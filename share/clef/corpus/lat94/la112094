 The season for elaborate laser collector's sets weighs in with one of the most 
dizzying yet: Walt Disney/Image's "Deluxe CAV LaserDisc Edition" of "Snow White 
and the Seven Dwarfs" ($100). 
</P>
<P>
 The 1937 animated feature was a daring venture for the young Walt Disney, and 
he risked his entire personal fortune to produce it. It not only marked the 
first animated feature ever made, but also ushered in a new era in 
merchandising. For the first time, film-related merchandise was available the 
day the film opened. 
</P>
<P>
 And had you bought it all then, and kept it in pristine condition, you could 
probably finance your own animation house today. 
</P>
<P>
 You can start a 1994 collection with the 10 limited-edition lithographs of the 
original theater posters from 1937 to the present that are part of the 
"never-before-released collector's items" that come with the package. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a dazzling release that features, above all, a beautiful transfer of 
the original film, with its stereo soundtrack on the digital tracks and the 
original monaural soundtrack on an analog track. Both sound and picture live up 
to all the hyperbole: They are crisp, clear and awash with lush, rich color. 
"Snow White" probably looks and sounds better than it did in its original 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
 An accompanying documentary, modestly called "The Making of a Masterpiece" 
(also available with the deluxe VHS tape release, as are the lithographs), 
offers a host of bonuses in this weighty laser set. A supplemental audio track 
includes "Lux Radio Theater" interviews of Disney by director Cecil B. De 
Mille, and a second audio track features early song demos and preliminary audio 
tracks animators used as a reference for a "Soup Sequence" ultimately dropped 
from the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Other deleted sequences and scenes include one that should have been restored 
to the film -- the making of Snow White's bed, reconstructed here from 
storyboards and pencil animation. There is also a huge sampling of color 
sketches, layout drawings, background paintings and preliminary designs and 
ideas both kept and tossed out. All of this provides remarkable insight into 
the painstaking detail that went into the making of this landmark feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully thought-out chapter stops throughout take you through the various 
storyboard sequences, layouts, backgrounds and effects tests, live action and 
voice tests and live-action reference film. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more fascinating bits of footage are scenes of a young Marge Belcher 
(later Marge Champion) dancing and acting out the role of Snow White so artists 
could accurately capture a human figure in motion. No wonder Snow White looked 
so graceful and light on her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When the film premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles on Dec. 
21, 1937, cameras were there to record it, and, naturally, that footage is here 
too, as is an obviously awe-struck Shirley Temple presenting Uncle Walt with 
his full-size and seven dwarf-size Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 The real-life story also has a happy ending. Six months after the film opened, 
all the debts Disney incurred to make "Snow White" were paid off, "and I had a 
couple of million in the bank," he recounts in rare footage. "With the profit 
from 'Snow White,' I built the studio." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the material available on the six laser sides there is an 
accompanying 88-page hard-cover illustrated book that mostly duplicates, in 
old-fashioned print form, much of the laser's supplemental material. Even so, 
there is something to be said for holding this information in your hand rather 
than staring at a freeze-frame on a TV screen. The book makes a handy reference 
(it's also included with the deluxe VHS gift set).

PLEASE DON'T FEED THE EXTREMISTS; IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ANIMAL RIGHTS 
ACTIVISTS AND SCIENTISTS, THE MIDDLE GROUND IS WHERE BOTH ANIMAL AND HUMAN 
LIVES MATTER; THE MONKEY WARS, BY DEBORAH BLUM (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $25; 
306 PP.)

<P>
 While surgeons in Pittsburgh were transplanting the liver of a baboon into a 
man's body, animal activists at the hospital entrance were chanting, "Animals 
are no spare parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Their protest was interrupted by Robert Winters, a patient on his way to a 
hepatitis treatment. Hepatitis attacks and destroys the liver. Starting up the 
steps, Winters shouted: "I didn't ask for this! But I've got it and I'm 
fighting it just like that guy (getting a transplant) up there! You don't have 
a right to be standing here!" The chanting stopped as Winters went on. "Do you 
know what it's like to have liver disease? Do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 The ethics of sacrificing a monkey for a human life are complex enough, but 
there was more. Regardless of how well that transplant might have worked out, 
the patient with the baboon liver was not expected to live long. He had AIDS. 
So it was not just a monkey's life for a person with a great future, but for an 
incurably ill person. Once the activists learned of this situation, they 
returned angrier than before. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes dilemmas like these particularly difficult is the value most people 
intuitively attach to the lives of monkeys and apes, our closest animal 
relatives. Confronted with creatures so strikingly like us, it is not hard to 
imagine that they have emotions similar to ours, that they are able to suffer 
and feel miserable as we do. There is increasing evidence that they are 
intellectually closer to us than any other animal. They think and plan and 
solve problems with a speed that often astonishes people working with them. Add 
to this the endangered status of many primates in the wild, and we have every 
reason to assign greater weight to their lives than to that of more common 
laboratory animals, such as rats or mice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the primates involved, their similarity to us also carries 
weight from a medical perspective: It makes them uniquely valuable for 
transplants and research. They are often the only animals susceptible to 
diseases that affect us. If it were not for the testing of the polio vaccine on 
hundreds of thousands of monkeys in the 1950s and 1960s, science might never 
have halted this crippling disease. The now widely used vaccine against 
hepatitis B was developed largely on chimpanzees. And most scientists believe 
that there will be no vaccine against AIDS without primate research. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, then, we are dealing with magnificent, intelligent animals 
that clearly deserve our respect and concern. On the other hand, they may hold 
the key to medical mysteries the resolution of which could save millions of 
human lives. With stakes so high, small wonder that the use of monkeys and apes 
in biomedical research has become one of the hottest controversies of today. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Monkey Wars," Deborah Blum provides a candid look at the issues from 
both sides. No comparable book on this topic exists, and after reading it it is 
not hard to understand why there is so much polarization. Blum reports the 
tactics of animal advocates, ranging from protest demonstrations and 
legislative initiatives to personal death threats, arson and laboratory 
break-ins. One group, the Animal Liberation Front, is violent enough to be on 
the FBI's terrorist list. On the other side, she describes in gruesome detail 
historical research by a few bad-apple scientists that have done great harm to 
their profession. However, she also visits the labs of first-rate investigators 
who explain how they go about minimizing pain and suffering and why their work 
should matter to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum, a science writer for the Sacramento Bee, received a Pulitzer Prize for 
an earlier series of newspaper articles on the same subject. Based on visits to 
the most important facilities and in-depth interviews with key participants, 
she is generally extremely well-informed. Both sides no doubt view her account 
as biased against them, which will only go to show how balanced it really is. 
</P>
<P>
 While enumerating various medical triumphs, Blum does not hide her shock at 
certain conditions and practices. She sympathizes with animal advocates who 
take issue with the way animals are being treated without giving them so much 
as a finger on the one thing many of them would like to see, that animal 
research be abolished altogether. Blum succeeds admirably at sharing their 
concerns without losing sight of what is at stake for society. After all, 
anyone entering a hospital or picking up a prescription at the pharmacy makes 
use of animal testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that the way we look at such research is not the same as it was 20, 
or even 10 years ago, Blum follows a middle course culminating in a plea for a 
more enlightened treatment of animals in our care and for open debate instead 
of the continued hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum's interviews demonstrate how intensely personal many of these issues have 
become. She describes Alex Pacheco of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals) as a passionate animal defender, yet also relates his unwillingness to 
allow veterinarians to euthanize a monkey, thus prolonging the animal's misery. 
Apparently, moral obligation took a back seat to political expediency. 
Pacheco's chief adversary, Peter Gerone, director of the Tulane Regional 
Primate Research Center, on the other hand, is depicted as an indefatigable 
champion of research, who says about the animals he works with: "I don't relate 
to monkeys and I don't want to. It would bias my ability to direct a center 
that does research on them." 
</P>
<P>
 The nasty battle between Pacheco and Gerone over the fate of the Silver Spring 
monkeys -- removed, in 1981, from a Maryland laboratory -- has set the tone of 
confrontations between animal advocates and researchers ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum provides us with thumb-nail sketches of these and other players. There is 
plenty of personal drama, including scientists who claim that their career went 
down the drain because of their sympathy for animals, and administrators who 
have managed to build up cozy relationships with animal advocates. One of the 
most interesting sections deals with Harry Harlow, whose early work on monkeys 
reared in isolation was critical for our understanding of the affection needs 
of primates. Harlow subsequently went overboard, however, designing one 
experiment after another to see how best to thwart these needs. William Mason, 
one of Harlow's ex-collaborators, distances himself in unmistakable terms from 
this later research. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlow's ghost may still be with us, but he is not here anymore to defend 
himself. In this day and age, it is unlikely that his experimental protocols 
would be approved. They would meet with resistance not only from the outside 
but also from inside the research community. An entire generation of scientists 
has grown up with increased awareness of the special responsibility that we as 
a species have toward other species. They are not convinced of having a 
God-given right to do whatever pleases them. As Blum explains, the research 
community is not a monolithic block; many different voices can be heard, 
including those that argue for radically different ways of conducting science. 
</P>
<P>
 Primate research facilities have adopted strict guidelines for research, and 
are moving from keeping their animals singly in stainless steel cages to 
housing them in groups in spacious enclosures or outdoor compounds. Some 
research centers now keep the majority of their animals in this fashion. I was 
naturally pleased to see my own institution, the Field Station of the Yerkes 
Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Ga., singled out as a model to be 
emulated. The philosophy behind this facility, as well as a few others that 
successfully combine social housing and biomedical research, is that in the end 
everyone gains from psychologically healthy animals. Primates evolved as social 
beings; there is no better and more natural way to enrich their lives than 
providing them with companionship. At the same time, making their existence 
more variable and satisfying may make them more suitable research subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum urges animal advocates to step back a little from the fences around 
research facilities so as to appreciate the genuine progress made by some. 
Looking beyond the positions of the most radical animal advocates and the most 
conservative defenders of scientific freedom, we can see an entire middle 
ground out there. It is not a place for simple slogans, nor for neat boxes 
marked "right" and "wrong," but one where the large majority of people will 
feel a lot more comfortable than on the barricades erected over the past 
decade. It is a place where both animal and human lives count, and where we can 
honestly and calmly ponder the so-called pain/gain equation, that is, how much 
pain we are prepared to inflict for scientific gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Monkey Wars" documents the shifting of this balance. It argues that the 
time has come to close our ears to the yelling proponents of the most extreme 
positions and tune in to voices of reason and moderation. As in the Middle 
East, not everyone may be happy with dialogue, but it has to be tried if we 
ever wish to get beyond the current standoff.

PACKAGING OF THE PRESIDENT; HOW MUCH DID CLINTON'S IMAGE ACCOUNT FOR THE RECENT 
BEATING HIS PARTY TOOK AT THE POLLS?; ON THE EDGE, THE CLINTON PRESIDENCY BY 
ELIZABETH DREW ; (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $24; 462 PP.)  
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The publicity materials that accompanied the reviewer's copy of "On the Edge" 
touted Elizabeth Drew's "unparalleled access" to the Clinton White House. To 
which I can only say: Poor woman. How much more of this grossly overexposed 
Administration, with its all-too-public trials and errors, can anyone bear 
without becoming one more percentage point in one more poll of disaffected 
citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 Is the President overexposed? 
</P>
<P>
 Or should he be out there, always on top of the story, dominating the news 
before it dominates him? 
</P>
<P>
 What should he say? 
</P>
<P>
 In what tone? 
</P>
<P>
 In which suit? 
</P>
<P>
 And how will it play? 
</P>
<P>
 The question of image interests Drew almost as much as it does the President's 
circle of advisers, as well as the rest of us ordinary citizens who couldn't 
help but wonder how much the President's image accounted for the beating his 
party took at the polls late week. "If Clinton lost," Drew remarks of a crucial 
congressional vote, "he would be seen as powerless, treated as powerless, and 
therefore powerless." And the same goes for his success with us, the people, 
whose moment-to-moment, minutely measured opinions and feelings seem to figure 
in every decision coming out of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 How we react to what we see affects what the President does, what Congress 
does, and what they do to each other and to us. This endless tracking of policy 
to ratings -- this perpetual campaign -- is nothing new; but never has it been 
so extreme and overt. So it's no wonder that Drew sees fit to comment on the 
President's appearance and performance in theatrical terms -- his 
"convincingness," his lip-biting, his bulk in a baggy suit. It matters. 
</P>
<P>
 That it shouldn't matter as much as it does is something Drew knows too, and 
she proves an able guide through the looking glass, showing us, on one side, 
how this presidency plays and, on the other, how it works. Or, all too often, 
doesn't work -- not, mind you, for lack of trying. These people are 
indefatigable, none more than the President himself, whose driving pace and 
seemingly inexhaustible energy can work to his disadvantage, contributing to 
the overcrowding, overreaching and overdoing that doom some of his best 
efforts. To get the business at hand into anything resembling chronological 
order seems to be beyond this President and his staff, but Drew somehow 
manages. Her book begins with the transition, then moves from one initiative to 
the next -- often one crisis to the next -- covering Clinton's first 18 months 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tricky business, not just because, as she amply demonstrates, the 
Clinton Presidency is still a most malleable thing and any summary may quickly 
become beside the point, but also because everyone who has something to say -- 
all those "experienced Washington observers" and "administration officials" and 
"important senators" and "persons who attended the meeting" -- probably has a 
reason for saying it. In an author's note, Drew says that she kept asking 
herself, "Why is this person telling me this?" and screened the information she 
received for motives. I'm guessing she was successful. Her book seems tough and 
fair and multifaceted enough that if somebody comes off well -- as, for 
instance, George Stephanopoulos and Al Gore do -- you'll probably understand 
why rather than suspect Drew of having been snowed. 
</P>
<P>
 As to that other risk -- of the passing of her subject matter's moment before 
her book even appears -- it's well managed here, too, in part because, 
regardless of what's happened since, this is just plain interesting stuff, from 
the least little remark -- (her description of Ruth Bader Ginsburg as 
"charismatically challenged," for example, to the big event (the budget battle, 
NAFTA, eruptions in Somalia, Bosnia and Russia). More than that, though, this 
book goes beyond Clinton and his immediate milieu to show us something about 
the character and shape of the modern presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to his eventual woe, Clinton initially surrounded himself with young, 
often inexperienced outsiders, but a few of the people close to him (and 
accessible to Drew) were seasoned enough Washingtonians to know that there was 
something different about this Administration, and that the differences didn't 
all originate with Clinton. The intense struggles within Congress and between 
Congress and the White House reveal one important change, a weakening of the 
President's power in relation to the legislature; the President has little to 
work with in the way of sanctions, inducements or party discipline, and without 
a huge and passionate following, he hasn't much leverage with representatives 
who have their own followings to satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change becomes apparent as we witness Clinton's style of governing. 
Lloyd Bentsen, an old hand, begins to put his finger on it when he comments, 
"This is the meetingest crowd I've ever seen." This President wants to hear 
from everyone. An adviser tells Drew, "You can go to him and say, 'So-and-so 
thinks this' and 'So-and-so thinks that' and go down the list, and he'll say, 
'Let's have them all in and talk about it.' " Robert Reich describes this 
tendency toward summits and policy by discussion in generational terms. He and 
his colleagues in the Administration are, for the most part, "products of the 
Sixties generation," and "the revolts of the Sixties were very much in reaction 
to the hierarchical society we inherited." So, exasperated though he is with 
the unwieldy process, he is, he says, "much more comfortable making decisions 
sitting around a table with assistants than sitting at a desk and checking a 
box." 
</P>
<P>
 That's nice, but when we get a look at how this approach was applied to health 
care reform -- with a task force of 500 health care experts broken into 34 
subgroups subjected to a torturous slate of meetings (one of which lasted 22 
hours) and finally coming up with a 1,342-page bill of such complexity that 
nobody even knew where to begin to talk about it -- we start to see the 
pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately it could be argued that Bill Clinton has extended this approach to 
the whole nation, that his plebiscitary governing, closely calibrated to the 
public mood, is his way of getting all of us, the people, into the dialogue. 
"But a poll-driven, consultant-ridden Presidency (carries) risks," as Drew 
points out. "Leadership could be preempted by the consensus of the moment. 
There might not be any leadership at all." If President Clinton is going to 
listen to everyone, he might as well listen to Elizabeth Drew; after all, 
there's still time for him to rise above us.

RICHARD EDER: DOING DOSTOEVSKY; A FATHER BECOMES THE ARTIST WHO 'MASTERS' FACTS 
BY REINVENTING THEM; THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG, BY J. M. COETZEE (VIKING: 
$21.95; 250 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A noted 19th-Century Russian writer, living abroad, returns to Petersburg when 
he receives word of the mysterious death of his stepson, Pavel. Grief-stricken, 
he goes through the young man's trunk, inhaling the odor from his clothes as if 
to take possession of his ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 He whispers "Pavel" repeatedly to himself. He thinks of an Orpheus who walks 
backward "step by step, whispering the dead woman's name, coaxing her out of 
the entrails of hell; of the wife in graveclothes with the blind, dead eyes, 
following him, holding out limp hands before her like a sleepwalker." 
</P>
<P>
 So, with misleading tenderness, begins J. M. Coetzee's harsh, cerebral, 
provocative novel about the savage mechanism of artistic creation. He conceives 
it as a Darwinian process, a life that crowds out life, a struggle in which a 
brilliantly specialized organism feeds on its host and destroys it. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeding on the memory of Pavel, the father metamorphoses into the writer. 
Leaching his love is an undercurrent of generational suspicion and resentment. 
Grieving and guilt-stricken, he is also a child-devouring Saturn. For a while 
it seems that he will turn Pavel -- who had quarreled, left home and joined a 
circle of nihilist conspirators in Petersburg -- into the character of 
Stavrogin. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, of course, is Dostoevsky, Coetzee's Master of Petersburg. 
(Stavrogin is the possessed or be-demoned protagonist of the novel that is 
variously translated as "The Possessed" and "The Demons.") Coetzee has 
audaciously taken facts from Dostoevsky's life and imagined the transformation 
by which a father, monstrously, becomes the artist who "masters" these facts by 
reinventing them. It is an operation of love, hatred and art, inextricably 
mingled. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is knotty and sometimes punishingly abstract -- it is an idea more 
than a novel -- but at its most powerful the idea burns and terrifies. There 
are moments when, as in some Pirandello-like variation on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 
Hyde, we see the features of a man liquefying into the lineaments of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Coetzee writes about the tormented Dostoevsky as someone himself possessed by 
demons, and pulled about in emotional and intellectual spasms (a mimicry of the 
epileptic seizures that the writer in fact endured). Dostoevsky's fiction, his 
life, and Coetzee's fiction about the life and the fiction: all three are 
intricately, elegantly and coldly intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 The protagonist shows traces of Raskolnikov in "Crime and Punishment," of Ivan 
Karamazov, and even of the epileptic Prince Myshkin in "The Idiot." He is 
saintly and corrupt. He lodges with Anna, Pavel's landlady; a type of a 
Dostoevskyan fallen and redeeming woman. They make passionate love alternating, 
on her part, with horror and on his, with a vision of salvation. There is 
Anna's innocent yet preternaturally knowing daughter, whom Coetzee's Dostoevsky 
has nightmares of corrupting. There is a Buddha-like and unstoppable police 
investigator, a second Inspector Porfiry. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Nechaev, the real-life nihilist conspirator -- possibly, in real 
life, a police agent as well -- on whom the character of Verhovensky in "The 
Possessed" is based. Coetzee's Nechaev, who draws Pavel into his clandestine 
net just as Verhovensky drew Stavrogin, is Dostoevsky's arch-antagonist. They 
hold a nightlong disputation that suggests the Grand Inquisitor scene in "The 
Brothers Karamazov." Here, though, each man slips back and forth between the 
roles of Inquisitor and Christ, with Dostoevsky getting the last turn at Christ 
and a chance to plant a damp kiss on Inquisitor Nechaev's pimply visage. He 
does not, however, reduce him to silence; quite the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Possessed," the Nechaev character is the demon of nihilistic violence 
that fatally corrupts the malleable Stavrogin. "Master" takes the villain of 
Dostoevsky the writer, and turns him into the scourge of Dostoevsky the 
character. A villain still, he gets to answer back. 
</P>
<P>
 Nechaev assails his interlocutor for turning his wretched and abused 
characters into saintly and spiritual beings. As such, they threaten no one; 
certainly not the ruling classes. In fact, he argues, the earth's wretched 
harbor a prodigious violence. The nihilists, with their program of 
assassination and bombings, will liberate this violence and ultimately 
establish a reign of peace and justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Dostoevsky had accused the Nechaevists of lacking the idealism of earlier 
conspirators -- he himself was one and went to Siberia for it -- and of 
standing for nothing but blood lust and resentment. In fact, toward the end of 
their disputation, Nechaev is babbling happily about God and his angels dancing 
together in melodious equality. 
</P>
<P>
 With each of its ironic notes reverberating, "Master" moves sinuously and to 
uncanny effect between the fiction of a character and the fiction of a fiction. 
Dostoevsky's grief is no less authentic for its parodic theatricality. Sitting 
at table with Anna and her daughter, his silent tears are punctuated by an 
occasional brief howl. He visits Pavel's grave with them, takes them on an 
excursion to the country, links Anna's arm in his own and dreams of starting a 
new family with her (though he has a wife in Dresden). It is a lovely moment 
and it does not undermine itself; what does undermine, deliberately, is the 
cutting away of such moments into scenes of a drastically different texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, he and the somber Anna are rolling on his bed and tearing lustfully 
at each other. The next moment she pulls away, accusing him of using her to 
seduce her daughter. The moment after she is back for more tearing. Bit by bit 
we sense that we are not in a story but in a succession of story drafts; as if 
Dostoevsky had imperceptibly changed from the tormented character to the writer 
who paces the room, acting his pages out and experimenting with changes. 
</P>
<P>
 We see him, for example, distilling his resentment of his stepson's 
subservience to Nechaev into the intention to write him as the corrupted 
Stavrogin. In fact -- though we have to read "The Possessed" to realize it -- 
he relents and turns Pavel into the more winning character of Shatov, who 
succumbs momentarily to Verhovensky/Nechaev but dies rebelling against him. 
</P>
<P>
 In design, "The Master of Petersburg" is a provocative and ironic exploration 
of the relation of art and life. In substance, and in many ingenious ways, it 
is an attempt to write a Dostoevskyan novel about Dostoevsky writing a novel. 
The design is a tour de force and dryly successful. The substance is engrossing 
but it falls short. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Coetzee is a master himself, he cannot produce the essential 
element in re-creating the master of Petersburg. Any of Dostoevsky's 
characters, after only a few pages, makes the heart freeze and the eyes weep. 
Coetzee achieves a measure of freezing; the eyes stay quite dry.

COVER STORY: WE LOVE A (MACY'S) PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE WILLENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Willard Scott says he only had one big dream as a budding broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was just starting out in the business, I used to love to watch Lorne 
Greene doing the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade," says Scott, the "Today" 
show's affable weatherman. "I said right then that's what I want to do someday, 
and it's been one dream that has come true." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott once again co-hosts the parade this Thanksgiving Day with Katie Couric. 
The NBC telecast, which airs from 1 to 4 p.m., is always one of NBC's 
highest-rated daytime events of the year, even though the competition tries its 
darndest to offer other treats to entice viewers their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in New York, Macy's has held its parade, replete with floats, stars, 
high-flying balloon characters and a live stage show featuring Broadway 
numbers, for 68 years, rain, shine or snow, bankruptcy or no. (You think we're 
kidding? Last year, when the department store chain was being sold to 
Federated, the judge stipulated that the parade must go on regardless of new 
management.) 
</P>
<P>
 The key for the networks is to capture the street flavor and high feelings 
generated by the parade Thanksgiving morning, from its inception point at 77th 
and Central Park West, to its final destination outside Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest challenge is to translate the incredible excitement that takes 
place to the television audience," says Brad Lachman, executive producer of the 
NBC telecast. And to hold to tradition while finding something new. "This year 
we're doing some different feature pieces that can run during the telecast," he 
explains. "We're doing one on the blowing up of the balloons the night before, 
which is an event in itself. We're also following one of the bands in the 
parade from their hometown in Arizona, where they raised all the money to get 
themselves here." 
</P>
<P>
 During the telecast, Lachman must decide when to simply stay with the parade, 
when to cut to the stage show at Macy's, when to catch Willard and Katie 
conversing with some viewers on the route. As Scott says, the key is to program 
down to the last second, yet leave room for spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rehearse and everything, but you can't really plan how you're going to 
react to certain things," says Scott, who feels the mood is so high one can 
even fight the elements. "I remember standing one year three hours in the 
freezing slush but, you know, I never sneezed once. I always wear my long johns 
just in case, but it's those cheerleaders, those kids in the little dresses, 
who are the real heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Weather is certainly the major contingency that Macy's and NBC have to worry 
about. "It's our overriding concern," says Jean McFaddin, Macy's vice 
president. "About seven years ago, we had overnight snow, which at first we 
thought was magical. But by the time the parade started, all the sandbags that 
hold the inflated balloons were wet and heavy, and we were all trying to chip 
ice off the floats. We also had lots of volunteers coming from New Jersey who 
couldn't get through on the roads and we had to use our local people to do 
twice as many things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another year it rained for three straight days and it was really our worst 
parade ever in terms of damage," adds McFaddin. "We were sure no one would come 
out. But when we started, we looked around and there were thousands of people 
huddled together in every doorway, looking out every window, even standing in 
plastic bags." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the weather, there are also those fickle huge balloons, (16 a year) 
featuring characters such as Betty Boop, Olive Oyl (she was the first woman), 
Snoopy, Clifford, and -- making their first appearances this year -- Barney and 
Cat in the Hat. Held and literally choreographed from below by about 40 people, 
their fortunes tend to blow, well, with the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd loves it when they think a balloon is coming down," notes McFaddin, 
referring to the oohs and ahs that accompany an uncooperative balloon. For 
McFaddin, who has to make split-second decisions regarding the parade itself, 
the situation can be more painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, she had to take Sonic the Hedgehog out of the parade 
midstream, because he got caught on a light and was too torn to go on. No such 
luck the year she saw a crippled Kermit the Frog literally swimming (lying 
horizontally as opposed to vertically) down Broadway and tried to take him out 
of his misery. "People got wind of it and 10,000 of them booed me," she says 
with a laugh. "So I left him in." 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the backstage secrets that television viewers are rarely made aware 
of. Last year, over at CBS, which counter-telecasts with some coverage of 
Macy's, other parades and ice skating -- a very cold co-host, Marilu Henner, 
was demanding more and more heat inside the CBS bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was freezing," recalls CBS' parade producer-director Michael Gargiulo. 
"Marilu kept asking for the space heater to come a little closer to her and all 
of a sudden, I saw a little smoke coming out behind her. Her coat had caught on 
fire. But she was a great sport and we got her a new coat." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's CBS event will be co-hosted by Tyne Daly and sportsman Jim Nantz. 
Gargiulo concedes that most viewers seem to want The Big One (Macy's), but he 
feels adding the Aloha Parade in Hawaii and a Lion King Parade from Disney 
World may be just the diet for the remote-hopping short-attention span. "I like 
to think we offer minestrone and they give you tomato soup," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at NBC, where producer Brad Lachman says, "I don't think we have any 
competition that day," viewers will see numbers performed from "Showboat," 
"Beauty and the Beast," and "Damn Yankees," not to mention stars such as Judy 
Collins, (singing "Wind Beneath My Wings") Kenny G (riding atop the Mother 
Goose float playing "Let It Snow") and Natalie Cole performing what McFaddin 
calls the parade's "holiday moment," "No More Blue Christmases." The new Miss 
America will ride atop a float performing with a hearing-impaired performance 
group, and Bob Hope will be part of a Salute to Veterans musical float. 
</P>
<P>
 While Macy's really is in charge of the parade -- 3,000 of its employees 
volunteer in some capacity -- the combination with television is what makes it 
all come together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," says McFaddin, "if we didn't have NBC's wonderful show, we 
wouldn't get all these great stars. "But then we have the parade which I like 
to call the longest-running show on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 "The All-American Thanksgiving Day Parade" airs Thursday at 8 a.m. on CBS. 
"Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade" follows at 1 p.m. on NBC.

THE PEACE THAT NEVER CAME; FRANCE'S ACROBATIC SELF-DELUSION KEPT ITS PEOPLE 
BELIEVING, UNTIL THE VERY LAST MOMENT THAT NOBODY, HITLER INCLUDED, WANTED WAR; 
THE HOLLOW YEARS: FRANCE IN THE 1930S, BY EUGEN WEBER (NORTON: $25; 352 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Denis Hollier, Denis Hollier, Professor of French at Yale University, is the 
editor of The College of Sociology: 1937-1939 (University of Minnesota Press) 
and of Against Architecture: The Writings of Georges Bataille (MIT Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eugen Weber's new book, "The Hollow Years," is a pitiless account of France in 
the 1930s, a decade that, if it is anything but glorious, has nevertheless 
something inescapably fascinating about it. It offers a painful case study of a 
society bringing itself almost willingly under a spell. But, however 
depressing, this story suggests that in France even the most Dostoevskyan 
tragedies can be made into farcical Offenbachian operettas. 
</P>
<P>
 The only redeeming episode in these "Hollow Years," for example, is the 
Popular Front government's implementation of paid vacations. (The government's 
only successful division, Weber claims, was "Le Ministere des Loisirs," an 
expression which, with a particularly American condescension -- Weber is 
Romanian -- he translates as the Ministry of Idleness.) 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1936. The French would have fared far better had they spent time 
thinking about Hitler and Nazi expansionism rather than about holidays. Roger 
Caillois, a young sociologist at the time, was struck by the lethal 
untimeliness of such a concern. In one of the lectures he gave at the College 
of Sociology, he wondered what could be happening to a civilization whose 
bottom line, even on the eve of war in 1939, was a refusal to mandate an 
expansion of working hours in plants that were involved in the national 
defense. (By the way, the word vacation comes, as one knows, from vacuum : it 
refers to a kind of hollow time, a time of committed demobilization.) 
</P>
<P>
 True, glory and great leaders are no longer the stuff of historians. Following 
the trend initiated in the '30s by the Annales school, to which Eugene Weber 
pays due homage, historical narration emphasizes contexts, replacing 
individuals with common men, events with daily life, proper names with 
statistics. However, the absence of great men in "The Hollow Years" is not 
merely the result of a methodological choice. Did France suffer from having no 
Hitler, no Lenin or Stalin, no F.D.R., not even a Mussolini or a Franco? She 
clearly, at times, felt that way. The title of Weber's book refers, among 
others, to a dramatic emptiness of the seats of power. 
</P>
<P>
 It also refers to other vacant zones. 140,000 soldiers had died, leaving an 
equal number of empty (or half-empty) beds. France had broken the world record 
in widows. Moreover, the war effort had been fed by foreign (mostly American) 
loans whose repayment would mortgage the coming decades, adding a financial 
vacuum to the demographic one. France thus became dependent on America for 
money, and on immigration for manpower. Having been fought, mostly, on French 
territory, war also caused immense civil destruction. France was exhausted by a 
victory that was beyond her means. Hence the impatience of the annees folles 
(crazy years): no sooner was the Versailles treaty drafted, than the French 
rushed to celebrate the end of war, not waiting to hear that an accounting 
error had been made. They never totally believed in their victory -- and they 
were right not to. The years that were to end with a phony war started with a 
phony peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deeper sense, hollowness refers to a lack of direction, a sense of 
purposelessness. Psychiatrists describe moments where one loses a sense of 
time. The past, it seems, is still to come, while the future has the 
discouraging flavor of deja vu. So, while the reader of "The Hollow Years" is 
offered a picturesque mix of anecdotes and statistics, one senses, crawling, 
looming behind, the menacing presence of war. It is everywhere, like the figure 
in the carpet. But is it behind or in front? More and more, that became the 
French people's question. They didn't know which way things were moving. Were 
they moving away from or ahead, toward war? Was war receding or approaching? No 
wonder so many artists of the time were inspired by the theme of the labyrinth, 
and the legendary figures associated with it, Theseus and the Minotaur. 
</P>
<P>
 This feeling of a lack of direction was reflected in the way they named their 
time. For what followed war was not peace but post-war, l'apres-guerre, which 
lasted 10 years. And, when the decade closed, 1930 was celebrated as the end of 
the postwar, "la fin de l'apre s-guerre." After war and postwar thus came 
post-postwar, which, typically, was a way of saying war without saying it. Some 
French people might still have thought that they had won the war, none would 
claim they had won the peace. In fact, by the mid-30s, almost everyone had 
discovered the period's real name, entre-deux-guerres. Like a river in the 
desert's sands, war had gone underground. The hollow years were just a creepy 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugen Weber draws a parallel between the events of 1939 and those of 1870, an 
analogy that allows him to use Emile Zola's novel about the Franco-Prussian 
war, "La Debacle," as a refrain in his story of the Third Republic's twilight. 
But the gay Paris of the Second Empire was not obsessed by the war that was to 
put an end to it. Offenbach did not write, as did a famous employee of the 
French Foreign Ministry, Jean Giraudoux, "The Trojan War Will Not Take Place." 
"The Hollow Years" is thus a study of "mentality" that brings to the fore the 
paradoxical coexistence in French minds of two statements that should have 
excluded each other: War is unavoidable (especially after Hitler's rise to 
power); there will always be a way to avoid it. Convinced as the French were 
(and justly so, but who cared?) that they deserved peace, they were committed 
to pretending that what they knew was not true. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Sartre was, at this point, constructing his concept of bad faith. 
How did they accommodate these two propositions? During the decade, France's 
mass psychology rested on an acrobatic system of self-delusion. The concluding 
chapter of "The Hollow Years" is entitled "The War Nobody Wanted." There is 
something miraculous in the way the French managed to keep believing until the 
very last moment that, indeed, nobody, Hitler included, wanted war. For the 
death instinct can manifest itself equally through war and through a refusal of 
war. In any case, and this is Weber's point, it is not enough not to want war 
for it not to occur. Even worse, pacifism is a clear invitation to war when 
your next-door neighbor is anything but pacifist himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the misperceptions generated by this desperate longing for peace, the 
most spectacular is probably the denial of Nazi aggressiveness. The success of 
Erich Maria Remarque's pacifist novel "All Quiet on the Western Front," one of 
the best sellers of the time, was a reassuring screen that allowed its readers 
to ignore a rather different sort of German voice: "Mein Kampf." With the 
Munich crisis, wishful thinking reached a hallucinatory level. The novelist 
Jean Giono, for example a militant pacifist, claimed that Hitler had renounced 
attacking Czechoslovakia not because of the military power of the democracies 
(a point nobody would hesitate to grant), but because of the street 
demonstrations staged at home by German peace-loving people singing "La 
Marseillaise." Alexandre Kojeve, soon to be a major player in shaping European 
policies, claimed that, thanks to the Munich deal, Europe had settled down, 
once and for all, for an eternal peace. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Robert Aron, the ideologue of L'ordre nouveau , the events reinforced 
his assuaging Hitler. They should bend over backward, Aron argued, to convince 
Hitler that he is wrong to be afraid of them, sending the clearest possible 
message that they in no way constitute a threat for him. Aron also opposed 
those who justified France's humiliation at Munich on the basis that it had 
prevented a war. No, he replied, it didn't prevent anything. Munich was a war, 
but wars today are won without being fought. War has entered the world of the 
immaterial, of the conceptual. Such delusions were feeding on the deep 
consensus that no war was worth fighting, and especially not the one that was 
waiting at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 A common explanation of the tragic hollowness of French politics during the 
decade is France's two conflicting policies vis-a-vis Germany and war 
reparations, that of Poincare, intransigently nationalist, punishing, and 
definitively past-oriented, and that of Briand, more European, constructive, 
and future-oriented. Eugen Weber's picture suggests that the real number was 
not two but zero. The French political project of the decade seems to have been 
a systematic and radical vacating of the seat of decision. The slightest mark 
of authority in a government, immediately denounced as fascism, resulted in an 
automatic fall. 
</P>
<P>
 This perverse and collective fascination with political impotence allows Weber 
to condemn. Between heroism and laziness, the difference is sometimes minimal. 
For history is not fate: Men and women are not objects, they are responsible 
subjects. "The Hollow Years" is an indictment of a society that let history be 
imposed on it as a fate.

RETRO; WHO'S ON THURSDAY NIGHT?; SEINFELD GETS BUMPED ON THANKSGIVING NIGHT BUT 
HE GETS TO WORK (SORT OF) WITH HIS IDOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The bad news is that "Seinfeld" won't be airing on Thanksgiving Day. But the 
good news is that Jerry Seinfeld is. NBC's king of Thursday-night comedy is the 
host of a new special, "Abbott & Costello Meet Jerry Seinfeld," part of the 
evening's reshuffled lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour tribute to the beloved comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello 
features clips of their memorable routines from film and TV, including the 
immortal "Who's on First?," never-before-seen home movies and poignant memories 
from their offspring: Bud Abbott Jr., Vicki Abbott Wheeler, Chris Costello and 
Paddy Costello Humphreys. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, they're thrilled that Seinfeld is paying tribute to their 
parents. "We are really happy with Seinfeld too," says Bud Abbott Jr. "I guess 
he was a fan when he was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so nice," adds Paddy Costello Humphreys. "I think what really made me 
feel good is that (in the special Seinfeld says) that 50 years later, you still 
have people laughing at the material as much as when it first came out. The 
material is really timeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott and Costello began working together in burlesque in the mid-'30s and 
soon took radio and Hollywood by storm. Under contract to Universal, they hit 
box-office gold in the '40s with such movies as "Buck Privates," "Keep 'em 
Flying, " "In the Navy," "The Time of Their Lives," "Ride 'em Cowboy" and 
"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein." During World War II, they raised more 
than $89 million for war bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also found success in TV. They frequently appeared on the live 
1951-54 NBC weekly series "The Colgate Comedy Hour," and starred in their own 
popular syndicated series, "The Abbott and Costello Show," which aired from 
1952 to 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, one year before they amicably ended their partnership, Abbott and 
Costello became the first non-baseball celebrities inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame, solely on the success of their "Who's on First?" routine. 
Costello died in 1959; Abbott in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphreys believes the duo clicked because they were pieces of a puzzle "that 
when put together, fit so perfectly. I don't think my dad could have worked and 
been successful with anybody else. I think the chemistry between them was 
absolute magic. I think that's why they are just as funny today as they were 
back then." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott Jr. points out that the pair's humor was pure burlesque. "There were 
whole scripts based on (burlesque) routines," he says. "Seinfeld said a lot of 
the comedy on his show is based on Abbott and Costello because they don't pick 
fun at anybody but themselves. They don't have a scapegoat. They always made 
themselves the humor. I think kids and adults can relate to that kind of 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Before teaming up with Costello in 1935, Abbott worked in burlesque for 20 
years as a show producer and straight man. "He actually was a good comedian 
too," says Abbott Jr. "There are two movies that Dad and Lou did, 'The Time of 
Their Lives' and 'Little Giant,' where they weren't in the movies as a pair. 
They had separate roles." 
</P>
<P>
 As a little girl, Humphreys loved watching her father in "Keep 'em Flying." 
"There's a scene when he was on a torpedo and it is running amok. That was 
hysterical to me. As a kid, you really get into the slapstick stuff. Later, you 
start appreciating some of the finer points of what they were doing, like 
timing." 
</P>
<P>
 The special also delves into their off-screen lives. Though Abbott was a 
fast-talking sharpie on screen, in real life "he was a really quiet gentle 
person," says Abbott Jr. "That's why I have so much respect for what he did. I 
knew at a young age he was a very famous star, but I knew he was so good at 
what he did because when he was off camera, he was a different person. He was 
the best there was. I was always very proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello, Humphreys says, was really a big kid at heart. Especially at 
Christmas. "Christmas for him was the big time of the year," she says. "You 
should have seen the house. What he had on the outside of the house was 
absolutely incredible: life-size Santa Claus, sleigh and reindeer on the roof. 
Everything was lit up. It got to the point that our neighbors across the street 
put up a sign on the front lawn that simply said, 'See our display across the 
street.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And both men cared for their fans. Humphreys recalls her father receiving a 
letter soon after "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" was released. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was from the parents of a little boy who was so frightened by the movie. 
He was so frightened by the thought of my father being injured or killed by 
Frankenstein. My dad called him and talked to him and assured him that he was 
fine and that it was just a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were both very generous," Abbott Jr. says. "The things I saw in my life 
you just don't see today. They'd buy people homes, take care of operations. 
Half the people they didn't know that well. When you take from the public like 
that you have to give something back, too. That's very important." 
</P>
<P>
 "Abbott & Costello Meet Jerry Seinfeld" airs Thursday at 10 p.m. on NBC.

FOCUS; REVERSAL OF HISTORY; HBO'S 'FATHERLAND' PICTURES A WORLD IN WHICH HITLER 
WON AND KEPT THE HOLOCAUST A SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 HBO's new original movie, "Fatherland," poses some rather big "what ifs." 
</P>
<P>
 "What if" the Germans had beat the Allied forces on D-day, June 6, 1944? "What 
if" the Allies lost the momentum that day and Germany won the war and control 
of Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in a project like this, there's one thing that you can get you really 
interested in at the expense of something else," says Ron Hutchinson, who 
co-wrote the screenplay with Stanley Weiser. "Clearly, that 'what if' thing is 
so strong. One knows that really it was a close-run thing, D-day, and 
Eisenhower had in his pocket a three-line resignation speech. He was ready to 
pull back. God knows what would have happened. Because we have written the 
history as we won, it's never quite as obvious to us that it could have 
switched the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Fatherland," based on Robert Harris' novel, the Germans did win the war. 
In fact, all of Europe is now called Germania. Set in 1964, the film noir 
thriller finds Joseph Kennedy -- the father of John, Robert and Ted Kennedy -- 
the new President of the United States. Adolf Hitler is alive and well and 
about to celebrate his 75th birthday. And the Fuehrer is making overtures to 
Kennedy to end the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 20 years, though, the Third Reich has managed to keep the 
Holocaust a secret. But the secret could be revealed when a noble SS detective, 
Xavier March (Rutger Hauer), and a visiting American journalist, Charlie 
Maguire (Miranda Richardson), acquire information that could topple Hitler and 
his totalitarian regime. But the Gestapo is hot on their trail and the two have 
just one hour to expose the truth to President Kennedy before the leaders renew 
the relationship between the countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is kind of a flip side of a Holocaust movie," says producer Ilene Kahn. 
"But it's in your face about the same issues. In the end, the movie speaks to 
the neo-Nazis and the people who would lead you to believe that the Holocaust 
didn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fatherland" was shot in Prague earlier this year, after the release and 
subsequent success of Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 The production elicited interesting reactions from people while shooting in 
Prague. Kahn recalls how tourists staying at the downtown hotel in which the 
cast and crew were at freaking out at the sight of a big swastika and 
propaganda banners adorning the buildings across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "But somehow the Czech residents weren't shocked by it," she says. "I would 
say for me, waking up and looking out my window, it was a pretty chilling sight 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's surreal production design contributes much to the film. "What 
Prague offered, because it wasn't destroyed in World War II, was the old 
buildings, plus all the buildings built post-war," Kahn says. "Because our film 
takes place in 1964, we wanted the contrast of the '60s buildings against the 
old buildings that looked like (Nazi architect) Albert Speer's buildings. We 
used a special-effects' house that really used Albert Speer's drawings to 
create these very outsized domes, which was really what Hitler wanted. He 
wanted the architecture to dominate the people. There were plans to build them 
when the war ended." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a political thriller, "Fatherland" also explores the tragic 
relationship between March and his young son, who has been taught to believe 
everything the government says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the heart of the movie is about this man and his relationship with 
his son," Hutchinson says. "I guess decency can only be passed down one person 
at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes this movie really resonate for me," says Kahn, "and takes it even 
further out of the realm of Nazis, is that (it says) you can fill a child with 
anything. That should be a warning. You can fill children with whatever you 
choose. This is our line to immortality, so you better be careful what you put 
in their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Hauer's March, though, may be one of the few sympathetic Nazis ever depicted 
on screen. "I guess it seems to be that we have sort of fallen into a funny 
gap," Hauer explains. "When it comes to portraying characters -- once they work 
for the bad guys they can't be normal people. I think it's really interesting 
to take on the whole thing because it's all fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 His big challenge, Hauer says, was "if we could make them into real people 
that you can go along with and make a situation, so you can sort of believe 
what's going on. This world is less obvious than in the real Nazi world." 
</P>
<P>
 Before working on the script, Hutchinson read several German autobiographies 
written in the '30s and '40s. "It's quite clear that it wasn't, like, overnight 
you woke up and the devil was in charge. It was that you made these tiny little 
adjustments. I think that roads to the camps started with things like Jews 
being denied permission to use public phones. All of those things are baby 
steps on the way to the horror. It's just so hard to know which tiny step is 
the one you make the big battle on." 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult aspect of adapting the novel, Hutchinson says, was that 
"you can do so much in a novel that you can't do in a screenplay. The biggest 
problem is to keep the audience with us so that they are not yelling from the 
second minute, 'Wait a minute. It's all about the Holocaust. We know what the 
big secret is.' I think you can't watch a movie watching characters struggle to 
find the secret, if you know the secret, because they look dumb. I think the 
biggest technical writing problem was to assure the audience that we knew that 
they knew what it was all about." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fatherland" airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

 The 1991 The Last Boy Scout (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), which indulges in macho 
daydreaming with a vengeance, is one of those movies that wants to keep you 
bouncing off your seat. It's a crash-a-thon about two misfit heroes who meet, 
woo each other with wisecracks, kill a lot of guys and then go into business 
together. (The misfits are Bruce Willis' weathered private eye and Damon 
Wayans' pro quarterback banned for gambling and drugs and whose girlfriend has 
just been killed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gone With the Wind (KTLA Monday at 7 p.m., concluding Tuesday at 8 p.m.), the 
most beloved of all American movies, is back again. The Civil War epic offers a 
perfect cast headed by Vivien Leigh as that great survivor, Scarlett O'Hara, 
and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, the most honorable of rakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Poppins (KTLA Wednesday a 7 p.m.) is Walt Disney's charming 1964 musical 
fantasy about a nanny possessed with supernatural powers who descends on a 
family in Edwardian England. Julie Andrews won an Oscar in her film debut in 
the title role. Dick Van Dyke co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 blockbuster Home Alone (NBC Thursday at 8 p.m.) makes one wonder how 
closely a movie can resemble a cartoon and still be called a movie. Macauley 
Culkin became famous overnight as the 7-year-old upstart accidentally left 
behind by his vacationing family to fend for himself against a bumbling pair of 
burglars (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern). 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven (KTTV Friday at 8 p.m.) is a medium-level 1992 comedy about a 
lovable St. Bernard, a dog-loving family and a dog-phobic dad (Charles Grodin). 
It's a consciously naive movie -- big, bright, cartoonish -- but there's some 
feeling to it involving how pets humanize uptight suburbanites. 
</P>
<P>
 On Golden Pond (KABC Saturday at 9 p.m.) expresses eloquently a dream that 
many of us share: to grow old, but never less passionate, alongside the person 
one has loved most dearly. The dream couple, Norman and Ethel Thayer as played 
unforgettably by Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, have no defense against the 
frights and confusions of age or the nearness of death. Another key element in 
the drama is an unresolved relationship between Norman and his daughter, played 
by Fonda's real-life daughter Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 With Metropolitan (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.) debuting writer-director Whit 
Stillman scored a success with this incisive 1990 romantic comedy of manners 
among the young, very rich and social in Manhattan. Stillman's alter ego 
(Edward Clements) is an outsider of sorts by way of diminished financial 
status, and he's as repelled as he is attracted by his friends.

A QUESTION OF CATHOLIC BASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re. the article, "Survival of the Spirit," on TNT's movie about the 1973 
Wounded Knee clash: The comments on the "forced assimilation" of Native 
Americans by Catholic missionaries is most troubling. It is pure propaganda to 
portray Catholic missionaries as one-dimensional beings out to oppress Native 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there were some abuses by some missionaries of some Indians. But it 
is also true that some Indians were hardly gentle and kind in their treatment 
of Europeans. Moreover, much of what the missionaries did was truly beneficial 
to those whom they touched. To offer only one side of this reveals a truly 
politically correct agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar campaigns of misinformation would not be tolerated against other 
groups, such as blacks and Jews. Why Catholic bashing is considered acceptable 
is a question I would very much like answered.

 Funny Face (AMC Sunday at noon and 10:30 p.m.) is Stanley Donen's timelessly 
elegant and charming 1957 musical with a Gershwin score. A fashion photographer 
(Fred Astaire) helps turn Greenwich Village waif Audrey Hepburn into a Parisian 
supermodel. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Hard Times (TNT Sunday at 7 p.m.) is a memorably moody 1967 
Western, adapted from an E.L. Doctorow novel; Henry Fonda stands up to outlaw 
Aldo Ray, who's been menacing a seedy frontier town.

 SPLIT SKIRT by Agnes Rossi (Random House: $20; 256 pp.) Two women in the 
slammer. How did they get there? Why did they get there? Agnes Rossi explains, 
in a psychological study of lives gone awry.Plunked by chance into the same 
cell of the Bergen County (N.J.) Jail are Rita, three days for DUI and 
possession of a smidgen of cocaine, and Mrs. Tyler, also three days, for 
shoplifting. (It's always Mrs. Tyler , no first name, to set her off as 
something of a lady. Rita is no lady.) Their travails, examined lovingly and at 
length, stem (surprise!) from their husbands. Both women are battered, neither 
physically. Rita's aloof Alex treats her with indifference bordering on scorn 
since their wedding day (at which, doubting her own motives, Rita materializes 
with the grandmother of hangovers). Alex expects her to cope with his two 
children while he dallies with their mother, his ex, a law student. Mrs. 
Tyler's case is more complex. A resilient Texas survivor of poverty, she 
marries into wealth -- and intimidation, at the hands of the mother and hollow 
business associates of husband John. The reasons behind her shoplifting are 
contorted; the act extrudes an almost physical rush of guilt and glee; the 
effect on her husband, and especially her four children, is devastating. 
Predictably, Rita and Mrs. Tyler become friends, each wiser and stronger for 
her quarantine. A semi-stimulating study, perhaps not worth $20.

 THE STORY OF ZAHRA by Hana el-Shaykh. (Anchor: $18; 215 pp.) Zahra is an 
avatar of modern Lebanon. Both Zahra and her country, while afflicted by 
ambient and random violence, simultaneously embrace it, fearful but 
fascinated.Zahra's malaise, as Lebanon's, verges on madness. For both, hopes 
are raised, then dashed. What light there is at the end of the tunnel is dim, 
tenebrous. In a relentlessly grim novel, Hana el-Shaykh has chosen Zahra -- 
unattractive, disturbed, dependent -- as the eye of the hurricane, her calm 
arising not from serenity but from withdrawal. Her Beirut family is relatively 
privileged. Her mother is promiscuous, her father feckless. With only one man 
does she feel anything, a vague sexual pleasure. The man is a sniper. We do not 
understand Zahra. We do not understand Lebanon.

 KILLING CUSTER by James Welch with Paul Stekler (W.W. Norton: $25; 274 pp.) 
What does it say about American lore when virtually everyone agrees that there 
were "no survivors" of the Battle of the Little Bighorn? (There were hundreds 
of survivors; they were called Sioux and Cheyenne.) Why do hundreds of books, 
scores of movies and a national monument celebrate -- let's face it -- a loser? 
Why were (are?) the victors scorned as "bloodthirsty savages" while no less 
than Walt Whitman, in a "glad, triumphal sonnet," lauds the vanquished: "The 
loftiest of life upheld by death"? Why is Custer's Last Stand remembered 120 
years later, while the Massacre on the Marias River, an entire encampment wiped 
out to the last child ("They are nits, and will become lice"), is remembered by 
nobody -- except the Blackfeet? "If you switch the focus," writes James Welch, 
"the story becomes infinitely richer." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch switches the focus all right. With a vengeance. Half Indian, acclaimed 
novelist ("Fools Crow," etc.), Welch takes sides -- and why not? Plain and 
simple, the 1876 battle was part of the U.S. plot to eradicate the Indians 
("God's righteous decree," said Horace Greeley). It was a depression year, and 
robber baron Jay Cooke needed settlers to make his railroad profitable. More 
succinctly, in the words of Chief Black Elk, "They came to kill our mothers and 
fathers and us, and it was our country." Welch's account of the battle -- and 
what receded it, and what followed -- is rousing and rending unaccountably 
marred by long passages on the difficulties he and co-author Paul Stekler had 
in making a Little Bighorn documentary. Just skip those parts. His rendering of 
his people -- neither noble nor feral, just human beings -- is provocative but 
balanced. The aftermath is shameful. Black Elk: "There is no center any longer; 
the sacred tree is dead."

 OFF THE ROAD: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim's Route Into Spain by Jack 
Hitt (Simon & Schuster; $22; 255 pp.) Pilgrim . There's a hum to it, a mantra, 
a must. "The more I tried on this awkward word, the more I liked its ill fit," 
writes Jack Hitt. Whatever possessed Hitt -- Viking-sized, 35, American 
Episcopalian -- to toss up a comfortable life and trek across northern Spain, 
Basque country, to westernmost Santiago de Compostela, the reader is the 
richer. Whether or not the apostle James is buried there (the ancient story 
owes its origins to a typo), Dante himself proclaimed the journey the One True 
Pilgrimage: There is no earthly reason to go to Santiago, but to go. Hitt went, 
and recounts his hajj in luminous prose. At times Chaucerian in tone and scope, 
at times reflective, even magical, Hitt's chronicle resounds with wit, wonder 
and curiosity satisfied. Side trips of speculation lead to a consideration of 
stylites and dendrites and Benedictines, Crusaders ("vulgar mercenaries") and 
Knights Templar ("a splendid drama of political jostling, gems, gold, forts, 
popes, kings and divine mysteries"), of the Song of Roland, the ecclesiastical 
origin of Friday the 13th, religious relics (a dispute over two heads of John 
the Baptist was resolved when it was declared that one was the head of John as 
a youth, the other as an adult). Closer to earth are Canterbury tales of wacky 
fellow travelers, of "rugged, ugly plains" and the "primal soup" of lanes well 
traveled by cows, of minor miracles and a village, where pilgrims used to wash 
in the river, called Lavacola (wash tail). And finally, the revelation that 
"the road takes up residence within us and becomes a way to something else."

 THE GAZETTE GIRLS OF GRUNDY COUNTY by Gwen Hamilton Throgmartin and Ardis 
Hamilton Anderson (University of Missouri: $19.95; 176 pp.) At the time, it was 
tough, though in retrospect it was a Bushian era, kinder and gentler. People 
helped each other out. Bills were paid in kind, a chicken here, a rick of 
firewood there. It was the Depression, and the menfolk of Spickard, Mo., could 
be forgiven a raised eyebrow when a couple of women -- girls, really -- bought 
the Grundy County Gazette and proposed to make a go of it. Spunky was the 
working word for Ardis Hamilton, 23, and her sister Gwen, not yet old enough to 
vote. For $500 down, earned teaching school, they acquired the rundown country 
weekly in 1935, tripled its circulation (to 1,200 at $1 a year subscription) 
and sold the paper in 1940, when Gwen's marriage to a printer divided her 
loyalties. In alternating chapters, perfectionist, no-nonsense Ardis and her 
more gregarious, enthusiastic sister (one spelled, the other didn't) recall the 
days when type was hot and women were double-breasted. It is a thoroughly 
charming little memoir, treating not only of small-town newspapers but of the 
small-town America they reflected. Plus, of course, a pre-Lib primer on what a 
woman could do when she set her mind to it, even in the '30s, without losing 
her rightly cherished femininity; a little leg brought in a lot of ads. Lack of 
money heightened rather than diminished small triumphs -- the season's biggest 
tomato, a son's making the honor roll -- and tragedies; item: "Dewey McDaniel 
was bitten in the shoulder last week by a cow..." Amusements were cheap if not 
free: gathering hickory nuts in the woods with a favorite beau; harmonizing in 
the evening on the steps of a store; two straws in a five-cent root beer.A 
softer time, remembered with great affection.

 BRUNO OF HOLLYWOOD by Paul Mantee (Ballantine: $18; 234 pp.) Give him time; 
he'll settle into it. For now, Paul Mantee -- veteran actor of heavies; novice 
novelist of lights -- writes with a natural exuberance, an unmistakable flair 
for the comic characterization, the bon mot.Just needs to rein it in a little, 
is all. Following "In Search of the Perfect Ravioli," a memoir with tomato 
sauce, Mantee unleashes "Bruno of Hollywood," the tale of a postwar actor in 
search of a gig. There's a succession of odd jobs (the L.A. economy would 
collapse without its "actors," Mantee notes), acting classes ("Don't make a 
sound, allow a sound!") and an old girlfriend from high school days in Northern 
California whose body was "a galaxy of yeses and noes" but whose shoulders now 
are "concave from years of what's the use." Agents equivocate: "You got a 
quality, no doubt about it -- Honey, find my lighter! -- Trouble is, I already 
got three of you"). Bit roles are cherished: Lobster Man; the son of the chief; 
thug No. 2. He's game, Bruno, and simpatico, and an acute observer of 
third-tier Hollywood ("Corner of Fairfax, which is not where Sunset begins but 
where it rises to the occasion"). As for Mantee, stand by for his third novel, 
tentatively titled "The Plant Who Knew Too Much."

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; FAMILY'S 'WENCESLAS' IS HERE VIA 
CHRISTMAS CAROL AND A DALMATIAN'S WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The newest Family Channel movie, Good King Wenceslas, was inspired by a 
Dalmatian paw print. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Michael Deakins was walking his dog, Bonzo, in the snow when the 
traditional Christmas carol came to him. "There's that line in the song, 'In 
his master's step he trod,' and I realized, my God, that song would be a great 
film and it's never's been done," he says from his London home. 
</P>
<P>
 Deakins packed up an English and American crew -- with actors Jonathan 
Brandis, Stefanie Powers, Perry King and Joan Fontaine -- and traveled to 
Prague for six weeks to shoot the movie based on the Czech folk tale. 
</P>
<P>
 The fable, originally set in the Dark Ages, was pushed to the mid-14th Century 
to give it more of a "fairy-tale feel," says Brandis, 18. While the story of a 
teen-age king about to be usurped by his wicked stepmother sounds much like 
fiction, it's based on fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important story," Brandis says. "The prince has definite goals, and 
there's a major element of his life missing. He's somewhat of a victim and 
getting absolutely no support from anyone around him. It's about his triumph 
over this constant struggle he has. He stays positive throughout." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good King Wenceslas" airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on The Family Channel. For ages 
6 and up.  
</P>
<P>
 *** 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to wage that ever-present battle of evil vs. good are Mighty Max 
and Skullmaster (voice of Tim Curry). And just in time for Thanksgiving, a new 
villain, Nactrone, is introduced on the animated show. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being designed and drawn by a professional animator, Nactrone was 
created by 9-year-old United Kingdom resident Adam Shaw, who won a contest 
sponsored by show producers Film Roman ("The Simpsons" and "Garfield") and 
Lumiere in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam isn't quite sure where his inspiration came from: "Well, my sis told me 
that the show was on the telly and then when the contest came around, I just 
came up with the name and the character," he says from his home in 
Middlesbrough, England. Adam decided he knew "the way he looks, the way he 
spoke and that he's got big hands. It just came up in my mind and I drew it. I 
watch it every time it's on here and I watch videos too. I've got three." 
</P>
<P>
 When the modest Adam didn't want to brag to his friends that he'd won, his 
"mum rang them all up and told them!" This summer, Adam and his family won a 
trip to the Film Roman studio in North Hollywood and were given an animation 
cel of the character he designed. Right now, he's at work on a "Mighty Max" 
comic book featuring Nactrone. He's also determined to be a cartoonist when he 
grows up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nactrone appears in Thursday's and Friday's "Mighty Max" at 7:30 a.m. on KCAL. 
For ages 4 to 10. OTHER EARLY HOLIDAY SHOWS 
</P>
<P>
 The Muppet Christmas Carol comes to the Disney Channel even before we've had 
time to carve the Thanksgiving turkey. You can catch it Sunday at 7 p.m. 
Michael Caine plays mean old Ebenezer Scrooge and Kermit the Frog (who else?) 
essays Bob Cratchit. For ages 2 and up.  
</P>
<P>
 Can Santa find a snowbound family, trapped in a cabin deep in the woods? Sure 
he can, especially if he gets help from Holly and Christopher, the children's 
faithful Teddy bears, who are determined not to let their family down in The 
Bears Who Saved Christmas (Friday 7 p.m. KCOP). The special features the voices 
of Jonathan Winters, Henry Gibson and Pam Dawber. For ages 2 to 8.

COMMENTARY; 'TINKER IN TELEVISION': MANDATORY READING FOR THOSE MAKING A LIVING 
TINKERING WTIH TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRAZIER MOORE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As with the rest of the world, the Romper Room known as network television is 
managed by Do Bees and, more often, Don't Bees. Grant Tinker is a notable 
example of the former. 
</P>
<P>
 So here's the buzz on NBC of the early 1980s, when, as its chairman, Tinker 
led the network back from the brink and made it No. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 -- DO BE willing to leave talented people alone to do what you hired them to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DO BE patient with your programs, nurture them, and leave them on long 
enough to let the audience come to share your enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DO BE concerned about your viewers, as well as your numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a decade after he left NBC, Tinker can't help getting exercised about 
the grudge match briefly waged between CBS and his former network as they fired 
their medical shows against each other on Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have done that," he says. "At least, I hope I wouldn't. It's 
forgetting your first responsibility -- to the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with a reporter in a midtown Manhattan hotel suite that happens to 
look out on Tinker's former workplace, the RCA Building -- whoops, make that GE 
Building -- he is talking about his new book, "Tinker in Television: From 
General Sarnoff to General Electric" (Simon & Schuster), which he co-wrote with 
former NBC associate Bud Rukeyser. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is a revealing memoir of a man who first came to NBC in 1949, when 
its founder, the legendary General David Sarnoff, "was still in the building -- 
he was up there on the 53rd floor and I was delivering mail on the sixth." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tinker In Television" is also a valuable crash course in the history of the 
TV business, which Tinker was there to witness and help elevate. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides three hitches with NBC, he worked the other side of the street by 
founding MTM Enterprises, the creative salon that produced some of TV's most 
beloved programs, including "Lou Grant," "The Bob Newhart Show" and, of course, 
the series that starred his business partner and then-wife, Mary Tyler Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had the good luck to be around people who did the kind of work that 
the audience appreciates," says Tinker, who, at 68, is as well-known for his 
self-deprecating manner as for his lean good looks and California tan. "The 
success just rubbed off on me." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, he brought this low-key approach back to NBC, which, in terms of 
earnings, ratings, programs and morale, barely had a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, when Tinker left to return to independent production, NBC 
was flush -- and, with its parent RCA, about to be bought by G.E. Referring to 
GE boss Jack Welch, Tinker writes, "I left him an NBC that was the 1927 New 
York Yankees, and some good advice about how to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 But under the management of Welch and the man he put in Tinker's old office, 
Robert Wright, NBC was soon the cellar dweller again and the operative question 
echoed that of Casey Stengel: "Can't anyone here play this game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, it's hard to say. 
</P>
<P>
 More than inside baseball, the issues Tinker raises in his book make for 
interesting reading. They also are a balm for viewers fed up with such network 
antics as schedules that have the stability of a stock-market ticker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our practice was to make a judgment about a show," Tinker recalls, "and, if 
we deemed it worthwhile, to really stay with it until it succeeded." Two 
shining, oft-cited examples of Tinker's steadfastness: "Hill Street Blues," a 
slow starter in 1981, and, one year later, "Cheers," a consistent ratings flop 
-- that is, the first of its 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither series will soon be forgotten, nor will the Thursday-night time slot 
each so dependably occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Could most viewers, or even Bob Wright, recall what show occupied 
most network time slots as recently as last week? Or want to?

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even in our acronym-happy age, I'm not sure that anyone but Ross Thomas would 
have come up with VOMIT (Victims of Military Intelligence Treachery) but so he 
has, in AH, TREACHERY! (Mysterious Press, $21.95, 274 pp.). It is another in 
his unique succession of sleek, amusing, imaginative tales of duplicity, 
corruption, betrayal and other entertainments. 
</P>
<P>
 His plots do not respond to easy synopsizing, but it hardly matters. His 
protagonist this time, Partain, is having a thin life clerking in a gun shop in 
deepest Wyoming when a visitor drops by with word that an old and unresolved 
intelligence scandal in Latin-America is resurfacing. It turns out that 
Partain, then an Army major, had been a fall guy in the affair, the bribing of 
counterrevolutionary group in which the bribe disappeared. He is presumably 
still at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 There are subsidiary matters: a political fund-raising woman whose 
unaccountable $1.6 million slush fund has also unaccountably disappeared, and 
there are murders and discoveries, all largely revealed in Thomas' patented 
dialogue, which is urbane, economical and forever a joy to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Evanovich is not new to fiction -- she has published romances -- but she 
is new to crime fiction and her first offering is a lulu. In ONE FOR THE MONEY 
(Scribner's: $20; 290 pp.), Stephanie Plum, just scraping by in Trenton, N.J., 
blackmails her way into a desperation job as a bounty hunter, chasing down 
bail-bond skippers for her cousin Vinnie the bondsman. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first absentee client is a vice cop charged with murder. By a nice 
fictional coincidence he's the smoothie who deflowered her in high school and 
told all. He's still an attractive devil, and thoughts of revenge sweeten the 
attraction of the bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 Evanovich, who lived in New Jersey before writing her way to Virginia, is 
funny and ceaselessly inventive, and describes Trenton to a gritty 
fare-thee-well. Stephanie keeps finding and losing Joe the cop, steals his car 
when her own heap conks out, runs afoul of a truly sadistic heavyweight 
contender (not so funny and indeed very scary), and all the while the evidence 
grows that Joe was set up and is in hiding to try to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie is imperiled almost daily and the finale, when All Comes Clear, 
manages to be both comic and suspenseful. The telling is first-person, with all 
the artifices the method requires, but Stephanie's voice, breezy and 
undauntable, is all her own despite the ever more crowded field of female PI's. 
Her own moral seems to be that when the going gets tough, the tough get funny. 
It seems no surprise that Hollywood has optioned the book for more bucks than a 
bounty hunter makes in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Dunant is host of a nightly cultural affairs show on BBC2 television in 
London. In her spare time she writes very good mystery/thrillers, of which 
FATLANDS: A Hannah Wolfe Mystery (Otto Penzler Books: $21; 215 pp.) is the 
third, after "Birth Marks" and "Snowstorm in a Hot Climate." 
</P>
<P>
 Her heroine is Hannah Wolfe, a private eye who works for a nice ex-cop named 
Frank and who upholds the genre tradition by having a rather tenuous love life. 
In the Sara Paretsky tradition, Dunant's novel is about something: animal 
rights. But while the author's sympathies are clear, the book is neither tract 
nor a preachment. The viewpoints flow from the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe is hired to pick up a teen-age girl from her boarding school and escort 
her to London for a day's shopping before Daddy, a pharmaceutical executive, 
gathers her up for the theater. The teen-ager is bright and complicated, her 
brattiness a cover for a hidden agenda. She eludes Wolfe's overview, turns the 
ignition in Daddy's car and is blown to bits. It's a shocker, because on brief 
acquaintance the girl had the sympathy of the detective and the reader. 
</P>
<P>
 What the girl was up to, what Daddy was up to, what his firm is up to, all 
make for fascinating revelations. Hannah is brass-knuckled at one moment and 
just does avoid taking permanent leave during the last seconds of hog-wild 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunant is a fine new name to know if, like me, you hadn't made her 
acquaintance before. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thriller that is indubitably about something is HALF NELSON (Pocket 
Books: $20; 279 pp.), the fifth in Jerome Doolittle's Tom Bethany series about 
a volunteer wrestling coach at Harvard (thus the titles, others including "Head 
Lock" and "Body Scissors") who also investigates. 
</P>
<P>
 Doolittle's targets (forget the balanced view) are the lumber giants who 
clear-cut the forests with a posterity-be-damned attitude. At the urging of his 
lady-love at the ACLU in Washington, Bethany tries to protect the soft-spoken 
but militant leader of an ecological group called Earth Everlasting. Bethany 
fails but engineers a score-settling that is majestically and perhaps wickedly 
ingenious. It may not save the forests but it reduces the villain population 
and is totally satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 Doolittle, who has been a Carter speech writer and once ran a cafe in 
Vientiane, ranks with Robert Parker, Elmore Leonard, Ed McBain and Ross Thomas 
as a high voltage story-teller, and that is exalted company. 
</P>
<P>
 NO WITNESSES (Hyperion: $22.95; 365 pp.) is Ridley Pearson's eighth novel, and 
as before he writes a serious, well-researched, complex thriller, set again in 
Seattle, where Pearson lives. This one involves the poisoning of food cans on 
grocery shelves, where they kill the unsuspecting innocent who have randomly 
chosen their own deaths. It's an elaborate extortion scheme aimed at the food 
processor, the ransom being collected at ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson's sleuths are a police detective, Lou Boldt, and a psychologist, 
Daphne Matthews, who discover that the original scam begat successor scams with 
a Byzantine set of motivations and connections. The suspense is not really 
pulse-pounding but Pearson does convey the horror of the randomness, and the 
detailing has its own interest. His principals, violating tradition, are not 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. Lupoff hosts a radio show in Berkeley and is a veteran, 
wide-ranging writer whose output includes a biography of Edgar Rice Burroughs. 
You have the feeling he follows his enthusiasms into fiction. His THE SEPIA 
SIREN KILLER (St. Martin's: $20.95; 304 pp.) is at heart a celebration of the 
world of black filmmaking which, like the black baseball leagues, paralleled 
the white big-time well into mid-century. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is one of a series featuring Lupoff's interracial couple, Hobart 
Lindsey, an insurance adjuster, and Marvia Plum, a Berkeley police sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire at the Pacific Film Archive has claimed the life of a young woman 
researching black films. An ancient black man (modeled, as Lupoff admits in an 
afterword, on the career of Oscar Micheaux) appears with questions about an 
ancient insurance policy with Lindsey's company. He is a filmmaker long 
presumed dead, but coincidentally his film, "The Werewolf of Harlem," is being 
honored, along with its star, in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire is only the beginning of trouble, and its roots are deep in the past, 
related to another fire, which killed a film's star and put the company out of 
business. The mystery is not mind-boggling but the old man is a great 
character, Lupoff has an exception ear for dialogue and the blend of fiction 
and fact gives the novel a special attractiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about thrillers that are about something: Joe Gores' new book, MENACED 
ASSASSIN (Mysterious Press: $19.95; 338 pp.), is, as Gores cheerfully admits in 
a closing note, a novel "that happens to examine man's origins, his nature, his 
relationship with the world around him, and the wellsprings of his almost 
unremitting violence against his own kind." (The latter would inevitably be of 
some interest to mystery writers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily Gores has come up with a plot substantial enough to carry such heavy 
musings. The corporate executive wife of a distinguished paleoanthropologist 
named Dalton is murdered and the scientist himself becomes the target of death 
threats from a serial killer who signs himself Raptor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton returns from research in Africa for a major public lecture, which is 
used as a linking punctuation throughout the book. Dante Stagnaro, a detective 
on the organized crime beat, is assigned to protect Dalton from Raptor. 
</P>
<P>
 The lecture serves as Gores' opportunity to explore his topics of interest, 
including Science vs. Creationism and the points at which they seem to 
coincide. The lecture is engrossing, and in his appendix, Gores lists the 
titles of 18 books he has consulted and whose thought he has painlessly 
paraphrased, from Robert Ardrey's "African Genesis" to Dudley Young's "Origins 
of the Sacred." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a most unusual combination of entertainment and provocation from 
the author also capable of the hilarious "32 Cadillacs" a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Rankin is an Edinburgh-based poet, short story writer and winner of a 
Chandler-Fulbright Fellowship for authors of crime fiction. His police 
procedurals featuring Edinburgh detective John Rebus are atmospheric, 
fast-moving and very good. THE BLACK BOOK: A John Rebus Mystery (Otto Penzler 
Books: $21; 288 pp.) is the fifth in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 The black book of the title is a coded diary kept by a young officer still 
fascinated by a years-ago hotel fire in which a never-identified man died. The 
officer is ambushed and left in a coma and Rebus takes up the inquiry, hoping 
to learn what the officer knew that made him a target. 
</P>
<P>
 The quest is populated with vivid characters, not least among them a male 
couple who run a restaurant that is a shrine to Elvis. Crime is evidently as 
nasty, brutish and organized in Scotland as elsewhere, and some of its 
beneficiaries equally well-concealed behind respectable fronts. Murder will 
out, of course, and not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reginald Hill is a Brit who deserves to be more widely known here than he is. 
He is prolific (24 titles to date) but gives no sign the springs of imagination 
do not flow as generously as ever. He is clever (the chapter headings in the 
new book are all quotes from Jane Austen, for purposes of irony if no other). 
His plotting is fiendishly good and his denouement, payoff to a bloody first 
chapter, is breathtaking in its brazen unexpectedness. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, PICTURES OF PERFECTION (Delacorte: $19.95; 307 pp.) takes place in 
one of those quaintly colorful and dysfunctional villages without which British 
crime fiction would shrivel and die. The local constable is missing and Hill's 
regulars Inspectors Dalziel and Pascoe, augmented by Sergeant Wield, seek to 
locate him. 
</P>
<P>
 They contend with the local gentry, a bookseller of dubious ethics, a 
Bible-quoting cafe owner, a rather grand arts editor of a regional daily, and a 
covey of other villagers looking forward to the annual Day of Reckoning when 
all accounts are settled, as they certainly are. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not exactly social realism, but it's an elegant and diverting piece of 
writing all the way. Hear the Authors

THE TRIUMPH OF PEARLIE AND TESSIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bravo to Joy Horowitz for her warm and huggable portraits of her bubbes 
("Greetings From Pearlie and Tessie," Oct. 16). She has earned her place in 
heaven for her ability to share these remarkable women with us. They are the 
crones who teach us by example, the goddesses who stay at the hearth and stir 
the noodle pudding. They are everyone's grandmothers, the ones we may have 
forgotten to honor.

 Old age is inevitable. Tessie and Pearlie have certainly done it with grace. 
They are to be respected and admired.

 Horowitz's marvelous story about her grandmothers reminded me of a story I 
heard about my own grandmother. When she was in her late '70s, her daughter 
suggested that she slow down a little, as she was always running out to club 
meetings and luncheons. Her answer was: "I'm not going to slow down. I'm ready 
whenever God wants me, but I'm not going to sit home and wait for Him . . . 
He's going to have to find me." She kept right on running around until she was 
87 years old.

 The recipes were hilarious. I think my Hungarian mom learned at the same 
cooking school: "You know, honey, a handful of flour, a little water, two eggs, 
and then you beat it until it looks like a good dumpling." I had a heck of a 
time getting the old family recipes out of her. 
</P>
<P>
 All I can add is that Pearlie and Tessie must have been good "poysons" when 
they were young.

 I, too, seem to be suffering the same middle-age crying syndrome that Horowitz 
writes about. Just the other day I found myself in tears that Lou Gehrig had 
died of the disease named for him. I cried as I read the bubbes article. I miss 
my grandmother's marble cake. Any way I can have Tessie's recipe?

 Grandma Tessie's Yummy Marble Cake: 
</P>
<P>
 I'll tell you the truth; I don't make it from scratch. I use the Duncan Hines 
marble cake mix, but I doctor it up and make it more rich. I put in half a pint 
of sour cream that it doesn't call for. It calls for three eggs, so I put in 
four. I add small chocolate chips, about six ounces. I also put in a package of 
My-T-Fine vanilla pudding. This you must have; it's got the vanilla smell. I 
use half of what the box says for water and oil, since I add the sour cream. 
Otherwise, it'll be too loose.  
</P>
<P>
 So I mix the eggs, sour cream and water at not a very big speed -- a nice 
speed. I mix it for 20 minutes for sure. It comes out very smooth. When I have 
all the ingredients mixed, I put it in a nine-inch baking pan -- you know, so 
the cake comes out with a hole in the middle. But in order to make it marble, I 
leave a little dough in the mixing bowl. Duncan Hines gives you a little 
envelope with chocolate, and I marble it with a knife, back and forth. Into 
this here, I add the chocolate chips. If anyone doesn't like it, let 'em sue 
me.

 One question for Joy: How come your bubeleh told you that the name Horowitz 
means hard-working , when my bubeleh , who had the same name, told me it means 
you have no idea how I suffer ?

 My husband had just had another chemotherapy treatment for the bladder cancer 
that he has been fighting for the last 2 1/2 years, and he was feeling pretty 
rotten. He had been working on the crossword puzzle, and, as usual, it gave him 
some respite from his ailments. I asked him if he had read the article about 
the bubbes , and he said no. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading the first paragraph I knew I had to read the article to him 
aloud. We roared over the similarities between Horowitz's bubbes and my own 
mother and her sisters and over the Jewish idioms. It made our day. We both 
ardently believe in laughter therapy (my husband is a psychologist) and your 
article was so effective that we had to let you know how much we appreciated 
it.

 Horowitz wrote that a Jewish woman is "unclean" for 40 days after the birth of 
a son and 60 days after the birth of a daughter. The Hebrew word for a woman's 
status after the birth of a child is niddah , and she is teme'ah -- "ritually 
impure." This is a spiritual concept that has nothing to do with physical 
cleanliness. The Kotzer Rebbe, in quoting the Gemara , says that when a woman 
gives birth, the schechina (heavenly presence) is present, but after birth, we 
mourn its departure, and that is why we are niddah after childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 The time period mentioned is more than merely symbolic; six weeks is also 
modern medicine's recommended waiting time before a postpartum woman should 
resume sexual relations. The longer time period following the birth of the girl 
is because the birth of a daughter, who has the potential of giving birth to 
others, carries with it a much greater sanctity.

 I learned a lot from my grandmother, who lived until the age of 97, and from 
the truly amazing stories she told about her life. We all could learn from the 
elderly; they are our backbone. I feel as though they are the forgotten 
generation in America. I loved and respected my grandmother the way that 
Horowitz does hers. I miss her every day.

ROSEWOOD RETROSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a native Floridian, I pledged from first knowledge of the Rosewood massacre 
that I would do all within my power to see that the survivors received redress 
of their grievances, whether or not I ever made a movie about it ("A Massacre, 
the Movies and the Obligations of Memory," by Eric Harrison, Oct. 16). When I 
engaged Holland & Knight in behalf of Lee Ruth Davis and Minnie Lee Langley, I 
charged the law firm with seeking out and representing all the survivors, and 
they undertook that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to your portrayal, I never attempted to exclude anyone from being 
beneficiaries of the legal action, nor did I have the power to do so, should I 
have chosen to. I never specified the number or the exact whereabouts of the 
additional survivors on the Maury Povich TV show, because I simply did not know 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that I limited the number of survivors from whom I purchased story 
rights. I had to work within a budget -- this was, after all, a story Holywood 
already had rejected once -- and I concentrated first on securing rights from 
Langley, Davis and a third character I thought was essential to telling the 
story. It was, however, my intent to reach out to other potential participants 
when a movie or TV deal was made.

 Reading about Rosewood reminds me of all the pain and suffering that African 
Americans have encountered throughout the ages. I don't think that $2.1 
million, or $150,000 for each person, would compensate for the emotional trauma 
the Rosewood survivors endured.

 Ella Taylor's "Riffing With Michael Ondaatje" (Oct. 16) proves that good 
writing inspires good reading. Your magazine has improved so much in the past 
six months that nowadays I look forward to reading it before I pick up the New

THE LAST WORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Alex Uchitel described himself as a "godfather" who helped fellow 
immigrants by giving them jobs in his appliance-repair service, he surely could 
not have anticipated the headline identifying his business as "L.A.'s Russian 
(Appliance-Repair) Mafia" (Palm Latitudes, Oct. 16).Off to a gulag for your 
editors for carelessly misrepresenting Uchitel and his highly educated 
colleagues in focusing only on the last word of the item and for failing to 
recognize that such "cleverness" could cause the "melting pot" to do a slow 
burn. 
</P>
<P>

 Uchitel, according to his attorney, was none too happy with the headline 
either. We did not mean to imply that Uchitel's company is involved with the 
Russian mob.

SHAWN CHRISTIAN'S 'WORLD' TURNS AROUND FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The most difficult thing about my life now," says Shawn Christian, who loves 
playing Mike Kasnoff on "As the World Turns," "is that I don't get to spend 
time with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian, a native of Grand Rapids, Mich., where his family still resides, 
says, "When I do go home, it's like a crash course. I get to spend a little 
time with each relative but get quality time with only a select few. My little 
brother Chad is 19, and I've missed the opportunity to watch him grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I went home there was a family pig roast," he continues. "There 
was a pig on a spit, a bonfire, an incredible harvest moon and about 40 of us. 
We slept in a camper in the woods. Some pitched tents. It was wonderful, but I 
had to leave early so I could tape a show. It was heart-wrenching saying goodby 
-- especially to my grandmother -- and only hoping to make it back for the 
holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian admits that he was "a bit of a wild child" and was even suspended 
from junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life could have taken a huge turn there," says the actor, "but my family 
showed me they believed in me. I became a camp counselor, got into sports, and 
even coached." 
</P>
<P>
 At his high school graduation, Christian was surprised when he was awarded a 
Congressional Medal of Merit for community leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know at graduation all you want to do is get out of there," he jokes. 
"They were rambling on about some guy being given this award for his commitment 
to human growth and community service. I was trying to figure out who it is. I 
couldn't believe it when my name was called." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian feels he has not lost his wild spirit but has learned to handle 
responsibility. He admits to playing pretty hard in college but he held on to 
graduate with a high-B average. 
</P>
<P>
 On "As the World Turns," Christian has found a kindred spirit in Yvonne Perry, 
who plays his love interest, Rosanna Cabot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both have similar small-town backgrounds," says Christian. "She's got a 
good sense of morals and family values, and she is honed in on it like I am. Of 
all the people I've met in New York City, she is one of those I just love to 
sit down and talk with." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are fascinated by the relationship between Yvonne and me," adds 
the actor, who is engaged, while Perry is married. "They want to know the real 
deal. We're friends. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 His fiancee, Deborah, is a personal fitness trainer who was recently 
transferred from Chicago to Washington, D.C. A move to New York is a strong 
possibility for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's getting closer," says Christian. "We're not even thinking of a wedding 
date yet. For now, we're just looking forward to living in the same city." 
</P>
<P>
 "As the World Turns" airs weekdays at 1 p.m. on CBS.

 SEWING BY HAND by Christine Hoffman, pictures by Harriett Barton 
(HarperCollins: $14; 29 pp.) The insurmountable pile of unanswered questions my 
7-year-old has asked me accumulates in my overworked brain much like dirty 
laundry on the bathroom floor.Always there, always more. What a find to be able 
to answer the query, "Mom, how do you sew?" Christine Hoffman demystifies the 
process for 4- to 8-year-olds (and their parents) in her delightfully 
illustrated and easy-to-understand "Sewing by Hand." Even the smallest hands 
can help assemble the needed tools and materials. Step-by-step instructions are 
accompanied by clear drawings for non-readers and the skills required discussed 
-- marking, cutting ("Go slowly and carefully"), threading a needle, tying 
knots and how to sew three types of stitches ("Wow, Mom, I can't believe I'm 
sewing!"). Three simple projects will give parent and child that satisfied 
sense of completion in a relatively short time. A few shortcuts we came up with 
on our own: Machine-sew larger stretches of the project -- beginners will still 
get the enjoyment of marking, cutting and stuffing; and photocopy the patterns 
if you don't have tracing paper on hand. A third suggestion -- my son's -- was 
to tape the final edge shut if you're in a hurry, but then he remembered we 
were doing this to learn to sew by hand and sew he did. Lauren Tsujimoto

ON THE TOWN: A BIRD WATCHER CONFESSES; TAKING HER NAME IN VAIN IS NOW DE 
RIGUEUR, BUT THE EX-CHIEF JUSTICE MADE EXCITING LAW 
</P>

 If you only mostly followed the recent election campaign on TV, you might be 
excused for any confusion as to just who was on the ballot two weeks ago. Jerry 
Brown was up for something -- I'm pretty sure the commercials said that. I 
think Bill Clinton was running for Congress in a few districts. But everybody 
seemed to be running against former California Chief Justice Rose Bird, though 
I could have sworn she's been out of office for years -- and we all know how 
much the crime rate has gone down since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to find a Pete Wilson ad without a pre-makeover Bird picture in it 
somewhere, and the governor seemed to mention her often in the gubernatorial 
debate, much like Dan Quayle brought up Jimmy Carter in the 1992 
vice-presidential campaign. Michael Huffington also referred to Bird a lot, on 
the few occasions he spoke at all, though Dianne Feinstein has been canny 
enough to avoid being seen with Bird for at least a decade. The thrust of an 
unsuccessful campaign last spring to recall State Sen. David Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys) seemed tied to Roberti's support of Bird. And Bird was the subject of at 
least half the congressional campaigns in the state. Now that the Evil Empire 
has been discredited for a while, Bird-calling is the closest thing to 
Red-baiting. Even Nixon took less time to rehabilitate. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I used to have something of a Rose Bird problem myself. I 
discovered her my first year out of college, when I found myself working 
alongside bar-exam casualties at the local legal newspaper, proofreading 
judicial decisions for the next morning's appellate report, conforming cites, 
staring at a blurry screen until my eyes threatened to turn into tomato soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other proofreaders, I took pleasure in the gory cases that involved 
motorboat tragedies and trailer-park killings, but I always fought to get first 
crack at California Supreme Court decisions when they came in. A Rose Bird 
opinion, even a dissent on a product-liability case, was usually forceful, 
compassionate, intricately reasoned and fashioned with the kind of writerly 
craft that lawyers are probably conditioned to distrust. It was like finding a 
Jane Austen novel in a pile of Harlequin romances. 
</P>
<P>
 You could disagree with her conclusions, on the standard of evidence, on the 
racial composition of juries, but in the waning days of the Warren Burger court 
in Washington, it was hard to argue with the notion that the California Supreme 
Court was making exciting law. To tell the truth, my interest in Bird may not 
have been so different from my interest in the "Like a Virgin"-era Madonna 
thing that took over a couple of years later, except that I put up fewer 
posters on the wall at work, and I liked Bird's record better. Tort reform may 
not be sexy, but its protections actually affect people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers made fun of my "Bird obsession," razzing her when she read her 
poetry in public, making sure I noticed when the paper ragged on yet another 
lead opinion on a death penalty case, groaning when she found for the plaintiff 
in a labor or real estate suit that they thought might prevent them from one 
day becoming as rich as the Bechtels. One Valentine's Day, the boss taped a 
grainy photograph of Bird above my computer terminal, probably because he 
thought that her droopy sweater and uncombed hair were amusing. I threw away 
the paper heart he'd glued it to, but I kept the picture until the day I quit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 campaign against her was inevitable. It was financed largely by 
insurance and oil companies who cared nothing about her death penalty rulings, 
and it was run in part by some of the same people who brought us the Willie 
Horton ad and the tobacco companies' Trojan-horse "anti-smoking" initiative 
this year. Californians like to see murderers fry; that has been made 
abundantly clear. But like any modern pop hero, Bird was too cool to care, too 
cool to point out how her rulings protected individuals against giant 
corporations, too cool to talk about the Bird court's role in preserving 
individual freedoms. Her stubborn anti-campaign was noble, even heroic in its 
way, but politics isn't like the movies. The day after that election, I knew 
that California politics would never be the same.

 The beauty of Carolyn Chute's "The Beans of Egypt, Maine" is that she makes 
her sometimes appalling working-class characters both funny and sympathetic. 
They chew with their mouths open, live in trailers surrounded by toys and 
rusting junk, and smell overpoweringly of rifles, rabbits, babies and 
yesterday's dinner. To read this is to feel a kinship with people most of us 
would ordinarily have nothing to do with. 
</P>
<P>
 The question for the makers of the movie, to be released on Nov. 23, is 
whether watching it will prompt the same reaction -- and, if so, whether that 
will translate into good box office. A way around the movie-makers' legitimate 
concerns is, of course to Hollywoodize the material. Straighten Rubie Bean's 
twisted teeth. Excise his cousin Beal's plum-sized pimples. Tone down their 
neighbor Earlene's hymn singing. Make Aunt Roberta Beans' head bigger than a 
turnip and put her in touch with Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they've done (almost) all of these things and yet still have somehow 
remained true to the book. Principal among the changes was the decision to 
combine Rubie's second "wife," Madelaine, with Roberta, so that Roberta is a 
Bean only by marriage. According to scripter Bill Phillips, this achieved 
several objectives. It simplified the narrative, and it made the role "decent 
enough to attract a name actress" -- the willowy and not at all turnip-headed 
Kelly Lynch. (Among the other photogenic cast members are Martha Plimpton and 
Rutger Hauer.) Indeed, Phillips says that some of his rewrites "were for the 
purposes of saving $500 here and there by striking speaking parts. We were 
really nickel-and-diming it." 
</P>
<P>
 The nickel-and-dimers were producer Rosilyn Heller and first-time director 
Jennifer Warren, who struggled for nine years to bring this book to the screen. 
The lengthy development process was complicated by the fact that Chute's 
representatives wouldn't sell them the property at first. According to Warren, 
it wasn't as if Chute didn't need the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money she made from the book, which was not a whole lot, was long since 
gone," says Warren. "Our first payment to her got her a truck. She still has an 
outhouse. She still has no hot water. She still has no heat. The literary world 
is almost as bad as the independent filmmaking world." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from buying her that truck, the movie may serve to dispel some 
misconceptions about the book. One is that the Beans' lives are unrelievedly 
nasty, brutish and short. Chute apparently felt that readers would assume 
without being told that they have their good days, but the movie spells this 
out. Another impression many observers (readers and movie-makers alike) had is 
that the relationship between Earlene and her daddy is incestuous. Not so, in 
the movie, nor was this the author's original intention. In fact, says 
Phillips, Chute has been working on a new version of the book with changes that 
clarify this relationship. In this way, the movie has become a trailer for the 
book.

 THE LAST PANDA by George B. Schaller (University of Chicago Press: $13.95; 299 
pp., illustrated). Their pudgy shape and black-and-white pelt make pandas one 
of the most beloved animals on the planet.Wildlife biologist George Schaller 
recounts his efforts to study these little-known animals in their remote 
habitats, despite inadequate facilities, bureaucratic snarls and indifferent 
co-workers. Frustrated in his efforts to protect even the specimens he 
encountered, Schaller concludes that the remaining pandas face an uncertain 
future: "Segregated on its mountaintops, harried by poachers, its habitat 
shrinking, the panda has become an elegy. No face-saving illusions can hide 
these facts. Unless sound planning and vigorous law enforcement are soon 
initiated, all the field research, impressive laboratories, educational 
campaigns, public appeals and legal assaults will be of no avail in saving the 
panda."

 CERAMIC UNCLES & CELLULOID MAMMIES: Black Images and Their Influence on 
Culture by Patricia A. Turner (Anchor: $12.95; 238 pp., illustrated, paperback 
original) and MAMMY AND UNCLE MOSE: Black Collectibles and American 
Stereotyping by Kenneth W. Goings (Indiana University Press: $22.50; 123 pp., 
illustrated, paperback original). The illustrations in Goings' book are taken 
from his personal collection of outrageous product labels, toys, postcards and 
bric-a-brac.The jokes about children eating watermelon and fleeing alligators, 
fractured English and chicken stealing form a veritable rogue's gallery of 
racist imagery. The text, which amounts to little more than a capsule history 
of interracial relations in America, lacks the punch of the visuals. Turner 
discusses images in the popular media that parallel what she calls 
"contemptible collectibles." Her analyses of the shifting interpretations of 
the characters in Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and the 
portrayals of African-Americans in prime-time TV shows are carefully documented 
and well-argued. But other essays seem mis-focused: She compares Roger Rabbit 
to Lincoln Perry's Stepin Fetchit character, but ignores more relevant 
depictions of blacks in cartoons and comic strips. Strangest of all is her 
contention that the absurd elephant jokes of the '60s were a way for whites to 
"articulate their anti-black prejudices and fears in a socially acceptable 
fashion."

 THE NATURE OF CALIFORNIA: An Introduction to Common Plants and Animals and 
Natural Attractions by James Kavanagh, illustrated by Raymond Leung (Waterford 
Press, 1592 Union St. 200, San Francisco, Calif. 94123: $16.50; 179 pp,. 
paperback original). Although less complete than the Torry Peterson guides, 
"Nature" offers an agreeable overview of animals and plants casual hikers and 
campers are likely to encounter. Kavanagh notes which species have been 
introduced to the state, and which are potentially dangerous. A useful book to 
keep with the picnic supplies or camping gear.

 JAPANESE JIVE: Wacky and Wonderful Products from Japan by Caroline McKeldin 
(Tengu Books/Weatherhill: $9.95; 80 pp., illustrated, paperback original). 
English writing on T-shirts and product labels is considered very trendy in 
Japan, and these often hysterical examples were obviously created by people who 
don't speak the language, e.g. the beverages, "Plain White Water" and "Pocari 
Sweat." Some of the products sound as bizarre as their names, especially the 
"Soup Sand Series": a serving of soup sealed in a fried crumb crust, presented 
on a hamburger bun with lettuce and mayo to resemble a sandwich. What's the 
Japanese word for yeech?

 FRENCH LESSONS: A Memoir by Alice Kaplan (University of Chicago Press: $9.95; 
232 pp.) . In her thoughtful autobiography, Kaplan recalls the role studying 
French played in her life: "French got me away from my family and taught me how 
to talk. Made me an adult. And the whole drama of it is in that 'r,' how deep 
in my throat, how different it feels." The most entertaining chapters describe 
her adolescent attraction to the sophistication the language seemed to bestow. 
Her later interest in the odious Fascist authors of the early '40s enabled her 
to come to grips with the legacy of her father, who had served as a prosecutor 
at the Nuremburg trials.

 PRODUCE & CONSERVE, SHARE & PLAY SQUARE: The Grocer & the Consumer on the 
Home-Front Battlefield During World War II edited by Barbara McLean Ward 
(Strawberry Banke Museum/Univeristy Press of New England: $24.95; 240 pp.) . 
The catalogue of an exhibit at a New Hampshire museum, "Produce & Conserve" 
offers a look at a small neighborhood grocery in 1941-45: The store layout, 
posters and product labels seem less aggressive than their modern counterparts. 
An engaging series of essays focuses on the demands the federal government 
placed on consumers during the war, including ration books, Victory Gardens, 
meatless days and saving grease to be processed into glycerin for explosives.

PALM LATITUDES: THE TUBE; CHANNEL-SURFING SAFARI

<TEXT>
<P>
 You've memorized your Social Security number, payroll number, ATM access code, 
driver's license and the phone at your mom's new boyfriend's summer home. You 
carefully guard the shiny rectangles that contain your most pertinent credit 
numerology. 
</P>
<P>
 And now this: Your local cable company, driven by new federal regulations and 
the burgeoning market for obscure information services, decides without 
notice,to scramble the 70-odd channels that you have slowly and methodically 
assimilated over two years of pathetic but character-building idling. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, my current L.A. entertainment nightmare: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 43. Used to be C-SPAN, dependably lively subcommitte committee 
hearings on international trade policy and the descent of the ruble. Now, Cafe 
Ole, and definitive recipes for coconut flan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 66. Used to be Bravo; could count on dramatic huffing and puffing 
of attractive figures, artfully photographed in shadows, speaking deep thoughts 
in foreign tongues. Now, Family Entertainment; lots of cows, small dogs, pretty 
horses, noble sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 15. Used to be MTV. Always watched this for the complex rythmic 
innovations, melodic experimentation and the finer points of jump-cutting 
editing techniques. Now, the Weather Channel. Study the dramatic range of 
temperatures at LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 40. Used to be Univision; tele-nuevos, political assasinations, 
funny wrestlers; now TV Tokyo , stock tables, variety shows and the weather in 
Yokahama. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 36. Used to be ESPN, now ESPN 2. Used to be Major League Baseball, 
hockey; but, hey, with no major leagues, lacrosse and hurling have their place. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, once your new mental map is complete, a new test looms on the 
horizon: memorizing your federal ID card number. Bret Israel

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; RADIO FREE HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maria C. Iacobo 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody was more tired of all the groaning, moaning L.A.-bashing than Fred 
Messick, a public information officer for the state Office of Emergency 
Services. Urban anxieties filled the headlines and stoked our fears, but he 
knew there were good people doing good things in the city.To Messick's mind, 
local news outlets were doing a lousy job of finding them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media tells us about all of the problems: illiteracy, the crime rate, 
drugs. If all you did was read the local news," he says, "you'd want to move 
out of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 So six months ago, he bought radio time a Glendale radio station, KKLA-FM 
(99.5) and began "Citihope," which shines a light on efforts of grass-roots 
nonprofit groups and the people behind them. Messick uses his money and some 
donations from friends to buy air time. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong show, which airs Saturday at 5, has profiled dozens of people. 
Among them was Bill Doulos, who runs two low-income housing programs that 
provide residents with such social services as child care and tutoring. Another 
is Chris Briggs, who directed a program from Azusa Pacific University with 
elementary and middle school students for one-on-one skill development, 
tutoring and mentoring. His appearance on the show prompted a call from a 
Diamond Bar man who wanted to start a similar project. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just the kind of response Messick ants. "There's a sense of 
hopelessness about L.A.I hope 'Citihope' replace that with a sense of optimism 
and confidence. We can then build on the knowledge that this city is filled 
with people who care and working to make a difference." Maria C. Iacobo

PALM LATITUDES: STATE OF MIND; COMRADE X

<P>
By R. Daniel Foster

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I despise going to lectures alone, and knew I couldn't drag just any comrade 
to a discourse titled "Generation X and the Communist Manifesto Today." To make 
it a memorable evening, I needed an Xer who had actually read the tome. After 
much searching, I chose Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 As we enter the Pathfinder bookstore on Pico, Eric tells me he has subtitled 
the talk "Slackers of the world, unite." Inside, 30 people fill a small room 
trimmed with posters of Che Guevara. A stocky young man is going on about class 
struggle, how capitalists are raking in profits off our labor and how Xers are 
disillusioned by the cynicism of bourgeois institutions and politics. I look 
around the room; most of the audience is past 40. 
</P>
<P>
 A new national movement called the Young Socialists formed in August and now 
boasts 20 chapters, says Evenhuis, 24. The moment is ripe, he says, for 
proletariat Xers who have been raised in an era of alienation and social 
disintegration "to form a fist like the fingers on a hand to smash the 
capitalists out of their positions." He's a regular John Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric all the while is plying my ear with commentary: "This is bogus with a 
capital B. Complete irrelevant drivel. The victim role is the fatal flaw of 
Marxism from day one. It's a spurious argument because we no longer have one 
working class like the serf class in the 19th Century. Yes, there is class 
struggle. So what? So you move beyond it and develop some ingenuity to exploit 
your neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, I should point out, is a trust funder from Beverly Hills who now manages 
Hollywood rental property for his family. "Cynicism is my life," he says. "I 
was raised on it, thrive on it and anyone with a brain would do the same." 
Cynicism, clearly, is the opiate of the slacker. R. Daniel Foster

 COLORATURA ARIAS: TRACY DAHL, soprano; Calgary Philharmonic, Mario Bernardi, 
cond. CBC records SMCD5125.Dahl represents a throwback to the type of 
coloratura soprano in vogue before the bigger voiced Callas, Sutherland and, 
currently, Anderson and Devia changed the way we hear this music. As pure 
sound, the soprano's voice is small, not intrinsically beautiful, monochromatic 
in color and just plain chirpy. She misses much of the tongue-in-cheek humor in 
"Glitter and be gay," the sophisticated drollness of Zerbinetta's aria, while 
Mozart is beyond her. She is at her best in such showpieces as Adele's "Mein 
Herr Marquis," and Olympia's aria from "Contes d'Hoffmann," where deep 
introspection is not needed. Bernardi's accompaniment is discreet.Walter Price

 VERDI: "FALSTAFF." Juan Pons, Daniela Dessi, Roberto Frontali, Bernadette 
Manca di Nissa, Maureen O'Flynn, Ramon Vargas, others; forces of La Scala, 
Riccardo Muti, cond.Sony S2K 58 961. Seldom has the admired Muti found a 
vehicle more suitable to his passion for disciplined detail, sense of 
orchestral color and arching expressive expansion. Taken from live 
performances, this riveting achievement is accomplished, moreover, with a cast 
containing not one truly memorable voice. However, Muti allows his singers 
space to bloom lyrically when the music calls for it. As the Fat Knight, Pons 
finds his best role, the conductor coaxing nuances not usually found in the 
baritone's work. O'Flynn and Vargas, as the young lovers, are the most 
noteworthy, but indicative of the overall effect is the stunning result of 
Muti's loving guidance of Frontali's less than first-rate voice in "E sogno?"

 STRAVINSKY: Four movements from "L'Histoire du Soldat." Three movements from 
"Petrushka." "Apollo."Christopher O'Riley, piano. Elektra Nonesuch 9 79343-2. A 
mixed lot, this. The best first: a dashing, playful reading of the "Petrushka" 
movements -- the only bona fide piano music here -- elegantly understated in 
virtuosity, nicely sauntering in tempo. The piano reduction of movements from 
"L'Histoire du Soldat" works well, too, in O'Riley's lissome hands. But nothing 
can disguise the piano reduction of "Apollo" as anything but a gray, 
utilitarian imitation, which the pianist does little to dispel.Timothy Mangan

POP EYE: A PRETTY PHAIR PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does it make any difference to you whether a record was produced by Brad Wood 
or by Ed Wood? 
</P>
<P>
 Record companies are banking that enough people do care -- and that's why 
they're showering offers on Brad Wood, rock's hottest young producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, 30, produced both of Liz Phair's acclaimed albums and the heralded debut 
by Veruca Salt. That success has placed Wood alongside Butch Vig (Nirvana's 
"Nevermind"), Steve Albini (Nirvana's "In Utero") and Brendan O'Brien (Pearl 
Jam) on alternative-rock's A-list. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been busy at the studio I run, but now it's at a different 
level," Wood says. "Mostly it's a difference in who I talk to and all the extra 
zeros (on the checks)." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a long way from recent times -- Wood basically did Phair's debut, 
"Exile in Guyville," for free, charging just for studio time and not his own 
services. And for the three months he spent working on Veruca Salt's "American 
Thighs," he billed the band just $5,000 to cover expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has a production deal with Capitol Records, scored during the label 
bidding war for Phair -- though Phair herself stayed with the 
Atlantic-distributed Matador. (Wood's currently in Atlanta, producing the new 
Capitol band Mother.) And artists are ringing his phone off the hook to discuss 
their upcoming projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But do fans care who produces an album? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will buy, for example, anything that Steve Albini produces," says 
Karen Glauber, post-modern editor for Hits magazine. "People have that kind of 
loyalty. Brad's catalogue isn't that deep yet, but he has managed to make 
records, especially with women, that don't sound contrived." 
</P>
<P>
 A trained classical and jazz musician, Wood set up his Idful Music studio in 
Chicago seven years ago and quickly became an active player in the Windy City's 
rock scene, best known as the home of Smashing Pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood has a reputation as a quick worker -- he claims to have produced 50 
albums in the last year. With Veruca Salt, though, he encouraged the band to 
take its time, and the project, originally slated for 10 days, lasted three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with more demands on his time and higher stakes on the line, Wood says he 
hopes to be able to keep working in his old way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a band is totally broke and I like it, sometimes I'll pay out of my own 
pocket," he says. "And whenever I do that, good things always come back to me."

RECORD RACK: WAX TRAX'S SHOCK-ROCK SHOWCASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 VARIOUS ARTISTS 
</P>
<P>
 "Blackbox" 
</P>
<P>
 Wax Trax  
</P>
<P>
 * * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Wax Trax Records may be the most influential little-known enterprise in pop 
music today. The original home of such industrial and electronic music 
heavyweights as Ministry, KMFDM, Coil, KLF, the Revolting Cocks and many 
others, the Chicago label can claim bragging rights to this year's Angst 
-ridden hero Trent Reznor. Mr. Nine Inch Nails is represented on this three-CD 
retrospective with his lead vocal on "Supernaut," a cut by Ministry chief Al 
Jourgensen's side group 1,000 Homo DJ's. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1980 by former record store co-owners Jim Nash and Dannie Flesher, 
Wax Trax (which filed Chapter 11 in 1992 and emerged restructured last January) 
specializes in the more experimental end of electronic music. As collected on 
"Blackbox," it ranges from the thrashing assault of Jourgensen's various 
projects to the KLF's groundbreaking 1990 rave anthem "What Time Is Love?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wax Trax has supported an aggressive style combining easy shock value with 
true cutting-edge sensibilities. Common themes among Wax Trax artists are 
isolation, sexual ambiguity and living in a decaying society. Where Reznor 
filters many of those issues through rock star stances and commercial savvy, 
the typical Wax Trax artist seems intrinsically incapable of cracking the Top 
40. But while they are generally far from mainstream tastes, Wax Trax acts have 
come up with unexpected hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the KLF smash, Ministry saw a steady increase in its audience with 
each release, laying the foundation for its big impact on the 1992 Lollapalooza 
tour. The success of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult's "Sexplosion" album 
helped the group land a major-label deal with Interscope Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The label isn't coasting on past triumphs, though. Included in "Blackbox" is 
"Afterburn," a limited-edition sampler that showcases new talents such as Kenny 
Larkin and Sister Machine Gun at the forefront of progressive techno sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The pop market, loosened up by the likes of Reznor, may finally be ready for 
the truly innovative output of Wax Trax. This retrospective collection shows 
why that's good news. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 Liberty / SBK

<P>
 Nelson is a wonderfully gifted and original vocal interpreter who exhibits a 
Sinatra-like feel for combining intimacy, sophistication and character. At 61, 
however, he's way too far on the wrong side of the age curve to get much 
country radio airplay -- and therefore sales -- in the era of Garth and Clint. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with that underdog position is that it encourages record execs to 
over-think each project -- as if every Nelson album is a comeback try in need 
of a special twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Don Was outfitted him last year in a coat of many pop-rock colors, 
and it didn't fit. Now producer Jimmy Bowen puts Nelson with a 60-piece 
orchestra in hopes of crossover appeal, and the arrangements smother the 
bearded Texan much of the time on standards ranging from his own "Funny How 
Time Slips Away" to Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's "All the Things You 
Are." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson may never regain his '70s and '80s commercial punch, but we'll have a 
lot better chance of getting some more good albums from him if everyone stops 
trying to fix something that isn't broken. Just let the man sing. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 "Don't ask me what I believe in / Right now it's everything," Heidi Ore wails 
in the title song of this big-label debut. In its 10 songs, the Lincoln, Neb., 
trio conducts a grueling examination of a life struggling to escape inertia and 
uncertainty and find some footing, wholeness and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The music, an original take on the arty-punk, alternative-rock vocabulary, 
reflects the treacherous nature of the ambiguous terrain of faith and 
temptation. Sour notes float in the storms, denying resolution and suggesting a 
subtle dread. Jolting, PJ Harvey-like dynamic shifts establish a sensibility 
flying between extremes, and the overall urgency underscores the realization 
that life is slipping away. No time to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Fronting guitarist Jon Taylor and drummer Ron Albertson, bassist Ore sings in 
pure, ringing tones that are slightly damped by her a Midwest twang. Powerful 
enough to stay atop the most majestic surges, she also has an engaging intimacy 
and a no-nonsense directness that allows her to remain defiant in the testy 
relationship with a Higher Power that she begins negotiating. That makes it 
rock 'n' roll of the first order.

really spells out his intentions on this randy roundup of bedroom ballads.But 
even White must realize that so much emphasis on mattress-bouncing can only 
carry you so far. He sounds resigned on "Whatever We Had," in which he suggests 
that an enduring love can be the most slippery icon to capture.

band's own 1993 surprise hit, the metalized "Three Little Pigs," gets sent up 
here.Grunge and neo-metal are targets for most of the good-natured, cartoonish 
pokes, all played for fun and with pretty good chops. But rarely does GJ 
transcend the satire a la Spinal Tap or the Rutles.

a lot to enhance Tesla's latest dose of middleweight pop-metal.The highlights: 
the grinding gears of "The Solution," the slow-dance sway of "A Lot to Lose," 
the supercharged road-weariness of "Mama's Fool" and a pleasantly raspy, 
rockin' rendition of Joe South's "Games People Play."

Canada, fits neither the harsh L7-Bikini Kill grrrl-group nor the winsome 
Frente-Velocity Girl molds, but stakes out its own territory with elements of 
both.Playful, confident guitar-pop and intelligent, melodic and at times 
understated writing make for a promising debut. New albums are rated on a scale

adrenaline-infused vocals notwithstanding, the quartet still sounds too often 
like Midnight Oil Lite."Judgement Day," a nihilistic Bee Gees-meet-Crazy-Horse 
take, works well enough, as do some of the full-throttle thrashers. Ultimately, 
their trademark style-hopping leaves the feeling that there's no there here.

 Morrissey, recently the subject of false suicide rumors, will release a new EP 
in January that is said to feature the singer in an atypically cheerful mood. 
The EP was produced by Steve Lillywhite, who did Morrissey's last album, 
"Vauxhall and I." A video for the EP's title song was recently filmed in an 
East London gymnasium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A limited-edition "secret" single by Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan has been 
released by TVT Records. The song, "Disillusion of Candour," with Corgan taking 
the alias of the Starchildren, is backed on a vinyl single by "Songs About 
Girls" by the group Catherine, which is produced by Corgan and includes the 
husband of Pumpkins bassist D'Arcy. Only 1,000 were printed -- with 700 shipped 
to England. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's Urge Overkill, riding a hit with its "Pulp Fiction" version of Neil 
Diamond's "Girl You'll Be a Woman Soon," will head to Philadelphia next month 
to record a new album with the Butcher Brothers, who also worked on last year's 
"Saturation." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Canadian dancehall reggae star Snow is almost done with his second album, due 
in February, but he is still facing visa problems from felony convictions that 
could prevent him from promoting it in the U.S. The single "Si Me Them No No 
Me" has been released to dance clubs and college radio stations to stir up some 
advance interest. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The merger of EastWest Records with Elektra has put an even bigger spotlight 
on En Vogue, arguably the biggest EastWest act. But it will probably be late 
next year before the company gets a new album from the R&B divas, still on 
hiatus following the birth of Cindy Herron's baby. . . . Maternity hasn't 
stopped rapper Yo-Yo from getting back to work. Though she had a baby in 
August, she's already finished five songs for her next album, due next year. .

</P>
<P>
 Carlos Santana and Van Morrison guest on John Lee Hooker's "Chill Out" album, 
due in February. Morrison sings on a medley of "Serves Me Right to Suffer" and

 RUFFLED FEATHERS?: Is this an Eagles reunion tour or a farewell tour? 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the formerly feuding Don Henley and Glenn Frey told us they hoped 
to write more songs together after the tour.In the Nov. 19 issue of Billboard 
magazine, however, Henley tells editor Timothy White, "I think that after this 
tour, that'll be it. . . . Some of the things that broke us apart years ago 
have not gone away, evidently." 
</P>
<P>
 When questioned by Pop Eye, Henley cautioned against reading too much into the 
quote. "There has been some occasional strife on this tour, but it has 
certainly been nothing out of the ordinary or anything that wasn't expected at 
the outset," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 His Billboard interview, he continued, was "not a good day for me. That 
morning I was informed . . . that my home on Mulholland Drive -- the house that 
I painstakingly built over a period of three years and have lived in since 1979 
-- would have to be completely demolished because of extensive earthquake 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Henley was making no promises to the Eagles beyond the tour, 
which resumes in January following a break caused by Frey's emergency stomach 
surgery. The operative term, Henley says, of post-tour projects continues to 
be: "We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Irving Azoff, Henley's manager, is looking into a possible European 
Eagles swing after the U.S. shows, which include a stop Jan. 21 at the Rose 
Bowl. Robert Hilburn

 SHOP AROUND: While the trend in the retail music world for years has been 
giant supermarket-like outlets a la Tower and the Virgin Megastores, Tower 
itself is experimenting with smaller, more specialized locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Tower Alternative store has just opened in the Lab Shopping Mall in 
Costa Mesa, offering what's loosely defined as "college music," according to 
store manager Rodney Metoyer.The store's focus embraces everything from the 
current alternative pop playlist through avant-garde jazz, traditional country 
and imported product. 
</P>
<P>
 The store also offers clothing, books (William Burroughs is a particular 
fave), adult magazines and esoteric videos. A second Tower Alternative will 
open on Santa Monica Boulevard in Santa Monica next month, specializing in 
world music and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Metoyer and his assistant manager make the ultimate call on whether a title 
passes the "alternative" test, and already there have been battles with record 
company salespeople over what qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
 But they'll try to avoid coming off as snobs. "If people are looking for it, 
we won't tell them it's not cool enough to carry," Metoyer says. Bruce Haring

 Vincent Ward's beautiful and ambitious 1993 film is a startling epic of 
cultural seduction that tries -- and often succeeds -- to catch a massive chunk 
of our century in microcosm. Two mixed-race Inuit youths bond in a Montreal 
Catholic hospital school, become separated and then meet again in London during 
the last stages of World War II. There, Avik (Jason Scott Lee), who has become 
an aerial photographer, and the sensuous Albertine (Anne Parillaud) continue 
what amounts to a lifetime of frustrated longing (Cinemax Thursday at 4 a.m.).

 Carter deals in upfront statements. When she grapples with a song, as she 
frequently does here, there is no doubt about who will emerge victorious. Her 
interpretations of the familiar "Sometimes I'm Happy" and "Lover Man" twist the 
tunes to her own purposes. At times, she stretches and reshapes melody lines 
well past their appropriate harmonies; occasionally, she plays the role of 
instrumentalist, scatting out phrases with the feral self-confidence of a jazz 
lioness. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Shirley Horn's music pulls the listener in via an almost hypnotic 
suspension of time, Carter's reaches out, grabs the lapels and shouts, "This is 
it!" It is quirky, unsettling jazz and a demanding experience for the 
accompanying musicians. In this case, Carter is backed by an ensemble -- 
pianist Geri Allen, bassist Dave Holland and drummer Jack DeJohnette -- fully 
capable of dealing with her idiosyncratic style. The result is intermittently 
perplexing, but always fascinating.

 Horn's return to jazz singing was a powerful boost for an art that had begun 
to drift toward irrelevance. In the years since her comeback album in 1987, she 
has distilled her exquisitely controlled style into brilliantly artful 
minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Working here with longtime accompanists Charles Ables on bass and Steve 
Williams on drums, she is at her very best, singing standards such as "Just in 
Time," and "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" with an irresistibly sensual, easy grooving 
rhythm. In contrast, "Do It Again" and "It's Easy to Remember" are reduced to 
near-perilously slow tempos -- a floating time that can only be effective in 
the hands of a performer whose rhythmic skills are strong enough to fill the 
pregnant musical pauses with the rich promise of anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 For Horn, each song is a musical miniature, a complete melding of words, music 
and rhythmic flow. She creates a captivating emotional universe in which subtle 
timing, harmonic precision and dramatic implication are everything. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

<TEXT>

 This Merchant-Ivory production is a beautifully melancholy romance between 
people who point-blank refuse to acknowledge emotional attachments and, 
constricted by an unwritten professional code, can't even bring themselves to 
address each other by first names.While the thought of all this decorous 
self-denial between a butler and a housekeeper in one of England's great houses 
in the days before World War II may sound uninvolving, the 1993 film is the 
opposite. It is a moving and carefully modulated picture that overcomes a 
certain innate stodginess. And it offers acting from Anthony Hopkins and Emma 
Thompson (both pictured) that is little short of miraculous (Cinemax Friday at 
8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Director Francois Truffaut, who died 10 years ago, ended his all-too-brief yet 
major career with perhaps his most playful film ever.This is a giddy comedie 
noir in which a businessman (Jean-Claude Trintignant) is forced to turn to the 
secretary (Fanny Ardant) he has just fired after his wife ends up shot to death 
in her living room. Ardant is the classic wisecracking Girl Friday who, as a 
private eye, proves more intrepid than Nancy Drew ever dreamed of being. 
Adapted from Charles Williams' "The Long Good Night," this 1983 French 
production displays such a mastery of tone that every murder becomes a laughing 
matter (Bravo Saturday at 8 p.m. and 1 a.m. Sunday). Kevin Thomas

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; ROSETTA LENOIRE'S NURTURING WAYS EXTEND BEYOND HER ROLE 
ON ABC'S 'FAMILY MATTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosetta LeNoire works in Los Angeles on the ABC series "Family Matters." She 
runs two theater groups in New York. And, before we forget to mention it, she's 
83 and has more goals in life. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she's spent 70 years in show business, most people today know LeNoire 
from her role as the sweet, all-knowing Mother Winslow on "Family Matters." But 
her real passion are two acting companies she founded in her home state: The 
AMAS Repertory Theater and The Eubie Blake Children's Theater. Both groups are 
devoted to interracial productions, a theme that plays an integral part in the 
actress' life. 
</P>
<P>
 LeNoire -- who also starred in NBC's "Gimme A Break" and NBC's "Amen" -- was 
born in New York's Hell's Kitchen and recalls her family's experiences with 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every morning, my father and his friends gathered on the roof to walk out 
together to the subway to work, because that way they wouldn't get beaten up by 
whites," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 LeNoire's mother died of pneumonia at 27; after giving birth she was refused a 
room and was placed in a hospital hallway, LeNoire says. Her mother died two 
days later, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 LeNoire also found opposition from other African Americans. "Not only was I 
crippled," she says of her youth, when rickets caused her legs to be braced and 
she walked with crutches, "but I was Catholic and most of the other blacks were 
Baptist or Methodist, so I know what it's like to be beaten up." 
</P>
<P>
 LeNoire says she's seen "gigantic changes" in America's racial environment. 
"You have to live it to know. I thank God everyday I've lived this long to 
enjoy what I'm enjoying now, what most young people take for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 Her godfather and mentor, Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, "had to eat in the 
servants' area, no matter how famous he got. I'm thrilled I can live like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and her singing instructor, Eubie Blake, helped develop her interest 
in entertainment. When LeNoire's leg braces came off at 13, she learned to tap 
dance and two years later, went on the road with Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she joined the Robert Earl Jones Theater Group. In addition to 
gathering acting experience, she cared for Jones' infant son, James Earl Jones, 
now one of the most highly regarded actors around. "He's grown in to such a 
lovely man," she says. "I'm so proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
 LeNoire's 1939 Broadway debut was in "The Hot Mikado," an all-black version of 
the opera. "It was something," she recalls. "There were 125 of us, all black 
Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hot Mikado" was followed by a role in Orson Welles' all-black production 
of "MacBeth": "Good Lord! He was a delegate from heaven. He was the only one 
who had faith that blacks could bring the right dignity and sophistication to 
Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
 Roles in television and theater, starting in the early '40s, followed and 
continued to be offered. "I've been lucky," she says, "I've always worked." She 
also penned the Tony-nominated "Bubblin' Brown Sugar." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just pray that if 'Family Matters' goes off the air, there'd be another 
show like it," she says. "Many people told me they were able to solve problems 
through the show. We need more shows like this and less of the sex business all 
the time. You'd think that's all that exists, sex, watching most TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her constant reference to her age, the great-grandmother of two still 
has goals: "I hope before I leave this world, that I can obtain a building for 
my theater groups. It's so needed and we can continue our work on 
multiracialism. That's why I called it AMAS, which means 'you love' in Latin. 
The principal reason is to bring people together regardless of creed, religion 
or national origin, and at my age, I know how important that is." 
</P>
<P>
 "Family Matters" airs Fridays at 8 p.m. on ABC. Reruns air weekdays at 6:30 
p.m. on KTLA.

ON THE SET; HOT 60-YEAR-OLD COPY; THE STORY OF THE DIONNE QUINTUPLETS ARRIVES 
ON CBS AS 'MILLION DOLLAR BABIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY CONLOGUE, Ray Conlogue is cultural correspondent for the Globe and Mail 
in Montreal, Canada. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beau Bridges, wearing the kind of white medical smock worn by the doctor who 
delivered the world's first surviving quintuplets, makes his way into a nursery 
that might have floated up from a mother's gauziest dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are five perfect beds, with chenille spreads in five perfect pastels and 
little matching bedside lamps, animal stencils running around the top of the 
walls, and in the middle of it all, five identical postcard-perfect little 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "And are my angels happy tonight?" Bridges asks, looking walrus-like with his 
extra stomach padding. "Yes, Dr. Dafoe," Annette, Cecile, Yvonne, Emilie and 
Marie chant in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-part CBS movie that Bridges is shooting is called "Million Dollar 
Babies," but that's an understatement. The tiny Dionne infants, born in May, 
1934, to impoverished French-Canadian parents in a remote Ontario town, so 
endeared themselves to America that they generated more than $100 million as a 
tourist attraction known as Quintland (built across from the Dionnes' 
hardscrabble farm). 
</P>
<P>
 Airing more than 60 years after the quintuplets were born, "Million Dollar 
Babies" can be looked at as a modern-day parable on media hype in its formative 
years. On a more inspirational level, the infants, by their very survival, 
became a symbol of hope to a continent mired in depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges plays Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe, the self-promoting doctor who delivered the 
five girls and became their legal guardian. In his path to celebrityhood, the 
country doctor met President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was interviewed by 
Walter Winchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in Bridges' dressing room, an old recording of Winchell interviewing 
the real Dafoe (the sound is as scratchy as the rough woolen trousers Bridges 
is wearing) is playing. Bridges, a demon for authenticity, is imitating the 
cadences of Dafoe's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Authenticity was much on his mind when he first read the script for the 
$10-million movie. "I didn't know anything about this when i read the script," 
Bridges says. "Didn't even know if it was a true story. Then I got to the bit 
about Quintland and I thought, 'No, that can't be true. They made it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it was all the truth, including an unpleasant truth that the Dionne 
sisters' adoring public didn't know at the time: that they had been virtually 
kidnaped from their parents and were being raised by child-development 
theorists who programmed every moment of their days, tying their hands at night 
so they couldn't touch their genitals. 
</P>
<P>
 When they became adults, they retreated from the world together to live in 
seclusion. None ever married. The three still alive today -- Annette, Cecile 
and Yvonne -- emerged on their 60th birthday last spring to give a single 
well-paid interview to a tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Million Dollar Babies," written by Toronto's Suzette Couture, places the 
story in the context of Canada in the 1930s. French farmers such as Elzire and 
Oliva Dionne were treated by English Canadians much as white Americans of the 
era treated blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an idealistic doctor like Dafoe, Bridges says, thought the French were 
"exotic savages." That's the only way, he says -- still wrestling with the 
complexity of the character -- that Dafoe participated in the "unthinkable" 
crime of "letting the government take away the babies." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't the only player in on the act. Kate Nelligan appears as Helena Reid, 
a famous American radio "sob sister" who saw the quints' media possibilities 
right away. Using her medium, she framed the father as a villain, and when the 
public tired of that, she rehabilitated him and turned her scorn on the good 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal director Christian Duguay (who worked on "Snowbound" for CBS) hired 
two Quebec actors to play the parents. Celine Bonnier, a fearless stage actress 
with an earth-mother presence, says she can relate to her character partly 
through the fact that both have an imperfect understanding of English. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I am tired, and having a hard time understanding English," says Bonnier, 
"I think how it must have been like that for Mrs. Dionne too. It's bad enough 
that she lost her babies, but she lost them to people who spoke a language she 
could hardly understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Dupuis, the drop-dead handsome young star who plays the girls' father 
Oliva, says, "He (Oliva) had no idea what the media could do, and he was hurt 
by the way he was swept aside. Afterward, when he got them back, he tried to be 
a big man too." 
</P>
<P>
 The film compresses the first nine years of the Dionne girls -- from birth to 
the moment their parents finally got them back -- into five years. Partly this 
was because of the daunting task of finding children to play the roles. (After 
a long search, triplets from Minnesota and twins from Quebec were cast as the 
quints.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Dionnes' story seems dark and distressing, but Duguay doesn't see it that 
way. "It's not a hard story at all. It's beautiful: there's greed, for sure, 
but there's also love, faithfulness. You see these children with nothing 
emotionally to cling to, so they survive by clinging to each other. It's an 
inspiring story." 
</P>
<P>
 "Million Dollar Babies" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS and concludes Tuesday at 
9 p.m.

 Regarding "What's the Frequency, Gen X?" by Claudia Puig (Nov. 6): 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's just that Ruben Navarrette and Tavis Smiley haven't been on the 
planet long enough to have developed the perspective and life experiences that 
would make for a more interesting and successful show. 
</P>
<P>
 I've listened to their "Twenty-something Talk" on many occasions.More often 
than not, I find it a tough go. So far, at least to these ears, it's all been 
emotion and grad-school platitudes with little substance. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is their chronic habit of discussing topics only in light of their 
own narrow racial or cultural agendas. Another is a palpable lack of humor, wit 
or whimsy in their manner of speech and interaction with callers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cover shot of the two sums up their show: gruff demeanors and a lot of 
finger-pointing.

 Good article on Smiley and Navarrette. Now let me get this straight: They are 
drawing 6,567 listeners per quarter-hour, and Larry Elders, a black 
conservative, is drawing 33,600 listeners per quarter-hour. Yet liberals Smiley 
and Navarrette get the Calender cover story, not Elders. Why am I not 
surprised?

<P>
 In response to Camille Paglia's "The Real Lesson of 'Oleanna' " (Nov. 6): 
</P>
<P>
 I would feel better about the films "Oleanna" and "Disclosure" if Hollywood 
had first made a movie dramatizing how sexual harassment disproportionately 
preys upon women in subordinate positions to their male harassers. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that when sexual harassment finally hits the big screen in two major 
films, men are portrayed as its primary victims? 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the issue is sometimes complex and ambiguous, and artists like David 
Mamet are justified in probing its fuzzier regions. But given the dearth of 
Hollywood movies with strong female leads and the spate of femme fatale films 
like "Fatal Attraction" and "Basic Instinct," the women's side hasn't been 
given equal time. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I would go so far at to say that the commercial cinema appears to be 
punishing women for sticking up for themselves.

BONE TO PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm sorry that Christopher Knight is tired of lead, bone, glass and the like 
as art materials ("This Critic Has a Bone to Pick," Nov. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like just a few years ago that it was at least acceptable to put 
pencil to paper or paint to canvas, as long as it was done with honesty and 
passion. Now we are being told we have to throw away our clothing, pedestals 
and rust and look for new materials to please the jaded critic. 
</P>
<P>
 While I too deplore cliche, do we really need to be given a list of forbidden 
materials? All this time I thought the message was more important than the 
media.

'THE BEAT' GOES OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every Sunday for 15 years KCRW's "Reggae Beat" played music with messages of 
truth and rights, equality and justice and international brotherhood. In a 
callous decision, station management canceled the show, without warning to its 
faithful listeners (Pop Eye, Oct. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the "African Beat" was also taken off the air. With these 
actions, KCRW has virtually eliminated truly black cultural music from L.A. 
radio, and we are now left with nowhere to turn on the dial for real roots 
reggae. 
</P>
<P>
 To KCRW: Don't deprive this city of one of the last surviving forms of true 
message music at a time when we so desperately need it. Bring back "The Beat"!

<P>
 I am saddened to hear of the demise of "The Reggae Beat," the program that 
introduced me to KCRW more than 10 years ago. Back then I would listen 
zealously to Roger Steffens and Hank Holmes as they played this strange new 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as reggae incorporated the technology of the drum machine and 
won acceptance with the younger hip-hop crowd, it seemed to lose its heartfelt 
groove. 
</P>
<P>
 But I am very thankful for wonderful memories of times spent at the beach with 
the radio tuned to "Jah music" and even more grateful that I have the tapes to 
go along with them.

GOOD SAMARITAN'S SACRIFICE IS MATTER OF THE HEART, NOT HEROISM; CRIME: SHE 
IGNORED HER OWN SAFETY IN A BID TO HELP A WOMAN FLEE AN ARMED ATTACKER. LEFT 
PARALYZED, SHE SAYS IT WAS A 'SMALL PRICE TO PAY.' 
</P>

<P>
 Jaquie Creazzo eases her wheelchair slowly toward a table at a fast-food 
restaurant as her three young daughters scramble about on its multicolored, 
plastic playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lunchtime patrons whisper as she passes. A few approach, shake hands and 
thank Creazzo, "the Good Samaritan" who was shot three times as she tried to 
save a young woman in a desperate race against a gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, Creazzo, 31, of Wheat Ridge, is struggling to live in a body 
paralyzed from the chest down by a bullet lodged in her spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most frustrating thing is just what you've lost personally, like laying 
in bed and having a muscle spasm; your legs not doing the simplest things," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thankfully, I'm still alive. Being paralyzed is a small price to pay to get 
this person, actually if you want to call him a person, off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an extraordinary, selfless attitude for a woman who has overcome obstacle 
after obstacle during her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Creazzo had a difficult childhood after her parents divorced in a bitter 
dispute. She lived with her mother on the East Coast until she was an older 
teen-ager. Then she moved in with her father and they settled in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Creazzo soon married, but she and her husband grew apart and realized they 
would be better off divorced, as friends, sharing custody of the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in my life has been a struggle, and I've had to overcome it," she 
said. "That's what I have done my whole life . . . all I know is to keep 
fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 With sun streaming through the restaurant's glass walls, Creazzo speaks softly 
in a deep voice, recalling how her pre-dawn encounter with Rhonda Maloney on 
Feb. 12 changed her life forever. 
</P>
<P>
 On her way to pick up her father for breakfast, Creazzo's Cadillac rounded a 
freeway ramp curve and illuminated with its headlights two parked cars, one 
with flashers blinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking one vehicle had broken down, Creazzo inched by, but the look on the 
face of a young blond woman standing by the road compelled her to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a choice," Creazzo said. "It was just like there was the need 
and it was written all over her face. There wasn't any question, and I think 
anybody who had been in that situation and seen the intensity on her face would 
have stopped as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Maloney jumped into Creazzo's car, her words tumbling over one another into a 
horrific tale of being run off the road, of being dragged from her car onto the 
frozen ground, of being raped repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 As Creazzo pulled away to get help, she glanced in the rearview mirror and saw 
a man get into the other car. 
</P>
<P>
 The race began. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cars jockeyed for position, their tires fighting for traction on the 
icy road. Creazzo swerved between cars, trying to stay ahead of her pursuer, 
but he gradually gained ground and pulled alongside. 
</P>
<P>
 Creazzo glanced up and saw the window move on the other car and the flash of 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullets smacked into her car and struck her in the knee, mouth and back. 
Bleeding from the wounds, Creazzo fought to maintain control, sparks flying as 
the car scraped the median rail. 
</P>
<P>
 She steered her vehicle across the median and onto the snowy front lawn of the 
Thornton Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Slumped in the front seat, covered with blood and spitting out teeth, Creazzo 
watched as the gunman got out of his car, looked up and down the street and 
walked toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 He dragged Maloney from the car and threw her to the ground. When he reached 
back for Maloney's things, his eyes met Creazzo's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither one of us said anything," she recalls. "It was like a dead stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed like it hung for an eternity. His eyes are so dark and so 
empty and so cold and it was, I don't know, something that will live with me 
forever, probably." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman grabbed Maloney's belongings, picked her up like a rag doll and 
headed for his car. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last time she was seen alive. 
</P>
<P>
 With Creazzo's help, police arrested Robert E. Harlan, 29, within days. He is 
facing trial in January on charges of first-degree murder and assault. 
Maloney's body was found in a water-filled culvert on the prairie east of 
metropolitan Denver a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 As Creazzo fought for her life, her heroism captured the heart of metropolitan 
Denver, which dubbed her "the Good Samaritan." 
</P>
<P>
 Maloney's husband, Kerry, issued a statement that said: "She is a real hero, 
and without her, we never would have known what happened to Rhonda." 
</P>
<P>
 Maloney's family also gave Creazzo a pair of golden hoop earrings with 
guardian angels as a token of their support. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks after the incident, doctors told Creazzo she would never walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 She sought a second opinion; the results were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 She shed tears, denying her fate for a time. Then she resolved to move ahead, 
hoping in her heart to walk again someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Creazzo is learning how to shift from a life without limits to a life 
where everything has limits. 
</P>
<P>
 She now looks at the world from a permanent seated position, learning to 
balance her body all over again and to cope with muscle spasms. "When they 
start, it's like you're fighting your own body," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She now rolls her wheelchair slowly, ever conscious of cracks and bumps that 
could topple her to the ground, helpless. Caution has captured her, 
particularly with her children, Hannah, 12, Elizabeth, 11, and Martha, 9. But 
it has not imprisoned her will. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, she and her daughters were leaving a grocery store when they saw a 
man snatch a shopper's purse. Creazzo and her girls chased the man as far as 
she could in her van but couldn't catch him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we went to help this woman catch the purse snatcher, I couldn't 
really do anything," she said. "So especially where they're concerned, I'm 
fearful about what my limitations in protecting them are." 
</P>
<P>
 Her periods of frustration are balanced by optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 She is looking forward to returning to work as an administrative assistant in 
the fall. And she is teaching her daughters some valuable lessons about life, 
by dismissing her heroism -- recognized by a wall of plaques, medals and 
certificates -- as something for which everyone should strive. 
</P>
<P>
 "These awards don't make me any different," she tells her daughters. "What you 
are has to come from inside, and all the awards and all the medals on the wall 
can't make you. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't make you happy. They can't make you feel good about yourself. You 
have to feel good about yourself already."

WRITER TRACES GRANDMOTHER'S MYSTERY DEATH TO 'OSAGE REIGN OF TERROR'; 'SYBIL 
BOLTON': A REAL-LIFE MURDER STORY, THE BOOK IS PUNCTUATED BY TALES OF INDIAN 
WARFARE. A SAD CHAPTER TELLS HOW HUNDREDS WERE MURDERED FOR THEIR LAND AND OIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH MENDEZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before age 40, all Dennis McAuliffe Jr. knew about Sybil Bolton, his Osage 
maternal grandmother, was that she had attended an East Coast boarding school, 
died alone of kidney disease at age 21 with her infant daughter at her side, 
and was buried in an ermine coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, McAuliffe, a Washington Post foreign editor, unraveled the 
mystery of his American Indian grandmother's murder. He chronicled his 
life-shaking discoveries in his book, "The Deaths of Sybil Bolton, An American 
History," recently published by Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by his son's 1991 birth, McAuliffe traced his grandmother's 1925 
death to the "Osage reign of terror," when hundreds of Osages were murdered by 
white settlers who wanted their land and oil wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son's heritage has placed upon small shoulders a burden so great that a 
mighty nation has been unable to carry it, or chooses not to," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "He must find a way to balance the two sides of himself, to find a place in 
his life for the Indian part of him, which continues to have no place, or part, 
in his society. That is his challenge, and his curse. That is my gift to him." 
</P>
<P>
 McAuliffe, 44, an award-winning journalist who has worked in Europe and Latin 
America, did not set out to rewrite history. However, as he tells his family's 
story, he evokes voices rarely quoted by U.S. historians. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a mystery, the guy always gets his man, and there's always justice, and 
everybody's happy," McAuliffe said during a recent Denver visit. "Well, the 
strings in real life weren't tied. And nobody was happy -- except for the bad 
guys who walked away with the Osage millions." 
</P>
<P>
 A real-life murder mystery, his book is punctuated by tales of Indian warfare, 
Gen. George Custer, Thomas Jefferson, gunfights in Dodge City and haunting 
reflections about six generations of McAuliffe's family, his ethnic identity, 
and his painful experience with alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 As his family story unfolds, he rattles a few beloved perceptions about 
settlers in America's Old West, taking a stark look at one famous illegal 
Kansas squatter -- Pa Ingalls of "Little House on the Prairie" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real Charles Ingalls wore a 2-foot-long vinery of beard. His dark, 
narrow, hard, glassy, chilly, creepy eyes would, a century later, stare out of 
photos of Charles Manson, the Hollywood murderer," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 McAuliffe, described by his sister as "the new Indian storyteller," has no 
qualms about writing the Osage side of the story in what some would deem an era 
of political correctness and historical revisionism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not tell both sides of the story? Why not say that was Osage territory 
and that they were squatting. Why not tell that story? Because it's a very 
one-sided presentation," McAuliffe said about the Ingalls family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does (Pa) have to look like Michael Landon? Why can't he be a hard-eyed 
guy who would absolutely give you the creeps. Because that's what settlers 
looked like. Is that revisionism, or is that being a realist? Is that telling 
an honest story?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get his story, McAuliffe left his comfortable Baltimore home in 1991, 
returning to Pawhuska, Okla., for three months to research the murder scene. He 
also spent three years poring over history books, press reports, birth records 
and FBI documents. He learned Sybil Bolton's death, like the deaths of most 
murdered Osages, was papered over with a false death certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybil's murderer, identified in the end, had powerful reasons to kill the 
beautiful, well-educated young woman. Her birthright included a large annual 
income based on historic tribal oil holdings or "headrights." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1907, each Osage, regardless of age or amount of Osage blood, was given a 
headright worth 657 acres of land in what would become Oklahoma's Osage County. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, Congress had adopted an allotment act for the tribe, not 
realizing Osage land sat atop one of the biggest oil fields in North America 
and the tribe would become the richest ethnic group in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 From the day a 15-year-old McAuliffe learned his grandmother was Osage and had 
died at an early age, he suspected his white grandfather is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 He set out to solve Sybil Bolton's death with that disturbing thought in mind. 
While McAuliffe later vindicated his innocent grandfather, he cannot reconcile 
himself to Harry Bolton's general dislike of Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother would explain to us children that her father's prejudices were 
unfortunate, but not unusual for a man his age who lived in places in the 
Midwest where prejudice grew like the weeds and wildflowers coloring Kansas," 
McAuliffe wrote about Bolton, a Denver resident who died of throat cancer in 
1981 at the age of 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a "card-carrying" Indian journalist, he has undergone an extraordinary 
metamorphosis since identifying with his Osage roots. McAuliffe is an enrolled 
member of the tribe, and has a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood, the 
official Indian identification card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, there's still a lot of distrust in a native gathering, and initially 
with the Osages," McAuliffe said. "Here comes this white guy -- blue eyes, 
brown hair -- he suddenly announces that he's an Osage, and this is after a 
decade or years of white guys coming in, you know, the 'wannabes,' and there's 
some of that. And they held me at arm's length." 
</P>
<P>
 Any doubts he had about whether his book has struck a note with the Osage were 
dispelled during a mid-September talk and book signing in Fairfax, Okla. Dozens 
of Osage and non-Indians showed up, toured murder sites and revealed to a 
stunned McAuliffe their own horror stories about mysterious suicides and 
poisonings in their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "A reconciliation is coming out of this. And, I felt just flabbergasted that 
it had to be me who did this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked around and all those faces of Osages, born and raised and living in 
Osage County and taking part in all the Osage functions. And one of those could 
have been my mother, and should have been my mother," McAuliffe said. "And, 
luckily for me, the Osages agreed with me." Glimpses of Grandmother 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts from "The Deaths of Sybil Bolton, An American History": 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been difficult for me, shaped and surrounded all my life by my 
parents' love, to accept the realization that, to a greater degree, my destiny 
was shaped by hatred manifested in the extreme; that the history I carry within 
me is colored by racial discrimination of the most violent kind -- directed 
against one half of my ancestors by the other half." 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as a father can, I will see to it that my son does not shirk from his 
responsibility by ignoring his true identity -- as I did. If he does, I fear, 
he will be doomed to repeat the upheaval that shook me, literally to my roots. 
That was my grandmother's gift to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "For half of my life -- well, one-third of it now -- I was just an ordinary, 
run-of-the-mill white kid like everyone else I knew, with nothing ethnically 
extra that met the eye, no footnotes to the Great American Success Story that 
my father embodied." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like all American kids, I'm a sucker for Custer stories. My reason, though, 
is different from our national, morbid fascination with Custer's Last Stand. . 
. . I lived in Custer's house. And it was haunted. By Phil Sheridan's wife. 
This story is as juicy as it sounds." 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Laura Ingalls, her sisters and their beloved Ma and Pa were illegal 
squatters on Osage land. She left that detail out of her 1935 children's book 
'Little House on the Prairie,' as well as any mention of ongoing outrages -- 
including killings, burnings, beatings, horse thefts and grave robberies -- 
committed by white settlers, such as Charles Ingalls, against Osages living in 
villages no more than a mile or two away from the Ingalls' little house."

CRISIS-PLAGUED KARACHI TEETERS ON EDGE OF TOTAL BREAKDOWN OF CONTROL; PAKISTAN: 
THE TEEMING CITY IS BESET BY CRIME, UNEMPLOYMENT AND POLITICAL, ETHNIC AND 
RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE.

 When Karachi's top official gets to the office, his sleeves are rolled up, his 
phones are ringing furiously and dozens of men are waiting in the sweltering 
hall to ask urgent favors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no easy days for Faheem Khan as he tries to save one of the world's 
most troubled cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised myself sometimes how the city carries on with all its 
problems," Khan said in an interview with the Associated Press. "We have 
unemployment, crime and pollution. People are chasing each other through the 
streets with guns every day, but the city survives." 
</P>
<P>
 Just barely, many people say. The congested, steamy port with 10 million 
residents has lurched from crisis to crisis in recent years and now a surge in 
political, ethnic and religious violence is threatening to get out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Karachi's woes have scared away foreign investors at a time when international 
money is pouring into Asia and fueling booms in much of the region. Karachi, 
like the rest of Pakistan, has seen little economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 There are gun battles in the streets almost daily. The most serious conflict 
pits security forces against the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, a minority group that 
uses violence, strikes and other confrontational tactics to repeatedly paralyze 
Karachi, Pakistan's business capital and biggest city. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence has killed hundreds of people the past few months and added to 
the general turmoil of a city suffering from frequent power blackouts, high 
unemployment and dawn-to-dusk traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan, 33, was flying a helicopter for an air ambulance service until June, 
when Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto picked him as city administrator, the top 
government post. 
</P>
<P>
 She had wanted Abdul Sattar Edhi, who heads Pakistan's only privately run 
emergency service and is often compared to India's Mother Teresa because of his 
charity work. Edhi declined and suggested Khan, "one of my most trusted 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Khan has no government experience. But some say it is appropriate that a man 
versed in emergency rescues has been put in charge of Karachi. 
</P>
<P>
 The army was called in two years ago to assist Karachi police in trying to 
curb violence that has killed an estimated 4,000 people since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But the troops have not stopped the bloodshed or dampened the popularity of 
the Mohajir movement, which represents Muslims who migrated to Pakistan from 
India when the subcontinent was divided into two nations in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mohajirs account for a majority of Karachi's population, but only about 
10% of Pakistan's 120 million people, and they feel shortchanged by fellow 
Muslims when it comes to jobs, education and political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government does not consider Mohajirs to be sons of the soil," said M.A. 
Jalil, one of the movement's leaders. "They don't feel we have the same rights 
as others." 
</P>
<P>
 Security officers repeatedly round up Mohajir activists, and about 500 are now 
under some form of detention. The figure includes Jalil's wife, Nasreen, a 
senator in the National Assembly who is under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other feuds contributing to the city's disorder. The Mohajir 
movement is itself split into two factions whose members often battle each 
other. Also, followers of the Shiite and Sunni Muslim sects ambush one another 
with regularity, and criminal gangs battle for turf in a city where underpaid 
and poorly trained police have little authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto, who has a house in Karachi's well-to-do Clifton district, expressed 
shock at conditions when she spent a week in the city in July. 
</P>
<P>
 She chastised city officials and announced an aid package, but the federal 
government in Islamabad is chronically broke and few believe any real help is 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Karachi was a modest city of about 100,000 when Pakistan won independence from 
Britain 47 years ago. But a relentless inflow of unskilled migrants from the 
countryside increased the population a hundredfold, overwhelming the city's 
ability to provide services. 
</P>
<P>
 Several million residents live in squalid slums that sprouted throughout the 
city. Social order broke down over the last decade as a tidal wave of guns and 
drugs flowed into Karachi from the civil war in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is burdened by a bloated bureaucracy that many people view as 
incompetent and corrupt. Khan said he has been offered bribes as high as 
$300,000 for government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 He was shocked to discover that only 12 of the city's 54 firetrucks were in 
working order when he took office. He was dumbfounded when he learned the city 
was still paying for 800 full-time firemen -- and many were getting overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how irrational our bureaucracy has become," said Khan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to stay in this job even one day more than necessary," he added. 
"I just want to get back to flying my helicopter."

SCHOLARS CONTINUE TO REVEAL MAO'S MONSTROSITIES; ASIA: EXILED CHINESE 
HISTORIANS EMERGE WITH EVIDENCE OF CANNIBALISM AND UP TO 80 MILLION DEATHS 
UNDER THE COMMUNIST LEADER'S REGIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gong Xiaoxia recalls the blank expression on the man's face as he was beaten 
to death by a Chinese mob. 
</P>
<P>
 He died without a name, becoming another statistic among millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him so vividly, he really had no expression on his face," Gong 
said. "After about 10 or 20 minutes, God knows how long, someone took out a 
knife and hit him right into the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 He was then strung on a pole and left dangling and rotting for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most terrible thing, when I recall that period, the most terrible 
thing that struck me was our indifference," said Gong, today a 38-year-old 
graduate student at Harvard researching her own history. 
</P>
<P>
 That terrible period was China's 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. The blinding 
indifference was in the name of Chairman Mao Tse-tung and the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Gong is among a new wave of scholars and intellectuals, both Western and 
Chinese, who believe modern Chinese history needs rewriting. 
</P>
<P>
 While the focus of many books and articles today is on China's successful 
economic reforms, dramatic new figures for the number of people who died as a 
result of Mao Tse-tung's policies are surfacing, along with horrifying proof of 
cannibalism during the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now believed that as many as 60 million to 80 million people may have 
died because of Mao's policies -- making him responsible for more deaths than 
Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Gong said killer is not a strong enough word to describe Mao. "He was a 
monster," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler's policies led to tens of millions of deaths during World War II and in 
concentration camps, and Stalin is blamed for tens of millions more. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese government figures say between 15 million and 25 million people died 
unnatural deaths during Mao's reign from 1949 until his death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Chinese and Western scholars know those figures are no longer valid. 
One document, published in the Shanghai University journal Society last year -- 
and immediately yanked from shelves -- said 40 million people died during the 
great famine of 1959-1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Some China experts say it is time to move on and put the past to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 But so much new information is coming out about China's recent past that this 
handful of scholars, some of whom recently fled China, feel it must be recorded 
so that future generations will learn from it. Like the relentless scholars of 
the Holocaust, they hope to prevent history from repeating itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the upheavals in the middle of the century, the famine and the 
Cultural Revolution, are still very much locked into the soul of China," said 
Perry Link, a professor at Princeton. "Modern China's not going to find its way 
into the 21st Century unless the Chinese people can feel that they really got 
to the bottom of how such things happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Walder, a Harvard sociologist working with Gong to examine hundreds of 
recently obtained Chinese documents on atrocities during the Cultural 
Revolution, acknowledged that some colleagues feel Mao's failures are old news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most China scholars are not really interested in delving back into those 
issues," Walder said. "I think, with regard to violence with the Cultural 
Revolution, that's what we've done, we've had a sense of complacency." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tian An Men Square pro-democracy movement of 1989 played a role in making 
much of this new information available to the West. The crackdown forced some 
Communist Party members and leading intellectuals to flee the country -- taking 
with them secret documents and new resolve to uncover the truth about how many 
died during Mao's rule, and to tell just how they died. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best-known is Chen Yizi, a Communist Party member who was an 
architect of the economic reforms of the 1980s and founder of several 
government think tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 During the pro-democracy movement in the spring of 1989, Chen urged the 
government to negotiate with the demonstrators. After the tanks rolled and 
untold numbers of people died -- estimates range from about 500 to several 
thousands -- Chen became one of the seven most-wanted -- dead or alive -- 
dissidents in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen, now 54, fled to the United States and founded the Center for Modern 
China, based in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Using smuggled government documents, Chinese population statistics and 
interviews with police and villagers in four Chinese provinces, Chen calculated 
that as many as 43 million people died during the famine that followed Mao's 
absurd industrial campaign, the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth will be much higher than this figure -- believe it," Chen said 
during a recent interview at his Princeton apartment. "The biggest problem for 
the Communist Party is they never learned how to treat human beings like human 
beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Chen believes that, from the Communist takeover in 1949 through the landlord 
and intellectual purges of the 1950s, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural 
Revolution and the prison system, at least 80 million met unnatural deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there's no doubt about it," Chen said. "Americans just can't 
understand that such a thing could happen. Only when I went to the countryside 
did I myself realize the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the provinces Chen visited was Anhui, about 500 miles south of Beijing. 
One official document shows that, in one county alone, 60,245 people died, or 
about 7.7% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 How Mao could be so callous about the millions who pledged their faith in him 
is still a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story of Mao still just isn't known," said Link, a professor of East 
Asian studies at Princeton. "I think he will rank with Stalin and Hitler when 
the dust settles." 
</P>
<P>
 New documents are being made available, and a book has been written by Li 
Zhisui, Mao's personal physician for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Private Life of Chairman Mao," released last month, paints Mao as an 
unfeeling man who refused to be treated for sexually transmitted disease 
despite infecting the many young women who shared his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The memoir describes an imperial court of decadence and ruthless intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mao, a classical poet, knew little about economics. But he insisted on trying 
to lead the country out of the Middle Ages overnight. The masses joined the 
race to increase steel output with back-yard furnaces, believing the Great 
Helmsman would lead them out of their long history of poverty and feudalism. 
</P>
<P>
 But in doing so, farmers left their fields. And having no skills at 
steel-making, the metal was poor quality, and most of it was useless. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first bad harvest, Mao's aides began to warn him of famine. 
</P>
<P>
 After two more poor harvests, the nation was plunged into starvation, forced 
to ration, steal and scavenge for roots and rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mao never admitted that the Great Leap was a failure, although he did step 
aside while top party pragmatists -- including Deng Xiaoping -- rescued the 
country by focusing on agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Wu remembers the Great Famine. During its worst year, 1960, after he 
graduated from college, he was arrested for speaking out at a Communist Party 
Youth League meeting. He spent 19 years in China's labor-reform camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu is a resident scholar at Stanford University who published an account of 
his ordeal in the book "Bitter Winds" last year. He recalls eating rats and 
snakes during the famine to supplement his prison rations, and burying 
countless fellow inmates who starved to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Zheng Yi was one of China's leading contemporary writers before he fled 
Beijing after helping to organize intellectuals during the Tian An Men 
uprising. He arrived at Princeton, a center for many Chinese dissidents, in 
1992 and finished a book about political cannibalism during the Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Red Memorial," to be published in English next year, offers some of the most 
gruesome accounts ever of the Cultural Revolution, which was unleashed by Mao 
in a last-ditch campaign to rejuvenate himself after the famine. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old writer who grew up in Beijing was sent to the countryside for 
the decade of the Cultural Revolution to work on farms and in mining. 
</P>
<P>
 He heard tales of cannibalism, but he couldn't imagine they were true. So he 
and his wife, anthropologist Bei Ming, set off for Guangxi province to 
interview villagers and officials in six counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized it was the most important thing I could do," said Zheng, who wears 
the black-rimmed glasses of a Chinese intellectual. "I read a lot of books 
about Nazi Germany, and I admired the writers who had told the truth -- so I 
felt the need to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He secretly photographed police files and some of the accused killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Zheng's voice softened when he spoke of one 86-year-old man, Yi Wansheng of 
Sixiao village in Zhongshan county, who spoke freely and with pride about 
murdering and dividing up the organs of one young man. 
</P>
<P>
 Deng Jifang had fled his village as a young boy after his brother and father, 
who belonged to the hated landlord class, were killed by the government in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1968, villagers trying to comply with a Red Guard frenzy for rounding 
up "class enemies" hunted down Deng, then 20, in a neighboring village. They 
carried him in a bamboo cage back to Sixiao, where the villagers beat him and 
poked him with hot iron rods until he passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The villagers then carried him to the river, and while he was still alive, Yi 
slit his chest and pulled out Deng's heart and liver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he was a class enemy, it wasn't enough to kill him," Zheng said. "You 
had to eat him. It was a symbol of loyalty to the party." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of not having full access to government documents, Zheng was never 
able to give an accurate number of how many people were cannibalized. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, however, get full access to the archives of Wuxuan county, where 64 
people were eaten in 1968. There, 56 hearts and livers and 13 sets of genitals 
were eaten. Seven people were disemboweled while still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannibalism was practiced in ancient times because some believed human blood 
held medicinal powers. During the Great Famine, it occurred in matters of life 
or death. But this type of political cannibalism was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 As the death toll continues to rise and tales of terrors unfold, former 
prisoner Wu reflects an opinion held by many when they consider Mao: "I don't 
even care about 80 million, 60 million killed. The simple one fact is he's a 
monster, he's evil, he's a ghost, he's nothing but a criminal. The Chinese can 
never forgive him."

AUDITORS WORK TO RECLAIM BRAZIL'S PLUNDERED TREASURY; GRAFT: THEIR MISSION IS A 
NOVEL ONE. THE TEAM IS ATTEMPTING TO KEEP TAXPAYERS' MONEY AWAY FROM CORRUPT 
LEGISLATORS, FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep within the maze of flourescent-lit corridors with dozens of numbered 
cubicles in the Finance Ministry basement, a Brazilian revolution is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers, calculators and printers are humming, clicking and coughing out 
reams of public works contracts, ministry expense sheets, bank statements. It 
is the sound of the government's new scam busters. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission is a novel one in a country riddled by graft: to keep taxpayers' 
money away from corrupt legislators, federal employees and government 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The rot runs deep, from phony farm insurance claims to mayors skimming 
kickbacks from padded public works contracts to legislators channeling treasury 
money to ghost charities run by family members. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $47 billion has been wasted or purloined since 1988, according to a 
10-page treasury report submitted to President Itamar Franco last April. In 
another report, the Federal Accounting Board said a partial audit found that at 
least $2.9 billion vanished the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something had to be done," said Carlos Atila, a director on the accounting 
board. "The government had nearly lost complete control over its own finances." 
</P>
<P>
 From July to September, the new Internal Control Secretariat canceled $16 
million worth of public works contracts because of serious accounting errors, 
said Domingos de Poubel de Castro, head of the auditing team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The frightening thing is that this is just the beginning," said Poubel de 
Castro. "We only monitor 5% of the budget and we've saved $16 million. Imagine 
what we could save if we did more." 
</P>
<P>
 His auditors already are doing more. They discovered municipalities were late 
or never offered receipts for 19,556 of 46,800 federally financed projects. The 
secretariat is moving to cancel those projects, which are worth $122 million, 
Poubel de Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corruption in Brazil is as old as the 16th-Century Portuguese conquest, when 
bribing officials became the way to cut through baroque regulations and 
intricate laws. 
</P>
<P>
 This century's nationalist governments made graft a large-scale enterprise by 
expanding and later centralizing state power in Brasilia -- the newly built 
capital that became an enclave of a vast, coddled bureaucracy on an isolated 
central prairie. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors were brought to Brasilia to keep tabs on the government, but they 
lost touch with the fraud percolating in their home states. 
</P>
<P>
 One favorite was for legislators to peddle fat public works contracts to 
businessmen for kickbacks. The schemes left remote, unpopulated regions dotted 
with white elephants. About $33 billion in half-built bridges, schools, dams 
and roads sit deteriorating across Brazil, according to a 1993 study by SEPLAN, 
a Cabinet-level planning commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1990, President Fernando Collor de Mello took office and, under the 
pretext of reducing a bloated administratiion, fired hundreds of federal 
auditors -- while leaving the rest of the bureaucracy intact. 
</P>
<P>
 When Collor slashed controller salaries from $2,500 a month to $260, hundreds 
more quit. The ranks of people guarding the federal coffers had dropped from 
5,100 to 1,700 a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president basically threw open the doors of the henhouse so the wolves 
could raid it,' said Elvia Castello Branco, president of the Federal Accounting 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, Collor was one of the wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 A congressional investigation found he took at least $6.5 million from an 
influence-peddling ring that extorted bribes and stole federal money to the 
tune of $100 million in his first two years of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten months after Collor resigned in disgrace in December, 1992, another scheme 
unraveled that apparently had enabled dozens of legislators to pocket hundreds 
of millions of dollars since 1989 -- the year Congress won expanded power over 
the budgetary process. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco, Collor's successor, finally acted last July. He created by official 
decree the Internal Control Secretariat -- known as Cisetao -- as part of an 
"institutional revolution" to reduce official waste. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 auditors went to work, and it didn't take long to find suspicious 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 One of their first probes is an investigation into why 51 executive and 
legislative bodies spent millions of dollars citing "secret expenditures for 
national security" without proper congressional authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those agencies are the labor ministry, the National Indian Foundation, 
the education ministry, the public transportation ministry and the land reform 
ministry, government records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of scams goes on and on: a farm insurance fraud totaling $500 
million; a scandal in which judges, lawyers and prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro 
embezzled more than $1 billion in social security funds; a scheme in which 
millions of dollars worth of unemployment compensation was skimmed by agency 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Poubel de Castro admits the Cisetao is far from perfect. Auditors still earn a 
paltry $500 a month, leaving them susceptible to bribes and kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The government aims to increase the Cisetao staff to 7,000. But it will take a 
lot of money and at least two to three years to train new auditors, Poubel de 
Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The president-elect, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said he will reorganize 
Cisetao after he takes office Jan. 1 so the bulk of the staff will monitor 
federal projects directly in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state apparatus cannot be a parasite any longer," said Poubel de Castro.

LAUNDERING DRUG MONEY IN A SYSTEM OF SILENCE; SMUGGLING: THE CALI CLIMATE OF 
ACQUIESCENCE MAKES IT EASY TO CHANNEL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN PROFITS 
INTO LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES, BANK ACCOUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sabina Prieto doesn't mind when drug dealers and their bodyguards in fancy 
cars stop by her hot dog stand. She's happy to be making good money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at their faces," said Prieto, who has sold snacks for 20 years 
in a park overlooking Cali's office towers and Spanish colonial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not alone. In a city that is home to traffickers who supply 80% of the 
world's cocaine, many people -- from street vendors to bank executives -- do 
business without asking too many questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The climate of acquiescence makes it easier for the Cali drug cartel to 
launder money, channeling billions of dollars a year in profits into legitimate 
businesses and bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cali is not alone in turning a blind eye to money laundering. The 
Colombian government has until now also largely ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 Laundering drug money is not even a crime in Colombia. A congressional 
commission is just now considering a bill that would make it one. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently emerged from a bloody war with drug traffickers, Colombia's 
government is on a new battleground. Instead of helicopter-borne soldiers 
raiding hide outs and shooting it out with traffickers, investigators are 
looking at accounting ledgers and financial statements, trying to find the "hot 
money" mixed in with the legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in a very initial stage," Prosecutor General Alfonso Valdivieso 
said in a press interview in his office in Bogota, the capital. "We have to 
recognize that we reacted very late. We lost time." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty officials at the prosecutor general's office are just starting a course 
in finance to learn more about cartel money. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartel leaders are worried that a crackdown on money laundering will cripple 
their business, said a cartel associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cali cartel is a more shadowy foe than the Medellin cartel, which fought 
the state with car bombs and assassins until security forces gunned down its 
leader, Pablo Escobar, last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Cali cartel are low-key businessmen with roots in industry and 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 After smuggling drugs out of Colombia, they smuggle cash back in, sometimes in 
boxes or suitcases. Traffickers, sinking their drug money into legitimate 
enterprises, are causing this city of 1.7 million people that sprawls at the 
base of a green Andean mountain range to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricey cars zip along broad boulevards, past whole blocks that are under 
construction or renovation. Chic boutiques and trendy nightspots abound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Harley fever at the moment," crowed a salesman at Harleymania, where the 
U.S.-made motorcycles sell for up to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. law enforcement official who tracks drug money said drug profits are 
contributing to the construction boom in Cali and other Colombian cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge of money laundering in Colombia is converting large amounts of 
U.S. dollars into Colombian pesos that are harder to trace. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug profits are most risky for the traffickers when they are still in 
dollars. A cartel associate carrying a large amount of dollars can be more 
easily tied to his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the cash enters a business or bank account and mixes with legitimate 
money, it is harder to trace. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffickers often avoid scrutiny by doing business with legitimate Colombian 
brokers and other businessmen whose capital is unlikely to be challenged by 
authorities. They invest in real estate and construction, car dealerships and 
even a hospital, always using front men. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would never be able to affix any of these projects or buildings with a 
drug trafficker," said the U.S. law enforcement official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. "They always have other people do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffickers use other gambits as well, sometimes buying cars in the United 
States and selling them in Colombia for the same price or lower. They may lose 
money, but they gain local currency that will not arouse suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery winners have even been asked to exchange their peso jackpots for 
larger sums of U.S. dollars, the cartel associate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Colombian laws allow authorities to investigate the origin of 
someone's wealth, they are not well enforced, said Francisco Thoumi, director 
of the Center for International Studies at the University of the Andes in 
Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians are reluctant to crack down on money laundering because they 
are also guilty of financial wrongdoing, Thoumi said.

CHEMICAL SENSITIVITY DRIVES WOMAN INTO WILDS; HEALTH: SHE SAYS THE FRESH AIR ON 
HER WIND-SWEPT RIDGE IS LETTING HER SLOWLY RECOVER FROM A DEBILITATING 
AFFLICTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Like Thoreau, Peggy Magidson went to the woods because she wished to live 
simply. But she was driven by chemistry, not philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as autumnal nights chill to the 20s, Magidson lives in a campsite at 
Frosty Acres Campground, about 20 miles west of Albany in the agrarian hills 
above the Mohawk Valley. Swaddled in 12 layers of cotton clothing, she sleeps 
in a hammock strung under hemlocks and beeches. She crawls into a small tent 
when nights are frigid. 
</P>
<P>
 She has taken refuge here from the ubiquitous chemicals of the civilized 
world. Like the tuberculosis patients who fled to the pine-scented air of the 
Adirondacks a century ago, Magidson says the fresh air on her wind-swept ridge 
is letting her slowly recover from a debilitating affliction called Multiple 
Chemical Sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day I'm president of a company, the next I'm a derelict on the street," 
said Magidson, 43, who ran a telemarketing firm from her New York City 
apartment until the illness struck three years ago and left her unable to enter 
her home or any other building without becoming violently ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock," she said. "I spent three nights wandering the streets. I 
felt like something between an animal and a guerrilla warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, now under study by the Environmental Protection 
Agency, is a controversial ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors say it's psychological. And among those who consider it a 
physical disorder, there is disagreement over what causes it, how to define it, 
and how to treat it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some new syndrome to gain medical credibility, there has to be some 
scientific research done on it," said Dr. Kelley Brix, a chemical exposure 
expert for the state Health Department. "So far, there hasn't been much 
research done on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates like Mary Lamielle, president of the National Center for 
Environmental Health Strategies in Voorhees, N.J., say the illness afflicts 
between 15% and a third of the population, with varying severity. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms are triggered by perfumes, cigarette smoke, car exhaust, photocopier 
ink, pesticides, mold, plastics, carpeting, polyester, dry cleaning chemicals, 
floor wax and other common substances. 
</P>
<P>
 They include wheezing, sinusitis, sore throats, headaches, rashes, nausea, 
dizziness, fatigue and impaired memory and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The medical community has been trying to discredit this," said Lamielle, 
herself a sufferer. "But the trend among researchers is that there does appear 
to be a physiological basis, although there may be psychological aspects as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a mossy rock in the woods, Magidson looks like a pale Gypsy. Her 
fair skin is lined and at times blotched with red. Her hair, the soft silver of 
a squirrel's tail, brushes shoulders wrapped in a ragged beige-and-salmon 
Navajo print cotton blanket. Her lean body is layered with flannel shirts, 
sweaters, bleach-stained dungarees and worn leather shoes with broken, knotty 
laces. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothing, as well as the pile of towels Magidson sleeps on, is faded from 
elaborate cleansings in bleach, vinegar and baking soda. 
</P>
<P>
 She stays at least 10 feet from any visitor. She dons a filter mask if someone 
is wearing perfume, or if she has to go into the nearby restroom and shower 
cabin or the campground office. She asks an interviewer to write with a pencil, 
because ink makes her ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxygen tanks sit propped against a tree stump in case she has breathing 
difficulty. The only furniture is a metal folding chair and a picnic table 
piled with supplies beneath a rain tarp. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow leaves drift into cases of bottled water and caffeine-free Coke, 
staples of Magidson's special diet, which includes boiled lamb, brown rice and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be a fashionable executive lady, with designer dresses and high 
heels," she said, laughing at her Bohemian appearance. "This is not a lifestyle 
I chose. It's what I have to do to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from St. Louis, Magidson went to the University of Michigan and 
then the School of Visual Arts in New York. She worked as a photo stylist, 
setting up fanciful tableaux for ads, before she started a telemarketing firm 
specializing in the environmental cleanup industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a polished professional. One of the most dynamic people I know," said 
James Trillinger, owner of a New York City telemarketing firm that 
subcontracted work from Magidson. 
</P>
<P>
 Her reverse metamorphosis from urban social butterfly with a growing business 
to hermit cocooned in cotton in the woods began in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hit with a biological and a chemical contaminant in my co-op 
apartment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending more than $30,000 to have private testing laboratories 
investigate, the contaminants were identified, she says. She won't specify them 
publicly, however, because she has filed lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The toxic exposure caused damage that left her extremely sensitive to a wide 
range of common substances, said Magidson and her physician, Dr. Steven Colby, 
chief of infectious diseases at Brooklyn Interfaith Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't see straight. My sense of balance was off, like I was walking on 
Jell-0," she said. "I had a raspy cough, burning in my lungs and nasal 
passages, and a wild, crazy heartbeat. And it did something weird to my sense 
of smell, like it was super-magnified." 
</P>
<P>
 Having abandoned her contaminated belongings, given up her business because 
she could no longer run it and spent all her money on doctors and 
investigators, Magidson was dependent on charity. 
</P>
<P>
 She lived in a friend's apartment for two years, in a "safe room" sealed from 
irritating chemicals. When floor-care products in that building made her sick, 
she appealed to her friend John Fridholm, who let her set up a metal shed on 
his lakeside property near Schenectady. 
</P>
<P>
 "She lived outside here for a while, and was making progress," Fridholm said. 
"But then the town came by spraying malathion for mosquitoes, and she had to 
flee." 
</P>
<P>
 Magidson, who is on welfare, has asked the Schenectady County Department of 
Social Services to provide her with a trailer furnished to specifications in a 
82-page statement on her medical condition from Colby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked into special housing, but there is no provision in our 
regulations," said Richard Staszak, the social services commissioner.

A DISASTER WHEN BOSTON DOCTOR PACKS HIS BAGS; MEDICINE: TOM DURANT'S PASSPORT 
AND VISA PHOTOS ARE ALWAYS CLOSE AT HAND IN CASE HE'S NEEDED AT A REFUGEE CAMP 
OR IN A WAR ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For Boston physician Tom Durant, vacations are almost always a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda, Bosnia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kurdistan, Cambodia, Vietnam 
-- whenever catastrophe strikes, wherever refugees flee across borders and 
crowd into camps, wherever hapless civilians are starving, dying by the 
roadside from cholera, mutilated by land mines, Durant is sure to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 When calamity calls, he puts in for vacation time, dons his lucky Red Sox 
baseball cap and heads off to volunteer his clinical skills, his infectious 
humor and his steely immunity to despair built up during three decades of a 
unique problem practice around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 House calls on the homeless and the helpless are his prescription for 
anesthetizing "the Mickey Mouse of medical bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether in a dusty tent hospital on the border of Cambodia or Rwanda or in the 
antiseptic tiled corridors of the Massachusetts General Hospital, where he is 
assistant director, this stocky, nearly bald medical missionary would never be 
mistaken for Dr. Albert Schweitzer. And his M-A-S-H-type humor and blunt 
vocabulary would surely startle the newest of Mother Teresa's novices, as it 
sometimes does to veteran nurses and high-tech lab types. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc Durant, as he is usually called, except in Vietnam where he gloried in the 
title of "Tommy Tongue Depressor," looks and often sounds like a 
battle-scarred, overage rugby player, which at 66 he still is, to the 
consternation of his wife Fredericka. 
</P>
<P>
 A founding member of the Beacon Hill Rugby Club, he still competes in the 
dinosaur division, for players over age 35. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a hooker," Doc grinningly confessed over coffee and bagels in his office 
at Massachusetts General. "The hooker is the guy in the middle who hooks the 
ball out of the scrum, the huddle, while everyone piles on. So in refugee 
situations you're used to being buried under burdens of chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 The office is decorated with photographs he has taken of rice paddies in 
Cambodia, a sampan on the Mekong River in Southeast Asia, sunrise in Somalia, 
wood fires front-lighting a smoldering volcano in Rwanda, a stone bridge 
recently blown away from the Bosnian landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Also there's a rugby poster from the world championship at Twickenham, 
England, a helmet liner "liberated from an Iraqi militiaman" and some 
literature not found in your average doctor's office: a pamphlet on putting the 
pieces together in Northern Ireland, a treatise on the proliferation of 
anti-personnel mines around the world, the annual report of the American 
Refugee Committee, under whose auspices he has treated the forsaken on three 
continents over the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing the catastrophes he has witnessed is a grim compilation of mankind's 
inexhaustible inhumanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afghanistan had the most refugees, over 5 million," he begins. "Many had been 
maimed by the millions of land mines planted by the Soviets. Their planes 
dropped butterfly bombs, disguised as copies of the Koran, which kids often 
picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kurdistan produced nearly a million refugees. Cambodia has just repatriated 
the last of its refugees. One Thai border camp became the second-largest 
Cambodian city." 
</P>
<P>
 Durant has made 14 trips to Cambodia since House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill 
dispatched him in 1979 to assess the refugee situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plane was one of the first to land in Phnom Penh after Pol Pot took 
over," Durant said. "The city once had a war-swollen population of 2 million, 
but there was no one around. We saw about 1,000 Vietnamese soldiers, a total of 
two trucks and eight Russian limos carrying government officials, but no more 
than 20 Cambodians. An empty city, ghostly silent." 
</P>
<P>
 In those crowded camps over the next decade the silence was broken by 
"harrowing stories we kept hearing about the killing fields. The horror 
continues. Land mines planted years ago claim 1,000 new victims a month: 
farmers digging their fields, kids bringing the cattle home. One out of every 
230 Cambodians is an amputee." 
</P>
<P>
 Somalia he regards as "by far the most dangerous. Shortly after we left in 
January four Indian doctors were killed at the hospital. There is more random 
gunfire than any place in the world. Your rented four-wheel drive comes 
equipped with a 15-year-old on the roof with a .30-caliber machine gun and a 
12-year-old in the back cradling an AK-47. You realize their job is to protect 
the vehicle, not you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands starved to death every day in a schizophrenic nightmare where a 
mile away there was a market with fresh vegetables and camel meat. But the 
people had no money. Sooner or later all refugee situations deteriorate. The 
guys with the guns get a disproportionate share of the food and try to make a 
buck while the very young and the very elderly die. Most of the gunmen were 
spaced out on chat, a mind-bending drug flown in daily from the slopes of Mount 
Kenya because it must be chewed fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia, Durant says, "was a completely different ballgame. Refugees in 
business suits and sports jackets who had lost everything: home, family, 
workplace. We scavenged for usable medical supplies in the ruins of seven 
hospitals blown away by the former Yugoslav Army. In Somalia, the deaths were 
the result of chaotic indifference. In Bosnia, they were premeditated and 
genocidal." 
</P>
<P>
 But of all his experiences, "nothing matched the horror and magnitude of 
Rwanda. The number of dead in a short time was greater than any other place: 
60,000 to 70,000 from cholera alone. At Goma, across the border in Zaire, 
corpses lined one side of the road, market stalls the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were lucky enough to have a family, you got wrapped in a burial cloth. 
Otherwise, if you were off fetching water or firewood, you just died where you 
collapsed from massive dehydration. You can lose one-third of your body weight 
in two days to cholera's devastating diarrhea." 
</P>
<P>
 In Goma, Durant witnessed his "first murder. I saw a thief hacked to death in 
15 seconds in the marketplace by four strokes of a merchant's panga, the 
African machete. The first cut his scalp off, then two ripped apart his chest 
and the last was to the neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Far from Massachusetts General's computerized scanners and the latest laser 
technology, the Boston physician often finds himself practicing the most 
primitive brand of preventive medicine. "Even in the grimmest situation," he 
insists, "there is always something worth doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Four retired firemen from San Francisco and one from San Diego saved more 
lives in Goma than all the doctors put together, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They loaded two pumper trucks onto a C-5 cargo plane, put their hoses into 
Lake Kivu, after clearing the corpses away from the intake, and brought 300,000 
gallons of fresh water a day to the camp 10 miles away. Clean drinking water 
was essential in replacing cholera's enormous body loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can drink, you can save yourself. Our own niche was organizing 
outreach teams to bring a replacement solution of sugar, salt and water to 
people in the remote huts too weak to walk to the clinic. In two weeks we 
inoculated 100,000 kids against measles, polio and tetanus, 10,000 of them were 
unaccompanied minors whose parents had died in that terrible tribal slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Durant, who has taught at Harvard, Tufts and Boston University medical 
schools, helped launch a massive 10-year training program in Cambodia. All the 
native doctors had been killed by -- or had fled from -- the Khmer Rouge who, 
in their zeal to eliminate the educated elite, targeted for death anyone 
wearing eyeglasses. Young refugees with no formal education were trained in the 
camps to give inoculations, run tuberculosis clinics, instruct midwives, even 
perform surgery and amputations on those mutilated by land mines. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Durant's carefully controlled demeanor of "detached involvement" was 
stretched to the breaking point one afternoon in Somalia. "We try not to eat in 
the camps because they have so little," he said. "I was sitting in the cab of a 
truck with two small bananas. I stripped one and threw the peel out the window. 
A little kid picked it up and wolfed it down. Obviously, he got the other 
banana. It blew me away for the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of becoming a doctor came to Durant when as a young soldier on 
occupation duty in Korea just after World War II he saw thousands of homeless, 
emaciated children foraging for food in trash cans. After graduating from 
Georgetown medical school and doing his residency at Boston's City Hospital, he 
hung his shingle in the Dorchester neighborhood where he was born and still 
lives in a 100-year-old house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The practice consisted mostly of relatives, medical students from City 
Hospital and some black patients," he recalled. "It wasn't very lucrative but 
it was lots of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He went to Vietnam in July, 1966, and for two years was Saigon's public health 
adviser. Durant's office in the ornate old city hall built by the French backed 
up on the mayor's. The mayor was a Vietnamese physician and also a neurotic 
alcoholic who rolled a grenade around on his desk and kept threatening to blow 
away his problems. One day after a long wet lunch, the mayor unholstered his 
pistol and proceeded to shoot the numbers off on the clock hanging on his side 
of their mutual wall. 
</P>
<P>
 This writer first met Durant in a Catholic cemetery on the far side of the "Y" 
bridge over the Saigon River. Hundreds of refugee families were living under 
tarpaulins and scraps of parachute cloth hung between the gravestones. At a 
clinic under an awning stretched between the outspread wings of a stone 
guardian angel, Durant was clowning and laughing with the bedraggled urchins 
lining up to be examined. He fitted his Red Sox cap on one bawling moppet and 
allowed another to tune in on his stethoscope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy Tongue Depressor demonstrates his tomb-side manner," joked his pal Mike 
McGrath, a burly ex-Marine from Boston who had come back to Vietnam with the 
U.S. aid program. The name stuck. So did Durant's enthusiasm for disaster 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Durant has always been too busy to play with what he laughingly dismisses as 
"doctor's toys." He has never belonged to a country club, owned a yacht or gone 
on a safari. He counts his rewards in the "incredible people you get to work 
with, real pros who can keep things in perspective and never lose their sense 
of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last five years Durant has been battling prostate cancer with a 
bravura toughened by tackling the roughest rugby opponents. "Running off to 
those terrible places is what keeps him going," said wife Fredericka.

PRAIRIE TOWN HOLDS OUT HAND TO INDONESIANS; KANSAS: AS MANY AS 3,000 ASIANS 
COULD BE LIVING IN GARDEN CITY. THEY ENJOY ACCEPTANCE FROM THE TOWN'S LONGTIME 
RESIDENTS, INCLUDING THE HISPANICS WHO'VE BEEN THERE FOR DECADES. 
</P>

<P>
 For many Indochina refugees, this windy town on the Kansas prairie has been a 
way station in their journey to a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, they begin their earning lives in America. Here, their children learn 
English and arithmetic and discover the lure of television. And here, they find 
acceptance from the town's 24,000 longtime residents, including the Hispanics 
who've been an integral part of Garden City for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our community has grown to accept diversity because we're used to it," state 
Rep. David Heinemann says. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate as many as 3,000 Asian refugees -- Vietnamese, Cambodian, 
Laotian and Hmong -- could be living in Garden City, located about 200 miles 
west of Wichita, enticed by what one calls the "refugee rumor network." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Iowa Beef Packing and Monfort packing plants, which employ a 
total of about 4,000 people, the town has had a sizable Asian refugee 
population since the early 1980s. They join the approximately 6,000 Hispanics 
who arrived decades ago for railroad and field work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tough job, big pay," Roger Vilaysing, executive director of the Southeast 
Asian Mutual Assistance Assn., says of the packing plants, where starting wages 
are $6.80 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Asian families stay for three to five years, until they've saved some 
money, and then move on, often to Texas, Louisiana and California, places with 
climates similar to Southeast Asia. But some depart for climates as cold as 
Kansas, if there's the promise of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Georg Anh Nguyen, owner of the Kim Nhung Market, put down roots 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this job," Nguyen says as he loads his freezer with fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen worked in a packing plant for four years in the mid-1980s before 
opening the store, which sells a variety of Asian products, from rice noodles 
and canned quail eggs to tea sets and Chinese soap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The refugee numbers have declined over the years," said Levita Rohlman of the 
Catholic Refugee Services, noting that there are fewer refugees leaving 
Indochina. "(But) we still have a basic refugee community here. We have people 
constantly coming and people constantly moving out." 
</P>
<P>
 Vilaysing, a former Laotian bomber pilot, says many among the newest wave of 
Asians don't come directly from overseas refugee camps but from other 
resettlement areas, such as California, where jobs for the unskilled are few. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are veterans of the prison camps, sometimes called re-education camps, 
that opened after the fall of Saigon in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Suong Nguyen and his wife, Nuong, have settled into a sparsely furnished 
mobile home they share with another couple. They have a television and a VCR 
and watch Vietnamese movies, or Chinese movies translated into Vietnamese, 
rented from the Kim Nhung Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, educated in French schools, served as a captain in the Vietnamese army 
before the fall of Saigon and spent six years in a prison camp. His wife was an 
elementary schoolteacher until 1993, when they left Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, both are employed at the IBP plant, where workers wearing hard hats, 
earplugs, stainless steel mesh gloves and chain-mail aprons slaughter, skin, 
gut and trim cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the most dangerous jobs in Kansas, and the industry long has 
relied on immigrant labor, from as far back as the 1906 publication of Upton 
Sinclair's novel "The Jungle," about Polish and Lithuanian workers at Chicago 
packing plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuong Nguyen said through a translator that she'd like to learn enough English 
to give up her job and become a teacher's aide. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband study every morning at the adult education center before 
going to work, and dream of buying a house some day. 
</P>
<P>
 In downtown Garden City, at the adult education class, Jessie Palacios paces 
around the room, giving dictation to about 20 students -- mostly Asian -- 
ranging in age from 17 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees will take three years to learn what she calls "survival English," and 
five years before being able to converse without prompting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They struggle with it. I know these people are tired," Palacios said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the school district, which is almost half-minority, with Hispanic students 
outnumbering Asians, children work just as hard. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 a.m., students at Victor Ornelas Elementary start crowding through the 
doors to eat breakfast or sit on the floor and talk. They speak English, 
Spanish, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian or Thai. A few speak Hmong, the 
language of the mountain people in Laos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let them know it's all right if you don't speak English," said Roxie 
Thompson, director of the English as a second language program. "We pull 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Asians began arriving, some residents worried about a conflict with 
Hispanics, but businessman Jack Ramos-Needham, a member of the Kansas Hispanic 
Commission, says the two groups have little contact, apart from work and 
school, and that trouble is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people thought a lot of negative things would happen. What helped is 
there were sufficient numbers where they effectively had their own community," 
Heinemann, the state representative, says of the Asian immigrants.

BRITISH JACKPOT SWELLS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So many hope to beat the 14 million-to-1 odds against winning Britain's first

SNIPER'S BULLET ENDS SUNNY STROLL FOR 7-YEAR-OLD

<P>
 On a mild autumn day, with sunshine highlighting fading leaves, 7-year-old 
Nermin Divovic's life came to a sudden end when a sniper's bullet pierced his 
skull as he strolled with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's mother, Dzenana Sokolovic, was wounded in the sniper attack Friday 
along the notorious thoroughfare dubbed Sniper Alley.Two people were wounded in 
sniper attacks earlier in the day, as thousands of Sarajevans turned out to 
enjoy the autumn sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nermin, his mother and two companions were walking down a relatively safe 
section of the street, when they paused briefly to chat with a foreign 
television crew. Then they made the dangerous dash across an open intersection. 
Suddenly, the crackle of gunfire rang out, and Nermin fell on the sidewalk in a 
pool of blood. A second round hit his mother in the stomach. Other people ran 
for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The government estimates nearly 17,000 children -- Serbs, Croats and Muslims 
-- have been killed in the 2 1/2-year-old war.

COFFEE SHOP TRIGGERS OLYMPIAN PROTEST; NEW YORK: OLYMPIC RESTAURANT NAME 
OFFENDS USOC. COMMITTEE ACCUSES GREEK IMMIGRANT AND HIS 10-TABLE EATERY ON THE 
LOWER EAST SIDE OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At 44, Spiros Nakos can't run very fast or jump that high. But the U.S. 
Olympic Committee is after him anyway -- because his coffee shop is called the 
Olympic Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC has accused the Greek immigrant and his 10-table eatery on the Lower 
East Side of copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do this to abuse the name and make money," Nakos said, standing 
alongside his freshly baked muffins. "I do it because I believe in this -- the 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 In a pair of letters sent in October to Nakos' graffiti-scrawled restaurant, 
the USOC warned the immigrant entrepreneur to discontinue the unauthorized use 
of the word "Olympic." 
</P>
<P>
 The letters arrived 14 years after Nakos opened his coffee shop, which 
features a neon sign promising "The World's Best Coffee" and a picture of the 
owner with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 USOC spokesman Mike Moran said Nakos is just one of approximately 40,000 
businesses that received similar letters this year for using Olympic insignias 
and terminology. The USOC uses these symbols to generate revenue. By allowing 
people to use this name without their consent, it loses out on money. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran was unsure how the USOC found out about Nakos' restaurant, which caters 
to a small but loyal clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a tuna sandwich, one patron, high school teacher Victor Acevedo, said: "I 
support him. He's not some big shot. He's just a guy trying to make a decent 
living." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakos arrived in the United States in 1972 with $30 in his pocket. His version 
of the American dream came true: Nakos and his wife had three children, he 
became a citizen, and by 1980, he'd saved enough to open his own restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to call it the Olympic Restaurant, paying homage to his native 
land, and included the five Olympic rings on its sign. "I feel like an Olympian 
when I get up in the morning and run over here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Moran, only those companies that pay the USOC a merchandising 
or copyright fee can translate that feeling into anything more tangible. 
</P>
<P>
 Trademark attorney Mark H. Sparrow of New York City said Nakos faces 
significant legal hurdles because of a 1978 federal law granting the USOC sole 
control of the word "Olympic" and the five rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran said the USOC will contact Nakos "and talk with him about where we might 
go from here." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't seek to destroy businesses or individuals," Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only want to save the name," Nakos said. "Do you know what the Olympics 
mean to the Greeks? It goes back 5,000 years."

STRICKEN BABIES GET QUILTS FROM UNKNOWN FRIENDS; MISSION: VOLUNTEERS ARE 
SENDING SIMPLE PARTING GIFTS TO DOOMED INFANTS AROUND THE WORLD. THEIR GOAL IS 
TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO EASE THE SUFFERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They are the forgotten ones, and they number in the thousands -- babies soon 
to die of AIDS, fetal alcohol syndrome or complications from crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 But for six years now, a small volunteer group has been doing what it can to 
ease their suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 From a basement room at an Episcopal mission, off a rural road in New 
Hampshire, the volunteers send simple parting gifts of quilts to comfort dying 
babies all over the world in their final days. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Ahlgren, 74, a mental health counselor, started At-Risk Babies Crib 
(ABC) Quilts at home when she became aware of thousands of neglected AIDS 
babies in U.S. hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The project later moved to the mission basement where the quilts are sorted 
and sent to infants in many countries. 
</P>
<P>
 No one takes a salary. "The reward is greater than money," said Ahlgren. "The 
reward is the feeling of doing something worthwhile. It's an opportunity to 
give love to people and get love back and you can't beat that." 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 coverlets in pastel colors are stacked on tables, waiting to be 
checked for stray pins before shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC has sent out more than 160,000 quilts so far, including 1,700 to Romania, 
400 to Bosnia and 152 to Russia in 1991. "We try to do one new country each 
year," said Ahlgren. This year, quilts may go to Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The quilts are sent to the mission from across the United States, England, 
Germany, Australia and Japan. As computers and phones hum in the background, 
Ahlgren fluffs out one of 30 quilts made by students at Hokusei Gakuen Girls' 
High School in Japan. One square reads, "Love Love Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahlgren has seen only two of the thousands of babies who have received the 
gifts. When she took the first six coverlets to Boston City Hospital in 1988, 
she saw two babies stricken with AIDS. Ever since then, the identities of the 
infants who receive the quilts have been kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 But she does hear back from hospital administrators and occasionally a parent, 
about the solace the quilts have brought. Recently, a child named Andre died, 
wrapped in one of ABC's quilts, in his mother's arms at the New Hampshire State 
Hospital in Concord. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother said she would cherish that quilt forever," Ahlgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC began as a project to help babies with AIDS, but in 1991 Ahlgren learned 
of babies with other afflictions and changed the name from AIDS to At-Risk 
Babies Crib. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, the number of 
babies diagnosed with AIDS in the United States has totaled 5,095 from the time 
CDC tracking started in 1981 to June, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are only babies diagnosed as having AIDS. "There are probably thousands 
more out there infected with HIV," the AIDS virus, said CDC spokesman Tom 
Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no accurate figures on the number of crack cocaine babies and the 
CDC does not require their statistics to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC views itself as an AIDS education project. It hopes schoolchildren making 
quilts for the project will talk more openly about AIDS prevention. It has 
distributed 12,000 copies of a children's quilt-making book with a section on 
AIDS.

 The students meet surreptitiously -- at a restaurant off campus, or for a 
drive in the countryside. The arrangements, says one participant, would never 
be made on a campus phone. 
</P>
<P>
 They are outlaws. If they are found out, they face suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 They are fraternity brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-sex social organizations have been banned at Middlebury College, so the 
brothers of Delta Kappa Epsilon have gone underground. No boisterous beer 
bashes for them. No Animal House, either -- in fact, they're barred from using 
their own house. 
</P>
<P>
 Just furtive meetings. And a will to keep the Dekes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fraternity brothers have been my closest friends," said Michael Cohen of 
Boca Raton, Fla., who graduated from Middlebury in May. "Most of my great times 
at Middlebury have been with Delta Kappa Epsilon and not Middlebury (College). 
. . . It's a tradition that shouldn't die." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone agrees. To some students and college administrators, 
traditional fraternities are outmoded institutions that promote sexism and 
inequality. And they have become associated with alcohol abuse and hazing 
episodes in which students have died. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of New England's elite private colleges have banned them outright, 
including Middlebury, where the fraternities led college social life for 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The official end of the fraternity system at this liberal arts college of 
about 2,000 students began in 1989, when a study of student life concluded the 
all-male fraternities were incompatible with college life. Sororities 
disappeared on their own in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The study coincided with a series of embarrassing incidents, including one in 
which a female mannequin was suspended in effigy from the front of a fraternity 
house during a raucous party. 
</P>
<P>
 College trustees voted unanimously in 1990 to ban single-sex social 
organizations. Some fraternities opted to admit women and became part of the 
college's new social house system, which replaced fraternities as the center of 
social life. Others dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Kappa Epsilon refused. "We know men. We don't know women's issues," said 
David Easlick, executive director of the fraternity's national office in Grosse 
Point, Mich. "It would be a totally different experience." 
</P>
<P>
 They fought the ban in court and lost. Middlebury students have not been 
prohibited from belonging to fraternities. But they cannot participate in any 
fraternity activities whatsoever, even off campus on their own time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the conduct of every organization is defensible," said Don 
Wyatt, Middlebury's vice president for undergraduate affairs. "I think 
(fraternity activity) is contrary to what our mission is." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt said anyone caught violating the rules would be suspended. "It would be 
swift and severe." 
</P>
<P>
 This has not deterred the underground frats, though Wyatt insisted that their 
activities are "greatly exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly natural thing in the death cycle of fraternities," said Jim 
Kolesar, spokesman for Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., where 
single-sex fraternities were banned in 1968 and underground fraternities 
flourished for years, but have since -- apparently -- died out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected there would be underground activity and there was," said William 
R. Cotter, president of Colby College in Waterville, Me., which banned 
fraternities in 1984. He said the influence of the secret fraternities was 
waning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mastrangelo, a 1992 Colby graduate, spent all four years in college as 
an underground member of Delta Kappa Epsilon there. He said there are now five 
fraternities and one sorority operating underground at Colby. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find people in underground chapters who take their frats very seriously," 
Mastrangelo said. "In a school where you know you can be expelled, you have to 
be dedicated." 
</P>
<P>
 At colleges where underground life is strong, fraternities have re-established 
ties with national organizations, found ways to bring in new members and carry 
out secret initiation rituals and rites. 
</P>
<P>
 At Colby, instead of a much publicized "rush" to attract new members, they 
investigate prospects and then "tap" them secretly. 
</P>
<P>
 At Middlebury, the Dekes say they and at least two other fraternities are 
learning clandestine survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing the college administration, no Deke returning to Middlebury this year 
was willing to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent graduates described a skeletal organization where their lives were 
ruled by fear that an overheard whisper or an errant letter could lead to their 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen and others say that the school administration waged a "witch hunt," 
tapping phones and intercepting mail in pursuit of the outlaw frat brothers. 
Administrators dismiss the charges as laughable. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the Dekes met through most of the first semester. But beyond that 
they decided the risk of continuing was too great and they stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was they would begin again this fall -- though like revolutionaries 
who compartmentalize information, Cohen said he had not been told of the plans 
of Dekes returning to Middlebury this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, fraternities are healthy. "I really don't think of (the 
restrictions and bans) as a major threat to the fraternity world in general," 
said Jonathan Brant, executive vice president of the National Interfraternity 
Council, representing 55 fraternities with about 400,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraternity supporters say their wild parties have been reined in and critics 
don't take into account the community services provided by fraternities and the 
strength of the lifelong friendships that develop. 
</P>
<P>
 And they say the schools underestimate their perseverance. At a football game 
last fall, a plane flew over Middlebury's stadium, towing a banner. 
</P>
<P>
 The message? 
</P>
<P>
 "Deke Lives."

TEXAS BUNKERS HOUSE NUCLEAR ARMS MATERIAL; PLUTONIUM: COMPONENTS WILL REMAIN 
INDEFINITELY IN GROUND BECAUSE NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE ON FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Think of William A. Weinreich as the warden of a maximum security federal 
institution -- miles of razor wire, electronic sensors, fortified watchtowers, 
heavy steel doors, guards with automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The occupants are dangerous and potentially explosive. But this is not a 
prison, and Weinreich's charges are not people. As the general manager of the 
Energy Department's Pantex plant northwest of Amarillo, Weinreich is the 
custodian of more than 6,000 bowling-ball-size "pits" of highly toxic plutonium 
retrieved from dismantled nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Removed from bombs and missiles and separated from casings of high explosive, 
these pits -- each the former trigger of a nuclear weapon capable of 
incinerating hundreds of thousands of people -- are stored in racks in 
earth-covered bunkers. There they will remain indefinitely because the U.S. 
government has not decided what to do with all that surplus plutonium. It's a 
sensitive issue, because as little as 15 pounds of plutonium can easily be 
fashioned into a crude bomb, a potential goal for terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 As the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile shrinks rapidly in the post-Cold War 
era, Pantex is the only one of the Energy Department's network of nuclear 
weapons facilities that is getting busier. This is where the old weapons come 
to meet their end, and Pantex is to plutonium what Ft. Knox is to gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that big a deal, according to Weinreich, who -- like many people who have 
spent their careers working with nuclear weapons -- views them with respect but 
not fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put people through a lot of training and we have a lot of security," he 
said. "We're fairly comfortable with our procedures" for preventing either of 
the two worst things that could happen here: a nuclear accident, or invasion 
and seizure of plutonium by terrorists or other rogue groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinreich and other officials of Mason & Hanger-Silas Mason Inc., the Energy 
Department's operating contractor here, point out that Pantex workers have been 
assembling nuclear weapons and taking them apart for more than 40 years without 
a major accident or breach of security. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most of that time the plutonium was recycled into new weapons. Now the 
United States is not building nuclear weapons, so the weapons-ready material 
has nowhere to go. As the U.S. stockpile of strategic nuclear warheads heads 
down from an estimated peak of 12,000 in 1987 to a target of 3,500 in 2003, 
about 1,400 weapons a year are being disassembled here and their plutonium pits 
are added to the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department promised in January to limit the number of pits in 
"interim" storage here to 12,000 "until further decisions are reached 
concerning long-term storage of plutonium." 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department is coordinating a Clinton Administration study of 
long-term disposition options for the plutonium, but in the meantime the 
Administration has not yet officially made the most fundamental decision: 
whether the material is waste to be destroyed or a potential energy resource to 
be kept available if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pantex lies in the approach path of Amarillo airport, and officials 
acknowledged some concern about what might happen if a plane crashed into one 
of the bunkers and started a fire that would spread plutonium in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 As for terrorists, security supervisor Dale F. Morgan smiled as he displayed 
the weapons carried by Pantex guards, including an M-60 light machine gun. It 
is theoretically possible for someone to parachute into Pantex or land a 
helicopter, he said, "but it wouldn't do 'em much good. They might get in, but 
they wouldn't get out."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS PULP FICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: When did men become extremely concerned about sexual harassment ? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: About the time women gave the phenomenon a name and it became an 
actionable offense.  
</P>
<P>
 If you immerse yourself in the latest paperback and movie discussions of 
sexual harassment, you risk being knocked flat by a tidal wave of men's anger, 
a force that has been gathering for some time now. 
</P>
<P>
 Having just seen David Mamet's movie adaptation of his play, "Oleanna," and 
read Michael Crichton's novel "Disclosure," both of which turn on the abuse of 
power expressed in sexual terms, I am feeling slightly disoriented, 
experiencing what is known in the shrink trade as cognitive dissonance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" takes place on a college campus, where a male professor is visited 
by a female student in distress over a failing grade. The dialogue is 
ambiguous, open to interpretation and misinterpretation, and what seems to be 
an intense, elliptical, semi-Socratic exchange results in a formal complaint 
lodged by the student against the professor, maybe signaling a criminal case, 
certainly the end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disclosure" is highfalutin trash, a great airplane read, coming to a theater 
near you next month. In this Seattle-based tale, an oddly innocent, apolitical 
computer company executive is bumped for promotion by a gorgeous, scheming 
former flame, who proceeds to wreck his life. Or tries to, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer executive could teach a thing or two about self-preservation to 
Mamet's befuddled professor. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, what one is left with after both stories close is the sense that 
men are imperfect, confused, but essentially noble. Women are confused, too, 
but the confusions masks more dangerous qualities -- anger, ambition, psychosis 
and a dangerous propensity for dishonesty as represented by plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I think I know something about sexual harassment -- having encountered it, 
having reported on it, having been sentient for most of the past two decades. 
But had I known nothing (and believe me, some have accused me of just that), 
this is what I might have gleaned of the topic from "Oleanna" and "Disclosure": 
</P>
<P>
 * Women sexually harass men, and men cannot help but become sexually aroused 
by abusive women because they have no control over their physical responses to 
stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even when men are in the power positions, women turn tables and ruin men's 
lives with false accusations, which scandal-fearing institutions are only too 
willing to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women torture men psychologically, leaving men no choice -- none whatsoever 
-- but to fight back in any way they can -- with lawsuits, with fists, with 
whatever works. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that women are capable of sexually harassing men and, sure, 
other women. No doubt about it, women have been known to strike blows in 
domestic disputes and to engage in emotional abuse with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as reported by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, fewer than 10% 
of harassment complaints are filed by men (and no one knows how many of those 
are complaints against other men), doesn't that mean that more than 90% of them 
are filed by women? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't the ratio suggest that the archetypal harassment situation -- the 
paradigm, as the smug professor of "Oleanna" would put it -- is a woman 
victimized by a man with more power than she? 
</P>
<P>
 That, students, was a rhetorical question. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What does it mean when the fictional offerings on a subject so huge it almost 
derailed a Supreme Court nomination present this lopsided view of sexual 
harassment? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing much, I wager, except that two talented writers, who happen to be men, 
have tackled the issue in a way that resonates for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people have encountered the theory that everyone you dream is you, that 
the characters dredged up from your subconscious are extensions of yourself. 
Your scary monsters, in other words, say a whole lot about more about you than 
about them. They are your truth. You own them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the truth revealed by these stories is not that scary-monster women harass 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that men feel threatened by this new public accountability 
(harassment laws) for actions that once remained strictly in the private realm 
(professor-student sex or boss-subordinate sex), and they are batting it around 
(the male as victim), attempting to forge a new understanding of this slight 
equalizing of power between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Their concerns are totally understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 And powerfully expressed. As fiction.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; FROM THE PAIN, A PASSION; JAMES AND NANCY CHUDA LOST THEIR 
LITTLE GIRL TO A RARE CANCER. NOW THEY ARE ON A MISSION TO PROTECT OTHER 
CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a child dies, the mourners talk about how a short life is purposeful -- 
how even the very young can complete a mission on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 This belief, embraced during the memorial service for their little girl on 
April 24, 1991, steers the lives of James and Nancy Chuda. 
</P>
<P>
 The remembrance was held in the stunning, sunlight-bathed house that Jim, a 
well-known environmental architect, built four years ago for his family in 
Laurel Canyon. Colette, who died of cancer at 5, had lived there only a short 
while, playing among the rose bushes and dreaming the dreams of a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 That spring day, lying "like a princess," Nancy says, in her bedroom and 
surrounded by roses and her loved ones, the child was gone but the mission had 
begun. With the Chudas' approval, a friend passed out elegant handwritten notes 
announcing the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chudas' close friend and neighbor, Marcy Hamilton, had come running down 
the hill the morning after Colette died, Nancy recalls. "She said, 'Nancy, 
Colette's favorite color was green. She loved the park. She loved nature. Why 
don't you start an environmental fund?' Of course, I was just trying to survive 
the tragedy, and I said, 'Oh, Marcy, it's a good idea.' But I was in a fog." 
</P>
<P>
 More than three years later, the Chudas' hearts are still leaden but their 
minds have cleared. And their resolve has grown exponentially. The couple 
suspect that Colette's cancer, a rare form called Wilms' tumor, was caused by 
some unknown toxic exposure, either in the womb or during infancy. Unlike other 
cancers, Wilms' tumor has no known genetic cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy turned their long-held environmentalism from a concern to a 
passion, from a devotion to a calling. And, with the help of other parents -- 
some of them entertainment business megastars -- the Chudas are earning the 
respect of environmental activists and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Natural Resources Defense Council, a powerful nonprofit 
environmental group, released a report saying that the typical American child 
is not only exposed to many chemicals known to cause cancer but also may be 
more vulnerable to those exposures than adults. Yet government standards 
regulating carcinogens take into account neither multiple exposures nor 
children's rapid growth and development, which make them more vulnerable to 
toxins.  
</P>
<P>
 The report, "Handle With Care: Children and Environmental Carcinogens," was 
funded by the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund and is dedicated to her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children have to be considered separately in environmental regulations, with 
their own standards for tolerance," Nancy says. "Until we can define and 
declare those differences, and begin to regard children as special, we won't 
see change. That is the driving force behind this report and behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 In the often arcane and dry technical world of environmental science, the 
Chudas humanize bland data, says Jay Feldman, executive director of the 
National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got to begin to personalize -- as the Chudas are able to do -- issues 
that have been reduced to statistics by lawmakers," Feldman says. "I can't 
think of two better people to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time they have to give their perspective -- to say what moved them -- 
they have to present the tragic facts and relive, to some extent, (their) pain. 
Yet Jim and Nancy are willing to put themselves through that to prevent future 
harm for others." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's a brisk October morning, two days after the release of the NRDC report. 
Jim and Nancy, along with her cousin, public relations professional Betty Ann 
Gaynor, frantically work the phones, trying to squeeze into the lineup of a 
Larry King show about the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Their prospects look dim, and Gaynor cautions against high hopes. But Nancy, a 
former broadcaster who worked for KABC in the early '80s, has contacts. And 
within a few hours Jim and Nancy are in a Sunset Boulevard studio telling King, 
via satellite, about Colette and the environmental fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why am I surprised?" asks Gaynor, who has flown in from Florida to help 
publicize the report. "Nancy and Jim are guided by this inner sense of what is 
right and good, and what can come to pass. They are also articulate and 
magnetic. They can communicate that, 'This is where our priorities need to be.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as if Nancy, a Los Angeles native, was born to attract positive 
attention. At 47, she is a slender beauty often praised for her optimism and 
generosity. Her mother, Lenore Breslauer, co-founded the anti-war citizens' 
group Another Mother for Peace. Her father, Broadway producer David Gould, died 
when Nancy was 12. Her stepfather, entertainment business manager Gerald 
Breslauer, introduced Nancy to her best friend and soul mate in environmental 
causes, Olivia Newton-John. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy discovered a love of Mother Earth early. While working as a model in her 
late teens, she wrote a cookbook containing low-fat recipes and went on a book 
tour to warn against the use of pesticides and additives. Her slogan: "A slim 
solution for fat pollution." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the beginning of my consciousness about food, pollution and 
pesticides," she says. "I used to come home and say to my family at dinner, 
'Don't eat that. It has pesticides.' I used to drive my family insane. But I 
think I had a sense of what was to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Her experience in front of the camera on the book tour led Nancy to a 
broadcast journalism career, and she eventually landed the film critic job at 
KABC, from 1979 to 1982. She left to write a movie script with Newton-John, but 
marriage and motherhood became her priorities. Nancy and Jim met L.A-style when 
she answered his used-car-for-sale ad, and they married in 1984. Colette and 
Newton-John's daughter, Chloe, were born just a few weeks apart in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The mothers and their daughters formed the nucleus of a group that would meet 
each Wednesday in the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom in Beverly Hills. 
Nancy led nature walks through the park, where a sycamore was later planted in 
Colette's memory, and promoted her latest environmental cause to the other 
moms. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim, too, became a devoted environmentalist early in his career. After growing 
up in Nebraska and graduating from USC, he joined the Buddhist organization 
Soka Gakkai International and became its architect, designing structures across 
the country, as well as the Ikeda World Peace Park on Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '70s, his daughter from his first marriage was born with severe 
mental and physical disabilities. Then in 1979 Jim was found to have melanoma, 
a potentially deadly skin cancer. Doctors removed a lesion on his back and 
operated again when the cancer metastasized to his groin. Eschewing their 
advice to undergo chemotherapy, he put his faith in Buddhism and nature and 
adopted a diet high in various nutrients and enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to the conclusion that I could either put good things into my life to 
help me or poison," says Jim, 52. The cancer has not recurred. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, he had begun plans to build an environmentally friendly 
house for Newton-John and her family in Malibu. Nancy, meanwhile, stepped up 
her involvement as an activist, backing the 1990 Big Green Initiative (Prop. 
65), an ill-fated package of sweeping environmental laws. Working as a 
co-producer with Jeff Margolis, she lined up Newton-John, Bette Midler, Lily 
Tomlin, Robin Williams, Cher and Meryl Streep to perform in an ABC-TV special 
called "An Evening With Friends of the Environment." Although it never 
mentioned the initiative, the show's intent was clear to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy put the event together from Colette's bedside at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, making hundreds of phone calls to agents and network executives. The 
4-year-old with dimples and a veil of brunette curls had become ill four months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, saving the environment and saving Colette seemed tragically, 
inextricably linked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy just redoubled her efforts (on Prop. 65) after Colette got sick," 
recalls Lawrie Mott, co-author of the recent NRDC report. "We were all 
surprised beyond belief that she didn't want to drop out and crawl into a 
totally separate world. But she made it clear that she wanted to continue, and 
I think it helped her through her darker moments. It was incredible. People 
used to go have meetings with Nancy on Big Green in the hospital corridor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They say a dying child knows what is happening and accepts it long before 
adults do. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a poor prognosis -- the cancer that began in Colette's kidney had 
already metastasized to her lungs when it was discovered -- the Chudas 
supported their child through a heartbreaking odyssey of radiation, surgery and 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were so incredible during Colette's illness," Newton-John says. "They 
never gave up." 
</P>
<P>
 Colette couldn't die, they kept telling themselves, for another reason: Jim's 
son from his first marriage had been killed in a surfing accident in Hawaii a 
year earlier. Andy was 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't gotten over that, " Jim says. "I was still in a daze. I thought, 
'This time, we can change things.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds, "I think Colette knew. She used to ask me what happens after you 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 And, 10 days before she died, with a last-ditch course of chemotherapy 
awaiting her, she crawled into bed with Nancy one night and asked: "Mommy, why 
did this happen to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any words for her then, and I still don't," says Nancy, crying 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked, all along, about the cause," Jim says. "There were no answers. 
People would say, 'This is rare. This is non-genetic.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the couple underwent tests to see if something in their own health 
profiles might have affected Colette. The tests yielded no clues. 
</P>
<P>
 And because they live in a house devoid of potentially toxic building 
materials and eat organic foods, the Chudas can't imagine what toxin could have 
entered their child's body to cause the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll never know what caused it," Nancy concedes. "But we talked to one 
doctor who treated Colette about the possibility of environmental causes. She 
sat and listened to my concerns. She never negated it. She said, 'I don't doubt 
that there is an environmental factor in these cancers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They say nothing is harder to endure than the death of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say to us: 'I don't know how you do it.' Well, the only way we know 
(to cope) is by doing this," says Nancy, pointing to the downstairs office in 
their pristine home. 
</P>
<P>
 On one wall is a collage of pictures from a Bette Midler concert fund-raiser. 
Another holds a huge U.S. map with pins marking the spots where the Chudas' 
campaign is taking root. On a far wall is a blown-up picture of Colette, the 
sun glinting through her curls, a sweet smile of delight on her face as she 
cuddles a puppy. 
</P>
<P>
 On long days of networking on the telephone or writing grant proposals, the 
photograph reminds the Chudas why they have taken on such a daunting task. They 
remember the resignation in Colette's voice near the end of her fight, when 
three "sweating, shaking nurses tried to hook up the IV" for a last round of 
chemotherapy, Nancy says. "Finally, Colette said: 'Just do it and get it over 
with.' That was her last moment of consciousness." She died five days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chudas' friends remember the mission too. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Newton-John who held Nancy as she sobbed in a hospital after Colette's 
stomachache turned out to be cancer. And when the singer's environmental book 
for children, "A Pig Tale" (Simon & Schuster, 1993), came out, she hit the 
talk-show circuit, drumming up support for the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mothers' group member, Bette Midler, donated 500 seats at her 1993 
Universal Amphitheater concert to the fund, raising $86,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all in this mothers' group, and (Colette's illness) touched us all so 
much," Newton-John says. "We all felt that it could have been any one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The exposure from Newton-John's book tour also helped launch an offshoot of 
the Chudas' organization: the Children's Health and Environmental Coalition 
(CHEC), which is designed to unite grass-roots groups working on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Tessa Hill of Minneapolis met the Chudas through Newton-John and has become an 
integral part of CHEC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a strong commitment to Nancy and Jim. They are really smart. And they 
have the inspiration of their child behind them," says Hill, whose son, 
Clinton, founded the Kids for Saving the Earth Club before dying of cancer at 
age 11. "We want so badly for it not to go in vain and for it not to happen to 
other families and children." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chudas hope that Hill and other activists will take the NRDC report to 
their members, the media and lawmakers, amplifying the need for specific 
environmental regulations to protect children. Meanwhile, the Chudas are also 
sponsoring a study in Krakow, Poland, that aims to track the impact of 
carcinogens in ambient air pollution on the developing fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plans include a national petition drive for a Children's Environmental 
Bill of Rights and infiltrating the Washington power structure. They have 
already made several frustrating trips to the capital in which, too often, a 
low-level Administration figure sidesteps their pointed questions about the 
lack of regulations and studies on children's health. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chudas have made an impression, says Mary Gant of the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a government agency that funds 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they have done is raise the interest and concern of people in 
Washington," she says. "That is so important. . . . The Chudas communicate in 
an incredibly effective way. You immediately know their feelings are genuine 
and come from the heart. And you get a real sense of their commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Their commitment is simply as strong as their love for Colette, their belief 
that public pressure will lead to change, Nancy says, recalling a recent 
conversation with Newton-John's daughter, who had been Colette's best buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chloe was visiting us one day recently and she said, 'Nancy, I think I know 
why Colette got cancer. So we would start the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund 
and could save other kids from getting cancer. And I think she died so we would 
do it,' " Nancy recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-afternoon sunlight filters through the rooms of the Laurel Canyon 
house and across the rose bushes where the Chudas scattered some of Colette's 
ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is our philosophy," Nancy continues. "Colette did have a mission. When 
she took that needle in her arm, it was as if to say, 'I'm going. I'm getting 
out of here. But you've got some work ahead of you, Mom and Dad. And you had 
better do it.' This is a mission of love. It's something we have to do to honor 
her." Nancy and James Chuda 
</P>
<P>
 Ages: Nancy, 47; Jim, 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Natives?: Nancy was born in Los Angeles; Jim grew up in Nebraska. They live in 
Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: The Colette Chuda Environmental Fund and its offshoot, the 
Children's Health and Environmental Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy on their mission: "We have tapped into something where there is a void. 
It's mind-boggling when you realize that there is no testing done in children 
as a special focus of environmental research. We have forgotten the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim on their mission: "We have to look at prevention (of toxic exposures). You 
can't just say, 'The government is going to protect me. I don't have to worry 
about what I eat. I don't have to worry about what is out there.' Because, 
eventually, you will be affected by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim on a guiding philosophy: "How you can judge the future of a country when 
you see an old man planting a tree that he'll never experience the shade 
under." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy on a guiding vision: "Marching on Washington with children in strollers, 
backpacks or in little red wagons to bring attention to the health needs of 
children first.";

HOW DO WE REPAIR OUR DETERIORATING SCHOOLS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do you really believe the story describing conditions in schools ("Reading, 
Writing, Ruin," Nov. 9) will persuade me that what schools need is more money? 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how will money solve the problem of "all kinds of things jammed down 
toilets"? The students can afford juice cans, and the district has the money to 
provide paper towels and soap dispensers. If these kids had more towel 
dispensers and bigger and better soap dispensers, perhaps they would only do a 
more effective job of crippling the plumbing systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is naive enough to believe that more money will end graffiti? How exactly 
do we manage the budget for less defecation on floors and behind gymnasiums? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, money spent on the education of our youth is the most important 
investment we can make in our futures. However, my support goes to (LAUSD board 
member) Barbara Boudreaux who says, "If you tolerate filth, you're going to 
have filth."

 I find it obscene that some bureaucratic desk jockey is probably retired and 
fishing in Florida after a stellar career contracting shabbily constructed 
school buildings that crumble while children sit among the ruins.  
</P>
<P>
 What sort of self-image does a child develop sitting in that sort of slum 
building created by lack of attention and neglect? What are we saying to 
today's kids? To their teachers? Definitely: "You are not valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine: Mothers lovingly send their youngsters off to an educational 
environment so dirty, decrepit and vile that even the computers have to be 
strategically located and covered in plastic to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 What was implicit in your article was clearly verified in The Times Poll that 
reflected California voters' concerns. Education takes fourth place. We only 
pay lip service to the value of children and their impact on the future.

 Last year I appeared before the Los Angeles Board of Education as a retired 
schoolteacher and recommended they begin making students responsible for the 
school facilities as an important part of the educational process.  
</P>
<P>
 I have been told that in Korea and Japan the students are responsible for 
their classes and other facilities and each week take turns sweeping, mopping 
and gardening.  
</P>
<P>
 My presentation was received well by several members, but I was told this 
could never be a school-district policy. I ask the readers of The Times and 
parents of school-age children: Why not?

 How ironic that this article should be published on the same day the Los 
Angeles school board announced it will fight the will of the people by taking 
Proposition 187 to court. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board constantly states there are no funds for better education, 
and yet they can somehow afford expensive attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times should be commended for exposing the poor condition of so many of 
our school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 I am appalled to read about classrooms that have suffered for years with 
leaking roofs, buildings that haven't been painted for 30 years, restrooms that 
are virtually unusable and schools that once had several custodians and now 
have none. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope our school board and other elected officials study this issue. We voted 
into office people who said they represent us and would do their jobs, not 
mismanage the budget and fight us in court with our own tax dollars.

 I have a simple solution to the problem of inadequate maintenance of the 
deteriorating L.A. schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the LAUSD bigwigs close their clean and expensive downtown offices and 
reposition themselves at the school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Let Superintendent Sid Thompson and his comfortable bureaucrats be forced to 
use the filthy, disgusting school bathrooms and hold their meetings in the 
school rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 I guarantee that in no time at all, the money would be found to improve those 
school sites.

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: SPARE TIME AT STAR LANES

 If your idea of a classic movie is "Five Easy Pieces," then Hollywood Star 
Lanes is probably your idea of a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool Karen Black and Jack Nicholson types mingle with people who could be 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father and I started it, but now it's just me," says Sam Barnese. "I'm 
here every day from early afternoon on, although I don't stay until 3 or 4 a.m. 
like I used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Star Lanes is open around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular both with young hipsters and the wash-and-set crowd, Star Lanes has 
been in the hands of the Barnese family for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Little has changed here since 1960, including the prices, and the place still 
looks more or less like the dashboard of a 1968 Cadillac. 
</P>

 "There aren't any computers, nothing new," says longtime employee Dick White. 
"This is one of the cheaper alleys to bowl in because of that, probably the 
cheapest in the Southland. You get some pretty nice people because they've been 
coming into this darned place for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a melting pot," Barnese adds. "We really have a very nice crowd. 
They come here to bowl; they don't come here to horse around." 
</P>
<P>
 And does the place fill up with scenesters after the bars close? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," Barnese says. "What we do get is a lot of people who work in 
night clubs and hotels and restaurants. You know, when you get off work, you 
don't go home and go to bed and they don't want to either. We're one of the few 
things that are open and fun and available." 
</P>
<P>
 Novices might take advantage of the "Practice Special" every Tuesday night 
from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., when you can bowl three games for the princely sum of 
$5. 
</P>
<P>
 Week nights, the leagues are active and casual bowlers might experience a wait 
from 6 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do have to wait, there are a pinball arcade, a cocktail lounge, and a 
coffee shop that serves 1960s family fare. 
</P>
<P>
 A plate of shrimp chow mein will set you back $4, a ham and cheese is $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Wash it all down with a 50-cent cup of Sanka. (Remember "Marcus Welby, M.D."?) 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and of course there's beer.  
</P>
<P>
 If you can stand the nostalgic aura of stale Virginia Slims, the best thing to 
do is carry your food out to the tables overlooking the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The wee hours bring out a whole new demographic. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the weekend it's mostly pot bowlers," says White, referring to the 
practice of betting on games. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk in here on a Friday night at 4 a.m. and you'll have 20 bowlers 
bowling for money." 
</P>
<P>

 The Codex Hammer, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscript that recently sold for $30.8 
million, isn't the only piece of art gone from the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of 
Art and Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The oversized likeness of the late founder that dominated the museum's 
entrance was recently removed.For those who never viewed the painting, it was 
the approximate size of a Lenin portrait one might have expected to see in a 
1950s Soviet party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum spokeswoman Anna Graham described the Hammer likeness quite accurately 
as, "large. I don't know the exact dimension. It was large." The oil company 
chairman/art collector will now be remembered by a discreet bust. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, two things are certain: "It's in storage and we don't have any 
plans to hang it in the future," Graham says. And, if it's sold, it won't be 
bringing in $30.8 million.

 Ugly Trend: For those cleaning out their closets, it's come to our attention

 She's not really tall. Only 5-foot-9. "Most runway models are at least 5-foot- 
10," says model Claudia Orellana. 
</P>
<P>
 But that didn't stop the former co-captain of Belmont High's drill team and 
current student at East L.A. City College from going toe to pedicured toe with 
towering Nadja Auermann and Tatiana Patitz at the recent Richard Tyler fashion 
show in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the audience seemed to miss the extra inch. Indeed, few who 
encounter the willowy 20-year-old find her lacking. All her short life, 
Orellana says, "people would always come up to me and tell me I should model." 
But until three years ago, she was happy to drill and study for her honors 
courses -- as much for her mother's sake as her own. "Education is really 
important to her because she only went up to sixth grade." 
</P>
<P>
 Higher education, however, must take a back seat for now because at 20, 
Orellana is at the peak of her beauty. She can earn $1,500 a day modeling for 
catalogues in New York and Europe, and she uses it to help support her mother 
and younger brother. "I was brought up by a single mom who has worked so hard 
all her life. I owe her so much," she says. For now, Orellana goes to school 
during alternate semesters. And learns about the fashion world the rest of the 
time. DEBRA GENDEL

A CALL TO STUDY ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS; HEALTH: WHILE ADULT CANCERS ARE 
TRACEABLE, MANY IN CHILDHOOD ARE STILL A MYSTERY -- ONE THAT HAS BEEN 
UNANSWERED FOR FAR TOO LONG, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's common for parents whose children develop cancer to suspect environmental 
factors, says Kathy Ruccione, a nurse researcher in oncology at Childrens 
Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When 500 parents were asked what they thought might have contributed to or 
caused their children's cancer, the most common response was environmental 
exposures, says Ruccione, who directed the recent study. 
</P>
<P>
 These parents' beliefs, however intuitive, should not be ignored, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we learned from this study is that we need to talk to parents about what 
they believe caused their child's cancer; not to correct them, but to see what 
the cancer means to them," says Ruccione, whose study was published this year 
in the Journal of Pediatric Oncology Nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she says, while many adult cancers can be linked to family history, 
the environment or diet, the cause of most childhood cancers is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, cancer experts are studying environmental factors, fueled in 
part by a mysterious increase in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia and brain 
cancer. Since 1973, the rates of those diseases have risen 20.7% and 35.3%, 
respectively, in people younger than 19, according to the National Cancer 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The explanation is murky, and no one is prepared to say that the increase is 
linked solely to environmental exposure. The most one can say is there is a 
strong finger of suspicion," says Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, a pediatrician with 
New York's Mt. Sinai School of Medicine who has led efforts to protect children 
from environmental toxins. "This suspicion, however, has been neglected far too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspicion is not just among parents. On Nov. 1, the Leukemia Society of 
America convened its first panel of health and environmental experts to explore 
environmental factors, such as pesticides, secondhand smoke, high-tension wires 
(power lines) and industrial pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 Food and water have also become major areas of concern. A National Academy of 
Sciences panel reported last year that because infants and children consume 
more of some foods and drink more water for their size than adults, their 
potential exposure to toxins is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 But government agencies use an adult model to determine "acceptable" levels of 
exposure, says Landrigan, who co-chaired the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "That approach ignores that kids have very different exposures than adults do. 
It ignores the obvious biological differences -- that kids' organ systems are 
undergoing rapid growth and development. And it ignores that children have 60 
or 70 years of life ahead of them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Few scientists dispute these differences among children and adults, says 
Lawrie Mott of the National Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But she and other environmental activists doubt that science or government 
will act decisively any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "My take now is there is not a lot of faith in government or legislation, so 
I'm not sure how successful something like (a new law or regulation geared 
toward children) would be," says Mott, co-author of the new NRDC report titled 
"Handle With Care: Children and Environmental Carcinogens." "But I think 
something with a powerful grass-roots base would be unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
 That is where the talents of Jim and Nancy Chuda will pay off, predicts Teri 
Swearingen, a West Virginia mother who has led a 15-year battle to close the 
WTI incineration plant in East Liverpool, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim and Nancy are so dedicated; they work with a passion," Swearingen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most devastating thing to happen to a parent: Your child is taken 
away from you. But they are turning their loss into everyone else's gain. I 
think parents across the country should thank them." Children and Cancer 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1973, cases of cancer in children under age 19 have increased 12%. In 
particular, the incidences of brain cancer and leukemia have risen dramatically 
for unknown reasons. 
</P>
<P>

GOOD COOKING: THANKSGIVING; THE HIGH-HEAT SOLUTION

<P>
 One Thanksgiving Day a friend called frantically to say that all was ready for 
her dinner . . . except the turkey. She'd forgotten to put it in the oven. 
Remembering that many French chefs use very high oven temperatures for roasting 
poultry, I suggested roasting it in foil at 475 degrees. Not only did she put a 
large, stuffed turkey on the table in 3 1/2 hours, it had amazingly moist 
flesh, and all without any basting at all. Since then, I have fine-tuned this 
quick method. These days, it's the only way I roast a turkey, and it never 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
 As for stuffing, I prefer it to be well-seasoned, the kind that can stand on 
its own with leftovers and on sandwiches. I use hot sausage and packaged herb 
seasoned stuffing mix, which contribute the basic flavors I'm looking for. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Always try to find a fresh, high-quality turkey; it makes all the difference. 
Rinse well with cold water. The turkey can be kept up to two days, refrigerated 
and covered with a damp towel. A day ahead, make the stock and piece together 
the heavy-duty foil sheets; this foil wrapping encases the turkey during 
roasting and actually steams it. HIGH-HEAT, FOIL-WRAPPED THANKSGIVING TURKEY 
</P>
<P>
 1 (16- to 18-pound) turkey 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon paprika, preferably Hungarian 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Old-Fashioned Sausage, Wild Rice and Mushroom Stuffing 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Giblet Gravy 
</P>
<P>
 Cut 3 (3-foot) lengths of heavy-duty foil. Place side-by-side on large, flat 
surface to make long sheet. Form 1 continuous sheet by double-folding edges 
together. Securely seal seams. Foil must be airtight. Invert large roasting 
pan. Center foil over pan and gently shape foil around it. Remove foil. Turn 
pan over. Carefully fit foil in pan without tearing. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse body and neck cavities of turkey. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. 
Combine paprika, salt and pepper in small dish. Sprinkle seasoning in both 
cavities, reserving some for surface.  
</P>
<P>
 Just before roasting, loosely spoon Old-Fashioned Sausage, Wild Rice and 
Mushroom Stuffing into cavities. Put any extra stuffing in 1 1/2-quart 
casserole. Tie turkey legs together, skewer both cavities to close, and tuck in 
wings. Wrap several layers of foil around points of skewers to prevent tearing 
foil around turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Place turkey, breast-side up, in prepared pan. Rub turkey with oil. Sprinkle 
with remaining seasoning. Bring foil up over sides of turkey, leaving airspace 
on sides and top of turkey so skin won't tear during roasting. Double fold foil 
edges to form airtight package. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake on lowest oven rack at 475 degrees 2 1/2 hours. Then open foil 
(carefully, beware of hot steam) and brush breast and legs with melted butter. 
Tent foil loosely over legs and thighs to prevent drying, but leave breast 
exposed, and return turkey to oven. Place casserole of stuffing in oven at this 
time as well. Continue to cook until breast is deeply browned and instant-read 
thermometer inserted into thigh meat right next to breast registers 170 
degrees, about 30 to 60 more minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Remove turkey and casserole of stuffing from oven. Use bulb baster to transfer 
drippings and pan juices to 2-cup measure. Bring foil back up sides to cover 
turkey. Let stand 30 minutes before carving. Serve hot. Pass Giblet Gravy 
separately in gravy boat. Makes 12 to 14 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 12 servings, including Old-Fashioned Sausage, Wild Rice and Mushroom 
Stuffing Giblet Gravy, contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 874 calories; 776 mg sodium; 271 mg cholesterol; 43 grams fat; 39 grams 
carbohydrates; 80 grams protein; 0.95 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 12 servings, without stuffing or gravy, contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 561 calories; 379 mg sodium; 250 mg cholesterol; 30 grams fat; 0 
carbohydrates; 70 grams protein; 0.03 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wild rice, cooked al dente, gives this stuffing its perfect texture. Be sure 
to remove all the stuffing from the cavities before refrigerating the leftover 
turkey carcass.  
</P>
<P>
 Old-Fashioned Sausage, Wild Rice and Mushroom Stuffing 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 (12-ounce) package breakfast sausage, preferably hot, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey liver, optional, diced 
</P>
<P>
 1 large red onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 large ribs celery, diced 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/2 cups sliced, trimmed wild mushrooms, such as shiitake and crimini, or 
white mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups cooked wild rice  
</P>
<P>
 1 (8-ounce) package herbed seasoned stuffing mix 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup small cubed day-old white bread 
</P>
<P>
 Red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 6 tablespoons Turkey Gravy Stock or reduced-salt chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 Heat butter in 4-quart skillet with high sides or wide pot over medium-high 
heat. When hot, add sausage, liver, onion and celery. Cook until sausage is 
cooked through, about 8 minutes, stirring often. Add mushrooms. Cook until just 
tender, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Add wild rice, seasoned stuffing mix and bread cubes. Season to taste with red 
pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Use 2 large wooden spoons to mix. Add just 
enough Turkey Gravy Stock to moisten stuffing. Stuffing should not be wet. 
Adjust seasonings.  
</P>
<P>
 Makes about 12 cups, enough for 1 (18-pound turkey) plus 1 1/2-quart 
casserole, about 12 to 14 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 12 servings contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 223 calories; 289 mg sodium; 25 mg cholesterol; 14 grams fat; 19 grams 
carbohydrates; 7 grams protein; 0.74 gram fiber.

</P>
<P>
 The secret to a good gravy is a flavorful stock. Since the turkey stock is 
made with chicken broth instead of water, it has great depth of flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 Giblet Gravy 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons turkey fat drippings 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 Skimmed pan juices and Turkey Gravy Stock to equal 2 cups, heated and kept 
warm 
</P>
<P>
 Chopped turkey giblets 
</P>
<P>
 Bottled browning sauce, if needed for color 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Heat drippings in 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. When hot, stir in flour. 
Cook until lightly colored, stirring constantly. Slowly add warm juices and 
stock, stirring constantly. If lumpy, mix gravy in blender or food processor 
until smooth. Add giblets. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjust color with browning sauce, if needed. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Each 1-tablespoon serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 22 calories; 62 mg sodium; 30 mg cholesterol; 1 grams fat; 1 grams 
carbohydrates; 2 grams protein; 0 fiber. Giblet Gravy Stock 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey heart, gizzard and neck 
</P>
<P>
 1 small onion, cut in half 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks

 3 2/3 cups reduced-sodium chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
 4 peppercorns 
</P>
<P>

 Holiday Hint 
</P>
<P>
 Roasting a turkey, breast-side down, on a V-shaped rack until halfway done, 
then turning it over for the remaining cooking time makes the bird juicier, 
particularly the breast meat. This works best with a smaller turkey; it is 
inconvenient and dangerous to handle a big, heavy bird when hot. SAFETY TIP 
</P>
<P>
 Save time when stuffing a turkey by measuring, preparing and refrigerating 
stuffing ingredients before cooking. But wait to assemble and stuff the turkey 
until just before placing it in the oven. Never stuff turkey ahead of time 
because that can allow the bacteria that cause food poisoning to multiply. 
Thawing 
</P>
<P>
 There are three ways to thaw a frozen turkey. An evenly thawed turkey may be 
kept in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before roasting. Do not refreeze an 
uncooked turkey after it has been thawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerator Method -- The best, although slowest, way of thawing: Place the 
bird on a tray in its original wrapping and place it in the refrigerator until 
thawed. When it's partially thawed, remove the bag of giblets from the body 
cavity and reserve in the refrigerator for making gravy or stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey Weight and Thawing Time 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 12 pounds: 1 to 2 days 
</P>
<P>
 12 to 20 pounds: 2 to 3 days 
</P>
<P>
 20 to 24 pounds: 3 to 4 days 
</P>
<P>
 Quick-Thaw Method -- Leave the turkey in its original wrap, place in a large 
kettle and cover with cold water. Change the water frequently to speed thawing. 
Thaw until the bird is pliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey Weight and Thawing Time 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 12 pounds: 4 to 6 hours 
</P>
<P>
 12 to 20 pounds: 6 to 8 hours 
</P>
<P>
 20 to 24 pounds: 8 to 12 hours 
</P>
<P>
 Microwave Method -- If the microwave is large enough to accommodate a turkey, 
thaw in a glass baking dish, following the manufacturer's directions. It may 
take 1 to 1 1/2 hours on defrost cycle. BASIC ROAST TURKEY 
</P>
<P>
 A. 1 (12- to 14-pound) turkey, thawed 
</P>
<P>
 There are blackened turkeys and smoked turkeys and turkeys rubbed with herbs 
and spices. But the turkey that appears on the most Thanksgiving tables is a 
good old-fashioned basic roast turkey. Here's how it's done. 
</P>
<P>
 B. Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Remove giblet bag from turkey. Check both cavities for extra parts. Rinse 
turkey inside and out with cold water and pat dry. Rub salt and pepper to taste 
into neck and body cavities. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Basic Bread Stuffing or stuffing of choice 
</P>
<P>
 Loosely pack stuffing into neck and body cavities. Do not overstuff. Stuffing 
expands during cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Skewer neck skin to back of bird to hold stuffing in place. Tuck drumsticks 
with clamp or skin band, or tie with kitchen twine, and tuck wings under bird. 
Allow 1/2 to 3/4 cup stuffing per pound of  
</P>
<P>
 Insert meat thermometer into center of thigh next to body, but not touching 
bone. Place turkey, breast-side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Brush with 
melted butter. Roast uncovered at 325 degrees 20 to 22 minutes per pound (if 
turkey weighs more than 16 pounds, roast for 18 to 20 minutes per pound), or 
until thermometer reaches 170 to 175 degrees in thigh or 165 degrees in 
stuffing.  
</P>
<P>
 D. Butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 Baste with melted butter every 1/2 to 3/4 hour. If bird is browning too fast, 
tent loosely with foil or cover breast with butter-soaked cheesecloth. 
</P>
<P>
 When turkey is done, remove from oven and let turkey rest at room temperature 
20 minutes. 
</P>

carbohydrates; 55 grams protein; 0.20 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: To roast turkey unstuffed, season bird with salt and pepper to taste 
inside and out. If desired, insert pieces of celery, carrots and onions to 
improve flavor. Fold neck skin to back and fasten with skewer. Fasten legs down 
by tying or tucking under clamp or skin band. Basic Bread Stuffing

</P>
<P>
 You can teach an old turkey new tricks. Three years ago, The Times Food 
Section introduced the Ultimate Turkey and every year since, we've persuaded 
more and more people that there is a better way to make the Thanksgiving bird. 
It's a method that turns out amazingly moist meat in radically shorter time. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the basic idea: Stuffing is placed under the skin on the turkey's 
breast, rather than in the body cavity, and the turkey is roasted at a slightly 
higher than normal oven temperature. The stuffing keeps the breast meat moist 
while the dark meat cooks thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 With a roasting temperature of 350 degrees, you can have your turkey cooked in 
just 7 to 9 minutes per pound, instead of the usual 18 to 24 minutes a pound. A 
12-pound turkey, with stuffing, could be done in just a little more than 90 
minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 We also reduce the internal meat temperature normally used to determine when 
turkey is safely cooked. The usual recommend internal temperature of 185 
degrees is an old U.S. Department of Agriculture standard that gives cooks an 
extra cushion of safety -- and, usually, dried-out meat. We recommended taking 
turkey out of the oven when the internal temperature of the meat reaches 155 
degrees to 160 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, with such brief cooking times, there are a couple of caveats to 
avoid embarrassing undercooked spots: First, the turkey must be completely 
thawed before going in the oven. Further, it is imperative that you test the 
temperature with a thermometer (particularly in the thigh) to determine 
doneness. And don't truss the bird or tuck under the wings -- with such short 
cooking times, you need to expose all the surface area of the meat to the heat 
of the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 If you still find a few red spots at the joints when you begin to carve the 
turkey, don't panic . Remove the leg quarters, place them in a pan and tent 
with foil. Return to 350-degree oven for about 10 minutes to finish cooking 
while you carve the breast meat. 
</P>

<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups stuffing, about

<P>
 Thaw turkey thoroughly. Even fresh turkeys normally have icy sections and must 
be thawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse turkey inside and out. Pat dry. Season whole bird to taste inside and 
out with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Run fingers carefully between skin and flesh of turkey, loosening skin. 
Working slowly, push stuffing in thin layer under breast and thigh of turkey. 
Put celery, carrot and onion into body cavity of turkey.

 Put turkey in large roasting pan, breast-side up. Do not truss bird and do not 
tuck wings under bird. Brush turkey with melted butter to taste. Roast at 350 
degrees 7 to 9 minutes per pound, or until turkey registers 155 to 160 degrees 
when thermometer is placed deep into both breast and thigh, nearest bone.

Determining Doneness 
</P>
<P>
 To test a turkey for doneness, insert a thermometer through the carcass to the 
center of the stuffing. The thermometer should reach 165 degrees. If unstuffed, 
insert the thermometer through the large, meaty muscle inside the thigh, 
without touching the bone. The temperature should be 170 to 175 degrees. If no 
thermometer is used, test by hand: Wiggle the tip of the drumstick. It should 
move easily when done.

</P>
<P>
 It's fairly simple, really. But many of us serve gravy only during the 
holidays and could use a review of the basic technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Neck and giblets from 1 turkey 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart water 
</P>
<P>
 Drippings from roasted turkey 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Remove neck and giblets from bird. Separate liver from other giblets and 
discard or save for another meal. (The liver, largest and softest of organ 
meats, clouds the broth.) Place remaining giblets and neck in 2-quart saucepan. 
Add water and bring to boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer until 
tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Strain and reserve stock. Discard neck. Chop 
giblets, cover and refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
 When turkey is roasted, remove from oven and transfer to platter. Lightly 
cover with foil and let stand about 20 minutes to allow juices to set before 
carving.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile add 1 cup reserved stock to drippings in roasting pan. Place pan 
over medium heat and scrape browned particles free from bottom with wooden 
spoon. Pour mixture into measuring cup and let fat rise to top. Skim fat off 
with spoon. Or use specially designed measuring cup, pouring drippings. 
</P>
<P>
 To make 2 cups gravy, place 1/4 cup turkey fat in saucepan. (If necessary, add 
butter.) Add enough reserved giblet stock to skimmed drippings to make 2 cups.  
</P>
<P>
 Heat fat over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook, stirring, until bubbly. 
Remove from heat. Gradually pour in dripping-stock mixture, stirring constantly 
with wire whisk. Return pan to heat and cook, stirring, until gravy boils and 
thickens. For thinner gravy, add more broth. Stir in giblets. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Each 1-tablespoon serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 20 calories; 67 mg sodium; 3 mg cholesterol; 1 gram fat; 1 gram carbohydrates; 
1 gram protein; 0.05 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Giblets may be omitted from gravy, and canned chicken broth may be 
substituted for homemade broth. MASHED POTATOES 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to mashed potatoes, there is little consensus about the best way 
to make them. The best mashing utensil and the lump/no-lump question are 
matters of personal preference. 
</P>
<P>
 But the type of potato you use for mashing does make a difference. Of the two 
basic varieties -- waxy and mealy (sometimes termed non-waxy) -- the latter is 
best suited for mashing because of its low sugar and high starch content.  
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, rely on the thick-skinned potatoes such as russets to be 
mealy. Select potatoes that are firm, free from large cuts, growth cracks and 
sprouting eyes. Avoid any with green-tinged skins.  
</P>
<P>
 6 medium starchy potatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 to 3/4 cup hot milk, evaporated milk, half and half or whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cook potatoes, either by boiling or steaming. 
</P>
<P>
 To boil, in heavy saucepan with tight-fitting lid, cook potatoes in about 1 
inch boiling, salted water until fork-tender. If whole, cook 30 to 40 minutes, 
or cut-up, 20 to 25 minutes. If lid doesn't fit tightly, water may boil away. 
Check occasionally and add more water if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 To steam, place wire rack on bottom of kettle or large saucepan and add water 
to just below level of rack. Bring water to boil, add potatoes and cook, 
tightly covered, until fork-tender. If whole, cook 30 to 45 minutes, or cut-up, 
20 to 30 minutes. If lid is not tight-fitting, check occasionally to see if 
water should be added. 
</P>
<P>
 Peel potatoes (this can also be done before cooking). Use potato masher, 
electric mixer or ricer to mash potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 With potato masher, press tool into potatoes in downward motion, forcing 
through cutting grid. With electric mixer, begin by mashing potatoes slightly 
with stationary beaters. Turn mixer on low speed and whip to desired 
consistency. With ricer, place boiled potatoes in perforated cylinder, then 
squeeze long handles together to force contents through ricer holes. Let 
rice-like pieces mound in serving dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating with mixer or wooden spoon, gradually add heated milk, evaporated 
milk, half and half or whipping cream, according to taste. Potatoes will be 
creamier and thinner if more liquid is used. Finish with softened butter or 
margarine to taste. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve immediately, or spoon into buttered casserole and smooth light film of 
cream over top. Keep warm in oven heated to 250 degrees. Cover with towel to 
absorb steam. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Makes 4 servings 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 250 calories; 216 mg sodium; 33 mg cholesterol; 12 grams fat; 32 grams 
carbohydrates; 5 grams protein; 0.73 gram fiber. CARVING 
</P>
<P>
 Even expert carvers need a properly cooked turkey to do their best -- 
overcooked turkey meat crumbles when it's sliced. And remember to let the bird 
stand at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes after removing it from the oven so 
the juices set and the meat firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a chef's knife to remove the legs and thighs, then switch to a very sharp 
carving knife for slicing the breast meat -- the sharper the blade, the more 
attractive the slices. A serrated knife should not be used because it tends to 
tear the meat.  
</P>
<P>
 To remove the drumstick and thigh, press the leg away from the body. The joint 
connecting the leg to the backbone will often snap free, but if it doesn't, it 
may be severed with the point of a knife .  
</P>
<P>
 Cut the thigh from the body by following the contour carefully with the knife. 
Place on a separate plate, then cut through the connecting joint between the 
leg and the thigh.  
</P>
<P>
 Tilt the drumstick to a convenient angle and slice the meat away in a downward 
motion toward the plate. Hold the thigh firmly on the plate with the fork and 
cut it into even slices parallel to the bone.  
</P>
<P>
 Wings are typically left in place to keep the bird stable while the breast 
meat is carved in downward slices, across the grain. Begin each new slice 
slightly higher up on the breast, keeping the slices thin and even.  
</P>
<P>
 Inexperienced carvers may find it easier to tackle the bird in the kitchen 
rather than at the dining table. The sliced meat may then be arranged on a 
platter for serving.

THE PROUD BIRD; THE BRONZE AGE

 I read somewhere that the last flock of American Bronze turkeys was kept by 
the poultry science department at Oregon State University. It turns out that 
that isn't quite true, certainly not in the sense implied by the story -- that 
when the flock was gone, so too would be the bird upon which Thanksgiving had 
been built. And it turns out that it isn't quite true that OSU had the last 
American Bronze flock because what with budget cuts and all, the school sold 
the flock: 25 hens and 10 toms. The turkeys they now keep have unique genetic 
weaknesses, such as inherited disorders or distinct plumage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to see the American Bronze," I was told by the OSU turkey 
specialist, Dr. Savage, whose name is Tom, "get in touch with the Wishards in 
Prairie City. They have been raising them for 45 years. And one other thing . . 
. no, two. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The turkey is a very personable and intelligent bird, much more so than the 
chicken, say, or the Japanese quail. And it does not drown itself looking up 
into rain." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Prairie City, a small farming and lumber mill town east of John Day in 
east-central Oregon, is the home of Wish Poultry and the Wishard Family who 
keep the last great flock of American Bronze turkeys to be found in the nation. 
The American Bronze is the bird that made Thanksgiving what it is today, and 
while it is far from endangered, its numbers have dwindled to a pathetic low in 
the face of the industrialization of the turkey as a meat-producing animal. In 
the passing of the American Bronze can be found the gradual erosion of a style 
of American farming, the loss of the barnyard and the rise of the meat factory. 
If Thanksgiving has a flavor, we are no doubt losing that as well. 
</P>
<P>
 I called ahead before driving over. Marc Wishard described a narrow window of 
convenience through which he might be able to meet a writer interested in 
turkeys. The chicken slaughter was on one side, the opening of elk hunting 
season on the other. I arrived in between on a clear, warm Thursday morning. 
The Wishard place can be found behind the Prairie City High School gymnasium: a 
small house, a tangle of outbuildings, penned-in pigs, the big holding pen 
where the turkeys are brought in from the range for slaughter and where the 
breeding flock over winters. The sign at the entry read:

 "Hardly any more Bronzes growed," Mark Wishard said, fixing me with a baleful 
stare across the small kitchen table. His father had started the turkey farm 45 
years before. Mark, who looked to be in his early, road-weary 40s, had been a 
long-distance truck driver for 15 years and had come home to help his younger 
brother, Bard, with the business after the accidental death of their father 
four years before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That power line hadn't fallen on him, he'd still be running the place and 
you'd be talkin' to him, not me," Mark said. "We used to grow 30,000 turkeys a 
year. All natural. All naturally bred. Now we raise 2,500 and even that will 
drop now that the mill closed." 
</P>
<P>
 So much of our national Thanksgiving meal identity comes to us from across the 
century, the grandmothers in their aprons lifting the roast turkeys from 
coal-burning ovens in family farm kitchens. Those birds grew up in much the 
same way as the American Bronze turkeys raised by Wish Poultry, and presumably 
tasted the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Before poultry grower co-ops were organized, farmers arranged their own 
markets, delivering carefully plucked birds with heads and viscera intact. 
During the Depression when co-operative marketing organizations took hold, 
turkey-killing crews, odd men at best, traveled from farm to farm and 
slaughtered the birds and ruffed the feathers, plucking the larger body and 
wing feathers that are favored by arrow makers to this day. A crew of women 
would then come in and pin, or finish plucking the carcass for the growers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The birds were not eviscerated, but were cooled down and delivered to a 
shipping station where they were graded, weighed and packed for shipping. Such 
was the "New York dressed" turkey. Evisceration was a housewife chore, an 
intimacy with where food comes from lost on the modern cook. As the farm 
changes, as the bird changes, as our relationship to the turkey changes, so too 
must Thanksgiving change. 
</P>
<P>
 The turkey the Pilgrims raised once they established their colony came to them 
out of domestic Mexican stock, with roots in wild Mexican stock. Of the wild 
turkey, there are five major varieties, the range of one of which extended at 
the time of the Pilgrims into New England. The Pilgrims brought over turkeys 
from England such as the Norfolk Black, a variety that still exists, and 
crossed them with wild turkeys.  
</P>
<P>
 As domestication of the bird increased in what would become the United States, 
the bird moved west with the population. Mrs. Marcus Whitman reported seeing 
turkeys at Fort Walla Walla on Sept. 1, 1836. They must almost have been big 
enough to slaughter.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 1846, turkeys were being successfully raised on the West Coast. They would 
have been tall birds, at least three feet from turkey feet to drooping dewbill, 
that odd, wiggly, fleshy protuberance that hangs down one side or the other of 
the turkey's beak. They would have seemed black from afar, but on closer 
inspection a remarkably wide variety of coloring would have become apparent in 
their feathering: strokes of white, layers of buff, brown, and metallic bronze, 
blue-black, even rouge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard Bronze was recognized as a unique variety in 1870 by the American 
Standard of Perfection, the poultry equivalent of a pedigree, and became the 
common turkey throughout the country for any meaningful kind of meat 
production. It is the turkey most school children imagine each Thanksgiving, 
the one they draw in silhouette by tracing around their outspread fingers on 
black construction paper to represent the male turkey, the tom, hunkered down 
to puff out his chest and fan his tail feathers and turn his wattle scarlet 
red. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1928, a Whatcom County extension agent in Washington state happened to 
visit the Jesse Throessel farm across the border in British Columbia where he 
encountered toms that weighed 48 pounds and hens that weighed 25 pounds, or 
just about twice as much as they should. Throessel told the extension agent 
that his basic breeding stock had come from his brother in England, where the 
flock had been selectively bred for more than 50 years. The remarkable size had 
come from an early cross between the English Cambridge strain and the Standard 
American Bronze, and the subsequent strain had become known as John Bull. The 
Throessel strain was imported the next year into Whatcom County by a Lynden, 
Wash., farmer, who successfully crossed toms with his own flock, achieving a 
much larger bird within the same 26- to 28-week growth span.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two farmers in particular, one in Yakima County and one in Lewis County in 
Washington state, began working with the new strain in the early 1930s. One of 
them, Arthur N. Hamilton, took the new bird to the World Poultry Congress held 
in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1939. The Broad Breasted Bronze stunned the poultry 
world. As breeding stock became available and spread, first through the Pacific 
states, then across the nation, the Broad Breasted Bronze displaced the 
Standard Bronze as the American turkey of commercial choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broad Breasted Bronze didn't last all that long. Within 20 years, it was 
displaced by its white-feathered equivalent, a preference of the turkey 
processors. White feathering is a recessive characteristic and, according to 
Harper, "it only takes two generations to put white feathers on a bronze bird." 
The reasons for the selection were and remain purely cosmetic. White pin 
feathers aren't all that visible on a turkey in a display case. The dark pin 
feathers of the American Bronze, at times visible, encourage a certain 
squeamishness on the part of the ill-informed consumer. When the American 
Bronze is processed on the young side, areas of dark pigment beneath the skin 
can look like bruising. Spokesmen for the commercial turkey industry explain 
the switch to the white-feathered bird as meeting the demand of the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mark Wishard speaks of his turkeys as all-natural, he means in part that 
his turkeys actually mate with one another, which is about as old-fashioned as 
the turkey business can get. At Thanksgiving, Mark and Bard select 155 
egg-laying hens and 25 toms from the flock, and hold them over through spring 
to generate enough fertile eggs to produce the 2,500 turkeys the Wishards raise 
in a year. Any turkey not selected in fall for breeding is dead and processed 
by Christmas. "We only grow what we can kill and process ourselves," Wishard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Wishards used to raise 30,000 turkeys at a time, but within the last 10 
years it has become impractical to truck their birds to the processing plant in 
Salem. "Used to be there were all sorts of little processing plants scattered 
around," Wishard said, "but they have been closed down and forced out. Then the 
trucking company went out. And we were taking our birds over there and they 
were just getting mixed in with the rest at the co-op. And these days these are 
special birds. The allergy people just love 'em 'cause there's nothing in them 
that isn't natural.' 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say the turkeys raised by Wish Poultry are organic. While the 
Wishards mix all their own feed, the grain isn't necessarily organically grown. 
But the way the birds achieve maturity is about as natural as turkeys can get 
this side of wild. When turkeys are labeled in the market as "all-natural" all 
that means is that no preservatives and no food coloring have been added. 
Otherwise the manufacturer has to list the ingredients, a list well worth 
examining on pre-basted turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 weeks, the turkey poults the Wishards hatch are moved out of a 
wire-floored turkey house (probably the last of its kind on any commercial 
turkey farm in the nation)(ck w/ mh) and introduced to the 250 fenced acres of 
range land outside of town that will be their home until fall. Throughout the 
28-week growth cycle, the Wishards move the water station and feeding troughs 
around, and the turkeys follow after, pecking the native grasses right back to 
dirt, snatching at unwary insects, digging in their manure with their big 
turkey toes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After leading me through the turkey house, showing me the incubator, 
explaining the stages of the slaughter on the small, efficient processing line, 
Wishard drove me out to the range land to see the birds. A sign posted at the 
gate read: "NOTICE, DOGS ON THIS PROPERTY SUBJECT TO DISPOSAL." The rifle in 
the rack in the truck and the spotlight on the floorboards were not for 
poaching deer. They were for trouble. "We lost 100 birds in one night a while 
back," Wishard said. "Some dogs got in there between the time I checked the 
birds at night and came back early in the morning. It's like throwing good 
money down on the ground, that happens. A coyote'll come in every once in a 
while and kill a bird, but he'll only take the one, you know, to eat. I figure 
we all got to live. Dog's are different." 
</P>
<P>
 From afar, the turkeys looked like a mass of black-robed morticians hulking 
about. But as we drove into the range area and they spotted us, the turkeys 
moved in our direction en masse, pacing in our direction on long legs like the 
ballerina ostriches in "Fantasia," their childlike curiosity completely getting 
the better of them. As they came near, the sun picked up and highlighted their 
extraordinary feather colors and the remarkable range of color in their old, 
bald, grandmother heads, the vibrant purples and blues and reds sliding into 
scarlet. The turkey can apparently change this head color in much the same way 
as a chameleon. 
</P>
<P>
 These birds were all big, quickly reaching the optimum 13 to 15 pounds for 
hens and 22 to 24 pounds for toms. Beyond that weight, all the Wishards would 
really be doing is feeding the birds grain they wouldn't convert into meat. And 
in turkey farmer terms, that is a waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it is," Wishard said, "we feed our birds about twice as long as the 
commercial tom that's going to weigh more by 17 weeks. It takes about 100 
pounds of feed per turkey to grow it out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I looked out the rear window of the truck and a small sea of excited turkeys 
loped along behind. "We have the best flavored turkey in the world, right 
here," Wishard told me in an absolutely matter of fact tone of voice. "That's 
my opinion." He may be right, but you have to go to Prairie City, Ore., to get 
the turkey to find out for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck slowed and we were soon surrounded by more than 2,000 curious birds, 
all of them standing at least three feet high. Never before had I been the 
focus of so much pure attention, if not outright adulation. They made me feel 
like the Mahdi returned. And when I stepped among them, slamming the truck door 
and startling the flock, their constant bubbly gobble exploded into high, 
piercing trilling, a sound like a space ship lifting off. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt like raising my arms and making a speech. But the only message I could 
have given the birds gathered around me was the obvious one, that their days 
were decidedly numbered. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Wish Poultry turkeys are not available outside of Oregon at this time. The 
company has no distributor and cannot ship their product. "We're 100 miles from 
an airport," a spokeswoman with the company explained.

THE PROUD BIRD; WHITE BIRDS CAN'T DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Podolls of North Dakota have been raising white turkeys for more than 30 
years. But recently they've made the switch back to the dark, classic-looking 
Bronze.  
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, the Podolls are not merely regressing to an earlier time of 
barnyard flocks; the new birds on the farm are an "improved" bronze, which 
means that they share some of the most desirable characteristics of the 
industry's popular white birds. And while the birds are, as turkey farmer David 
Podoll puts it, "almost organic," the use of a drug to discourage coccidiosis 
disqualifies them from organic certification. (Even if the birds did receive 
organic certification, the USDA doesn't recognize present organic certification 
or allow it on labeling). To eliminate another disease hazard, the Podolls 
recently cut their flock in half, from 6,000 to 3,000 in order to raise them in 
confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Podolls new turkeys are a broad-breasted variety developed by the Kent 
Hatchery in Texas, a small breeding operation that has maintained Bronzes for 
the last 30 to 40 years -- years the dark birds have been held in disfavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Podoll, who farms with his brother, Dan, chose to go with the Bronze 
turkeys for their hardiness and personalities. "It was 1960 when we last had 
Bronzes," says David Podoll, 40. "I remember my dad remarking on their 
personalities at the time. These birds are extremely friendly. They seem to 
want to be around you all the time. You have to keep moving when you're out 
among them or they will crowd up to you and start to trample the smaller 
birds." 
</P>
<P>
 This improved Bronze, says Podoll, has high spirits, sturdy legs and a 
desirable body confirmation: although they are broad-breasted, much of the 
weight is toward the back of the breast, so the birds can stand better. And 
Bronzes have good strong legs. Some of Podoll's heaviest hens easily scale a 
four-foot fence without even attempting to fly.  
</P>
<P>
 "We like to see our birds move around," he says. "They're happy and active and 
they dance. Our hens in particular leap up in the air and turn, much like 
dancing cranes. You don't see white birds dance. The average white bird we'd 
been raising not only couldn't scale a four-foot fence, she wouldn't even try." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Podoll says, even the white bird is naturally active and inquisitive. 
"They run and play, although it's now at a much lower range," Podoll says. And 
things may get worse for the white bird; Podoll fears that the turkey industry 
may have backed itself into a corner: "We have inbred a white bird to where it 
can no longer maintain itself and we may not have the genetic pool to save it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Podolls may find that their Bronzes' hardiness, color and personality will 
be a precious commodity if white turkeys continue to inbreed in years to come.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, Podoll is just enjoying his Bronzes. "I have a need as a 
farmer to be able to spend a certain amount of time working with and among the 
birds. They respond to a relationship in a way that instills a contentment and 
security in the bird and that's important."

WESTSIDE WATCH: IT WON'T BE A BANNER YEAR FOR SANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa is out. Modern art is in. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the word in the Santa Monica business district, where lampposts will be 
decorated Tuesday with 225 brilliantly colored holiday banners and five 
overhead street scrolls created by a team of artists and art students led by 
Laddie John Dill. 
</P>
<P>
 The rotund man in red and his tiny reindeer, it seems, have been eclipsed by 
"original art." Being touted as a "gallery without walls," the holiday decor 
will include "not the typical 'Happy Holiday' scenarios," according to Dill, 
who directed the team of 15 local artists and 23 students in creating the 
banners. 
</P>
<P>
 The banners range from "the pure abstract to those depicting the human 
condition and inner dilemmas common during the holidays," said Dill, who is 
chairman of visual arts at the Santa Monica College of Design, Art and 
Architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 The works, titled "Joy," "Peace" and "Friends," were created as part of the 
city's Holiday Decor Project, which was initiated by representatives of Santa 
Monica's business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Luisa de Herrera, the city's cultural affairs administrator, said Santa 
Monica "boasts the highest concentration of artists, art galleries and cultural 
activities per capita west of New York. The project helps showcase on a 
professional level our community artists."

 PHANTOM MANAGER: Police call it the "Bust-Out" scam. A tenant poses as a 
building manager, leases an apartment to multiple renters, then flees with the 
ill-gotten deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bust-Out scam was a bust for one would-be con artist in Beverly Hills, 
police say. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 2, a woman using the last name Scott rented a two-bedroom apartment in 
the 400 block of South Maple Drive, Beverly Hills police said. She gave the 
building's manager $1,750 for the rent and deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the manager found a note pinned to her front door from a woman 
named Gloria who wanted to rent the same apartment Ms. Scott had leased. The 
note was addressed to Shayna Hicks. The surprised manager called Gloria to say 
that her name was not Shayna Hicks and that the apartment in question already 
had been rented. 
</P>
<P>
 After comparing notes, Gloria and the manager decided that Ms. Scott and 
Shayna Hicks -- who had represented herself to Gloria as the building's manager 
-- were one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager called Beverly Hills police, who staked out the apartment, shooing 
away several people who had come to answer an apartment rental ad placed in the 
newspaper by Shayna Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, Scott a.k.a. Hicks showed up to meet would-be renters. She was 
met, instead, by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Rice, 19, of Culver City was arrested on suspicion of grand theft 
and theft by false pretenses, and was discovered to have a loaded gun in her 
car, earning her the additional charge of carrying a concealed weapon in a 
motor vehicle, police said.

ON A SHOESTRING, LITERACY PROGRAM IS PATH TOWARD EMPOWERMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Jane Meyers, improving her reading and pronunciation skills this year has 
been nothing less than a spiritual experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always running away from reading. . . . But the Lord kept showing it to 
me in dreams, in letters," said the vivacious 60-year-old. "Now my dreams have 
come true. The way I read now, it's a lot, lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers and dozens of semiliterate and illiterate adults like her have found a 
form of salvation through the literacy program at West Angeles Church of God in 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, the program -- officially the West Angeles Literacy Empowerment 
Team, or WALET -- has grown steadily to become one of the largest independent 
literacy programs in the city, aiding about 200 clients in Southwest and 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the program's most remarkable attribute is its ability to flourish 
without a budget; WALET is staffed entirely by volunteers, led by project 
coordinator Gwen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thomas, the program is a personal mission that quickly took shape in the 
aftermath of the 1992 riots. During a meeting with West Angeles pastor Charles 
Blake and other church members who brainstormed ways they could improve the 
community, Thomas was driven to her feet by a sudden inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, ' education ,' and then I thought, ' literacy ,' " said Thomas, a 
former IBM sales representative and now a business instructor at West Los 
Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just stood up and said, 'I want to do this.' I had no experience at running 
any kind of program, but I deeply believe that the economic survival of African 
Americans is based on literacy." 
</P>
<P>
 With information gleaned from about 10 literacy programs she looked up in the 
Yellow Pages, Thomas assembled WALET with a core of about 10 volunteers in 
September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutors are trained and certified through the Los Angeles Public Library Adult 
Reading Project. They spend three hours a week with students -- called 
"readers" -- for a minimum of six months, though Thomas said the amount of time 
varies greatly with skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work with not just reading skills, but living and social skills too," 
Thomas said. "Often readers have to come three times to a session to just get 
comfortable. It takes a long time for somebody to admit that they can't read." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Johnson, 37, was struggling along in his community college studies 
before discovering the West Angeles project and signing up with a tutor. Now, 
he says, he not only reads better but also feels far less constrained in daily 
conversations with friends and people he meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be afraid to say things because my pronunciation and my comprehension 
wasn't good. I felt very limited because I had a third-grade reading ability," 
said Johnson, who suffered from epileptic seizures until corrective surgery 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "So people didn't realize what I had inside of me," he said. "I couldn't let 
it out. Now I can just talk without thinking. I really love that." 
</P>
<P>
 The group of volunteers has mushroomed to nearly 100 in two years, although 
the lack of an office forces tutors to meet students at local libraries, homes, 
restaurants -- anywhere that's mutually convenient, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our headquarters is the Burger King on Crenshaw," she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas, who wears an air of confidence as easily as she wears her stylish 
suits, is nothing if not determined. She recently held her second successful 
Celebrity Reading, which featured producer/actress Debbie Allen and other 
entertainers in an event designed to raise literacy awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also scouting around for temporary -- preferably free of charge -- 
WALET headquarters, though West Angeles is refurbishing a building that will 
have space in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years!" exclaimed Thomas, shaking her head. "Illiteracy is right now. 
It's growing. We can't wait that long."

CONSERVANCY REACHES TENTATIVE ACCORD ON SOKA SITE; PARKS: DEAL WOULD ALLOW 
UNIVERSITY TO PROCEED WITH EXPANSION, WHILE PRESERVING 173 ACRES OF ITS SANTA 
MONICA MOUNTAINS PROPERTY AS OPEN SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A tentative settlement between the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Soka 
University would turn 173 acres of the school's scenic Calabasas campus into 
parkland, but only after Soka's expansion plans are approved and construction 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the conservancy would be required to drop its 2-year-old eminent 
domain lawsuit, which seeks to condemn 245 of Soka's 662 acres at Las Virgenes 
Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides described the agreement as a fair deal that would save public money 
and preserve much of the school's property as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a parks agency is presented with the opportunity to get 70% of what it 
wants, including the jewel of what it wants, in this environment we would be 
absolutely foolish not to consider the offer," said the conservancy's executive 
director, Joseph T. Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
 Settling with Soka could save millions of dollars to buy other parkland, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials have long coveted Soka's property as a site for a visitors 
center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. But Soka, which 
runs a language school for 200 students, wants to expand into a liberal arts 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, Soka would move its proposed development to the east, 
away from Las Virgenes Road, and reduce its maximum proposed enrollment from 
3,400 to 2,500 over 25 years, school spokesman Jeff Ourvan confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy, in turn, would buy most of the property it is trying to 
condemn -- including the historic mansion built by razor magnate King Gillette. 
The price likely would be an average of three appraisals to be performed in the 
future, probably between $10 million and $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ourvan and Edmiston estimated that the whole deal, from the title transfer to 
Soka erecting a new administration building, would take at least five years to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact must still be approved by two parks agencies, Soka trustees and the 
judge hearing the condemnation case. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conservancy forsakes the deal and pursues condemnation, sources said, 
the ultimate price of the property could be several million dollars more than 
the conservancy's appraised value of $19.8 million once attorneys' fees and 
court costs are added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ourvan even said that the school probably would sue the conservancy for 
damages if the case goes forward, potentially adding several million dollars 
more to the conservancy's legal bills. But opponents of Soka's plans criticized 
the deal -- especially the condition under which no land would change hands 
unless the school's expansion plans were approved by the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 They said such a provision would require the conservancy and other 
environmental groups to support a destructive project to get part of the 
school's property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like a Hobson's choice," said Les Hardie, past president of the 
Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation. "It puts us in an impossible position." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Planning Commissioner Dave Brown agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will tear the community apart, that's for sure," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said he understood anger over the deal because many opponents of 
Soka's plans consider the conservancy's condemnation efforts their best hope 
for stopping the school's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, a conservancy victory is in no way assured. Even if the 
conservancy is victorious, Soka would retain the right to apply to develop the 
rest of its property. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are no doubt angry because we did not put the silver bullet in the gun 
and try to fire it and hope there was some powder," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, an arm of 
the conservancy, will meet Monday night to decide whether to sign off on the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka and the conservancy had been scheduled to face off Nov. 23 in Los Angeles 
Superior Court to determine whether the conservancy has the legal right to take 
the school's property. Park Deal at Soka 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Soka University's senic Calabasas campus would be sold to the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy under a tentative agreement to settle the 
conservancy's 2-year-old eminent domain lawsuit to seize the school's land. 
Soka now operates a language school with about 200 students on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of the Deal 
</P>
<P>
 * Conservancy would gain 173 acres at Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remaining Soka property would remain open space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conservancy would get historic Gillete Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agreement is contingent upon conservancy dropping a condemnation lawsuit and 
Soka gaining permission from Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to expand.

BUSINESS; STORE FOR LEFT-HANDERS FITS JUST RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brenda Greene is living her entrepreneurial dream as owner of Left Out, a 
Santa Monica store that markets gadgets specially made for left-handed people. 
</P>
<P>
 The small shop in Santa Monica Place carries such goods as reverse-spiral 
corkscrews, video-taped golf instruction for lefties and pens with ink that 
doesn't smear as left-handed writers move their hands across the page. 
</P>
<P>
 For the left-handed, such products can greatly simplify life, but finding the 
merchandise, Greene says, has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturers don't want to spend any time producing these goods," the 
35-year-old West Los Angeles resident said. "A lot of things can be made (for 
left-handed people) but companies see it as an obstacle and (believe) that 
there is not enough of a market." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the year her store has been in operation, Greene has managed to line 
up goods -- and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her clientele consists of right-handers buying for left-handed 
friends. But mostly, she sells directly to left-handers like Elaine Walker of 
Mar Vista. Walker had long wanted to crochet, but the only instructional books 
she could find were for right-handers -- until, that is, she entered Left-Out 
on a recent evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers can choose from more than 300 items, including calculators with hand 
grips on the right side, instructional tennis and golf videos featuring 
left-handed athletes and a corkscrew that must be turned counterclockwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from 99 cents to $116 -- in most cases a bit higher than for 
similar goods for right-handers. A set of measuring cups that can be read when 
picked up with the left hand goes for $7.99 and a kitchen knife with a 
left-hander's handle sells for $6.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene says she became interested in the business several years ago when she 
visited a store for left-handers during a trip to her home state of Indiana. A 
left-hander herself, she had long resented having to write on right-handed 
school desks, twist her wrist to read measuring cups and turn her left-hand 
upside down to use right-handed scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 Her frustrations no doubt reflect those of left-handers in the population at 
large -- about 9% of women and 13% of men. Though motivated to start her own 
store, Greene was low on entrepreneurial experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew absolutely nothing (about running a business)," she said. "I had 
worked at J.C. Penney in college and that was as close as I'd come to retail." 
</P>
<P>
 She researched how to start a business and eventually found a Massachusetts 
distributor who specialized in left-handed goods. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of friends, Greene opened Left Out in a rented space last fall 
in the Glendale Galleria. When her lease expired in May, she moved to the 
Westside shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene considers herself equal parts entrepreneur and educator. Along with the 
left-handed spiral notebooks and measuring cups she also stocks instructional 
books and flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 She likes to remind customers of famous lefties, who have included Benjamin 
Franklin, Alexander the Great, Queen Victoria, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, 
Picasso, Joan of Arc, Bach and Harpo Marx. She'll do what it takes, she says, 
to help lefties overcome the centuries-old stigma that being left-handed is 
somehow sinister, the Latin word for left. 
</P>
<P>
 "(I try) to reassure (the customers) that there is nothing wrong with being a 
lefty," she said. "I try to create a homey place. I want people to know that 
somebody out there cares and that they are special."

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; OPENING OF KIDS' CENTER BRINGS OUT SMILES 
</P>

<P>
 After nearly four years of negotiations, the Las Doradas Children's Center has 
found a new home in the Oakwood section of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Doradas, which began in 1984 as a program for latchkey children and became 
a preschool and after-school center in 1989, had occupied a rented building on 
Broadway Avenue. Earlier this year, the building was moved to new property 
owned by the Los Angeles Unified School District, next to Broadway Elementary 
School, and renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the center formally opened its doors at the new site, amid 
tributes to the city officials, private corporations, individual fund-raisers 
and neighborhood organizers who made the project possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the center's proximity to Broadway Elementary will be far more 
convenient for parents seeking preschool and after-school services -- 
particularly in a community recovering from months of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been truly a labor of love all around by people who recognize the center 
as a ray of hope in this embattled community," said Adel Martinez, the center's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, operated by the nonprofit Neighborhood Youth Assn., serves 45 
children and has two-full time teachers, two full-time aides and equipment that 
includes seven computers. Under the $150,000 project, the center's building was 
purchased from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, moved and 
renovated. The land on which the building sits is being leased from the school 
district for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is named after a group of Pacific Palisades women that has been 
raising money for charities for three decades. Since 1983, the women, who call 
themselves Las Doradas, or "the golden ones," have focused their efforts 
exclusively on the children's center, raising about $100,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those on hand to celebrate the opening of the center were actor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and KCBS-TV 
newscaster Linda Alvarez, who hosted the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a parent, I realize how important it is to invest time in our children," 
said Schwarzenegger, who donated $25,000 toward the center's renovation. At 
Thursday's ceremony, he jokingly said to the children: "Don't be angry with me 
if I come back as the kindergarten cop and ask you to do a few pushups with 
me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at the ceremony said the center's new site near Broadway Elementary 
not only is more convenient, but also gives them a greater sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 Children had more immediate objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 3-year-old Renica Turner as she stood on the center's playground: "I like 
to slide!" LORENZA MUNOZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; CITY PROTESTS RADIO HOST WHO SAID HOMELESS 
'SHOULD BE PUT TO SLEEP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Outraged by a radio talk-show host's comment that homeless people "should be 
put to sleep," the Santa Monica City Council this week sent a scathing letter 
to KFI Radio and is preparing to file a complaint with the Federal 
Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The station aired a show July 10 on which radio host Emiliano Lamon called for 
the extermination of homeless people, comparing them to stray dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found it alarming that during this show the 'extermination' of homeless 
people was discussed. This line of debate clearly falls into the category of 
advocating violence against homeless people," said the letter, signed by all 
seven council members. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked that Lamon be severely disciplined and a public apology 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamon could not be reached for comment. But Howard Neal, vice president and 
general manager of KFI, said the station has not asked the talk show host to 
apologize. Instead, Neal says, Lamon was asked to "reassess his feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said Lamon's recommendation that the homeless be "put to sleep" does not 
necessarily amount to advocating murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not formulated an opinion about it," Neal said. "If people are looking 
to be negative about it, you could make that assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I would not, personally, make that assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 In its letter, the council said it supports First Amendment protections of 
free speech, but "finds it reprehensible that KFI management permitted this 
type of irresponsible and inflammatory reporting to be aired." 
</P>
<P>
 During the broadcast, Lamon said that a solution to the "homeless problem" 
came to him in an "epiphany" when he saw a stray dog walk into traffic and get 
killed by a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It led me to a solution . . . an idea . . . to the homeless problem," Lamon 
told his listeners. "I believe homeless people, essentially, should be put to 
sleep. . . . I see no reason they should exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members decided to address the incident last month after Lamon's 
comments were brought to their attention by activist Jerry Rubin. Rubin, a 
Santa Monica resident, and several advocates for the homeless have expressed 
outrage at Lamon and KFI, demanding a public apology from the host. SUSAN

COVER STORY; YOGAMANIA; WEARY OF BODY-POUNDING WORKOUTS, FITNESS BUFFS TURN 
WITH RELIEF TO THE ANCIENT HEALING EXERCISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After years as a ballet dancer and aerobics instructor, Kim Silver's body was 
disintegrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Painful ailments dogged her daily routine and kept her awake at night. She 
suffered from tendinitis of the hip, fallen arches, arthritis in her toes and 
knees and shin splints. Whiplash from a car accident in 1986 left her with 
severe migraines. Months of physical rehabilitation failed to achieve any 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Near despair, she took a yoga class with a friend that incorporated flowing 
movements with a series of postures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It completely transformed my life," said Silver, 33, who was so taken by the 
experience that she became a yoga instructor. "Within three months I was 
pain-free, headache-free -- it was heaven. I finally had some hope." 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, yoga's abiding image in this country centered around incense, 
flaky gurus, Eastern religions and chanting hippies in pretzel poses. But in 
the last few years, the practice of yoga has exploded into the mainstream, and 
perhaps nowhere more so than on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of new devotees are flocking to yoga classes in studios, sports 
medicine clinics and health clubs. Some see the trend as a response to the 
power workouts and physical excesses of the 1980s. Experts say that yoga has 
become a refuge for baby boomers seeking something kinder and gentler to treat 
their aging bodies and frazzled psyches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our society has become so fast, and stress is epidemic," said Anne Cushman, 
associate editor of Yoga Journal, a leading trade publication based in 
Berkeley. "Yoga encourages an attitude towards the body which is not as brutal. 
It focuses on the right balance of consciousness -- staying alert but relaxed, 
peaceful yet aware, and joyful." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 2,000 years, yoga -- whose name is derived from the ancient 
Sanskrit word yuj, meaning to yoke or join together -- has remained an integral 
part of the Hindu religion. The most popular form, brought to public attention 
in the Western world in the 1960s, is hatha yoga, which emphasizes a series of 
physical postures ( asanas ), breathing ( pranayamas ) and some meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many practitioners say yoga is an art form that stresses the spiritual rather 
than the religious, and provides untold medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 For those reeling from physical injury caused by more aggressive aerobic 
activities, yoga is a welcome relief. Most enthusiasts report a greater sense 
of well-being and peace of mind. Others say their posture, digestion, 
coordination, circulation and respiration have improved greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the medical profession have taken notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Gajevski, a spokeswoman for the American Yoga Assn., a national 
education network based in Cleveland, says her organization has received 
requests for information from hundreds of patients referred by their doctors 
and chiropractors. The association recommends yoga for such illnesses as 
diabetes, arthritis, asthma, back and neck problems and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Other doctors believe yoga is a powerful antidote to heart disease, the 
nation's No. 1 killer. 
</P>
<P>
 The link between emotional stress and heart disease is much more documented," 
said Dr. Dean Ornish, director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in 
Sausalito and author of a book that advocates yoga as a means of reversing 
heart disease. "The stretching, breathing and meditation exercises in yoga 
provide a synergy and a powerful system of quieting the mind and body and 
reducing stress," Ornish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fitness instructors say yoga has gained more followers as people become 
more aware that a toned and well-muscled body is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletics is now more mind/body, combining every aspect of fitness, which 
also means having a fit mind," said Toni Brown, aerobics manager at Sports Club 
Los Angeles, who manages the facility's yoga classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of yoga's burgeoning popularity abounds. A recent Roper poll 
commissioned by the Yoga Journal showed that more than 6 million Americans now 
practice yoga, and about 17 million others expressed an interest in learning 
the ancient art. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoga videos by Jane Fonda, Kathy Smith and Ali MacGraw have heightened 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, a wide range of yoga classes has sprung up across the 
Westside. The flourishing yoga industry, which has also become a significant 
portion of the fitness business, now offers such mutations as yogarobics, yoga 
dance, yoga therapy, astro-yoga (tailoring exercises to one's astrological 
sign), double yoga (exercises with a partner), nude yoga and yoga with weights. 
Sessions usually range from 60 to 90 minutes and cost from $8 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Many yogis have for years conducted classes in the back yards of their homes. 
Now instructors teach crowded classes at athletic chains such as the Sports 
Connection and the Spectrum Club and have a dedicated at other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most successful studios, Yoga Works in Santa Monica, employs about 
30 instructors who teach 98 classes a week that range from introductory to 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, more than 40 students packed a class in power yoga, which 
incorporates a vigorous series of linked postures that combine strength and 
flexibility with aerobic conditioning. With the windows and doors shut, and 
students encouraged to breathe deeply through their nostrils, the room quickly 
assumed a greenhouse atmosphere. But participants reveled in the purifying 
effects of the hothouse environment, which is supposed to simulate the climate 
of India. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it can be awkward with people dripping all around you . . . but the 
heat creates an aura in the room and allows you to go deeper into your posture. 
It helps your body move," said Petrula Vrontikis, a student. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sita White, another power-yoga devotee: "I'm athletic and have a lot of 
nervous energy, and I couldn't just sit in another class with my foot behind my 
head. This gives me a vigorous workout challenge that strengthens and tones but 
without jarring my body." 
</P>
<P>
 But some yoga purists remain critical of what they see as a potentially 
hazardous combination of larger classes and increased aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting harder and faster, and I think you're going to see a backlash," 
said Silver, who a few years ago suffered an umbilical hernia by stretching too 
far while doing a backbend in an intermediate-level yoga class. "Sometimes the 
energy is intense, and you want to go for it . . . but teachers need to take 
responsibility. With 55 people in a class, you can't keep everyone safe. Yoga 
really needs to take a look at itself and have a humility stage." 
</P>
<P>
 But a period of humility could be far off. 
</P>
<P>
 New forms of yoga continue to sprout, offering mind-boggling choices to both 
aficionados and initiates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Triangle Studio in Santa Monica offers yoga with live flamenco music. 
Elysium Fields, a nudist camp in Topanga Canyon, runs clothing-optional yoga 
classes. Many facilities have yoga classes for children and pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin O'Kane, an instructor and owner of Angel City Yoga in Studio City, 
conducts a series of popular classes in yoga therapy for the mind as well as 
the body. Students assume various postures, which are meant to stimulate an 
emotional release. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a sad and beautiful thing," said O'Kane. "I've seen people collapse 
out of their postures and into a ball, crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Forrest, owner of Forrest Yoga Circle in Santa Monica, says her classes 
focus on healing, and that includes administering to everything from 
car-accident injuries to spiritual wounds. "Putting the body in certain 
positions . . . releases numbness and suffering and all those little emotional 
pus balls." 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, the Center for Yoga in Larchmont will begin classes in yoga dance, 
which involves assuming poses through a sequence of flowing movements. The 
center also operates double-yoga classes for partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to get into deeper poses . . . to do what we can't do by 
ourselves," said Nancy Campbell, a director at the center. "It's a unique 
American creation that works best with a partner you know. Because of the 
physical closeness, doing it with a sleazy, smelly (stranger) might not be too 
great an experience." 
</P>
<P>
 For those seeking a higher plane, there is no need to look farther than 
Beverly Hills. For the last four years, Siri Dharma Galliano, which means 
"Princess on the Path to Infinity," has offered astro-yoga classes for the 
cosmically inclined. "I put exercises together to match what is going on in the 
sky," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She currently teaches such celebrity clients as Rosanna Arquette, Linda Gray 
and LeVar Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 Each individual's sign represents an area with a focal point of tension. For 
Geminis (lungs), Siri Dharma recommends extensive breathing exercises. An 
assortment of belly grinds are best for Cancers (stomach). Scorpios (genitals) 
need postures that increase circulation to the pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all else fails, there's sex," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond trendy or offbeat practices, traditional Eastern yoga regimens are 
still taught. 
</P>
<P>
 For the roughly seven live-in students at the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Center in 
Venice, most of whom are on a work-study program, yoga instruction comes with 
spiritual guidance, a vegetarian diet, philosophy, chanting and meditation. The 
center also offers separate hatha-yoga classes to the public in several sunny 
rooms in its two-story house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people look at yoga as just an exercise, but here we emphasize tradition 
-- the exercise is just part of a complete holistic system," said Swami Atma, 
the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students prefer picturesque settings. 
</P>
<P>
 Estelle Jacobson, who calls herself "69 years young," has taught a popular 
Saturday-morning class on the beach in Marina del Rey since 1990. A recent 
group of more than 25 students included newcomers in their 20s to 77-year-old 
John Devonshire, who is recovering from quintuple-bypass heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The yogis say that you don't measure age by chronology but by the flexibility 
of the spine," said Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two decades, yoga in America has continued to grow with hybrid 
abandon, refusing easy categorization and reveling in the cross-pollinations of 
its practices. Such dynamism -- and its recent surge of mainstream popularity 
-- gives many veterans hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little amusing to see it marketed as the new fitness thing with all 
the money, the celebrity, the videos and the hype," said Yoga Journal editor 
Cushman. "But ultimately it's a positive thing . . . they will all eventually 
benefit -- more in touch with their bodies, healthier, stronger and more 
relaxed."

POLITICS: DEFEAT OF SANTA MONICA COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica City Councilman Tony Vazquez's comment that his failure to win 
his reelection bid was due to racism is an insult to Santa Monica voters and 
the democratic process ("3 Police-Backed Candidates Win Seats on Council," Nov. 
10). 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the voters of Santa Monica elected me, an East Indian immigrant 
and political neophyte, to the Santa Monica City Council.During my campaign, I 
came to know and appreciate the openness and inclusiveness of the Santa Monica 
electorate. I perceived, correctly, that the determining issues would be public 
safety and rent control, not my skin color and ethnicity. Indeed, one of the 
reasons I won election against overwhelming odds was because Santa Monica's 
liberalism has always been a significant plus for minorities and women. But 
even liberalism has its limits and it is unfair to expect Santa Monica voters 
to sacrifice their personal safety and quality of life at the altar of 
political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years that I sat with Councilman Vazquez on the council, I observed 
him cast a "no" vote on every public safety measure to come before him. This 
abysmal voting record was an important catalyst in this year's campaign. On 
Nov. 8, Santa Monica voters rejected Tony Vazquez, not because of his 
ethnicity, but because they recognized that his performance on the council did 
not address their concerns.

VENICE: WORKSHOPS ON USING PROP. A FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bohemia at the Beach" (Nov. 3), in which Kathleen Kelleher interviewed 
residents of Ocean Front Walk in Venice, was well timed. A series of workshops 
to decide how $10 million in Proposition A funds are to be spent in Venice will 
begin soon.It is important that residents express themselves. This is 
especially true for residents of Ocean Front Walk and streets such as Horizon, 
Westminster, Brooks and Rose, which bear the brunt of traffic and parking 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Kelleher's interviewees said Venice is an artistic community. Another 
said Venice is paying the price of reckless liberalism. These are views of 
committed Venetians. But they are of little importance to non-residents whose 
interests in Venice are all too often destructive to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope there will be a strong showing of bona fide residents of Venice at the 
workshops. I suggest that details about time and place be obtained by calling 
Councilwoman Galanter's office.

FOR SENIORS; 100 CANDLES AND COUNTING, SOCIAL AGENDA STILL INTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Don't write anything about me as if I have answers. I don't. I have a lot of 
questions." So says Beatrice Oppenheimer on the occasion of her 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing Oppenheimer wants people to think is that her longevity is 
attributable to some special magic or that her opinions are any more valuable 
than anyone else's. She's right, of course, but being in the presence of 
someone with her perspective, active mind and background, it's only natural to 
want to know what she thinks about things. 
</P>
<P>
 So we start with Election Day, 1994. Oppenheimer has voted in every election 
since women gained the right in 1920. She was influenced early on by her 
father, Abraham Bisno, who, at the beginning of this century, was a well-known 
labor leader in the women's garment industry of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Oppenheimer remembers her father bringing her to a meeting at which Clarence 
Darrow spoke. She remembers Sunday gatherings where literature was discussed 
along with the political issues of the day. So what's a girl to think who was 
brought up to believe that the worker was entitled to economic security, decent 
treatment on the job, satisfactory working conditions and an acceptable 
standard of living? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the dumps over the election. My father and Clarence Darrow would have 
felt the whole world had gone to hell," she said from her apartment in Santa 
Monica. In the next breath, she adds, "but they also would have wanted to 
change it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oppenheimer grew up in a time when the organized working class fought to set 
the social agenda. "The villains were on top then. They owned the railroads and 
the big manufacturing concerns and everyone else were slaves to them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oppenheimer remembers a time when workers received no pensions, no paid 
vacations, no overtime pay and no unemployment compensation. By the 1950s, not 
only did the workers have extensive job security, but they had political power. 
Her father was a part of making that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she admits, organized labor is sliding downward and with that slide 
goes a source of information for workers (although unionized workers actually 
account for less than one-fifth of America's work force). Oppenheimer thinks 
the average citizen today is not sufficiently educated to be helpful to himself 
or others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to say it, but the prevailing instinct is self-preservation -- very 
selfish. (It's) not a bad thing, but when people are only guided by what's good 
for them it's exactly that -- me, me, me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Beatrice Oppenheimer was 13 years old, she performed the lead in the 
operetta "H.M.S. Pinafore," and decided to become a singer. But her father 
insisted that she was going to learn something so that she could become 
economically self-sufficient and told her to forget being an opera singer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she went to Lewis Institute in Chicago, became a stenographer and 
continued her education in New York City, later becoming the office manager for 
the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. She resigned to spend three years 
writing "Tomorrow's Bread," a human interest story about immigrant tailors. 
</P>
<P>
 When the book was published in 1938, Oppenheimer was quoted as saying: "If it 
takes nine tailors to make a man, it has taken an entire industry to make an 
American woman. This is the story of the needle and the industry it created. 
These humble tailors constitute a brilliant motif in the complicated fabric of 
American life, and possess, in my opinion, the same literary significance as 
the wheat farmers of the Middle West, the share croppers of the Deep South, or 
the shop girls and their bosses in the East." 
</P>
<P>
 After she finished the book, she went abroad and documented labor conditions 
in Europe. She returned to Chicago to create and direct the 18,000-member Labor 
Relations Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she lives in a senior housing complex with her helper, Flora, and is 
the only surviving member of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was up to me, it would have been a different decision. Enough is 
enough. I'm losing my sight, I can't hear very well. I call myself a fallen 
woman -- I broke both of my hips. Thank God I didn't have a third one to 
break." 
</P>
<P>
 "Having less of yourself is no fun. There's no sense in saying how great it is 
to live forever -- it's a lot of bull," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She provides no good news about living a long time, but, she clearly does not 
feel her life has been wasted. "There's a big problem about our lives, not only 
why we're here, but what are we going to do in our lives," Oppenheimer said. "I 
guess everyone wants to feel they have some kind of purpose, and that's a good 
feeling at any stage in one's life -- a reason for our existence that was 
somehow fulfilled. Somehow."

MEXICO'S COSTA CAREYES; DESTINATION: MEXICO; WILD STYLE; AT A REVAMPED RESORT 
SURROUNDED BY JUNGLE AND BAY, PEOPLE ARE PAMPERD AND TURTLES PROTECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE GALBRAITH, Galbraith, a former Newsday correspondent, is now deputy 
press secretary for Los Angeles Mayor Richard J. Riordan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When someone first mentioned this Shangri-La of a place called Costa Careyes, 
a resort that is part ritzy hotel, part untouched ecological wonder and 
renowned for its giant sea turtles, all I could mutter back was, "Where? 
Careyes? Never heard of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta, Ixtapa, Cancun, sure. But never a 
resort called Costa Careyes (Spanish for Turtle Coast). 
</P>
<P>
 Like its L.A. namesake, the tony Hotel Bel-Air on the Westside's Stone Canyon 
Road (to which it is unrelated), the Hotel Bel-Air Costa Careyes looks somewhat 
like a large, sprawling Mediterranean villa. But instead of pink, it is painted 
in the most brilliant crayon colors. I am told you can spot it from the air 
when flying over it in your own private jet, or when shuttled in from 
Manzanillo or Puerto Vallarta airports in a helicopter. (Or when driving to it 
off the Pan American Highway, the approach most guests take.) 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad my Gulfstream was in the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded on all sides by jungle, this 60-room hotel is on its own private 
bay and just a short distance away from a nature preserve that has crocodiles, 
cormorants and all kinds of exotic flora and fauna, not to mention two 
championship polo fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, I think to myself after having been told all this, the place is so 
exclusive, it's obscure. But clearly it is very expensive -- with those great 
amenities you crave when daydreaming out a smoggy Downtown L.A. in midsummer.  
</P>
<P>
 I was intrigued about eco-traveling in Costa Rica -- which also boasts great 
sea turtle-watching and luxury hotels -- but it was too far away for the time I 
had, essentially a long weekend. Careyes, on the other hand, is relatively 
close -- about the same distance time-wise (five hours total) as driving to 
Yosemite from Los Angeles. Yet it felt like a true foreign getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The question was how a non-top-of-the-tax-bracket type like me could swing a 
visit to a place that is frequented by international financiers, Hollywood 
glitterati and polo-playing royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 When I checked up on Careyes' past, I learned of its jet-set history. It was 
founded in the late '60s by Italian financier Gian Franco Brignone as a winter 
playground for him and his polo-playing buddies such as British industrialist 
Sir James Goldsmith, cereal heir Francis Kellogg and Italian automobile tycoon 
Gianni Angelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Brignone sold the hotel and a dozen or so adjacent casitas , or hillside 
townhomes -- a resort formerly known as Hotel Costa Careyes -- two years ago to 
Hoteles Bel-Air Mexico, and it has since undergone a multimillion-dollar 
face-lift. The pool alone looks like it cost a million.  
</P>
<P>
 There are antique Mexican artifacts in the hallway alcoves, a sauna and gym 
and landscaping to rival the L.A. County Arboretum.  
</P>
<P>
 How to pay for this slice of paradise? My friend, Reagan Gray, a Los Angeles 
advertising executive, came up with the answer: We went off-season, shared a 
room, and ate breakfast and dinner only. We went last August, leaving on a 
Thursday flight and returning late Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 We landed in a rainstorm at Puerto Vallarta (summer is the wet season in the 
tropics: hot and muggy) and arranged to be picked up by the hotel van, rather 
than renting a car.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes south of P.V., the skies cleared and we headed through lush, steep 
forests that dramatically nose-dive into the Pacific. Along the coast we passed 
Gargantuan high-rise hotels popular two decades ago and woefully dated now.  
</P>
<P>
 Up over the mountains we went, then headed down into a flat farm region. 
Cattle grazed fearlessly right alongside the highway. The adobe and thatched 
homes of the country villages were a strange contrast to the road's speed 
bumps, which signal the presence of underground high-tech fiber optic cable 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long drive -- two hours and 15 minutes -- we turned off the highway 
and onto the cobblestone road leading to the hotel. At the end of a long lawn 
laced with coconut palms, the van emerged to reveal a grand, tri-level, 
bougainvillea-disguised hotel with a high, wide arched entrance that frames the 
blue bay beyond. The air was clear, the grounds pristine.  
</P>
<P>
 The office manager greeted us with glasses of "Careyes nectar" (blended 
pineapple, papaya and banana) and said he'd show us around the compound and 
then escort us to our room.  
</P>
<P>
 "Did an artist paint this place?" I asked. The stucco walls are washed in a 
mesmerizing assortment of colors, executed in glorious juxtaposition under 
massive wood beams. A yellow archway, long white halls, a magenta walk-through, 
more white walls, a chartreuse entryway . . . so it goes on in a vibrant 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "Careyes style," our guide told us, and it was inspired by some of 
Mexico's best architects who have designed many of the private villas nearby. 
But it was hard to concentrate on a recitation of the hotel's amenities when a 
pinkish-gold sunset was washing out over the horizon.  
</P>
<P>
 My instant comparison was to Point Lobos at Big Sur because this sheltered 
cove offered equal, if not greater, drama with its giant rocky islands jutting 
out of the water. My instant urge was for margaritas and chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for us, the hotel was at 70% occupancy and we were offered an upgrade to 
a suite with a balcony from which to watch the sunset.  
</P>
<P>
 Whiteness was the overwhelming sensation of this room: white walls, white 
shutters and white bedspreads, with tons of natural light and touches of color 
here and there such as the "Bienvenidos" message that was written in red seeds 
on the coffee table. Nice. My favorite thing, though, was the six tiny 
Guatemalan worry dolls, packed in an oval wooden box and placed on each pillow. 
The enclosed description said that the tradition is to wish away one worry per 
doll, then place them under your head at bedtime and by morning all troubles 
will be gone.  
</P>
<P>
 I ran out of worries on the third night. 
</P>
<P>
 I mentioned to the office manager that we wanted to take a turtle excursion, 
but little did I assume an outing could be pulled together that very first 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moon is full," he said by way of explanation. And so it was. More chances 
to see turtles under a full moon. The witching hour was 11 p.m. That gave us 
just enough time for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans dine late, as we quickly found out after sitting down in the 
virtually empty hotel dining room at 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
 As the room filled up, we went through a bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay 
to accompany my rock lobster Fra Diablo and Reagan's sierra (a kind of snapper) 
in black bean tomato salsa, followed by banana crepes smothered in rum raisin 
and goat's-milk caramel sauce. The chef came by later to tell us that both our 
choices were bought from local fishermen that morning. It's not often you get 
fish so fresh it melts over your tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 We then raced to change for our turtle safari. 
</P>
<P>
 Off with the dresses and sandals, on with some bug repellent around the 
ankles, then long pants. We piled into a Cambio (a Volkswagen bus still made in 
Mexico) for a 15-minute drive to Teopa, the next beach south, escorted by the 
resort's biologist Alejandro Pena, a translator and the office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Teopa Beach is still owned by Brignone, and it is he who allows hotel guests, 
biologists from the University of Guadalajara, fishermen and others to cross 
the gates onto his sprawling property. Here, at the site of the Costa Careyes 
Polo Club, lies the turtle egg preservation program that Brignone initiated in 
1977. The cost for the turtle watching tour is $25 per person, and worth every 
cent; money goes into a preservation trust that is used to help save the carey 
(as in Careyes; also known as hawksbill), leatherback, black and ridley sea 
turtles. The moonlit beach is a wonder unto itself. Crashing, glowing waves 
create a orchestra of sound on this vast, empty beach, which seems to stretch 
the lengths of several football fields.  
</P>
<P>
 We came upon a funky-looking pen built of driftwood and chicken wire, which is 
where Pena and others bury the turtle eggs they've dug up from other parts of 
the beach. A sign hanging on the pen's gate proclaims that 62,143 turtle eggs 
have been brought to this spot -- and 35,560 baby turtles returned to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena explained that he, with the help of other locals, come here around 
midnight every day during egg-laying season -- July through November -- to 
quietly watch for the turtles, which emerge from the sea and make their way 
onto the beach to dig holes, lay eggs and cover them over with sand. 
</P>
<P>
 We looked for fresh tracks as he bemoaned the enemy, turtle egg poachers who 
continue to be these creatures' nemeses around the globe. As with rhino horns 
in Africa and tiger penises in China, there is a folk belief that eating turtle 
eggs will enhance virility. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the beach, a local man suddenly yelled that he'd spotted fresh 
leatherback turtle tracks. We ran to meet up with him, but just missed her, 
despite the fact that the creatures take 45 minutes to lumber ashore and lay 
their eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "God! They really are giant," we agreed as we took turns putting our hands in 
the tracks. Leatherbacks weigh about 1,200 pounds, and sea turtles generally 
live 40 to 70 years.  
</P>
<P>
 By 1 a.m., with no sign of turtles, we left, vowing to return. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The morning revealed the sights of Careyes. The hotel sits on its own beach, 
Playa Rosa. Across the bay is Club Med Playa Blanca, well out of view and 
closed in summer. There are no other hotels nearby, but from our beachfront 
bistro table at breakfast we could see the dozens of thatch-roofed designer 
palapas that dotted the surrounding steep hills. Painted in bright pink, coral 
and blue, these open-air villas sell for about $1.5 million a pop at the low 
end.  
</P>
<P>
 I looked on the buffet for Mexican pastries, a favorite indulgence, and was 
disappointed to find only Danish and croissants -- even if they were fresh. I 
went for the fresh papaya with lime instead, and drank the local brew -- coffee 
with sweetened milk. Reagan took advantage of the spa-cuisine option by having 
an egg-white-only omelet, but then loaded her plate with a side of chilaquiles 
(a fabulous dripping concoction of tortilla chips, chilis, cheese and green 
salsa). So much for calorie counting.  
</P>
<P>
 Books and SPF-30 sunscreen in hand, we walked a few feet to the hotel's giant 
amoeba-shaped pool that runs nearly the length of the beach. The sun was 
searing during this time of year, so I went in the water once every 15 minutes 
or so, taking particular advantage of one side of the pool, which is about 
three inches deep and several feet in diameter; one can just lie here and 
vegetate. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing skyward, looking through the palms, my brain was happily turning to 
mush. Our day's big activity was getting a massage and arranging a 
late-afternoon visit to the nearby lagoon and nature habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crocodiles . . . really?," I said to Pena, the biologist, when he came by the 
pool to make sure that we wanted to go. It sounded like an adventure.  
</P>
<P>
 The same group that went turtle-watching was on board for this excursion. We 
piled into a weathered Jeep Cherokee and took off.  
</P>
<P>
 It looked like rain forest, and felt like rain forest. Sticky, wet and 
mysterious -- a world away from the hotel, but only 1 1/4 miles south. It was 
drizzling, and a storm was predicted. The mosquitoes were out in force 
(mercifully, there didn't seem to be any at the resort). 
</P>
<P>
 Pena , a shy man who seemed to commune with nature better than with people, 
answered questions about our setting, Reserva de la Biosfera, a habitat for 270 
species of birds and an amazing array of wildlife that includes jaguars, tigers 
and puma and thousands of native plants.  
</P>
<P>
 We got into a metal boat and rowed to the middle of the lagoon. As if 
choreographed, fish would pop out of the water as Pena talked. Plop. Plop. 
Plop. A cormorant watched us from a respectful distance before fluttering 
loudly away as we got closer. We were fairly far from shore when Pena got to 
the crocodile population: 300 at last count. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many?" the hotel office manager asked, looking horrified. This was his 
first excursion too; he was a relatively new employee. Suddenly, he becomes the 
reporter, all questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "How deep is it here? Are they aggressive? Will they jump out of the water? 
How big do they get? What do they eat?" 
</P>
<P>
 We started scouting for them and could see them everywhere. But since they are 
quite shy we ended up spending two hours looking at hundreds of spooky eyes and 
spines. Yikes!  
</P>
<P>
 Pena broke the tension by informing us there were exactly as many males and 
females. "Crocodilos contentos, " he said. Contented crocs. So they won't be 
eating us after all, we laughed.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the hotel, a lightning storm entertained us at dinner as we ate 
alfresco in a light breeze, dining on roasted poblano chilis and another 
wonderful local fish, huachinango (red snapper), served on a bed of leeks with 
champagne sauce. Dessert was a super-rich, distinctly flavored "three-milk" 
cake that is a Mexican delicacy. We felt like we earned this treat. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, on our second turtle hunt, Pena passed out plastic bags in case 
anyone got lucky finding eggs. Our second-night group grew to 10 as other hotel 
guests joined the outing. Unfortunately, once again no one saw any turtles, not 
even tracks.  
</P>
<P>
 My third day in Costa Careyes I could have gone kayaking, or sail boarding or 
snorkeling, or even toured the closest town worth visiting, Barra de Navidad, a 
45-minute drive away. But Saturday was cloudy with intermittent rain showers: 
excellent beach strolling weather. The surf was warm on the toes and the 
drizzle cool on the skin. When the sun poked through, the atmosphere changed 
instantly and an ocean dip seemed ideal. I swam with schools of fishes and went 
bodysurfing. I'll come back, I thought, with a guy. This place is so romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, while I'm changing for dinner -- wouldn't you know? -- a giant turtle 
swam up to the hotel, not 30 feet from our balcony. I learned this later from 
another guest. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's nothing like a daiquiri, a bottle of chilled Mexican Montexanic 
Cabernet and a Sonoran beef filet with poblano sauce (for me) and New York 
steak with shiitake mushrooms and potatoes (for Reagan), to dull the 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we saw the eyes and spines of ' crocodilos contentos '," Reagan joked. 
Perhaps turtles weren't in my stars after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I should come back in the winter and take a polo lesson instead.

<P>
 Five Sundays ago, in a cover story on San Francisco hotels, I offered up a 
pair of top 10 lists -- my favorites for style and for value. Now comes the 
feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys, you blew it!!" opined Lucy Harrison on the back of a postcard from 
Santa Ana. On the expensive, stylish end of the spectrum, she likes the 
Stouffer Renaissance Stanford Court Hotel (905 California St.; tel. 
415-989-3500; brochure rates for two people: $235 nightly and up) for its 
service and view, and for its in-house restaurant, Fournou's Ovens. (The 
Stanford Court didn't make my list.) 
</P>
<P>
 "How could you overlook the Savoy?" asked Judith A. Horan of Corona. She 
called the Savoy (580 Geary St.; tel. 415-441-2700; brochure rates: $119 and 
up) cozy, friendly and conveniently located near theaters and Union Square. She 
also suggests we ask for her favorite bellman, Benjamin, and heartily endorses 
its restaurant, La Brasserie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised that the Cartwright Hotel (524 Sutter St.; tel. 415-421-2865; 
brochure rates $139 and up) was not included on your list of the top 10 for 
value," wrote John Apostolou of Los Angeles, noting its prime location, low 
rates, cleanliness and antique furnishings.  
</P>
<P>
 "What about the Donatello?" (501 Post St.; tel. 415-441-7100; brochure rates 
$155 and up) asked K.H. Kent of Los Angeles. "Convenient location. Friendly 
service. Indoor parking. Good restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Muriel Blankfort of Los Angeles, meanwhile, suggested that my lists "made it 
appear to me that Nob Hill does not exist. To my mind -- and I've stayed at 
them all over 30 years -- the Huntington (1075 California St.; 415-474-5400; 
brochure rates $185 and up) is the most elegant in San Francisco (and where I 
always stay). And to omit the Fairmont (950 Mason St.; tel. 415-772-5000; 
brochure rates $189 and up) is to omit the grande dame . . . These hotels stand 
for something." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I didn't entirely omit the Nob Hill hotels; I noted that they remain 
venerated but that in that neighborhood I preferred the newer Ritz-Carlton. And 
I didn't entirely ignore the Fairmont; I said its lobby reminded me of an aged 
performer trying to look young by using more makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 I also suggested that the Sir Francis Drake Hotel seemed like a tired place, 
despite recent renovation. "Tired? Yes," began M.L. Schiavi of Norwalk in a 
sort of rebuttal. "But where else can you check out the line at Sears 
Restaurant (an aged and much-beloved breakfast joint across the street) or step 
out onto the roof to gaze south of Market?" 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Madden of Long Beach cast her vote with the Orchard Hotel (562 Sutter 
St.; tel. 415-433-4434; brochure rates $110 and up), lauding the lobby and 
advising that "the best rooms are at the rear of the hotel overlooking a green 
space ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Madill of Coronado endorsed the Harbor Court Hotel (165 Steuart St.; tel 
415-882-1300; brochure rates $150 and up, to rise $5 in 1995), citing "great 
decor in small but excellently furnished rooms," and its Embarcadero location. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, my top 10 for style (in alphabetical order) were: Campton 
Place, the Four Seasons Clift Hotel, The Inn at the Opera, The Inn at Union 
Square, The Majestic, the Mandarin Oriental, the Hotel Milano, Petit Auberge 
and the White Swan Inn (a tie), The Ritz-Carlton and The Sherman House. For 
value I chose (again, alphabetically): the Andrews Hotel, Hotel Bedford, The 
Carlton Hotel, Chancellor Hotel, The Fitzgerald and the Hotel Sheehan (a tie), 
the Golden Gate Hotel, the Hostel at Union Square, the Hotel Nikko, the San 
Remo Hotel and the Hotel Triton. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hotels I mentioned, several people singled out for praise the Four 
Seasons Clift -- which come January is expected to take on new management and 
be known simply as the Clift -- but one couple called it the "worst place we 
ever stayed." And though I didn't mention it, a couple of correspondents 
complimented the Warwick Regis Hotel (490 Geary St.; tel. 415-928-7900; 
brochure rates $105 and up). 
</P>
<P>
 Linda A. Harris of Los Angeles, slightly stretching my request that replies be 
limited to 25 words, sent in a sort of bonus haiku in celebration of her 
favorite place. Her entire note: 
</P>
<P>
 "Soaking in the bathtub at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, sipping a good 
California red while gazing at the fog rolling in over the Golden Gate Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Regina L. Lujan of Torrance wrote to express pleasure at seeing the Golden 
Gate on my list, and offered her testimonial: "The reason we enjoyed it so much 
. . . is: I hate high-rise buildings, air-conditioning and sealed windows. On 
an exceptionally warm weekend the room we had overlooked the rear garden and 
was pleasantly cooled through the open windows." 
</P>
<P>
 Of them all, my favorite correspondent was Quinn Bouma, age 9, of Anaheim, who 
reported that he and his sister recently flew on their own to San Francisco 
(where their grandparents met them at the airport) and greatly enjoyed the 
Hotel Beresford Arms (701 Post St.; tel. 415-673-2600; brochure rates $89 and 
up). "What I liked about the hotel," wrote Quinn, "was that they had tea and 
rolls in the morning and cheese and crackers at noon." Quinn also liked the 
restaurant Allez-Allez and its "potato leak soup."Illustration by J. D. CROWE

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; MARKETPLACE OPENS IN HONOLULU

<P>
 A $100-million waterfront development -- the Aloha Tower Marketplace -- opens 
this weekend at Honolulu Harbor on the island of Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominated by the renovated 10-story Aloha Tower and fringed by coconut palms, 
the 190,000-square-foot marketplace opens with more than 100 merchants and will 
eventually house 200 shops, restaurants and an outdoor bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketplace is the first phase of a planned 22-acre redevelopment of the 
waterfront. Built in 1926, Aloha Tower was for many years the first sight to 
greet tourists when everyone arrived by boat and it remained the tallest 
structure in Honolulu for decades. But the arrival of jet traffic in 1959 and 
skyscrapers overshadowed the harbor and its landmark tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and tourism officials hope the Aloha Tower Marketplace will tempt 
residents and visitors back to the waterfront and revitalize the area just as 
Baltimore's Harborplace and Boston's Faneuil Hall Marketplace have done. One 
reason for their optimism is James W. Rouse, the mastermind behind the East 
Coast projects and a partner in this one. And all three share the same 
architect -- D'Agostino, Izzo & Quirk Architects. 
</P>
<P>
 The new development which also has two new passenger ship terminals, is about 
five miles from Waikiki. Dingy warehouses and concrete ramps have given way to 
graciously arched buildings topped with green-tile roofs, hundreds of trees and 
14,000 blooming plants. Unlike Honolulu's nearby downtown, which is nearly 
deserted after dark, it will stay open until 10 p.m., with many restaurants and 
clubs open until 2 a.m. SUSAN ESSOYAN

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; PUT IT IN PARK AT LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If parking at Los Angeles International Airport is the worst part of your 
trip, you may be interested in Airport Valet, the only parking service of its 
kind at LAX, according to a spokeswoman at the L.A. Department of Airports. On 
your way to the airport, you pick up a valet driver at the company's offices on 
Sepulveda or Century boulevards and head for your departure terminal. Once 
there, the valet takes the wheel and returns your car to Airport Valet's 
facilities. Upon your return, a call to Airport Valet produces your car 
curbside at baggage claim. Rates are $8.45 per day for stays of seven days or 
more; $13.20 for stays of one to six days. Information: (800) 32 VALET. Amtrak 
Offers Holiday Discount 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak will knock from $5 to $25 off rail fares between Jan. 9 and March 31 
for travelers who ride the train through the end of the year and save the 
discount coupon in the ticket jacket. Information: (800) USA-RAIL. New Limits 
for Lost Luggage? 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Transportation has proposed increasing the limit on 
compensation for lost or damaged luggage from $1,250 to $1,850 per passenger 
for domestic trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Compensation rates have not been changed since they were set 10 years ago, 
according to Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. He said the limit is 
intended to balance the amount necessary to cover the value of most passengers' 
baggage while allowing the airlines to protect themselves from excessive 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign carriers all face the same liability -- $9.07 per pound of lost or 
damaged luggage, up to 70 pounds, or $634.90, as established by the provisions 
of the Warsaw Convention, a treaty on international travel. Face Lift for Queen 
Elizabeth 2 
</P>
<P>
 Cunard Line launched a $45-million overhaul of the Queen Elizabeth 2 last week 
by donating 1,500 pieces of used furniture -- mostly elegant tables and chairs 
and leather love seats -- to the Salvation Army in New York. The luxury liner 
is headed to Hamburg, Germany, where it will undergo a 30-day refurbishment, 
the first major overhaul since 1987. It will return to its home port of 
Southampton, England, next month.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: LAS VEGAS; THE STRIP SAYS, 'KIDS, GOT CLEAN THRILLS FOR YOU, 
BUT YOU GOTTA BRING YOUR BORING PARENTS. DEAL?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Gorman is a Times' Metro writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Years ago as a child, I was whisked through Glitter Gulch as a persona non 
grata ; my parents plunged through a casino in search of cheap shrimp 
cocktails, tugging me tightly in tow. If I stalled for even a moment, some goon 
in uniform curtly admonished my dad to keep me moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas was no place for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 And now here we are, family of four, in a hotel room 30 stories above the 
Strip, feeling downright welcomed by the city's marketing ploy to tap Middle 
America: Bring the kids!  
</P>
<P>
 What a street scene: a fire-belching volcano, a pyramid with its high beam 
cutting a white shaft to heaven, an oversized lion protecting Dorothy and her 
Emerald City friends, and pirates beating the snot out of English seamen. 
</P>
<P>
 Having written about the Disneyfication of Las Vegas for The Times, I 
unwittingly piqued the curiosity of our two kids -- Paul, 18, and Cassie, 13. 
Jeanne and I agreed a three-night family getaway -- especially if we ignored 
the slots -- could be fun. For the most part, the rooms and meals are good 
values here, discounted to draw gamblers to town who'll return their savings to 
the casinos anyway. But we'd be too smart for that. 
</P>
<P>
 We booked a two-queen-bed room at Treasure Island, the classy but less-endowed 
sister of the Mirage, for $79 a night. (A room at Disneyland would cost, what, 
twice that?) 
</P>
<P>
 After our five-hour drive, we rewarded ourselves after a speedy check-in by 
going poolside (although to our dismay we had to traipse in suits along the 
side of the casino games). Jeanne and I tested the pool bar and the kids tried 
out the 30-foot-high water slide. It was tame by teen-age standards but, on the 
other hand, the only hotel water slide on the Strip. (There's a great water 
slide park on the Strip, Wet 'n Wild, but we passed on it for this trip.) 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of our Vegas escape came that first night: Cirque du Soleil's 
show Mystere, in a specially built showroom at Treasure Island. Mystere is the 
second-priciest show in town ($52.80 with tax, compared to Mirage techno 
magicians Siegfried & Roy at $78.35) but we think the most awe-inspiring: an 
inventive, poetic presentation of choreographed human strength -- part ballet, 
part brawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day we dropped our teens at Grand Slam Canyon, the small amusement 
park under glass adjacent to Circus Circus. The time alone allowed Jeanne and 
me to browse through hotel shops and lay by the pool to unwind. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Slam Canyon, which costs $15 per person for unlimited rides -- won 
favorable reviews from Paul and Cassie. There are only a handful of rides, a 
couple of them quite wet. But the kids repeated the double-loop roller coaster 
several times, and had a riot in the laser-tag arena. Players in teams "shoot" 
each other in the dark with harmless, light-emitting beams that activate 
targets on opposing players' shoulders. More fun and less dangerous than 
throwing snowballs. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening we anchored at Treasure Island. The hotel's street-front pirate 
show -- an engaging battle of epithets and cannon fire -- really is a blast and 
is best seen twice. Get there 30 minutes early, find a spot on the bridge 
leading to the hotel to watch one side of the action, then flip-flop for the 
next show. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance of the night was spent inside Treasure Island's youth fun zone, a 
collection of video games and carnival midway activities called "Mutiny Bay." 
Cassie was popping balloons with darts while Paul was lost in the videos, 
destroying alien spiders. Neither dared climb the pirate ladder. I vented 
freeway-driving frustrations by playing whack-a-mole. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 3 was spent at the new MGM Grand theme park and midway. MGM thankfully 
realized the park wasn't worth the original admission price of $25 and dropped 
it to $18.95. Still too steep, it's now down to $13. If you just want to 
accompany the kids but eschew the rides, you can get in for free and just 
browse the shops while kids play. 
</P>
<P>
 The log ride with its final plummet offered a cooling drench, but a boat 
cruise through a movie "back lot" was cornball. And its version of a roller 
coaster lasted only a minute, compared to the two-minute ride at Grand Slam 
Canyon, according to timekeeper Paul. No reflection on our high-brow cultural 
upbringing, but Jeanne and I got our biggest hoots at a live Three Stooges 
show, where a spirited Larry, Moe and Curly were having enough fun to interact 
with the audience as they went through their classic shtick of slapstick abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We retreated to MGM's midway games. Together we dropped about $50 on dollar 
games and please don't bother asking what we have to show for it (but can I 
interest you in a small stuffed purple dragon?). After we exhausted the MGM, we 
took pedestrian bridges for a midnight walk across the Strip to the Excalibur, 
a previous favorite haunt. Be warned: Even with my wife and two children there, 
sidewalk smut peddlers in front of the Excalibur thrust escort-service handouts 
in my face, and I had to explain to Cassie what the jerk meant by "room 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day we checked out of Treasure Island and spent a couple hours at the 
Forum Shops at Caesars. Paul and Cassie found can't-live-without T-shirts and 
hats at the Warner Bros. memorabilia store. By now I figured it was cheaper to 
buy souvenirs over the counter than to win them in a midway game. 
</P>
<P>
 Last stop in town: the pyramid-shaped Luxor. The hotel's signature, "The 
Secrets of the Luxor Pyramid," is a three-part ride, $13 per person. Part 1 was 
the best of the trilogy: a simulated airborne ride through the interior of a 
pyramid on your way to rescue something or somebody. Never mind the plot and 
just brace yourself for a jarring, convulsing ride with the kind of technology 
unveiled at Disneyland's Star Tours. In Part 2, you're seated in a mock 
television studio that's part live, part video and where the keynote event is a 
3-D experience. For Part 3, you're sitting in the world's steepest theater and 
confronted with a giant, vertical screen where the convoluted plot of this 
trilogy gimmick is supposed to be wrapped up. By now the kids were shaking 
their heads trying to make sense of it all, and I just wanted to go on Part 1 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no midway at the Luxor (thank goodness) but its Sega video games with 
over-sized display screens were the best on the Strip. Three virtual-reality 
games each cost $4. In one, you're a jet pilot, turned into every possible 
position to challenge your equilibrium. In another, you're a gunman in a 
darkened space tub, but Cassie said the instructions were too quick and 
confusing and termed the ride "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Their favorite Vegas game: "Virtua Formula," where you're one of eight race 
car drivers pitted against one another by video screens and interactive 
computers. As the cars fishtail and rumble in sync with your steering and 
speed, the view on the screen in front of you is from your own, 
behind-the-wheel perspective. Great fun, if not a tad pricey for a 2 1/2-minute 
race. Cassie thought it was worth it; the youngest and only girl of the eight 
racers, she won. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions: The Treasure Island buffet was excellent; lunch at the Luxor's 
cafe lets you gaze and wonder at the interior of the pyramid; lunch at the MGM 
theme park didn't gouge us, and inside the MGM there's a fast-food court that 
even has McDonald's. But if you're driving around, head east a few blocks from 
the Strip to Maryland Parkway for fast-food alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans of the Treasure Island pool, we sneaked a peak at the pools at MGM 
and Luxor, and thought MGM's looked like the most fun on the Strip. There's no 
water slide but it's bigger than most, had waterfalls and even a sandy beach 
for castle-building. All pools in Vegas close at dusk, if not earlier, and none 
are deeper than 3 1/2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Our biggest concern about coming to Vegas was exposing our children to 
gambling because Vegas now presents itself as a G-rated slice of Americana, and 
we have our misgivings. Indeed, with just one significant exception, kids in 
Vegas can't avoid the casino scene and literally brush up against the slots. 
The exception is at the Luxor, where the entertainment level is separate from 
the casino downstairs and the gambling games are easily and altogether avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Vegas becoming family-friendly in order to groom kids as future gamblers of 
America? At Treasure Island, our kids enrolled in the Mutiny Bay Club, 
promising them a newsletter and special premiums. It's just like the 
slot-machine clubs with membership cards that the casinos are offering adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only quandary we faced upon our arrival home was where Cassie was 
going to put all her new stuffed toys. Budget for Four

DESTINATION: THE NETHERLANDS; PILGRIMS' PROGRESS; IN AMSTERDAM AND LEIDEN, 
TRACING THE YEARS SPENT IN HOLLAND BEFORE THEY SAILED TO THE NEW WORLD

 Standing in the enormous Dam Square in the center of old Amsterdam, I was 
tempted to block out the sounds of the trams, cars and pedestrians; to envision 
this most modern of European cities when it was home to the Pilgrims, in the 
decade before they journeyed to America. My husband and I were here to connect 
with a part of our American heritage, to travel back to the roots of that most 
American of holidays, Thanksgiving. We had come to the Netherlands to walk in 
the Pilgrims' footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1608, a dozen years before the Pilgrims left England to establish New 
England's first permanent settlement in what became Plymouth Colony, they first 
sought refuge in Holland, in "the Low Countries, where they heard (there) was 
freedom of Religion for all men," according to the writings of Pilgrim William 
Bradford. Although the Holland of their time proved too liberal for the 
Pilgrims, during their stay there they absorbed subtle aspects of Dutch ideas 
and traditions that they brought to their American home and, eventually, into 
our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17th-Century Amsterdam that was the first stop on their journey was the 
center for an explosion of geographic exploration and international commerce. 
Established in 1602, the Dutch East India Co. was trading, among other things, 
the domestic pottery that made Delft famous, and Ming porcelain from China. The 
population was cosmopolitan, representing a cross-section of the world, 
including Germans, Poles, Hungarians, French, Spanish, Muscovites, Persians, 
Turks and Indians -- most of whom came to buy and sell. Newcomers camped in 
temporary shelters outside the city walls while streets were laid and houses 
erected. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking through crowded Dam Square and listening to the intonations of an 
unfamiliar language, it was easy to imagine the confusion of the Pilgrim 
farmers from pastoral England. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amstel river flowed freely through the Pilgrims' Dam Square -- the city's 
heart -- on its way toward the harbor linking it with countries beyond. The 
Dutch preoccupation with international commerce was reflected in the buildings 
surrounding the square. Except for the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church) and the Town 
Hall, the main buildings were warehouses for Dutch traders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Dam Square remains the setting of much of Amsterdam's public life. 
Nieuwe Kerk, first mentioned in writings from around 1400, continues to 
dominate the skyline, although it is now used not for religious purposes but as 
a public house where concerts and art exhibitions are held. Other historic 
buildings -- including the Town Hall -- have since disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best place to experience Amsterdam as the Pilgrims found it is in 
the Amsterdam Historical Museum. Located in a quiet courtyard off Kalverstraat, 
a few miles south of Dam Square, in a series of 17th-Century buildings that 
during the Pilgrim's time housed the Civic Orphanage, the museum covers the 
history of the city from the mid-13th Century to the present and puts 
Amsterdam's past into perspective, making subsequent walks around town more 
informative. 
</P>
<P>
 Although identifying titles are in Dutch, the museum provides booklets with 
English translations. Yet many exhibitions need little explanation: An 
illuminated flat plan of the city shows how the city grew; a light picks out 
each 25-year period down through the centuries and simultaneously illuminates 
the relevant phase of the city's growth; paintings depict the city's historic 
landmarks as they were when originally constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door is the Begijnhof courtyard: a magnificent diamond-shaped cobblestone 
collection of 17th-Century buildings. Although the houses are still occupied 
today, to enter the courtyard is to step back in time. The courtyard was 
constructed in 1346 as a cloister for Roman Catholic lay sisters. But in 1578, 
when the Reformation swept Holland, all Catholic churches became Protestant, 
including the one (now known as the English Reformed Church) standing within 
the Begijnhof. (A concealed Catholic church was subsequently located in one of 
the houses.) 
</P>
<P>
 The passageway connecting the Begijnhof to the Historical Museum is hung with 
oversize canvas paintings of the Amsterdam civic guard -- a group of marksmen 
that formed a union for civic defense and to help maintain public order at the 
end of the 14th Century. They later founded guilds for archers, crossbowmen and 
men with early firearms. These group portraits, often painted at their annual 
banquets, hung in their respective guild houses, like group photos from a 
reunion. About 50 of these paintings hang here, the largest collection of its 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The glimpses these enormous paintings offer into the extravagant splendor of 
the age contrast sharply with the hard life the Pilgrims led in Amsterdam. "For 
though they saw fair and beautiful cities," Pilgrim William Bradford later 
wrote, "flowing with abundance of all sorts of wealth and riches, it was not 
long before they saw the grim and grisly face of poverty." Bradford himself, 
being a man of private means, was exempt from the hardship that befell the 
majority of the Pilgrims. Excluded from most of the trades by the powerful 
guild system, the Pilgrims were forced to take on poorly paid, unskilled work 
in the wool, leather and metal trades. It was Amsterdam's exclusive guild 
system, compounded by quarrels with other separatist groups such as the 
Brownists, another Protestant sect from England, that led the Pilgrims just 
eight months later to relocate to Leiden, then the second largest city in 
Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leiden that Bradford wrote of as being "a fair & bewitifull citie, and of 
a sweete situation," is still palpable 300 years later. Until recently the town 
was not prosperous, making it a time capsule of sorts for experiencing the 
past. We found the best visual view of Leiden from the Burg, or citadel, an 
artificial circular mound -- the town's only hillock -- and the point where the 
Old and New Rhines unite at the town's center. The Burg is 150 feet in diameter 
at its summit and crowned by an old brick fort. It looks down on the black-tile 
roofs of the houses that separate it from the river. The city's most 
conspicuous features survive, including the two great Reformed churches where 
the Pilgrims were not allowed to worship but under which they buried their 
dead: St. Pancras, Hooglandsche Kerk (Church of the Highlands) and Pieterskerk 
(St. Peter's Church). 
</P>
<P>
 Leiden University weighed heavily in the Pilgrims' decision to relocate there. 
One of their leaders, John Robinson, a Cambridge-educated man, believed the 
scholarly environment would be sympathetic to their cause. He made a direct 
appeal to the Council of Leiden to obtain permission to settle in the city. The 
council granted them residency on grounds that "they refuse no honest persons 
free ingress to come and have their residence in this city; provided that such 
persons behave themselves and submit to the laws and ordinances." A copy of 
that request, entered in the court journal, became among the first in which the 
group was officially referred to as the Pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
 The document is housed in the Leiden Pilgrim Document Center, located behind 
the Municipal Archives Office on Vliet canal. (It was from this canal that the 
Pilgrims left for the port of Delfshaven, where they stayed for a night before 
departing for England on the Speedwell. In England they boarded the Mayflower 
for their journey to America in 1620.) The document is available for viewing 
upon request. The archives office is an essential stop for those tracing the 
footsteps of the Pilgrims in Holland. An informative exhibition and slide show 
explores the Pilgrims' experience in Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus prepared for our walking tour of the city, we left the center guided by a 
map of important Pilgrim sites that we were given at the Document Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Stedelijk Museum, in what was during the 1600s the old cloth merchants' 
hall, the history of Leiden unfolds in exhibitions that depict activities of 
the various guilds. Rooms furnished and containing beautiful silverware and 
paintings from the Dutch Golden Age make visitors feel as though they have 
wandered into a Dutch still-life. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like these artifacts, old Leiden is a city of domestic beauty. There are 
no great vistas, except the one from the top of the Burg. Instead, the town's 
charm and history are found in its narrow, curving streets filled with 
beautiful houses, side by side, all different and as individual as their gables 
-- pointed, stepped, necked, belled. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the center of the original city is the huge but severely plain 
Pieterskerk. It was there, wandering on foot along the twisting cobbled, 
medieval streets surrounding St. Peter's Church, that we found ourselves in the 
Leiden of the Pilgrims. The majority of the Pilgrims lived within a 
quarter-mile radius of St. Peter's. Forbidden to worship in any ordinary church 
or chapel, the group needed a house large enough to accommodate the several 
dozen members of the congregation. In 1611, they acquired land to build the 
house that became known as Groenpoort (Green Gate), across the Kloksteeg (Bell 
Lane) -- a narrow but important street just across from St. Peter's. There, in 
an area close to the university and reachable from all directions by a web of 
converging streets, they built Robinson's house, as well as 21 one-room 
dwellings in the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stones of the small square carry the memories of more than one group of 
foreigners who were welcomed or, at the least, tolerated. Pesijnhofje, the 
current house on the property where Robinson's house stood, was built in 1683 
as an almshouse for French Huguenots and can still be visited today. Robinson 
was buried in or near the baptistery of St. Peter's. Directly across the street 
from Pesijnhofje in St. Peter's facade is a plaque commemorating Robinson and 
the sailing of the Pilgrims to the New World. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Amsterdam, Leiden did not have a strict guild system that prevented the 
Pilgrims from finding work. Records mention the occupations of 86 Pilgrims. 
While the majority worked in the cloth trade, they were also polishers, ribbon 
weavers, tobacco workers, pipe makers, stocking sellers, wood sawyers and twine 
makers -- trades at which these farmers could become skilled with some ease. 
</P>
<P>
 After 11 years in Leiden, the Pilgrims began preparations to leave. 
Ultimately, the Dutch had proved too liberal for the Pilgrims. Resistant to 
their conversion efforts, the Dutch continued a loose observance of the Sabbath 
and what the Pilgrims saw as a lax discipline of children. Ironically, the very 
liberalness and tolerance that flourished in the cosmopolitan Dutch republic 
and that drew the English Pilgrims were the qualities that ultimately drove 
them to find a new home in North America. The Pilgrims feared assimilation into 
a general population indifferent to their religious fervor, as their time in 
Holland lengthened. While some attained modest prosperity, most continued to 
live in poverty and hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilgrim's immigration options were the South American region of Guiana and 
a part of the North American Territory granted in 1606 to the Virginia Company. 
Negotiations began in 1617. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, on July 31, 1620, the Pilgrims left Leiden on the Speedwell 
bound for Delfshaven. Their Vliet canal route remains much as it was then, 
stretching south for a mile and then turning to the southwest. The distance is 
25 miles and probably took six to eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the sites to visit in Delfshaven is the Pilgrim Fathers' Church. 
There is no hard evidence to support the claim -- prevalent in Holland today -- 
that the Pilgrims held services there just before their departure from Holland. 
But whether they actually worshiped in it or not, the Pilgrims have through 
time become irrevocably linked with this small church. A medallion in one of 
the stained glass windows commemorates the sailing of the Speedwell, as do 
memorials erected by such American groups as the Boston Congregational Club. 
For years, Americans living and working in the Hague, Rotterdam and Amsterdam, 
were drawn here for Thanksgiving Day service in such numbers that services had 
to be relocated to St. Peter's in Leiden. 
</P>
<P>
 Our pilgrimage ended on the bridge over the canal by which the Pilgrims left 
Holland -- where old Holland connects to the new, with the great modern port of 
Rotterdam visible in the distance. Yet the influence of the Dutch did not end 
with the Pilgrim's departure for the New World. The celebration of Thanksgiving 
and the many political freedoms we hold dear may never have come to be had our 
Pilgrim forefathers not experienced the liberties of the Dutch republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders organized the colony with ideas derived from both their English 
heritage and the Dutch experience. The Mayflower Compact (the Pilgrims' 
agreement to establish a government) established an elected democracy similar 
to that in which the Pilgrims had participated in Leiden, as members of smaller 
groups that controlled local affairs, taxes and safety in each of Leiden's 143 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 To an extent unknown elsewhere at the time, the Dutch constitution was founded 
upon and adjusted to this foundation of independent local sovereignties, or 
municipal governments. The military leader Miles Standish trained the Pilgrim 
militia using Dutch drill books. There was no minister in Plymouth Colony and 
when couples decided to marry, Gov. Bradford took a step unprecedented in 
English law: They were registered and married in civil ceremonies. He justified 
his actions by referring to the Dutch law requiring civil registration for 
marriages of non-members of the Dutch Reform church. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Pilgrims' years in Holland were undeniably marked by trials and 
hardship, the experience exposed our forefathers to concepts of government and 
customs that we continue to hold dear today. Like all travelers, the Pilgrims 
were changed in many ways by their Holland experiences. We were too. GUIDEBOOK:

DESTINATION: FRANCE; PARIS COVERED; IN A HIDDEN WORLD OF PASSAGES AND 
GALLERIES, FILLED WITH SHOPS, THE CITY'S HISTORY UNFOLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Shortt, Shortt is a New York architect who writes frequently on 
French topics.

<TEXT>
<P>
 We all love strolling through Paris when the sun is shining and the chestnut 
trees are in bloom -- never knowing what delights will reveal themselves. But 
alas, sometimes it rains cats and dogs; sometimes it is perishing cold and 
damp; sometimes in a heat wave the streets become suffocating. Don't despair. 
Paris' 19th-Century builders, alert to the importance of comfort to 
pleasure-seekers and consumers, created a solution that allows all the urban 
joys of strolling while shielded from weather and traffic: a hidden, interior 
city of skylight-covered passages, arcades and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 A chain of passages stretches from the First and Second arrondissements near 
the Louvre, up north to the Grand Boulevards in the Ninth. You can spend the 
day, window-shop ("window-licking" it's called in French) for clothes of all 
descriptions; lunch; go to the hairdresser; select a walking stick, or toy 
soldiers, antique dolls or masks, engraved calling-cards, expensive bed-linen, 
cosmetics, flowers; dawdle over bookstalls or in art galleries; sit in a 
sidewalk cafe and sip tea or an aperitif; go to a theater or a museum, a sauna, 
a hotel; dine elegantly, hardly ever emerging into the open weather. Some of 
the oldest and most interesting shops in Paris are in these galleries. In your 
progress, you can see Paris unfold its social history, pass from chic opulence 
to popular pleasures, from luxury to quaint, dusty charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Start at the northeast corner of the Louvre. Just north of the Rue de Rivoli, 
the Rue Saint-Honore intersects Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which goes north 
past the tiny Rue du Pelican, and arrives at the entrance of the Galerie 
Vero-Dodat. 
</P>
<P>
 Step inside, and you are in another world, almost untouched, 200 years old. 
One of the elements contributing to the magic of the passages is the quiet: no 
traffic noises or odors. This gallery was built in the early 19th Century by 
two enterprising pork butchers, Messieurs Vero and Dodat, who kept shops here. 
All its original wooden shop fronts are intact, with their multiple 
brass-arched window frames, and little engaged colonnettes. Although gas lamps 
have been replaced by electric bulbs, the light through the long, pitched 
skylights is gentle, reflecting off the diamond-pattern white and black mosaic 
tile floor. The wood ceiling between the skylights is coffered and gilded and 
painted with rustic scenes, garlands and cherubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The mezzanine level looking into the passage, also heavily decorated and 
painted, has apartments. The great tragic actress Rachel lived here in the 
1840s, a stone's throw from the Comedie Francaise, where she was a star. At No. 
2 is a printer's shop that looks as if it has been there the whole time; it is 
followed by a gemologist's, a leather-goods shop, a lutemaker's (mandolins and 
violins also) at No. 17, and at Nos. 23 and 24 a shop specializing in antique 
dolls and old gramophones, reputed to be a favorite of actress Catherine 
Deneuve. At No. 19 is the modestly priced but chic Restaurant Vero-Dodat, with 
a mezzanine dining room looking into the passage. A designer furniture gallery, 
clothing stores and an attractive cafe- brasserie , with lace curtains and 
outdoor tables complete the gallery at its west end. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow your nose west, under an arch to the tiny Place de Valois, and on 
through to a quiet side entrance to the Palais Royal. Through the forecourt, 
turning right brings you to the eastern arcade of the Palais Royal. At first it 
looks unpromising, but keep walking under the arcades, and soon you will be in 
a wonderland of shops, some dating back to the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors today come here for the beautiful garden but neglect the arcades 
with their graceful lanterns hanging in each arch. Louis XIV left the original 
Royal Palace of 1639 to his brother, whose artistic, high-living and dissolute 
heirs turned the Palais Royal into an arty and hot neighborhood. The garden and 
arcades were built during the period 1781-86 for speculation by debt-ridden 
Philippe, Duc d'Orleans, who rented or sold the 180 shops with elegant 
apartments above. Emulating Venice's Piazza San Marco, the arcades had stylish 
coffeehouses, restaurants and aristocratic gaming clubs. Common soldiers, women 
in aprons and delivery boys weren't allowed in. Thomas Jefferson and Washington 
Irving were among early American strollers here. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Philippe denied the police entry to the Palais Royal these 
coffeehouses became revolutionary hotbeds; it was here on July 13, 1789, that 
the march on the Bastille was incited. Philippe, called Phillipe "Egalite" for 
his democratic beliefs, was always broke, and after the revolution his tenants 
became sleazier. (He went to the scaffold in 1793 during the Reign of Terror.) 
By 1804, there were 11 loan sharks, 18 gambling houses and 17 billiard halls. 
Palais Royal was infamous for brothels; there was even a circus, a wax museum 
(at No. 17, founded by Madame Tussaud's uncle) and a dance hall. American 
Ebenezer Smith Thomas, former editor of the Charleston Gazette, wrote in 1820 
that there were about 500 shops in the Palais Royal, that you could have a suit 
of clothes made while you sipped coffee, and be gratuitously entertained by 
dancers on ropes and wires; that at the famous Mille Colonnes coffeehouse as 
many as 200 people gathered of an evening and discussed art, science, 
literature, politics. When gambling was abolished in Paris on Dec. 31, 1837, 
Palais Royal died. It has now been reborn, elegant if slightly musty. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments above the arcades remain some of the most desirable in Paris. 
Stars of the Comedie Francaise at the Theatre Francaise here (also built by 
Philippe) get them as perks. Colette lived and died here (after drinking a last 
glass of champagne). Author/director/poet Jean Cocteau lived here, as did film 
actor Jean Marais. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling north along the eastern arcade brings you to the extraordinary 
display of engraved invitations by international royalty in the windows of No. 
153, Guillaumot, engraver and heraldry expert, where you can have cards and 
stationery engraved with your coat of arms. They have been in business since 
1761. Farther on are antiques and art galleries; perfumes at No. 141; rare 
books at 139; several shops of exquisite household linens, such as at 132; 
needlepoint and tapestry supplies at 128. At 112, the top of the east arcade, 
is Espace Champagne, a restaurant specializing in champagne and things such as 
foie gras and smoked salmon to absorb it. During nice weather, they have 
umbrella-shaded tables in the garden.  
</P>
<P>
 The short north arcade has three arches exiting out to Rue de Beaujolais. 
Between them are Anna Joliet's shop with music boxes, and next door, 
magnificent marionnettes, puppets and dolls. The last arch to the west runs 
between the Theater de Palais-Royal (also built by Philippe; it still has its 
18th-Century interior), where they show popular plays, variety and musicals, 
and the Grand Vefour restaurant. In business since 1760 as the Cafe De 
Chartres, it opened its doors here in 1784. At the turn of the century, 
Napoleon courted Josephine in its exquisitely painted Louis XVI interior. It 
has a serious claim to being the most beautiful restaurant in Paris. Later on, 
Victor Hugo was one of its habitues when it became a writer's hangout during 
the 1850s, the Second Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning down the western arcade, there are several pleasant restaurants, also 
with outdoor tables, where afternoon coffee, tea and pastry are served, too. 
There is a toy shop, a perfumer, an architect's office, and at No. 42, a store 
specializing in men's brilliantly decorative waistcoats. At Nos. 37-38, 
historical military figurines of famous generals -- Napoleon, Joachim Murat, 
Charles Maurice de Talleyrand -- toy soldiers and artillery in formation are 
deployed in the windows of Les Drapeaux de France. A jeweler's, a store with 
papier-mache masks, fine clothing and cosmetics, and at Nos. 6-7, and 3-4, two 
shops specializing in military medals and orders conclude the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Backtrack to the north side or cut across the garden under the lime trees and 
cross tiny Rue de Beaujolais. Outside the northeast corner of the Palais Royal 
a short flight of steps leads you up through the short Passage des Deux 
Pavillions. Cross the Rue des Petits Champs, glancing east for a moment toward 
the Place des Victoires to admire the equestrian statue of Louis XIV. 
</P>
<P>
 You will now be at the entrance of the Galerie Colbert, built in 1830. Now 
owned by Bibliotheque Nationale (next door), they have an annex here with 
public exhibits, including a museum of the theater and of recorded voices. 
Opulently restored, the Colbert's classical arches and columns of false marble, 
two-story mezzanine, gilded light fixtures with milk-glass globes, domed skylit 
rotunda with statuary, painted Empire motifs and mosaic floors, are spacious 
and grand.  
</P>
<P>
 The Galerie Colbert runs back into the L-shaped Galerie Vivienne, built in 
1823. Its high skylights are set between stone arches at the upper mezzanine 
level, and its arched colonnade is echoed in the circular patterns of the 
mosaic floor. A shop for rare books has been here since 1826. There are also 
trendy children's clothing, toys, housewares and gifts, and designer clothing 
shops such as avant-garde Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yuki Torii and Catherine Vernoux. 
An elegant tea room, with tables in the gallery, tempts you to linger. Lucien 
Legrand, Filles et Fils (daughters and sons) at the Rue de la Banque end, is a 
famous wine shop. * 
</P>
<P>
 You can now make a loop to a very different world, the Passage Choiseul, 
reached by going west along the Rue des Petits Champs. The Choiseul is the 
epitome of the petit-bourgeois world of 19th-Century Paris, very different from 
the grandeurs of the Palais Royal or the Vivienne. Louis-Ferdinand Celine's 
parents had a lace shop here, with a three-room triplex above, two levels under 
the long skylight, one above. He describes its enclosed, incestuously 
suffocating microcosm in his great turn-of-the-century novel "Death on Credit." 
 
</P>
<P>
 It is still a very popular place. It is narrower and less decorated than the 
other passages, but its lack of class is compensated by liveliness. You will 
find cheap clothing stores, toys, baggage, a cobbler, stand-up Vietnamese-food 
counters, ties, artists' supplies, jewelry, sexy underwear.  
</P>
<P>
 Coming out the north end of the Choiseul, turn right on the Rue 
Saint-Augustin, which arrives in a few blocks at the intersection with Rue 
Vivienne, by the imposing colonnaded Bourse, the Paris stock exchange. Continue 
north along Rue Vivienne; turn right at the next corner on Rue des Panoramas, 
left immediately on tiny Rue Feydeau through to Rue Saint-Marc with its three 
entrances to the Passage des Panoramas, and its branches: Galeries Feydeau, 
Saint Marc, Varietes and Montmartre. At the middle entrance is a sauna- hammam 
, a Turkish bath (this one is for men only). There are several so-so 
restaurants and the general atmosphere is seedy, but when you continue north to 
the main Passage des Panoramas you are in a bustling, skylit, flower- and 
light-filled space, ultimately leading out to its main entrance on Boulevard 
Montmartre. There are pots of red begonias everywhere, and the shops range from 
several stamp collectors, chic used clothing ( fripes ), coiffeurs, engravers 
and florists. Of particular note is a popular restaurant-cafe with tables in 
the passage, called the Arbre a Cannelle (cinnamon tree), with an ancient 
painted and gilded shop front and painted ceiling inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage des Panoramas has a particularly American association. In 1800 the 
American inventor Robert Fulton, who had a French patent on the "panorama," or 
circular painting, had two large silo-structures, 46 feet in diameter, built in 
a garden on the Boulevard Montmartre to show what were eventually 18 wildly 
popular, historic panorama paintings of cities. The alley between them, the 
Passage des Panoramas, was soon built up. The proceeds from the panoramas 
bankrolled Fulton's submarine and steamboat projects, both first tested in the 
Seine. 
</P>
<P>
 A pension e-hotel, built as part of the gallery above the entrance, at the 
corner of the Rue Vivienne, became very popular with visiting Americans, and 
people such as Ralph Waldo Emerson stayed there in 1832. If you cross the 
boulevard directly, you enter the Passage Jouffroy (1846). This passage has two 
parts as it zigzags north. The southern is the more lively, with the Restaurant 
Ronceray by the boulevard, its entrance to the Musee Grevin waxworks museum, 
and the charming Hotel Chopin at No. 46, classified as an historic monument. At 
No. 34 an enormous moose head trophy hangs above the windows of Maison Gilbert, 
founded in 1848 and selling walking sticks and umbrellas. The northern half of 
the Passage Jouffroy is entirely given over to bookshops, posters, art and 
ceramics. It is very, very peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 When you leave the Jouffroy, just cross the street (Rue de la Grange 
Bateliere, meaning boat-barn) and you're at the entrance to the Passage 
Verdeau, the farthest north in the chain. There is a Salon de The and modest 
Restaurant Verdeau, with tables in the passage, shops with old books, flowers, 
clothes, needlework and a photography shop that has been there all along, with 
a display of antique cameras. The passage veers right, letting you out on the 
Rue du Faubourg Montmartre, one of the most popular honky-tonk streets of 
Paris, and also the most ancient. 
</P>
<P>
 We have traveled from the pre-revolutionary world of dissolute courtiers, 
through the 19th-Century worlds of nouveau-riche luxury and petit-bourgeois 
populism and have emerged onto a workaday modern Paris street, overlying a 
Druid path.

BACKPACK & BUDGET: HOSTELS FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Key West, Fla., and from Hilo, Hawaii, to New 
York City there are more than 1,000 places where travelers can stay for less 
than $20 per person, per night. You can find out where they are in the new 
edition of "Jim's Backpacker's Bible." 
</P>
<P>
 The 120-page book includes hostels, hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts 
and cabins. KOA campgrounds have been included because many offer "kamping 
kabins" with bunk beds, which would be suitable for backpacking travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most listings are very skimpy. In most cases you just get the 
name and address, telephone and fax number. The information is provided by the 
listees. You don't get an unbiased appraisal. If a listing is longer, 
containing more information, it's a paid advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 Publisher Jim de Cordova or one of his representatives visited a few 
locations, which are indicated along with the date of their visit. 
</P>
<P>
 At some of the lodgings affiliated with national associations, such as the 
Canadian Hostelling Assn. or American Youth Hostels, you can expect certain 
safety and cleanliness standards to be maintained. But the guide does not 
always indicate this affiliation, which is why it's important that you try to 
talk to other travelers about their experiences and recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 When looking for low-cost lodging also keep these points in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended locations tend to fill up fast, so try to arrange your 
transportation so that you arrive early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourist information services in rail and bus stations are not always unbiased. 
Try to determine if they are operated by the government. If not, they may only 
recommend facilities they are paid to represent, and they may give you 
misleading information.  
</P>
<P>
 Touts (people who earn a commission by getting you to go to their 
hotel/hostel) can be very aggressive. Keep in mind you may be paying a higher 
hotel rate to cover their commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Check a room out before you pay. Make sure bathrooms and showers are 
acceptable.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jim's Backpacker's Bible" is available for $6 from Jim's Backpacker's Bible, 
P.O. Box 5650, Santa Monica, Calif. 90409. The price includes postage. Copies

HIKING: BAY AREA: ABOVE IT ALL ON MISSION PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From a distance, it is the most austere of East Bay landmarks, a half-mile 
high hunk of mountain brooding over the Fremont Plains. A nice place to go -- 
if you're a mountain goat. 
</P>
<P>
 In closer view, Mission Peak is much more approachable and hiker-friendly than 
its steep west face suggests from afar. The summit is surrounded by the Mission 
Peak Preserve, 3,000 acres of parkland that includes wooded canyons and gentle 
grassy hills grazed by cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen miles of trail crisscross the preserve and climb to the 2,517-foot 
summit of Mission Peak. Views from the summit are well worth the considerable 
exertion -- panoramas from San Jose to Mt. Tamalpais, Mt. Diablo to the 
Dunbarton Bridge.  
</P>
<P>
 The peak takes its name from the Mission San Jose, founded in 1797.  
</P>
<P>
 The climb up Mission Peak is quite simply one of those classic Bay Area hikes. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The best days to do it are cool, clear ones. Summer, with its thick, 
view-obscuring morning fog and hot, hiker-toasting afternoon sun is the worst 
time to hike Mission Peak. Autumn and winter are excellent times, when the 
clearest of days mean vistas from the Santa Cruz Mountains to the High Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Direction to trail head: From Interstate 680 in Fremont, exit on Mission 
Boulevard and head north one-quarter mile. Turn right on Stanford Avenue and 
proceed three-quarters mile to road's end at a trail users' parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Walk up the major dirt road, known as the Hidden Valley Trail. The 
first part of the path is also called Ohlone Wilderness Trail, a spectacular 
29-mile trail linking peaks, grasslands, oak forests and four East Bay parks. 
</P>
<P>
 To the right (east) of Hidden Valley Trail is the Horse Heaven Trail, which 
offers an alternative way up (or down) Mission Peak. You can join Horse Heaven 
Trail from the trail head, the peak, or from two connector paths leading 
eastward from the Hidden Valley Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Our path, the Hidden Valley Trail, climbs two miles before swinging north and 
passing a hang glider launch. Just as you start to think the trail is taking 
you away from, rather than toward the peak, you'll arrive at the junction with 
Eagle Trail on your right. Follow it an eighth-mile to another right turn on 
Peak Trail, which winds among rock outcroppings to the top of Mission Peak. 
Either return the way you came or join the quite scenic, though with fewer 
views, Horse Heaven Trail for the hike back to the trail head. Hidden Valley 
Trail Where: Mission Peak Regional Preserve. Distance: 6 1/2 miles round trip; 
2,100-foot elevation gain. Terrain: Steep, grassy slopes, craggy summit. 
Highlights: Panorami view of Bay Area. Degree of Difficulty: Moderate to 
strenuous. For More Information: East Bay Regional Park District, 2950 Pealta 
Oaks Court, Oakland, Calif. 94605; tel. (510) 562-PARK.

CRUISE VIEWS: COMFORT FOR THE WHEELCHAIR TRAVELER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you're choosing a cruise to accommodate a wheelchair, bear in mind that a 
newer, larger ship is more likely to offer cabins designed for accessibility. 
Such a cabin should have doors at least 25 inches wide, grab rails in the 
bathroom and no raised sills. To make public areas accessible, the ship should 
have elevators with doors wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair and ramps 
over the raised sills leading to the deck.  
</P>
<P>
 Most cruise ships built before the mid-1980s still present obstacles to 
wheelchairs -- no elevator to some public areas such as top decks and discos; 
narrow hallways on lower decks where most cabins are located; narrow doorways 
into cabins and bathrooms; oddly shaped bathrooms with fixtures close together 
and stairs leading into dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Common inconveniences include closet hanging racks and elevator buttons that 
are out of reach for a person in a wheelchair, very heavy doors leading to the 
deck and inaccessible swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 While in general, wheelchair passengers should book only ships that always 
come alongside in port rather than sometimes taking passengers ashore in a 
tender, both Norwegian Cruise Line's Norway and Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2 are 
exceptions, since their big tenders fit flush with the ship's loading doors.  
</P>
<P>
 Wheelchair travelers who enjoy spending a lot of time on deck should steer 
clear of smaller, older ships as a rule, because the deck spaces are often 
chopped up with steep, narrow flights of stairs. Instead, study deck plans to 
find ships with unimpeded promenades all the way around, as on Holland 
America's new trio, Statendam, Maasdam and Ryndam. Each of these vessels also 
has four wheelchair-accessible cabins and bathrooms designated on the deck 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Princess Cruises' newest ships, Star Princess, Crown Princess and Regal 
Princess, each contain 10 wheelchair-accessible cabins measuring 228 square 
feet (for an inside cabin) or 280 square feet (for an outside cabin). The third 
sister ship in this series has 10 accessible cabins measuring 240 square feet 
with extra-wide doors and flush thresholds. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. with its three huge megaliners Sovereign of the 
Seas, Monarch of the Seas and Majesty of the Seas, although carrying 2,354 
passengers, provide only four handicap- accessible cabins aboard each vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Celebrity Cruises' Zenith and Horizon, which carry 1,374 
passengers each, also provide four wheelchair-accessible cabins on each ship. 
</P>
<P>
 You might consider taking a traveling or sports-sized wheelchair instead of a 
standard one in order to make access easier into narrow doorways. Royal Cruise 
Line, for instance, requests guests to limit wheelchairs to a 35 inches width 
if they are booking a handicapped stateroom on the line's Crown Odyssey, built 
in 1988, but only 22 inches wide if they're booked aboard the Royal Odyssey and 
Star Odyssey, dating from the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 While you are studying the deck plan, look for the elevators. How many are 
there, and how convenient are they to the important public rooms, such as the 
show lounge and dining room? 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Cruise Line International Assn. 1994 Cruise Manual, which most 
travel agents use as a reference guide, lists only two ships that do not accept 
wheelchair passengers -- Cunard Sea Goddess I and Sea Goddess II -- many of the 
other ships on the list are also inappropriate for wheelchairs if the passenger 
wants to participate fully in shipboard life. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to all public rooms aboard, according to the manual, is not possible 
for wheelchairs on the following ships: American Hawaii's Constitution and 
Independence, Costa's Costa Marina and Eugenio Costa, Dolphin Cruise Line's 
Dolphin, Princess' Fair Princess, Paquet French Cruises' Mermoz, Regency 
Cruises' Regent Rainbow, Regent Jewel and Regent Spirit, Seven Seas' Song of 
Flower, RCCL's Nordic Prince, Sun Viking and Song of Norway, Norwegian Cruise 
Line's Southward and Starward, Premier's Star/Ship Atlantic, Sun Line's Stella 
Solaris and Epirotiki's Triton. 
</P>
<P>
 Full access to all passenger areas is also limited aboard Fantasy Cruises' 
Amerikanis and Britanis, Cunard Crown's Cunard Countess and Cunard Princess, 
Costa's Daphne, Commodore's Enchanted Seas, Costa's Enrico Costa, Princess' 
Island Princess and Pacific Princess, Delta Queen Steamboat's Delta Queen and 
Mississippi Queen, Dolphin's OceanBreeze and SeaBreeze, Pearl Cruises' Pearl, 
Royal Cruise Line's Royal Odyssey and Star Odyssey, Cunard's Sagafjord and 
Vistafjord, RCCL's Song of Norway and World Explorer's Universe. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, small expedition vessels without elevators from cruise lines such 
as Special Expeditions, Alaska Sightseeing/Cruise West, Abercrombie & Kent and 
Society Expeditions are not feasible for wheelchair passengers.  
</P>

TAKING THE KIDS: WHERE IN THE WORLD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ, Ogintz is author of Taking the Kids to the Great Southwest, 
Taking the Kids to Sunny Southern California and Taking the Kids to Northern 
California, (HarperCollins West, $9.90 paperback).

<P>
 OK, parents, put on your thinking caps and try this geography quiz: Which 
state has the 15 highest mountains in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 If you guessed Colorado as I did, you're wrong. The answer is Alaska, which is 
also home to Mt. McKinley, the highest peak in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know which state in the Lower 48 borders just one other state? It's 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't feel too badly if you were stumped by the questions from the kids' 
mystery / geography game "Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows all the answers," said Mike Libbee, a geography professor at 
Central Michigan University and a leader in encouraging parents to get involved 
in teaching children geography. "Geography is something you can keep learning 
all your life. Besides, parents probably know more geography than they think -- 
plenty to share with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Libbee is so enthusiastic about families exploring geography together that 
he's spearheading a new National Geographic Society-sponsored effort for 
families around the country to try at home. Called the Family Geography 
Challenge, a pilot program for schools, designed to involve parents in their 
children's geography education, will debut in Los Angeles in early 1995. (For 
more information, call Joan Clemons 310-825-7053.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Geography is understanding places and the relationship between places, 
society and the environment," said Ruth Shirey, a college professor and 
executive director of the National Council for Geographic Education. "We live 
in such an interdependent world," Shirey said. "It's terribly important for 
children to learn about other places." 
</P>
<P>
 Educators across the country agree. A new set of optional guidelines for 
school districts and parents, the National Geography Standards for teaching 
geography from kindergarten through high school, have just been announced. It's 
the result of an unprecedented two-year collaborative effort by the American 
Geographical Society, the Assn. of American Geographers, the National Council 
for Geographic Education and the National Geographic Society. As a result of 
the guidelines -- that were announced last month -- students, parents and 
teachers will know exactly what they are expected to learn about the subject. 
(The 276-page "Geography for Life: National Geography Standards" can be ordered 
for $9 and the 32-page Executive Summary for $6 from the National Geographic 
Society, 800-368-2728.) 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Robertson's sixth-graders in College Station, Tex., love tossing around 
globe beach balls and talking about different places. "The trick is that it all 
has to be hands-on and fun and then they eat it up," said Robertson, the mother 
of two teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 This Hanukkah and Christmas season, there's never been more to choose from -- 
everything from fast-paced CD-ROM computer games to board games and puzzles 
aimed at helping kids -- and parents -- have a good time learning more about 
the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Robertson always keeps a world puzzle going in her classroom. For 
jigsaw lovers, the American Map Corp. offers a 500-piece world, the United 
States and the planet for $11.95 that should keep everyone busy on winter 
nights (call 212-398-1222 to order). 
</P>
<P>
 The National Geographic Society devotes a third of its holiday catalogue -- 10 
pages -- to products aimed at kids. A top seller this year is the $24.95 
jewelry-making kit inspired by cultures from China to Egypt. (Call 800-447-0647 
for information.) 
</P>
<P>
 Two best-sellers highly recommended by teachers, despite their $99.95 price 
tag, are the award-winning GeoSafari and GeoSafari Jr. electronic games made by 
Educational Insights. GeoSafari is used in schools across the country to teach 
geography. (Call Rand McNally, 800-333-0136, Ext. 2111). 
</P>
<P>
 Another winner is the CD-ROM version of the popular TV show and game, "Where 
in the World is Carmen Sandiego?," including "Where in the USA is Carmen 
Sandiego?" and the junior detective edition (ages 5-8) of the game. The games 
are designed to allow children to track the outlaw Carmen from exotic locale to 
familiar territory. From Broderbund, they retail for roughly $50.

 I am a native of Nepal. Your article about Katmandu ("Crossroads Kingdom," 
Oct. 9), will contribute greatly to understanding between our cultures.Nepal is 
very poor and tourism is very important. We have a lot to offer. Because of the 
isolation until 1950, the rich culture has been preserved. Now that we are 
opening the door to people around the world, we hope to preserve the respect 
for our culture shown by the writer.

CAMPING COOKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed reading about camping at El Capitan State Beach ("Weekend Escape," 
Oct. 16), but I couldn't help but laugh when I read what the family brought for 
a cookout dinner: fusili pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, scallions and 
spicy chicken sausage. There was no mention of dessert, but it wouldn't 
surprise me if it was tiramisu or baked Alaska.Call me traditional, but there's 
just something wrong with a cookout that doesn't contain all the heavy, nasty 
foods that most of us remember fondly. You know, red meat, beans, maybe some 
corn-on-the-cob. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes so many camp in uncomfortable tents and put up with mosquitoes and 
not-so-clean bathrooms (or nonexistent ones) is that the great outdoors and 
sleeping under the stars brings out our pioneer spirits and makes us feel 
alive! 
</P>
<P>
 Leave all the fancy, citified cuisine at home.

ANOTHER RAFT WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I, too, want people to know the other side of river rafting. ("Raft Warning," 
Letters, Oct. 2) On my rafting trip with a group of friends down the American 
River five years ago, I was part of the "rescue" boat that picked up people who 
fell in.It was usually rather comical, until one time our guide's frantic 
commands told us the girl in the water was in trouble. Later, in rapids, the 
guide fell forward onto me as my foot was crushed between the pontoon and a 
rock. I can no longer bend the toes on that foot. The group went rafting the 
following year and I chose not to go. My friend's 19-year-old sister drowned on 
that trip. Her foot was caught between rocks, her ankle broken and they had to 
lower the river to find her body. I know that many people have happy, safe 
rafting trips, but I feel that people considering rafting need to be more aware 
of the potential dangers.

IS WILLIE BROWN ON THE EVE OF POLITICAL DESTRUCTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a contributing editor to 
Opinion, is a senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at 
Claremont Graduate School and a political analyst for KCAL-TV.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's political obituary has been written before. 
But, as Mark Twain might caution, reports of Brown's demise have always been 
"exaggerated." There may be other political venues in the Speaker's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown arrived in Sacramento after the 1964 election and proceeded to make 
then-Speaker Jesse M. Unruh's life miserable. His independence cost him time in 
legislative Purgatory, but not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1974, Brown was the anointed heir-presumptive to retiring Democratic 
speaker Robert Moretti. But he was vanquished by then-Assemblyman Leo T. 
McCarthy, who collected members' support in exchange for perks and power. That 
loss taught Brown an important lesson: The speakership cannot be inherited. In 
the 80-member Assembly, it has to be won -- read: bartered for -- vote by vote 
until 41 votes are secured. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bruising 1980 speakership war, Assemblyman Howard L. Berman, who 
controlled the majority of the Democratic caucus, forgot "the rule of 41." 
Brown remembered. He "gave away the candy store" to form a coalition of 
Republicans and Democrats to beat Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the legislative antics of dissident Democrats -- the "Gang of Five" 
-- temporarily left Brown without enough votes to protect his speakership. He 
was forced to turn again to Republicans for cover -- until the fall elections 
enabled him to regain 41 loyal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 elections were not so kind to Brown. As the absentee-ballot count 
winds down, Brown's best hope is to begin the next legislative session with an 
Assembly split 40-40 between Democrats and Republicans. Brown called the 
lame-duck Assembly (dominated by a safe Democratic majority) into special 
session last week to craft a rule that would allow bills to be paid if the new 
Assembly cannot elect a Speaker when it convenes next month. Not incidentally, 
the session also offered Brown a means to send a message that he was still in 
charge -- until James L. Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga), the current Assembly 
minority leader, or anyone else, can muster 41 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what stunts Brown may pull over the next two years, this time 
Brown is irrevocably on the verge of losing his speakership powers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the new Assembly convenes with a Republican majority of 41 votes, 
conventional wisdom predicts that Brulte, who oversaw Republican Assembly 
victories, should be elected speaker. And he might if GOP maverick Paul V. 
Horcher, still smarting from a long list of affronts by his caucus, stays loyal 
to his party. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Horcher hangs with the GOP, the balance of power in the Assembly is 
likely to teeter precariously between the Republicans and Democrats for at 
least the next few months, as GOP Assemblyman Richard J. Mountjoy resigns to 
take a state Senate seat he won in a special election and other Republicans 
jockey to replace Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who will take a seat 
on the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 To add to the dilemma, term limits have destabilized leadership by diluting a 
Speaker's ability to reward supporters and punish opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 In such precarious circumstances, nobody's control over the Assembly can be 
assured for long, without some sort of negotiated settlement. If Brown cuts a 
deal leaving him in the Speaker's chair, he will probably have to cede some 
power, staff, resources and appointments to Brulte and the Republicans. Brown 
could wind up Speaker in name only. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, whoever wins will likely find his legislative sails trimmed by the 
overriding need for bipartisan cooperation if anything is to be accomplished. 
To ensure continuity of leadership, the next Speaker -- and future speakers -- 
may have to share control of the Assembly with members of a powerful Rules 
Committee. That's the way the state Senate operates. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brown can't pry Republican votes loose, he could wind up as minority 
leader, an alien and diminished role for him. When Unruh assumed that post, 
after losing the Assembly to the Republicans in 1968, he found his agenda 
blocked, his fund-raising clout diminished and his political career temporarily 
stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown could be similarly frustrated. The ability to raise large sums of 
campaign money is the fuel that has powered his speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 But in today's confrontational politics, obstructionism can be as potent as 
activism was in Unruh's day. Brown has already discovered the clout that stems 
from the ability to block legislation. And he knows you don't need the 
speakership to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the speakership, furthermore, need not mean an end to Brown's political 
career. He has rarely flirted with higher office, a recognition of his 
considerable political baggage. Indeed, on surpassing Unruh's tenure in office, 
Brown announced he intended to remain Speaker "in perpetuity." 
</P>
<P>
 That was before term limits. Now Brown must relinquish his Assembly seat in 
1996. But as his Assembly tenure ends, term limits will open up the state 
Senate seat that includes his district. Chances are, Brown can take it. What 
then? Political oblivion as a Senate backbencher? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 As term-limited Assembly members jump to the upper house, the Senate is likely 
to become the more experienced body. And senators will have more time in 
office, compared with Assembly lawmakers, to make their policy mark. That will 
likely mean a shift in political power from the Assembly to the Senate. It is a 
tilt that could once again lead to the political resuscitation of Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Power will likely shift, too, from the Assembly Speaker to the Senate's 
president pro tem. Speakers will probably rotate every two years and, 
historically, rotating speakerships mean weak speakers. Pro tems, on the other 
hand, could have six years in office. A previous stint as Assembly leader could 
only enhance a pro tem's ability to accrue power and exercise it long enough to 
have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 With current pro tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) serving his last term, that 
office will be up for grabs in 1998, if not sooner. If the Democrats can hold 
the Senate, and Brown can muster a little patience and support, he could have 
another shot at legislative power. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits and the 1994 election results have thrown California's Legislature 
into turmoil. Speculation is that Brown will not pull it off this time. But 
that's not the safest bet. The man has found himself in the eye of the storm 
before -- with the wreckage of less agile politicians strewn around him.*

CAPITAL POWER STRUGGLE; PROVING GOVERNMENT WORKS IS STILL DEMOCRATS' DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, let's review the bidding. It's 1992. Voters are in a surly mood. Bill 
Clinton says they should vote for Change. They don't like Big Government. He 
doesn't like Small Government. He tells people there is a third, smarter way -- 
a "reinvested" government that will perform for the hard-working, law-abiding, 
tax-paying middle class. He finesses the social issues, trumping them with 
economic appeals. He wins the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, on the long, hung-over day after the Republicans have creamed 
the Democrats in the midterm elections, the President holds a press conference. 
He remarks that when he first declared for the presidency, he gave a speech 
saying government should create opportunity and let citizens take 
responsibility for making the most of it. "They don't think we've done that 
yet," he says. He allows that his health-reform plan, as mischaracterized by 
its opponents, "looked like" it was "restricting the choices of the American 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds as if Clinton thinks he has a communication problem -- to be solved 
by correcting public misimpressions. But the reason voters think Clintonites 
haven't "done that yet" is that they haven't. And it is not likely that they'll 
be able to. 
</P>
<P>
 Most critics of the Administration now attribute its non-performance to the 
incompetence of Clinton himself. He's too vacillating. Too wordy. He should get 
up off the mat and make a strong turn to the right. Or to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem indeed lies in Clinton's nature -- but temperaments are 
hard to change. And the other cause of the Administration's failure is even 
less under his control. It lies in the nature of the Democratic Party, many of 
whose members have already started to blame Clinton for all their woes -- the 
way they blamed Jimmy Carter in the run-up to the 1980 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 The midterm elections were not about "the economy, stupid." They illuminated a 
more pervasive voter anxiety. We just haven't been the same since the Berlin 
Wall came down, plowing under both the battered consensus about America's role 
in the world and the Cold War's guarantees of economic security in crucial 
industries. We feel competition from a world market. We fear a future where 
success depends on skills as arcane as Urdu. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just part of the angst. Add in the anxieties that have festered for 
25 years about the survival of bourgeois values. Liberal rhetoric and policy 
have addressed the grievances of society's designated victims by taking things, 
material and emotional, away from non-victims. Activists pursuing church-state 
separation have done so by denigrating the need for religion in public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the other symbols of loss of control -- illegal immigrants; 
viruses with no vaccines or cures, and the big one, crime, fearsome in itself 
but serving as shorthand for all the public practices and institutions that 
fail to do their job of promoting public order. 
</P>
<P>
 When Advertising Age runs a feature, titled "Fear!", about the burgeoning 
commercial side of the perceived crisis, and Hammacher Schlemmer offers a 
$119.95 life-size dummy for your car so you won't look like you're driving 
alone, the preoccupation with the dangers of violence has reached an advanced 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 We want our leaders to protect us against such fears. Yet, in these uncertain 
days, public officials can't know which specific demands the future will make 
of them. What they can do is provide a clear sense of first principles and 
shared values, so that citizens can identify with them, invest them with moral 
authority and trust them to make reasoned decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton -- likable, supple, untroubled by contradictions -- is not a 
protector. He has an ambiguous past; more important, he has not spoken out 
about this past from the perspective of a grown man looking back on his actions 
with a grown man's sober judgment. Citizens do not know what standards he would 
use to make such a judgment, let alone knowing whether they agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, we should not overdraw the importance of Clinton's failings. 
Inspiring confidence in government, and a sense that government "works," would 
be a long shot for almost any President reliant on the Democratic Party's 
political base and dominant thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the matter of alternative lifestyles. Most Americans probably have some 
tolerance of these differences -- but would prefer not to have them at the top 
of the public agenda, getting in the way of ordinary folks' atavistic desire 
for grandchildren. A prudent President would not begin his Administration with 
the issue of gay rights. But what President elected by Clinton's coalition 
could escape pressure to do so? 
</P>
<P>
 Another strong probability: Lots of people dislike affirmative action that 
mocks old-fashioned meritocratic truths by using explicit racial, ethnic or 
gender preferences. Clinton's Justice Department pushes these preferences. The 
predictable friction results. It does not stem from Clinton's foibles; it 
evolves from the kinds of activists and constituencies attracted to Democratic 
campaigns and to political office in Democratic Administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Or take health reform, where we speak of certainties rather than 
probabilities. People's ability to choose their doctors may be partly illusory. 
But folks still think it's important, and for good reason: Though a frail reed, 
it is often an individual's only weapon against the impersonality of medical 
bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
 A prudent President would not mess with this powerful sentiment. But if you 
put together the sorts of experts who formed the Clinton health task force, 
many of whom would have been called on by nearly any Democrat in the White 
House, it is hard to imagine not producing a reform plan that requires the 
surrender of a lot of consumer discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 The same conclusion is evident in the environmental field. Doing certain kinds 
of good through government rules and agencies means placing substantial 
constraints on people's actions. It has been years since Democrats could be 
trusted to do the job with sensitivity toward the people who bear the burden of 
government demands. Their mistrust is now aggravated by the sense that 
government does not even reciprocate by providing an elementary sense of 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a dilemma Clinton created. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on the President's personal shortcomings is reminiscent of Carter's 
presidency. Carter actually did some reinvesting of government -- but the 
public's ideological shift outpaced anything he was willing or able to 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Carter's most articulate fellow Democrats decided the citizenry's 
restiveness reflected Carter's own ineptitude. The way he sold his energy 
policy was wimpish. Carter staffers were too young and inexperienced to know 
how to operate in Washington: blue jeans and pig-sty offices in the White 
House, rudeness to Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. on the Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 This talk weakened the Democrats' President still further, making him an 
easier target when Ronald Reagan began to go at him in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 If today's Democrats persist in thinking their troubles are only as deep as 
Clinton's running shorts or his motor mouth, they will do an effective job of 
setting themselves up in the same way for 1996.*

<P>
 As we prepare for the convening of a new Congress, we ought to be clear about 
what we can expect. The defeat of health-care reform and the passage of the 
crime bill in the last Congress are widely misunderstood, in part because 
Democrats and Republicans are making partisan claims but in larger part because 
Americans do not understand what they can and cannot expect from their national 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 To liberal Democrats, Bill Clinton's health-care plan was defeated because of 
political-action committee spending, Republican obstructionism, 
special-interest pressure and misleading television advertising. To 
conservative Republicans, the crime bill was passed because it was laden with 
"pork." 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of high-profile political issues cannot solely be explained by 
personal failings, narrow partisanship or devious maneuvering. These forces are 
always at work, of course, and sometimes make a big difference, but whenever 
this country comes to grips with a major controversy, the way it is resolved 
usually depends more on the central features of the U.S. constitutional system 
than on the tactics of the participants. These features are: 
</P>
<P>
 * The system of checks and balances requires the creation of a majority 
coalition out of disparate, often antagonistic elements if any significant 
policy is to be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 * In assembling such a coalition, the benefits of a program must appear to be 
real and the costs either small, deferred or displaced onto the "other guy." 
</P>
<P>
 * If there is strong public demand for some specific federal action, 
coalitions can be formed out of the sheer pressure of electoral necessity; but 
if there is no such clear demand, members must receive side payments in 
exchange for joining the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite the aggrandizement of federal power during the last half century, 
the Constitution and the political culture require that many policies be 
implemented by state and local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Applied to health care, these principles have the following implications: 
</P>
<P>
 A new policy initiative of the magnitude of Clinton's health plan requires 
either a crisis or strong popular support if it is to pass. The plan must 
convince people that its benefits exceed its costs or that its costs will be 
paid by somebody else. The support of groups already delivering the service 
must be assured by making them part of the process and plan, or their 
opposition must be made ineffectual by isolating and demonizing them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton health plan did not address some of these requirements and tried 
but failed to meet others. There was no popularly sensed "health-care crisis." 
There was popular concern over rising health-care costs, but little demand for 
changing the ways in which the health-care needs of uninsured people are being 
met. The public thought the President gave an effective health-care speech to 
Congress, but few believed they were the people he was talking about. Groups 
now delivering health care -- doctors, hospitals, insurance and pharmaceutical 
companies -- were largely frozen out of policy development. Many large 
corporations like the idea of the government taking over some of their 
post-retirement health costs, but they were outnumbered by the small firms that 
resisted taking on new costs. The public wouldn't mind seeing uninsured people 
receive care and their own coverage guaranteed, but they will only support 
these things if someone else pays. Clinton tried to persuade them that the 
"someone else" were greedy insurance and pharmaceutical companies and wasteful 
paper-shufflers, but his effort to demonize these groups failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the United States a parliamentary system, everything would have been 
different. In all likelihood, we would have long since had a single-payer 
system like Canada's or some version of the German plan. But the U.S. 
Constitution does not permit us to move decisively in such directions without a 
crisis; it permits us, at best, to modify the existing system, correct the 
worst and most widely recognized problems and devise new ways of having 
public-private partnerships that take into account diverse local realities. So 
stop complaining about Harry and Louise ads, PAC spending and congressional 
gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is a different story. There was, and is, in the public mind a genuine 
crisis, so some action is politically imperative. The problem is that neither 
the Constitution nor public opinion permits the federal government to do much 
except make symbolic gestures (the federal death penalty) and ship money to the 
states (to pay part of the costs of a few police officers, build some prisons 
and try some untested programs). And even to do these things, Washington must 
promise to help every congressional district and not just those with a severe 
crime problem. The recently announced allocation of federally subsidized police 
officers to the cities illustrates what this means -- such crime hot spots as 
Stanislaus, Calif., St. Albans, Vt., and Rock Springs, Wyo., will get some 
"tree" cops. 
</P>
<P>
 In a parliamentary regime with political authority centralized in a national 
government, things would have been different. There would long since have been 
a national police force (or, as in England, a nationally funded and directed 
set of local police forces) enforcing a national criminal code. If the death 
penalty existed, it would be based on national law applicable to all offenders. 
There would probably still be a Bill of Rights of some sort, but there would be 
no strong, independent judiciary to enforce it against the legislative branch. 
Because parliamentary systems are more responsive to national elites than to 
local interests, penal policy would reflect, in large measure, the views of 
these elites (in much of Europe of late, those views have favored decarceration 
and rehabilitation). Would such a nationalized criminal-justice system produce 
less crime? Not if the recent experience of England, Germany and Sweden is any 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
 National elites influenced our crime bill as well, though not nearly to the 
same degree as would be the case abroad. The price of a largely meaningless 
expansion of the federal death penalty -- and even more meaningless federal 
"three strikes" law -- was the insertion of several billion dollars for 
untested social spending. Critics called this "pork," as if that were a serious 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 But buying off potential coalition members with spending programs they favor 
is exactly what the Founders not only expected, but practiced. In 1790, 
Alexander Hamilton got his economic plan adopted in exchange for locating the 
capital district on the banks of the Potomac, as Thomas Jefferson wanted. 
Washington, D.C., was -- literally -- built on "pork." 
</P>
<P>
 What is significant about pork today is not that it is less savory or more 
common, but that it has changed. Once pork meant tangible benefits to 
particular districts (such as a grant for Lamar College in the Texas 
congressional district of Rep. Jack Brooks); today, it increasingly means 
general rules and programs to satisfy nationally organized constituencies (such 
as programs that somebody believes prevent crime). 
</P>
<P>
 Many liberals and conservatives would like this country to have health and 
crime policies that are more "rational" -- that is, systematically planned, 
carefully coordinated and centrally directed. Unless they want to scrap the 
Constitution, they should forget it. And a good thing, too; however messy, 
localistic and "irrational" our policies in these areas, they are likely to 
permit far greater levels of innovation and to be more easily subject to 
corrections in the light of experience than the "rational" policies abroad.*

THE NATION; EVERY REPUTATION IS REDEEMABLE FOR THE U.S. PUBLIC -- EXCEPT 
MCGOVERN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

and CNN.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is something of a tradition in this country to take our more contentious 
political figures and turn them into admired senior statesmen as they grow 
older. Thus, the once disdained Barry M. Goldwater -- landslide loser in 1964 
-- has been lionized in retirement, and even Richard M. Nixon made a comeback 
in public opinion in the years before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the jeering stops, it seems Americans can find a nice word to say about 
anybody. Then again, there's George S. McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two years after he lost 49 states to Nixon, McGovern is still something 
of a dirty word in American culture. In the past two weeks alone, Speaker of 
the House to-be Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has blamed the "McGovernick" legacy for 
everything from the nation's propensity for violence to its dearth of ethical 
values. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's core philosophy, he charged, is a 
combination of "counterculture and McGovern" -- though when Gingrich speaks, 
those two labels are redundant. 
</P>
<P>
 It does make some political sense to tie your opponent to someone who could 
carry only one state. And it's true that Bill Clinton did run Texas for 
McGovern -- about as successfully as he managed his own health-care plan. The 
larger question is why such a charge resonates 22 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to go back to Herbert Hoover to find a politician who remained so 
vilified that the opposition party could run against his name for decades after 
he left office. Yet, Hoover, at least, was President during the Depression; 
there was a record to attack. McGovern can hardly be blamed for implementing 
anything. All he did was lose overwhelmingly to our only President to resign in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 This has come about because voters' concerns this year appear to be based not 
so much on economic fears but on their sense that our culture seems out of 
control -- in the schools, the streets and on television. Conservatives like 
Gingrich or William J. Bennett, former secretary of education, have identified 
the root of all this evil in what they see as the permissive culture of the 
1960s, which undermined traditional American values. What's happened is that 
McGovern -- or, better yet, his followers -- has become a rallying symbol of 
all the elites out there today that conservatives such as Gingrich blame for 
subverting their pre-1963 vision of America -- the Great Society liberals, the 
press, Hollywood types, the Washington Establishment, liberal professors and, 
above all, those awful disciples of the counterculture. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, in fact, some truth to Gingrich's charges: Though its leader was a 
mild-mannered South Dakotan, McGovernism was an elite movement, staging a 
hostile takeover of the Democratic Party. That, after all, is why McGovern won 
only one state. His was an anti-Establishment campaign that often resembled a 
commune; it included Warren Beatty, his roving campaign sidekick Gary Hart, and 
enough longhairs on the 1972 convention floor to make many lunch-bucket 
Americans feel their Democratic Party had been stolen from them. 
</P>
<P>
 And no wonder: There's a story that when Gov. Frank Morrison of Nebraska 
introduced McGovern to an audience in a high-school gym, he intended to set the 
record straight about GOP smears that McGovern was for legalizing drugs. "They 
say George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, but I say -- ," he 
began, but he was drowned out by applause before he could finish the sentence. 
When he did, the audience went quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was long ago, and most of Gingrich's characterizations about the 
effects of these elites today are exaggerated, if not false. The universities, 
the media and Hollywood are not liberal monoliths, if they ever were -- which 
is why the conservative Rush Limbaugh and "Forrest Gump" are this year's 
sensations. There are no Great Society liberals left. (Maybe one -- Ira 
Magaziner.) The Washington Establishment is an equal-opportunity employer, as 
many former Reagan and Bush aides will attest. 
</P>
<P>
 It is certainly true that many values of the counterculture have become 
mainstream: If Americans are not for "acid, amnesty and abortion" -- the 1972 
GOP mischaracterization of McGovern's views -- they do tend to favor a right to 
abortion, while eschewing involvement in foreign wars. (Acid never caught on, 
but two out of three ain't bad.) In fact, many of the counterculture's other 
values -- its stress on sexual freedom and personal liberation; its emphasis on 
the rights of women and minorities, and its distrust of authority -- are now 
key parts of the mainstream culture. Which means Gingrich's quarrel is not so 
much with a McGovern or countercultural elite, as it is with the American 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Gingrich's preoccupation with the 1972 Democratic nominee may tell us 
more about him than it does about McGovern. For all his criticism of the 
Clintons and their ties to Democratic elites, the irony is that the 
speaker-to-be so closely resembles his arch-enemies that he could be their 
mirror image. He, too, is a baby boomer who avoided Vietnam and then spent the 
time in graduate school. Like Clinton, he is a lifelong political junkie, who 
retreats to academic settings to re-invigorate himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are vilified by enemies and are the target of constant jokes; neither has 
ever met a TV camera he didn't like. Both claim homes in the South, but now 
appear to be rooted nowhere -- or everywhere. The same "liberation" movements 
that Clinton's critics now find inherent in the chief executive's character 
apparently allowed Gingrich to gain a divorce and remarry in a way that might 
have eluded him before those awful 1960s. In the same way that Hillary has 
apparently always been a true believer -- wandering from support of Goldwater 
in 1964 to a "values-based liberalism" -- so, too, has Gingrich been a pilgrim 
in search of ideological purity -- moving from support of Nelson A. 
Rockefeller's statism in the '60s to his own values-based conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Clintons and Gingrich will clash. It has been said the most 
intense rivalries are between those most alike -- Harvard and Yale, Army and 
Navy, Alabama and Auburn. In their book, "Generations," William Strauss and 
Neil Howe predicted the baby boomers, always messianic in their opinions, would 
wage a great national battle among themselves over values, with neither side 
giving an inch. The last time a similar generation rose to power, they 
recalled, we ended up fighting the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks to be a horrifying two years. But don't blame me: I voted for 
McGovern.*

THE NATION; WHY ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT CAN'T KILL RATING SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Valenti, Jack Valenti is president and chief executive officer of the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The sounds one hears in Hollywood these days are the result of a collision 
between producers/directors/distributors and the movie industry's voluntary 
rating system. The producers grouse that the sys tem is out of touch with 
reality. The ratings board claims it is attuned to the desires of American 
parents. No wonder Prozac is a best seller. 
</P>
<P>
 For 25 years, the rating system has tried to adjust to society's changing 
mores and to keep abreast of parents' evolving "acceptance level" of the movies 
their children see even as the public's perceptions of movies and their content 
fluctuate. Consider: Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch," rated "R" when it was 
released in 1969, was re-rated "NC-17," the old "X" rating, when it was 
re-released this year. But according to the rules of the rating system, a 
previously rated film re-entering the marketplace can retain its original 
rating, so "The Wild Bunch" carries the "R." Yet, the moral is clear: What was 
acceptable for children in one rating category more than 20 years ago may not 
be today. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the production cost of films has ratcheted upward, some producers and 
distributors argue stridently against an NC-17 rating. Less restrictive 
ratings, they believe, will increase their box-office take and make it easier 
for them to recoup their costs and turn a profit. But the moving-rating board 
cannot act as a council of economic planners. Moreover, the rating board is 
constrained to classify movies strictly on the basis of what might offend or 
disturb parents if their children were watching them. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter a dilemma: Producers and directors want the right, without any outside 
interference, to make their film the way they want to make it and, at the same 
time, demand a rating that would be most congenial to ticket sales. Then add 
the ardor of filmmakers to push the creative envelope in telling their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rating board, mindful of its obligations to warn parents of 
potentially objectionable content, has no choice but to apply ratings that are 
both accurate and suitable for parental needs. As a consequence, the 
movie-rating system regularly receives a pounding in the trade papers, the 
Hollywood Reporter and Variety, and in the daily print and broadcast press. The 
"assaulters" are mostly producers, directors and distributors who use the 
rating system as a marketing punching bag, trashing it to gain free publicity 
for their movies. The big surprise is that it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why one bears witness to odd couplings: hired lawyer-gunslingers 
congregating at the O.K. Corral with distributors/producers armed with bazooka 
press releases. They lie in wait for TV commentators and newspaper film 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The strangest stranger to enter this congregation is Alan M. Dershowitz, the 
Harvard law professor. Acting on behalf of a film distributor, he recently 
issued a denunciation of the rating system, damning it as "censorship." Alas, 
Dershowitz, as a law student, would have been awarded an "A" in Posturing 101, 
but he would have surely flunked Constitutional Law. All the more reason to nod 
approvingly at Dr. Samuel Johnson who, when attending a reception in 
18th-Century London with the actor David Garrick, said, pointing to a man 
across the room, "David, I do not choose to speak ill behind any man's back, 
but that gentleman over there is an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the lawyers-turned-ratings-sluggers should listen not to their silken 
ambiguities, which can make a trumpet sound like a tin whistle, but heed the 
needs of American parents. Those who cry "censorship" have to be instructed in 
case law. Any paralegal could advise them to consult two Supreme Court rulings, 
handed down in April, 1968. In Interstate Circuit vs. City of Dallas, the court 
declared that state and local entities could construct their own classification 
apparatus to restrict children's movie-going, and in Ginsberg vs. the State of 
New York, it ruled that while adults could see whatever they chose, children 
could be barred from viewing certain movies. Thus, prohibiting children from 
watching certain kinds of movies does not torment the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 In their zeal to annihilate the rating system, producers and their lawyers 
ought to understand that both nature and politics abhor vacuums. If the movie 
industry is unable to sustain its 26-year-old voluntary ratings enterprise 
because of unworthy attacks, all empty of evidence, you can bet that states, 
counties and cities will move in with their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year, American parents have expressed their support for and 
approval of the ratings. Since 1969, the Opinion Research Corp. of Princeton, 
N.J., has annually conducted a nationwide survey to determine how parents judge 
the system. This year, parental approval rose to an all-time high: 77% of 
parents with children 13 and under said the ratings were "very useful" to 
"fairly useful" in helping them guide their children's movie-going. Only 20% 
found it "not useful." That's the kind of approval rating any candidate for 
public office would kill to own. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a nice turn of irony that the most admiring supporters of the rating 
system are the folks to whom the system is directed and for whom it was 
created: the parents of America.*

THE WORLD; JUST WHAT SHOULD THE ROLE OF THE U.S. BE IN THE 'PACIFIC CENTURY'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James A. Baker III, James A. Baker III served as secretary of state from 
1989-1992. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will the year 2000 mark the advent of the "Pacific Century," as many experts 
predict? And will East Asia's ascendance, as some of the experts assert, mean 
the eclipse of the United States as the region's dominant power? 
</P>
<P>
 I sought answers to these questions on a recent trip to Singapore, Taiwan and 
Japan. For these and the other dynamic nations of the Far East, the Pacific 
Century has already begun. This is certainly true in the economic realm. 
Despite Japan's recession, Far East economies remain the envy of their 
competitors and an example to less-developed countries everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States has nothing to fear from a Pacific Century. Indeed, we 
are uniquely positioned to advance our strategic, political and economic 
interests -- both within the region and internationally. But we can do so only 
if we are prepared to use our military power and diplomatic influence to help 
meet critical East Asian challenges in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important challenge is Beijing's emergence into a post-Deng 
era -- a transition with vast ramifications not just for China but for the 
entire region. Deng Xiaoping's approach of economic liberalization combined 
with political authoritarianism has yielded remarkable short-term results in 
growth. It is not, however, sustainable in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, delaying the transition to a more popularly based form of government 
risks turmoil when the current generation of leadership passes from the scene. 
The most likely scenario is a period of calm, lasting perhaps six months to two 
years, as the leading figures of the new generation share power. Then the 
internal jockeying for position will begin. One possibility is the emergence of 
a military dictatorship prepared to suppress political discontent and resort to 
regional adventurism. Even more dangerous is another possibility -- that China 
might revert to the chaos it knew during the 1920s, when rival warlords 
struggled for primacy.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its allies in East Asia have a powerful interest in 
China's long-term stability. This stability is best served by an approach that 
balances close economic ties with China and the maintenance of a credible U.S. 
military presence in the Far East. Our defense relationships with Japan, South 
Korea and the countries in the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations will remain 
linchpins of Asian security -- not as part of an anti-Chinese alliance but as a 
force for stability. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing economic ties between China and the outside world are the best 
guarantee of responsible Chinese behavior toward its neighbors. In particular, 
the United States must beware of counterproductive confrontations like the one 
over most-favored-nation status that the Clinton Administration narrowly 
averted. Nothing plays more directly into the hands of potential post-Deng 
hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 A second key Pacific challenge is the instability represented by the Korean 
Peninsula. Unfortunately, North Korea's dangerous game of nuclear cat and mouse 
appears to have paid off. The recent agreement between the Clinton 
Administration and the Kim Il Jong regime represents a tacit acknowledgment of 
North Korea's nuclear status. As such, it undermines both the international 
non-proliferation regime and peace in Northeast Asia.  
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's nuclear weapons, whatever their number, constitute a direct 
threat to South Korea and the U.S. troops stationed there. The Clinton 
Administration may have gained some breathing room. But it has done so at a 
real cost.  
</P>
<P>
 The medium- to long-term strategic consequences of the agreement may be an 
increased, not diminished, risk of conflict on the Korean Peninsula. This 
places a premium on maintaining, and perhaps bolstering, U.S. military assets 
on the Korean Peninsula and surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the continuing threat of a nuclear North Korea requires that the 
United States review its current policy on the development of theater 
antiballistic missile systems. If we are willing to forgo full adherence with 
the international non-proliferation regime -- and the Clinton Administration, 
regrettably, appears ready to do so -- then we must also be prepared to develop 
the necessary tools to protect U.S. forces from nuclear attack. One thing is 
clear: The message of the Administration's agreement with North Korea will not 
be lost on other rogue states seeking nuclear capability. 
</P>
<P>
 A third challenge confronting the Far East will be the region's economic 
transformation. Following Japan's export-led development model, East Asia's 
economies have, in just a few decades, become global forces to reckon with. 
Yet, Japan's experience also demonstrates the limits of export-led growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant trade surpluses are no substitute for strong domestic demand. Chronic 
trade imbalances prompt international tensions and exact costs in terms of 
living standards. Today, Japan is slowly moving toward a more balanced economic 
approach. Other East Asian economies face a similar transition. But they are 
well-placed to do so. Most East Asian nations have achieved economic growth 
without extreme inequalities of income. The existence of an emerging middle 
class bodes well for consumption-based growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, much remains to be done in terms of opening domestic markets and 
encouraging demand. Otherwise, economic imbalances will sow the seeds of 
political conflict. That, in turn, may undercut U.S. engagement on critical 
Asian security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional liberalization of international trade and investment will be a 
critical part of this process. The long-overdue conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should mark the transition toward 
even broader liberalization of trade and investment among the nations of the 
Pacific Rim. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum provides a powerful 
vehicle for just such liberalization.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, President Bill Clinton attended the APEC meeting in Indonesia -- 
where he and other heads of state committed to an action agenda of trade and 
investment liberalization. It is in America's interest that APEC's approach be 
inclusive, not exclusive.  
</P>
<P>
 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed has been promoting the idea of an 
Asian multilateral organization that would include Japan -- but exclude the 
United States. This is dangerous. Nearly 50 years after World War II, it would 
be tragic to attempt once again to draw an arbitrary line across the Pacific. 
The damage to U.S.-Japanese relations, the cornerstone of peace and prosperity 
in the Pacific, could be irreparable. For decades, the U.S. market has been an 
engine of growth for countries like Japan and Malaysia; for Japan to join an 
Asian trade caucus that excludes the United States would mean not just a 
betrayal of trust but an open invitation to a trade war.  
</P>
<P>
 Given the stakes, the Clinton Administration must oppose any such effort and 
it should not hesitate to press Japan to say no. Instead, the United States and 
Japan should continue working through APEC to develop and implement a flexible 
framework that permits members to offer freer trade and investment -- not just 
among member states, but with other countries, including Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic liberalization will also strengthen the regional trend toward more 
broadly based government. The ever more prosperous populations of the Far East 
are eager for a greater say in public decisions. The experience of Taiwan, 
which now has a per-capita gross domestic product of $11,000 and a lively 
multiparty system, reveals the symbiotic relationship between free markets and 
free government. The challenge of economic transformation is just one key test 
that the United States and the nations of East Asia must face together. 
</P>
<P>
 This commonality of interest, in turn, reflects a another fundamental truth: 
The United States remains, as it has been since the late-19th Century, a 
Pacific power. East Asians recognize this and, indeed, embrace it. Everywhere I 
went, Asian leaders called for more U.S. engagement, not less. They realize, as 
Americans should, that if the Pacific Century is to be peaceful and prosperous, 
the United States must be part of it.*

 The act of sending letters to all my high school friends at the touch of a 
button -- and joining rec.music.Dylan (for Bob Dylan fans) -- transformed me 
into a cyber addict. Nightly, I trekked to the computer lab, where I found a 
long line of students with fingers itching to play keyboard. My mind was set on 
chatting with my on-line boyfriend, R2D2. 
</P>
<P>
 The internet is becoming America's latest addiction, especially on college 
campuses, which frequently offer free e-mail accounts and easy access. The 
"Just Say No" to sex, drugs and alcohol may soon include e-mail and surfing the 
information superhighway. Soon CA (Cyberaddicts Anonymous) may be added to AA. 
I quit in time; others aren't so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyber addicts are easy to spot. They sit for hours in front of a screen, 
laughing, talking and smiling. They proudly tell you they consume four hours a 
day on the internet, socializing with the likes of KillBarney. Forget study. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what she would do if the school took away her internet access, 
junior Petrea Mitchell turned pale. "I'd have to get a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say they would buy a modem. All they would have to do is log on to the 
school's system, still free of cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The temptation to enter cyberspace is great. Logging onto the IRC allows you 
to chat with as many as 30 people simultaneously. There are hundreds of news 
groups where the latest movies are debated, the psychology of body art 
dissected and Camille Paglia and Rush Limbaugh bashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instant friendships can be struck in places as far away as Australia and 
Africa through soc.penpals. Love at first byte is always a possibility. For a 
generation accustomed to fast music and fast food, the internet seems a perfect 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 But cyber surfing nine or 10 hours a day and on into the night can produce 
carpal-tunnel syndrome and a falling grade point average. There are always one 
or two such addicts in the lab. If you wave to them, they react as if you are a 
figment of virtual reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, these students become so connected to the world of information 
they disconnect from their own environment. They lose friends, give up school 
activities, student government or sports. Many lock themselves in dorm rooms, 
coffin-style. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Henderson, president of the Lead Pencil Club, which aims to put a pothole 
in the information superhighway, thinks that giving college students free 
internet accounts is "a total horror." 
</P>
<P>
 If colleges charged for internet use on an hourly basis, or if accounts were 
dispensed according to need and hours were limited, abuse, or addiction, could 
be diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 As seemingly great as free access on the information superhighway may seem to 
prospective students and their parents, the dangers and damage it can cause 
often outweigh the positives. 
</P>
<P>
 So here's some advice from an ex-cyber addict. Think twice before entering the 
maddening, tempting and addictive world of cyberspace. Logging on is easy, but 
logging off is a whole other story.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; PAMELA HARRIMAN; ON HAVING AN AFFINITY FOR POWER; 
ON BEING THE IDEAL U.S. AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Kraft, Scott Kraft is Paris bureau chief for The Times. He interviewed 
Pamela Harriman in her office in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Bill Clinton gave a political fund raiser and Washington 
hostess the plum job of ambassador to France, few doubted Pamela Harriman 
deserved the reward. The surprise is that she has turned out to be uniquely 
qualified for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman, a force in the Democratic Party and 
early supporter of Clinton, has been the U.S. government's envoy in Paris for 
18 months, presiding over the large embassy staff and handling weighty economic 
and military matters. But perhaps more important, her skills as a political 
insider, her close links to Clinton, her fluency in French, her sense of style 
and her ease in international drawing rooms have made this British-born 
aristocrat a favorite of French business and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at age 74, Harriman's extraordinary life, which has intersected with 
many of the world's most famous and powerful men, seems to have been one long 
preparatory school for this job. Married to Winston Churchill's son, Randolph, 
she lived at No. 10 Downing Street during World War II, often serving as the 
prime minister's hostess. (Her stories of Gen. Charles de Gaulle's visits to 
the Churchill home never fail to impress her French hosts.) 
</P>
<P>
 She was later married to Broadway producer Leland Hayward and, after his 
death, to W. Averell Harriman, presidential adviser and Democratic political 
heavyweight who died in 1986. She was also romantically linked over the years 
with other important men, including CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, Italian car 
magnate Gianni Agnelli and French aristocrat, Baron Elie de Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
 From the early 1980s until Clinton's election, she was an important figure in 
the Democratic Party, founding a political-action committee and hosting regular 
"issues evenings" that helped shape party strategy and policy. 
</P>
<P>
 An unauthorized biography of Harriman, "The Life of the Party," published 
earlier this year, portrays her as a calculating courtesan who targeted rich 
and powerful men, "parlaying her ambition and talents into a vast fortune and 
major political clout." The ambassador refuses to talk about the book. And, 
through her attorney, she denies claims made in a recent lawsuit filed by 19 
Harriman heirs, who accuse the ambassador and other trustees of Averell 
Harriman's estate of mismanaging $25 million in trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the lawsuit nor her past romances bother the French, though. In fact, 
her life story only seems to gild her reputation as a political insider. An 
invitation to lunch is coveted by the high and mighty in French politics and 
culture. Visitors to the ambassador's residence are treated to orchid-filled 
rooms and part of her impressive personal art collection, which includes works 
by Picasso, Matisse and Cezanne, as well as the formidable "White Roses," by 
Van Gogh. Talking in her large office on a recent rainy Paris afternoon, she 
discussed everything from French-U.S. relations to the attributes of powerful 
men in a strong voice, lightly accented by her British heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is it the French have trouble understanding about America?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: One of my principal efforts ever since I got here has been to make 
them understand the power of our Congress, because under their system, there is 
no such power. It does not exist . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When French ministers visit Washington, I've tried to convince them to meet 
with people on the Hill . . . . But it has been interesting how difficult it is 
to make others understand the political division between the Administration and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there any other areas?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Of non-understanding? Yes, especially in the cultural area. Films for us 
are commercial and for them, they're culture. And there is a disagreement and a 
misunderstanding, quite understandably, about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, our films are so enormously popular in France . . . . But our film 
magnates are really trying to do more to involve French producers, directors 
and actors. The world today is global and we've got to start looking at it 
through that vision. There is a problem, but this can be addressed, and I think 
we are probably taking the lead in doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On the other side of the coin, do you find yourself having to clear up 
misunderstandings in Washington about French politics?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's why embassies exist, to report back to Washington what we see as the 
feeling that is prevailing in our respective countries. We must realize where 
they (the French) are coming from; it's often not evil intentions but natural 
traditions. The Atlantic is a very large space of water. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things about France today is that it's really emerging as a 
high-tech country. It is no longer the country of wine and perfume. It's the 
country of Airbus, satellites, the TGV (high-speed trains). And I think that is 
putting France in kind of a different category in the global thick of things. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are the French beginning to take Clinton more seriously?  
</P>
<P>
 A: At first, they didn't know him, and they may have been apprehensive that 
they had read that he was a domestic President. But everyone here was really 
extraordinarily impressed with him the first time he came to Europe. And when 
he came to Paris in June, they were absolutely bowled over. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the French have said to me, "You know, this is the first time we've 
seen an American President who really could discuss Europe and had a vision for 
Europe." They found it exciting. People at home forget that this is the first 
President who has had a European education. He was at Oxford; he did travel as 
a student over here. So he's had an appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 And I must tell you that the first time that my late husband, Averell 
Harriman, and I got to know the young governor from Arkansas, which was, I 
guess, '79 or '80, he impressed us because he was so very interested in 
European history, talking with Averell about World War II, and (Josef) Stalin 
and (Winston) Churchill and (Charles) de Gaulle. So I've always known that he 
had an interest and understanding of global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it possible, in these times, for a President to maintain a high approval 
rating over a long period of time?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's what history is going to tell us. But I suspect that this is a 
particularly difficult moment in history. He has, I believe, a very good vision 
of the problems. But there are volcanoes going off all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody can pick a quarrel with any agreement, you and I know that. But the 
thing is to get things moving, to get them on track, to get them going the way 
we want them to go and I think we have a President who is committed to that. 
It's showing, and the world is beginning to see. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, it's awesome to be the one superpower in the world. (But) I really 
think the President is showing his good, true colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have known some of the most important world leaders of this century. Is 
there some common denominator?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It basically comes down to very simple components. There are many, many 
clever and brilliant people. But to be a public figure, a leader on the world 
stage, you have to first of all have an extraordinary health and physical 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 I've known many leaders, and all of the greats have had an outstanding 
physical capacity -- a capacity to endure. And it sounds silly, but I think 
that is a very, very important component, and we see that in the President 
today. However brilliant you are, unless you are blessed with a health that 
gives you that extra endurance, that extra energy . . . . and Churchill had it 
-- even FDR (Franklin D. Roosevelt) had it, with all his physical problems. 
That goes all through. They all had it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there other qualities?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Great men have to know how to delegate. I remember Churchill saying once, 
when talking about his own Cabinet, that unless people know how to delegate, 
they can't administer. I suspect there's a great deal of truth in that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it important, too, to be able to listen?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, that was one of the great strengths of Jack Kennedy, that he would get 
his wise men in around him, and would listen to all of their points of view, 
then he would make up his own mind. But he would listen to all of them first. 
And that's a trick of a leader, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who have been your teachers in the art of diplomacy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: When you get to my age, you've known a lot of people, you've seen a lot of 
things, and I'm privileged. One of the fascinating things for me about this 
50th anniversary year of the D-day landings was, in a sense, that I was there 
50 years ago. To be in this position 50 years later is kind of wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember that long wait we had for the invasion. And that's when I 
understood the leadership of (Gen. Dwight D.) Eisenhower, because, whatever 
history writes or does, we knew that Ike made that decision alone. Of course, 
it turned out to be absolutely the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But on the question of your teachers?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are always little things that happen, and I suddenly remember what 
so-and-so said, or what Churchill might have said or what Averell had told me 
about Stalin . . . . You can't sort of pinpoint it really, but there have been 
many years of having been privileged to listen to great men in many situations. 
I think it also gives one balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you mean by that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: People always say, "It's the worst of times," and we think we have so many 
problems, but, you know, there have always been deep problems. And the nearer 
you are to the center, the more those problems are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, one of the lessons to me -- which is something which history 
really doesn't record -- is that when Churchill became prime minister in May, 
1940, and moved into Downing Street, there were many, many times in the next 
five years when he went down to the House of Commons and didn't know whether 
they would throw him out. 
</P>
<P>
 You read history and everybody says, "Well, Churchill was all-powerful and he 
was a great leader of the war." But when you knew the inside story, there were 
bad moments in the war. The Conservative Party wasn't always on his side, and 
there were certain elements that would have been perfectly happy to see him 
removed during the war. And all these things are very interesting when you put 
them in a modern context. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Congress is due to take up GATT in the coming weeks. How crucial is its 
passage?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It is very, very important that it pass -- for America and for our economy. 
It will bring us a strong, reliable trading system, worldwide income and 
job-generating opportunities. It would really be a disaster if, after seven 
years of hard work, this was not ratified. The rest of Europe is waiting for 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your assessment of the French leaders of today?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They're very different from the French politicians I knew in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In what way?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, they're much more outgoing, they're much more individualist. I guess, 
you know, modern technology brings them more into the public arena, television 
and all of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does anything in Europe surprise you today?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What is surprising to me is how little it has changed and yet how well it 
has modernized itself. If you take this city, which is perhaps one of the most 
beautiful cities in the world, it is better than it was 30 years ago when I 
lived here. The buildings have been cleaned, the lighting at night is 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 What is fascinating to me is the fact that a president here can spend a lot of 
money doing over the Louvre, which all comes out of the taxpayers' pockets, and 
everybody is happy about it, proud of it and applauds it. This is kind of 
comforting that, in the difficult world we live in, people are still prepared 
to let their governments do these things. It isn't building extravagance; it's 
really keeping the culture and heritage. You know the French traditions; we can 
get sometimes very annoyed by " les traditions ," but it is a big force in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's been your biggest challenge here?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think really the challenge has been to find out how I can best interpret 
the French to us in America, to us in Washington. And that's where perhaps I 
have an advantage, being European-born. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you find the demands of the job particularly taxing?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Listen, if a job is dull, it's long and grueling. If it's exciting, it's 
really a pleasure. Every day is different, you're dealing with a lot of 
different things and it is just very fascinating. I'm privileged to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the publication of the unauthorized biography of you, "Life of the 
Party," affected the way you function here?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, absolutely not. Why should it? We're far removed from any of that kind 
of nonsense.

STUDY ON BIAS IN L.A. FIRE DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have been a member of the Los Angeles City Fire Department for 10 years 
and have seen many changes, mostly in how our department has bent over backward 
and helped women and minorities prepare for and become successful in attaining 
the position of firefighter and other departmental promotions. Probationary 
firefighters are assigned to the busiest stations so that they may acquire the 
best possible training and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of minorities have successfully received training at these so-called 
"rookie kill stations" (Nov. 12 and 15) and are now productive members of our 
department. These stations are the most sought after assignments by all members 
because of the high level of activity at these locations. To say that rookies 
are not trained at these stations is untrue; members assigned to these stations 
are the "cream of the crop" and take great pride in their work and in preparing 
rookies to become the most proficient firefighters possible, regardless of 
ethnicity or gender. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that those rookies who are complaining just can't "cut the mustard" 
and are clinging to anything they can before they sink. It is unfortunate that 
they blame their failures on racial or sexual biases rather than on their 
inability in meeting the minimum standards of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 As for promotional opportunities, 11 of the top 20 on the promotional list for 
captain and four recently promoted chief officers are minorities. To say that 
there is a lack of opportunity or that it is difficult to promote is 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, I am a member of a minority group and I don't blame my 
achievements or failures on any ethnic biases. I take full responsibility for 
my own performance. 
</P>

<P>
 * It appears that Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald Manning is finally being 
forced to confront the truth that he has quietly encouraged behind the scenes 
for so many years. The promotional system certainly does include aspects of 
"who you know" that accompanies the "do as I say, not as I do" behavior of 
several individuals from captain on up. 
</P>
<P>
 There are blatant examples of differential treatment of women, including one 
woman whose career was adversely affected after being arbitrarily and unfairly 
accused of being "inappropriate" for wearing shorts and a T-shirt to a fire 
station on a 95-degree day, even though upon arrival she had immediately 
changed into the required paramedics uniform! 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on any LAFD chief who denies the existence of the "good old boy" network 
while actively participating in it! High quality and good employee morale are 
too important to be overlooked for the sake of interdepartmental politics!

HOLLYWOOD AND ANTI-SEMITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Responding to Neal Gabler's attack against William Cash's article in Vanity 
Fair, "The New Establishment," I was struck by how obsessed Gabler is with 
Judaism; his own and others ("In a Lament of the Old 'Establishment,' Hollywood 
Encounters Anti-Semitism," Opinion, Nov. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler rails against Cash for what he deems to be his "anti-Semitism" when 
Cash was merely stating a fact: the majority of high-level executives working 
in Hollywood today are Jewish males. So what? Cash's statement is no more 
remarkable than the New York City Police Department being staffed mainly by 
Irish-Americans or that most sushi chefs are Japanese. Nonetheless, Gabler 
feels compelled to go on the defensive and hurl invective at what he wrongly 
assumes are mainstream Gentile biases against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 In my limited experience as a screenwriter in Hollywood, I fortunately have 
not experienced the hostile, racist environment Gabler describes. The problems 
I do encounter have more to do with the sheer difficulty of trying to crank out 
decent product. 
</P>
<P>
 When I go to story meetings, I don't perceive that my ideas are shot down 
because I'm a white female of Irish Catholic descent, as Gabler's thesis would 
suggest, but because they weren't very inspired, or because they're not what 
the producer wants. I don't pay attention as to whether a particular suggestion 
is from a Jew or a Gentile, a man or woman, an Asian or a Caucasian, but 
instead am grateful for anything that could help. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Gabler's jaundiced point of view, most people in Hollywood don't 
sit around thinking about the implications of last names; they're too busy 
making movies. I bristle at the Hollywood Gabler describes because it does a 
disservice to people of all faiths in trying to find fault where there is none. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Thank you for publishing Gabler's review of Cash's article on Jews in 
Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 In this era of political correctness, American Jews increasingly allow small 
and large anti-Semitic sentiments to diminish our contributions. We think that 
we are safe from the demagoguery of the past. But, as Gabler notes, the really 
offensive bile, the stuff that destroys one's soul, comes in the well-mannered, 
reasonable, high-minded verbiage of the thoughtful intellectual journals. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash wouldn't know anti-Semitism if it hit him in the face. Like all too many 
bigots, he thinks that reasonable people will grant him license to offend. He's 
wrong.

"potatoheads."  
</P>
<P>
 Food for thought, no doubt. Frankly, Mr. Rosenberg, I do give a damn.

PUT IT ON AND STAY ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government often is accused of taking the fun out of life through its daily 
intrusions. So it is natural that mandatory safety measures, be they laws 
requiring seat belts or motorcycle crash helmets, would be the target of harsh 
public criticism.Yet in study after study these so-called intrusions are shown 
to reduce deaths and injuries, sometimes significantly, and often at great 
savings for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, California passed legislation requiring motorcyclists and their 
passengers to wear crash helmets. Opponents were extremely vocal and went so 
far as to vow to protest by defying the headgear law. Now into the picture 
rides a UCLA study showing that the measure helped reduce motorcycle fatalities 
by 37.5% in its first year, sparing as many as 122 lives. The helmet law also 
was found to have reduced passenger deaths and nonfatal injuries, along with 
the time that injured cyclists spent in intensive-care units. All of this saves 
massive amounts of public money. A UC Davis study several years ago found that 
medical bills for an injured motorcyclist averaged more than $17,700 (surely 
that figure has risen since). About 82% of the cost is picked up by the 
unsuspecting taxpayer in the form of publicly funded state emergency services 
-- another reason nearly half of all the states, and the District of Columbia, 
have helmet laws on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly the evidence supports those who argued that headgear legislation would 
pay off substantially over the years by keeping thousands of people in one 
piece. A motorcycle helmet may be an inconvenience, but it may also allow its 
user to live to ride another day.

FOREIGN POLICY IN THE COLD WAR'S WAKE: A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than four decades the Cold War defined U.S. foreign policy, focusing 
American national interests and giving rise to an unprecedented level of 
international engagement. Without the Cold War there would have been no global 
network of military and political alliances, no costly interventions in Korea 
and Southeast Asia, no arms race. At home, national security concerns raised by 
the ideological competition with communism helped mobilize backing for the 
federal highway system, the space program and government subsidies for 
scientific research and education. To an extent perhaps still not fully 
realized, the Cold War directed the course of much of American history in the 
second half of the 20th Century. Now, in its aftermath, a new agenda of global 
challenges has emerged to test American leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans, willingly or resignedly, continue to accept that Washington 
must go on playing a lead role in international affairs; most other nations, 
too, accept this. There simply is no other power whose leadership others 
immediately look to when crises erupt or great international ventures are 
called for. The United States, says Lt. Gen. James Clapper, director of the 
Defense Intelligence Agency, has become "kind of the world's 911." Foreigners, 
however, appear to be more eager than Americans to have the United States take 
the point position. With the end of the Cold War has come an unmistakable 
erosion in the national consensus on just what the scope and nature of U.S. 
engagement abroad should be, especially where the use of force might be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was always domestic dissent over the nature of the Cold War and 
the means with which it was waged, most Americans generally supported policies 
that aimed at containing the spread of communism. But in the post-Cold War era, 
a study by the Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press has found, there 
is no longer broad agreement on where vital interests lie. The public and 
opinion leaders agree that protecting U.S. oil supplies and trying to prevent 
nuclear proliferation are of basic importance, the survey found. Other polls 
have pointed to a readiness to support intervention related to such domestic 
problems as illegal drugs and illegal immigration. Beyond that, opinion is 
unfocused and uncertain. All this can change, of course, as the world changes 
and as the drama of events works on popular emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Globe-spanning technology that now makes instantaneous communications possible 
can be a wonderful thing. But at the policy-making level, it can be an 
insidious thief that robs decision makers of the time they need to reflect and 
consult. James A. Baker III, George Bush's secretary of state during the 
Persian Gulf War, once said that a CNN broadcast of a "peace" proposal by 
Saddam Hussein early in the crisis forced the White House to rush out a 
response within the hour, lest Iraq gain a propaganda advantage. Similarly, 
concern over how the public might react to TV pictures of the devastation along 
the highway taken by Iraqi troops retreating from Kuwait prompted the U.S. 
decision to bring the war to what many think was a premature halt. For better 
or worse, information technology has become an influential force in decision 
making. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, Washington has opted for multinational approaches to world 
problems, through a stronger United Nations or other groupings. Nowhere is that 
more important than in trying to contain the chaos and alleviate the suffering 
produced by the implosion of what have come to be known as failed states. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming weeks, The Times will explore some of the key challenges U.S. 
foreign policy is likely to face in the years ahead. Based in part on 
interviews with more than a score of specialists, we will look at basic 
concerns and interests that drive U.S. policy, assess what the nation's global 
priorities should be and what realistic limits govern American efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War, for all its anxious testing of wills, in time came to be 
regulated by implicit understandings among the major powers. Where Cold 
War-related conflicts occurred -- in Southeast Asia, the Middle East -- they 
stayed localized. In a crude way, the Cold War produced something of an orderly 
world, able to carry on even under the omnipresent threat of mutual assured 
nuclear destruction. That threat has been lifted. But while the superpowers 
have halted their arms race, smaller states have not. Indeed, there has been a 
breakdown in the restraints Moscow and Washington once could apply to the 
spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Controlling 
proliferation looms as one of the great problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry A. Kissinger has written, "The problems of energy, resources, 
environment, population, the uses of space and the seas, now rank with 
questions of military security, ideology and territorial rivalry, which have 
traditionally made up the diplomatic agenda." At the same time, competition for 
world markets has intensified, even as the need for greater economic 
integration and cooperation has expanded. American vision and leadership are 
certain to be severely tested in confronting basic problems of how finite 
global resources can be justly apportioned among this planet's rapidly 
expanding population. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign policy agenda for coming years -- not a series of discrete 
problems but a tangle of interrelated ones -- is crowded, complex and worrying. 
In coming weeks we'll look at some of the major items on that agenda, and offer 
some ideas about how our country should proceed.

SINGLE TAXPAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Whenever one reads about a proposed middle-class tax cut, it invariably is 
about families and/or tax credits for children, be it for child care or 
educational purposes.The single taxpayer is never given consideration although 
that segment of the population carries a heavy tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is time for the single taxpayers to organize and mobilize for 
consideration. The senior population has been most successful in having its 
voice heard by legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for those who govern to realize that those who are unmarried are 
voters also. Remember us when talking about middle-class tax cuts. We need your 
help too. And there will be more election days to come.

 * Re "Learn a Language? It's Elementary," Nov. 11: 
</P>
<P>
 When inner-city children as young as 6 years old are learning to speak 
Chinese, Japanese and Russian, why are we spending millions of dollars in 
sorely needed tax revenues to translate everything into Spanish for our Latino 
population?

 * The article dealing with the success of the Marvin Avenue Language Magnet 
Center in teaching English-speaking children a foreign language seems to 
indicate that this is the approach that should be used in teaching English to 
our non-English-speaking children. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe it is universally accepted that the optimum time to efficiently 
learn a foreign language is from ages 0 to 7 years. Why then do we persist in 
placing children in classes where they are taught in their native tongue 
(usually Spanish), and missing out on utilizing the years where they could 
learn English so easily?

him in the act of picking up the ransom money ("Verdict in Brutality Case

BUREAUCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a small employer, one must wonder what goes through our local 
governments' (county and city) bureaucratic minds when it comes to scheduling 
interviews with persons on some sort of government assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
 On many occasion I've had employees not ask but tell me that they have an 
appointment with their social worker to discuss one of the programs and their 
eligibility.Failure to attend or attempt to reschedule after work is either 
impossible of forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, they must take the time off, and in some cases the entire day 
since the bureaucratic minds have trouble keeping the appointment time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the employees often lose their jobs, the taxpayers continue to pay 
more for these assistance programs, and the bureaucrat still continues to be 
oblivious to the real problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about time the system bureaucrats begin to deal with the problem they 
often cause themselves. Perhaps evening appointments for those who work during 
the day may save jobs and reduce government cost. But then again, this would be 
contrary to the definition of bureaucrat.

COLUMN RIGHT / LLEWELLYN H. ROCKWELL JR.: THE 'CONTRACT' IS A BETRAYAL OF 
AMERICA; THE PARTY ELITES' PSEUDO-CONSERVATISM REFUTES THE WILL OF THE RANK AND 
FILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LLEWELLYN H. ROCKWELL JR., Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. is president of the 
Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The electoral revolution of 1994 is being betrayed by the old-line Republican 
leadership, including Newt Gingrich. Since Bloody Tuesday, he has attempted to 
smother the ideas of the radical rank-and-file of the GOP. From the budget to 
foreign policy, the Republican elites now stand to the left of their own party 
and the American electorate as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending -- Instead of cutting the budget, the Republican elites are pushing 
for a panoply of institutional changes that are more symbol than substance. A 
balanced-budget amendment, for example, is unenforceable. Even if heeded, it is 
more likely to lead to tax increases than spending cuts. And it won't come into 
effect for many years. How about actually balancing the budget instead? 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxing -- The "contract with America" calls for a capital-gains tax cut, but 
it will strangle the mortgage-interest deduction to pay for it. And it says 
nothing about income taxes, which are a main source of middle-class anger. The 
GOP cried mutiny when President Bush raised taxes. Why not start by rolling 
back Republican tax increases? 
</P>
<P>
 * Welfare -- The "contract" proposal -- two-year limits, cuts in cash 
subsidies, group homes, workfare -- isn't much different from Clinton's phony 
reform, and it would actually raise spending. According to the polls, 
two-thirds of Americans think the government shouldn't even give welfare. Can't 
the Republicans cut any of this $500 billion-per-year industry? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say we had the chance to abolish whole segments of the welfare state 
tomorrow. Would the GOP leadership go along? The Proposition 187 debate 
provides a clue. The national Republican Establishment -- from Jack Kemp to 
William Kristol -- was on the wrong side. And in league with the left, 
Republicans labeled their traditional constituency nativist, racist and 
xenophobic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Social Security -- In an asinine attempt to be more leftist than thou, 
Gingrich blasted the Democrats for wanting to cut Social Security, a view 
bolstered by the "contract's" call to repeal "taxes" (actually welfare benefit 
decreases for the well-to-do) on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP should implement a buyout system to privatize Social Security. To 
defend the present system -- and Republicans did during the election -- is 
prima facie evidence of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trade -- One of many bipartisan conspiracies is the attempt to have 
government manage trade. That is the essence of the GATT agreement, which even 
creates a new global agency called the World Trade Organization to do it. 
Gingrich has called for the lame-duck Congress to do Clinton a favor and pass 
the agreement. If the Republicans can't stand up to liberals on globally 
managed trade, they won't be independent anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreign Policy -- The President's foreign-policy obsessions have made the 
Democrats the chief defenders of U.S. empire. Rather than criticize this, the 
Republican leadership is outflanking him on the left by calling for globaloney. 
The "contract," absurdly, even advocates higher military spending. 
</P>
<P>
 A notable exception is Jesse Helms, who has criticized U.S. involvement in the 
United Nations and NATO. He may even take aim at foreign aid. But the times 
also call for a complete defunding of the IMF, the World Bank and the 
Export-Import Bank. The rallying cry is simple: Keep U.S. tax dollars in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crime -- So far, the GOP's contribution to the crime issue has been to build 
more federal prisons and federalize more crimes. These big-government 
"solutions" only reinforce a primary cause of rising crime: the federal courts' 
disempowerment of local police. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government can't do anything right, and that includes stopping 
crime. That's why the Constitution left that matter to the states and 
localities. The GOP should bring back decentralism, and not use voters' anger 
about crime to build up the nation-state. 
</P>
<P>
 * Omissions -- The "contract's" rhetoric soars, but its content falls flat. It 
doesn't call for the elimination of a single program or agency. Republicans can 
thank Clinton's gun control and affirmative action for their margin of victory, 
but they haven't proposed doing anything about them. The GOP is even avoiding 
obvious reforms like repealing agricultural price supports and allowing private 
mail delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his ambitions, Gingrich only represents one district in Georgia. He 
doesn't speak for the new GOP radicals set to storm Washington in January. If 
they have their way, the only "contract with America" will be the enumerated 
powers of the U.S. Constitution.

PERSPECTIVE ON SCHOOL PRAYER; SPEAKER GINGRICH: LOOK AT VISTA; WHEN RELIGION IS 
IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT, IT BECOMES COERCIVE AND THUS ANATHEMA TO TRUE 
CONSERVATISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GOTLIEB, Michael Gotlieb is the rabbi of Temple Judea in Vista. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters here prematurely ended their school board's conservative Christian 
majority in the Nov. 8 election. Ironically, this San Diego County community, 
which voted along conservative lines on every ballot measure, rejected its 
school board's right-wing convictions. It ardently opposed the board's 
imposition of subjects that are the province of one's home or religious 
beliefs. As a result, four of the five elective seats changed hands, 
reconstituting the board as liberal and centrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's former conservative Christian majority represented a legitimate 
political perspective that has a national following. The members raised issues 
that express genuine concern for our nation and its youth; for that alone they 
deserve credit. But the school board's recall was not a reaction to either 
religious or political titles. It centered on a concern far more significant, 
one that reflects a broad consensus: The voters in Vista want religion out of 
the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the debate was not about sex, God and values; it was about 
reading, writing and arithmetic. Like so many, the residents here want the 
public schools to teach their children the necessary essentials, allowing them 
to integrate the knowledge they acquire elsewhere so that they can make mature, 
informed decisions. The people here want to find new ways to build the public 
schools back up, ensuring that they be safe and wholesome environments for 
education. But most important, perhaps, they want parents to have the freedom 
to decide what is best for them and their children when confronted with issues 
that involve personal beliefs and values.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people have said that the electorate opted for the recall because the 
targeted board members had misled the voters of their true intentions before 
being elected -- stealth candidates, as they have been called. But if the 
school board's policies and political directives had been in agreement with the 
public, the recall would not have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the political soul of Vista made it difficult for the school 
board to continue with its religiously oriented agenda. Conservatives, by 
definition, oppose government intervention. For them, the less control 
government has over our lives, the better. On Nov. 8, the voters made their 
preference known. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanting to teach creationism as an alternate approach to evolution is fine, 
but it does not belong in a public-school science classroom; neither does a 
sex-ed curriculum loaded with religious innuendo. The problem is, the pendulum 
swings in both directions, making the whole issue of public-school education 
even more complex. On the opposite coast, and on the other side of the 
political spectrum, the public schools in New York City are teaching their 
children that homosexuality is entirely normal and that a two-parent family is 
defined as having either a mother and father or two mothers or two fathers. The 
one thing we can learn from these two extremes is that imposing a value system, 
be it religious or secular, in the public schools is fraught with difficulties 
because it touches on so many sensitive areas of personal conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmund Burke, whose writings influenced 19th-Century conservative political 
theory, held that "religion is the basis of civil society." He was right -- to 
a point. To ensure society's civility, religion must flourish, but it must 
remain separate from government. Religion -- the expression of faith -- is a 
private matter. No matter how lofty the religion, when it mixes with 
government, it becomes coercive. House Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich 
recently promised "dramatic bold changes" with the newly formed Republican 
Congress. One of those changes includes restoration of prayers in the public 
schools. Gingrich ought to take note of the election outcome in Vista, for what 
happened here is a paradigm for the rest of the nation when exclusively 
religious values are introduced into the public schools.

ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR EMPLOYER INSPECTIONS COULD SOLVE THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

 Back to reality. In this case, the ratty office of the state labor 
commissioner in Downtown Los Angeles, where a broken computer sits forlornly on 
one corner of a scarred desk. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the valiant King Cheung, a truly dedicated civil servant, assembles his 
army of three, himself included, to enforce the labor codes for all 
manufacturing and agricultural enterprises in Los Angeles County. He's blessed. 
Orange County doesn't even have an inspection staff and is covered instead by 
the Labor Department's solitary representative in San Diego. For the entire 
state, on a good day, there are only 16 inspectors to enforce the labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 What this means is that the only program with any real promise of cutting down 
the incessant demand for cheap immigrant labor barely exists. Jobs are the 
magnet that pull people to this country, and if employers continue to get away 
with violating our labor standards, then the migrants will keep coming, no 
matter how many propositions the voters pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of California has long had the authority, constitutionally 
sanctioned, to ensure that everyone who works is covered by workers' 
compensation and paid the minimum wage as well as time and a half for overtime 
and that accurate records, including tax deductions and proof of legal right to 
work, are maintained. Additionally, working conditions must meet Cal-OSHA 
standards as well as local health and fire-safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforce all that, and you go a long way to answering the question of whether 
undocumented workers compete unfairly for jobs that others might take. But the 
Labor Department recognizes that even on a rare good day, when state agencies 
and the feds are fully cooperative, most labor activity in this state goes 
unregulated.  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was a good day, but a single building in Downtown Los Angeles 
absorbed much of the statewide effort. The target was the regal old May Co. 
department store on Broadway, now transformed into a rabbit warren of garment 
manufacturers, including some who cheat on the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage. The 
stately escalators are now still, workers are transported by freight elevators 
and the bathrooms are filthy, but thousands of dresses and sports outfits, many 
quite expensive and proudly bearing the label "Made in America" are produced 
here. But "Made in America" hardly translates into proud workers earning a 
living wage. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. garment industry now leads the nation and is the city's major 
manufacturing employer. But, as in agriculture, the state's most prosperous 
activity, working conditions are Third World. Inspectors found that some of the 
Chinese, Mexican and Vietnamese workers, paid on a piecework basis, were 
earning $2 and $3 an hour, worked 50-hour weeks without overtime and were not 
covered by workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 This rank exploitation is not restricted to labor in the inner cities. Later 
that day, a much smaller crew was inspecting sweatshops in a series of 
one-story buildings in Cerritos. From the outside, this looked like just 
another high-tech industrial park, complete with fountains. Inside, the dank 
working conditions were no different than in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in one crowded bunker, with bins of clothes clogging the aisles, 
workers were locked in, unable to flee in the event of a fire. In another, 
there were exposed electrical wires and the sewing machines were not grounded 
-- clear violation of county codes. But no one in authority in Los Angeles 
County, which voted for the dubious Proposition 187, seemed to care. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement of existing labor and occupational-safety laws is the best way to 
deal with illegal immigration, because it is constitutional, cost-effective and 
goes to the heart of the problem. But the limited resources that the governor 
has allocated to the Labor Department and other agencies render enforcement a 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get serious about the one approach to dealing with illegal immigration 
that works. The governor should put money into this program. He should also use 
his bully pulpit to demand that federal and county agencies get serious about 
enforcing the labor and occupational laws that fall under their jurisdiction. 
But he won't do this unless pushed by the voters, because it means solving the 
immigration mess by going after his supporters, the growers and manufacturers 
who shamefully exploit this cheap labor source.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, voters, you've had your fun venting rage while traumatizing 
schoolchildren. Now get serious and turn on the true culprits: employers out to 
make a fast buck off vulnerable undocumented labor and politicians -- beginning 
with the governor on down to county supervisors -- who only play at enforcing 
the law.

THE STATE; PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; CALIFORNIA'S LESSON: MALPRACTICE REFORM WON'T 
CUT HEALTH-CARE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. BAKER, Robert C. Baker, a lawyer who represents the health 
industry, is president of the American Board of Trial Advocates. This article 
is adapted from remarks he made to a House subcommittee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's medical-malpractice reforms, passed in 1975, have mostly aided 
insurance companies and physicians -- not the persons injured by medical 
negligence. In fact, most lawyers in California will simply not handle a 
medical-malpractice case. 
</P>
<P>
 The contingent fee allows those who can't pay a lawyer's hourly fees to take 
their cases to court. It provides a client the means to finance litigation with 
money essentially borrowed from the lawyer. If the lawyer loses, it is as if he 
or she made a bad loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers cannot earn a living by mak-ing bad loans, so they will only make 
loans when there is a good opportunity for a return. The sliding-scale 
limitation on the contingent fee, a provision of the California reform, further 
reduces these opportunities, since it has the effect of underestimating the 
amount of time needed for particular cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical-malpractice cases can take years to resolve and thousands of hours of 
attorney time. They are notoriously risky. Moreover, when the contingent-fee 
limitation is restricted to one area of tort law, such as medical malpractice, 
tort lawyers simply shift to more profitable areas of practice. This only makes 
it more difficult for medical-malpractice victims to obtain representation. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that attorneys who handle these cases concentrate only on those 
that have high economic damages associated with them -- cases involving "bad 
babies," wrongful-death of a breadwinner, demonstrable brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, entire categories of cases have been eliminated since malpractice 
reform was implemented in California. Victims in cases that have a value 
between $50,000 and $150,000 are basically without representation. For example, 
incidents of failure to diagnose an appendicitis still occur, but not many 
suits are filed in California. The reasons are simple: 
</P>
<P>
 * 80% of medical-malpractice cases that go to trial are won by the defendant 
medical practitioner; 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical-malpractice cases by their nature are expensive; 
</P>
<P>
 * Physicians in California, as in virtually all states, can withhold consent 
to settle and, therefore, control whether a case is settled or goes to trial; 
</P>
<P>
 * They are required to report malpractice settlements to the Medical Board of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 If, by settling, a physician is to be reported to the board, he or she has 
little to lose by proceeding to trial, where the chances of success are 80%. 
Professionally, they are in a no-worse position if they lose, than they would 
be by being reported to the board. Under such conditions, given the expense to 
the plaintiff and the plaintiff's attorney, cases in the $50,000-$150,000 range 
are rarely filed. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, of the medical-malpractice cases filed, a far greater 
number will go to trial than be settled. In California, a significantly higher 
percentage of medical-malpractice cases go to trial -- the costly alternative 
-- than any other type of case. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical-malpractice premiums, which were supposed to drop as a result of the 
reforms, have not diminished in California, according to physician groups. And 
there can be little doubt that, with damage caps on pain and suffering and 
limitations on attorneys' fees, there are fewer cases being filed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of case filings has diminished and dollar amounts of awards 
decreased, one can assume medical-malpractice reform is benefiting some entity, 
but it most certainly is not benefiting the average citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 With health-care costs in the United States running at $800 billion annually, 
and medical-malpractice insurance running at about $6 billion -- less than 1% 
of the total -- so-called medical malpractice reform is not the answer to 
reducing costs. It would be better to look at some of the real costs incurred 
in the delivery of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 One need not look beyond the most frequently performed surgery in the United 
States -- the implantation of intra-ocular lens. The 15-minute operation may be 
performed by a physician from six to 20 times a day, for which the charge may 
be $2,500, or higher, per operation. The same procedure in an 
outpatient-hospital setting will cost in excess of $7,500. The implanted 
intraocular lens may have about three to four cents of plastic in it -- and 
cost the hospital $100 to $200. As of the early 1990s, the United States 
government was paying more for the implantation of intraocular lenses than for 
the next four most frequently performed operations combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example of real costs is the proliferation of expensive CAT and MRI 
machines. In Santa Monica, where I practice, there are seven MRI machines, more 
than in the entire country of Canada. Because of their proliferation, these 
wonderful but expensive machines are underutilized. As a result, the cost of 
the diagnostic tests have gone up to cover the machine's cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Reducing health-care costs is not going to be achieved by some of the 
far-reaching medical malpractice-reform proposals now being considered by the 
Congress. What will occur is that victims of medical negligence will have a 
decreased opportunity for redress.*

DANA PARSONS: DOCTOR'S ORDERS: GREASE THE SKIDS TO MAKE CHOLESTEROL SLIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have to be very careful how I write this. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, I shouldn't have to be careful, but I do. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, if I were the captain of my own ship, the master of my own destiny, I 
wouldn't have to worry about how I said it. I could just come right out and say 
that I was thrilled to read the story last week about the success of 
cholesterol-lowering drugs. I could just come right out and say that it's great 
news, because my cholesterol count is -- -- 
</P>
<P>
 That's where things screech to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 I told a colleague I wanted to do a cholesterol column but that my mother is 
in town this week. "No way can I let her read what my cholesterol count is," I 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're 45 years old and you're still afraid of your mother?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why so incredulous? Isn't everyone afraid of their mother? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I'm not really afraid of her. She's gentle and kind and normally 
takes things in stride. I tell her lots of stuff. But if I told her that my 
cholesterol was hmrlf , who knows what she'd do? 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, I've had to dance around the issue with her. That's too bad, 
because my personal battle with cholesterol the last few years could give hope 
to all the cheeseburger-and-fries lovers out there. 
</P>
<P>
 I had never been checked until about two or three years ago. At the time, my 
level was hmrlf and the doctor immediately assigned me to a follow-up class on 
arteriosclerosis, the heart-disease affliction that can result from high 
cholesterol. The nutritionist gave me a list of foods that would help lower the 
cholesterol, but since most were in the vegetable family I had never heard of 
many of them and didn't know they could be purchased in any supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor also put me on a strict no-meat diet for two months, which led to 
the publication of my first book, "1001 Ways to Disguise Tuna." 
</P>
<P>
 The regimen worked, though. After two months, my cholesterol had dropped 
20-some points to hmrlf and I thought the worst was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, I lapsed in the Eternal Vigilance department. I went a couple 
years without being retested until doing so this summer. Not only had I 
backslid, but the new figure had surpassed the original total from two years 
ago and now registered a staggering hmrlf . 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, I was aghast. It was bad enough being at hmrlf , but to find 
out that it had risen to hmrlf was jolting. The first words out of my doctor's 
mouth was that he wanted to put me on cholesterol-lowering medicine. Determined 
not to become pharmaceutically dependent at such a tender age, I talked him out 
of it and said I would re-up on a diet and exercise program to see if I could 
lower the figure on my own. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave me three months to see what I could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the good news for you high-cholesterol types: You may be able to lower 
your cholesterol without becoming a vegetarian or a marathoner. 
</P>
<P>
 As I had before, I brought my number down significantly, this time to hmrlf . 
Well, let's just say I lowered it 42 points, and my doctor was impressed. The 
bad cholesterol dropped, and the good held steady. 
</P>
<P>
 I did it mostly, I think, by eliminating milk and ice cream, having oatmeal 
for breakfast and eating meat less often. I didn't give up on cheeseburgers 
but, instead, have one about as often as I do lobster. I hardly ever have a 
steak. French fries are now a delicacy item to be saved for special occasions 
with a fine wine, rather than serving as a dietary staple. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only other dietary change I made was to eat fewer desserts. On the 
exercise front, I went from zero to "a little bit" and realize that if I got 
serious about it I could make more of a dent in the number. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important thing is that I bought more time with the doctor. He agreed 
that I didn't need to start the medicine, as long as my count keeps dropping. 
The next checkup will be in about two months. I've set a personal goal of hmrlf 
by then, which I'm sure I can reach if I can just eliminate having a doughnut 
for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 The cherry on top was the report last week that cholesterol-lowering drugs 
have a significant impact on lessening the dangers to heart-disease sufferers. 
At this point, I'm thinking of the drugs only as a last-ditch effort, but it's 
encouraging to know they work so well. 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, I'm happy knowing my cholesterol is moving in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 As for when I'll be brave enough to openly discuss my health with Mom . . . 
well, that will require more time with an entirely different kind of doctor.

A BEAUTY BY THE BAY; SCIENCE: 17 MILLION VISITORS HAVE MADE THE MONTEREY BAY 
AQUARIUM THE NATION'S MOST POPULAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATALINA ORTIZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelp rises more than 20 feet from the sandy bottom, waving gracefully with the 
pulse of the sea. Sardines are merely a gray smudge in the water -- until they 
turn and the dim light transforms them into a shimmering silver cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea otters play and snooze on the rocks nearby, as stilts look for worms in 
the damp sand between the reeds and the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Such realistic displays have made the Monterey Bay Aquarium a model since its 
opening a decade ago, and the 17.5 million visitors it has attracted thus far 
make it the most popular aquarium in the nation, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is certainly the finest aquarium in the country, without question," said 
Raymond Chavez, a film producer for the San Francisco-based Marine Mammal Fund. 
"They've really found a balance between education and entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium, about 100 miles south of San Francisco, at once teaches and 
enchants by taking visitors through the many worlds along and beneath the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 exhibits and galleries display about 500 different plant and 
animal species that inhabit the shore, wharves, deep reefs and sea floor. A 
huge new wing under construction will offer glimpses at the bay's outer waters 
and the deep sea beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even on weekdays, visitors crowd around the sea otter exhibit, oohing and 
ahhing over the young animals that were rescued and will be returned to the 
sea. They gingerly pet bat rays that glide through a shallow sandy pool or try 
to catch giant octopuses changing color. 
</P>
<P>
 They wonder at the three-story-high kelp forest -- the world's tallest 
aquarium exhibit -- then stroll along an aviary that reproduces a sandy beach. 
Then, they can watch live television programs broadcast from a research 
submarine exploring the depths of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it. I just like to see all the big fish," 9-year-old Russell Hall of 
Piedmont, Calif., said as he admired foot-long steelhead trout in an 
indoor-outdoor exhibit that reproduces a coastal stream. "I like the trout 
best," he said. "And I like the rays -- they feel slippery." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors come from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it dawned on us even the day it opened that it would be so 
successful," said Steve Webster, a marine biologist who heads the aquarium's 
education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing sprang from an idea Webster and three colleagues had in 1977. 
The four marine biologists, who were conducting research in Monterey at 
Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Center, realized that a closed-down 
sardine-packing factory on nearby Cannery Row was a good place for an aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the scientists was Nancy Burnett, daughter of Silicon Valley pioneer 
and philanthropist David Packard. And Packard had just happened to ask his 
family to find a worthy project they could make their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard and his wife, Lucille, formed a foundation that paid $55 million to 
build the aquarium, intended to foster public interest in investigating and 
protecting the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $13 million went into the creation of the aquarium's sister 
institution, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now 82, Packard has helped develop exhibits and is still president of the 
aquarium's board. Another daughter, Julie Packard -- also a marine biologist -- 
is the aquarium's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Bay was an ideal place for such an ambitious project. The region 
already was a magnet for tourists, and nutrients welling up from the cold 
depths of a huge offshore canyon give the region an amazing variety of marine 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The bay's relatively clean waters also offered an unusual opportunity. The 
museum pumps up to 3 million gallons of seawater a day through its exhibits, 
including the kelp forest in its 335,000-gallon tank. The unfiltered water 
carries the spores of algae and larvae of invertebrates, completing the 
virtually natural environments in the displays. 
</P>
<P>
 As impressive as the exhibits are, Webster and other aquarium officials are 
proudest of its educational accomplishments -- fostering knowledge and love of 
the bay and the ocean beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-thousand school children visit the aquarium at no charge each year. 
The aquarium also hits the road with programs reaching another 20,000 
youngsters a year. And 1,500 teachers annually take part in programs to improve 
their knowledge of science and environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "As there are more and more people . . . it puts coastal parts of the ocean in 
greater and greater jeopardy and more and more stress," Webster said. "So I 
think the importance of educating people and keeping them aware of the coastal 
ocean is an ongoing problem. It's not going to diminish."

NUCLEAR BOMB MAKERS TURN FOCUS TO COUNTERING PROLIFERATION, LEGACY; WEAPONS: 
AMERICAN WIZARDS OF A GENERATION'S NIGHTMARE NOW WORK TO KEEP THEIR HANDIWORK 
FROM BECOMING ALL TOO COMMONPLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD M. ROTHBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As bomb maker James Mercer-Smith sees it, his contribution to world peace was 
designing weapons so terrifying no one would dare use them. "I view myself as 
the witch in all of Grimm's fairy tales. My job is to scare little children," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his colleagues succeeded admirably. Deterrence worked. But the price 
was leftover arsenals of thousands of nuclear weapons and a lineup of nations 
like North Korea, Iraq and Iran bent on developing their own. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the scientists and engineers who built the bombs are shifting their 
focus to the task of the '90s and beyond: counter proliferation. American 
wizards of a generation's nightmare now work to keep their handiwork from 
becoming all too commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most dramatic example of the drive to halt the spread of nuclear 
weapons is the cooperation between U.S. and Russian scientists who spent a 
generation competing to develop weapons of greater force and efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 As one Russian scientist told Ron Auguston of Los Alamos: "Our two labs caused 
this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, old habits of secrecy limit the cooperation between the former 
nuclear rivals. And there are frightening signs that Russia is losing control 
of some of its vast store of plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has a sense proliferation has not slowed down in the absence of 
superpower confrontation," said Roger Hagengruber, head of defense programs at 
Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque. "In fact, it may have speeded up." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lot of things people would like to uninvent if they could," said 
weapons designer Rod Schultz. "The only problem is, some think you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Coping with the legacy of the nuclear age is a challenge every bit as daunting 
as the one that faced the handful of scientists who moved to this remote New 
Mexican community in 1943 and developed the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki and forever changed the way the world thought about war. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the two bombs dropped on Japan in August, 1945, had the explosive 
force of 20,000 tons of TNT. Compare that to World War II's conventional bombs, 
few of which contained more than 500 pounds of explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Agnew, who later ran the Los Alamos laboratories for many years, tells 
the story of giving tours of Tinian Island to VIPs eager to see the place from 
which the planes took off carrying the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much to see -- models of "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" and the 
machinery used to load them. Little else. 
</P>
<P>
 One display was the wooden box that carried the plutonium pit -- a 
grapefruit-size metal-clad ball that is key to creating a nuclear explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a minute, sonny," interrupted a visiting admiral. "Are you trying to 
tell me that you carried in that box right there something that was the 
equivalent of 20 thousand tons of TNT?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir, that's right," said Agnew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young man, you may believe that, but I don't have to." With that the admiral 
and his entourage marched out. 
</P>
<P>
 That story illustrates one of the horrors of the nuclear age. Plutonium pits 
are as transportable as bowling balls. They don't glow; they're not hot; they 
don't give off instantly lethal doses of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the right hands or the wrong, they are the heart of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen pounds of plutonium in the hands of a terrorist with the know-how 
would be enough to produce a crude bomb, the equivalent of one or two thousand 
tons of TNT. Enough to topple the twin towers of the World Trade Center if set 
off in its parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manhattan Project produced only two bombs -- and both were used. After the 
explosion that destroyed Nagasaki, the U.S. atomic arsenal was empty. If Japan 
had refused to surrender and a third bomb was needed, scientists at Los Alamos 
would have had to scramble to build it. 
</P>
<P>
 The third bomb was never needed. Untold numbers of bombs were tested by the 
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China. But none was used 
in all the world's wars since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The arsenals grew by multiples of thousands, and not until the end of the Cold 
War were serious steps taken to reduce them. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost daily specially designed trucks deliver nuclear weapons to a sprawling 
industrial complex on the outskirts of Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Energy's Pantex plant is where nuclear weapons are put 
together and taken apart. The work is done in domed areas called Gravel 
Gerties, the name stemming from their unique feature: a roof covered with 17 
feet of sand and gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant officials say there is no danger, absolutely none, of a nuclear 
explosion during the process. But there is the possibility of a conventional 
explosion. Should that occur, the sand and gravel would collapse into the area 
to prevent the radioactive materials from escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 In this age of dismantlement, the Department of Energy hopes to take apart up 
to 2,000 nuclear weapons a year at Pantex. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is not explosions that worry people who live around Pantex. It's the 
pits. When a weapon is taken apart, the plutonium pit is removed and placed in 
temporary storage at Pantex. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary started out meaning about seven years. Now the talk is closer to 50. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever worries Pantex neighbors have about its plutonium storage are 
minor compared to those that scientists at Los Alamos and Sandia have about 
plutonium in Russia and elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 If security is tight enough, if no one sells one, pits are easy to keep track 
of. Plutonium dust and shavings are another issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagengruber said that even in a well-managed program the plutonium that is 
unaccounted for is in the range of a few percent -- "the material in the 
pipelines, the material in the ventilators, material in the filters." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a well-managed program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the former Soviet Union, he said there is "a handful of tons of 
material" unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, German police arrested three men when they arrived at Frankfurt 
from Russia with a little over a pound of weapons-grade plutonium in their 
luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 The other key element to building a bomb is knowledge and experience. There's 
plenty of both in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for us to imagine what's happening in the breakup of the Soviet 
Union," said Paul Robinson, who has worked at both Los Alamos and Sandia and 
from 1988 to 1990 was chief U.S. negotiator at nuclear test ban talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly Russian weapons scientists stopped getting regular paychecks and some 
took side jobs as truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start driving trucks you get mobile and I'm worried," he said. "I am 
worried that maybe the contacts (from countries seeking their talent) are 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
 To help stem that potential movement of talent, U.S. scientists are "trying 
hard to find ways to develop lab to lab contact," said Hagengruber, to help 
their Russian counterparts "find meaning for their lives and their profession 
in a world that is undergoing change." 
</P>
<P>
 How tight are international efforts to prevent countries from obtaining the 
materials and expertise they need to develop nuclear weapons? The labs train 
the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors who go to Iraq and other 
countries in search of evidence that a weapons development program is under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 They also play what Mercer-Smith calls the "Catch a Thief Game." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is simple, he explained: "How would an experienced weapons designer 
look at export controls as an amusing challenge and try to go around them?"

ART AT THE BORDER SPANS TWO NATIONS, TWO CULTURES; INSITE94: BINATIONAL DISPLAY 
REQUIRES PATRONS TO CRISSCROSS THE BORDER, VISITING SUCH FAR-FLUNG LOCALES AS 
BEACHES, PUBLIC PARKS, A TRAIN DEPOT, EVEN SOME ART GALLERIES. 
</P>

<P>
 On a gray, rainy Saturday, art lovers and the merely curious trudged to the 
beach by the United States-Mexico border to peer at three vessels patched 
together from junk metal sitting on the wet sand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the near distance, a steel fence separating the two countries cuts into the 
restless Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a ship without rudders. It conveys the idea of crossing but it's 
impossible at the same time," said Joe Conlon, who was visiting Baja California 
from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows the futility of the situation," said his friend, William Cordero, 
also from Chicago, looking first at the impotent vessels made of wire mesh, 
then at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair and their friends from San Diego stumbled upon inSITE94, a binational 
art exhibition under way here and in San Diego that requires patrons to 
crisscross the border, visiting such far-flung locales as beaches, public 
parks, a train depot and even some art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 It involves 38 art institutions on both sides of the border, more than 100 
artists, most from the United States and Mexico, displaying works at 37 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It invites you to travel a very interesting map of the region with cultural 
stops along the way," said Michael Krichman, president of Installation Gallery 
in San Diego, which coordinated the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers wanted to demonstrate the cohesiveness of the San Diego-Tijuana 
region by taking people to different locations, Krichman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition includes such varying works as icons of a woman giving birth 
lined up on the border wall in Tijuana's Colonia Libertad, and a giant table 
and chairs in San Diego's train station. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some works bear political themes, it is not the point of inSITE94, 
Krichman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a border show and it is not an exhibition about the U.S.-Mexico 
border," he said. "A number of pieces naturally engage the border in one way or 
another and a number of pieces are quite political. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best work is political but not overtly so. And clearly the best political 
work in the show is by artists from Mexico City who are working in Mexico with 
some knowledge of the situation but they see it from afar." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City artist Helen Escobedo, who created the rickety steel boats, fits 
that category. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very beautiful beach and it has a great hurt in it, a scar. The wall 
goes crashing to the sea," Escobedo said during a recent visit to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thinking about the sea, I thought about boats, crossings, impossible craft 
because they're made from steel mesh, they're transparent, they don't float, 
but they have hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Escobedo added a dash of humor by using catapults on the boats, or coconut 
slings, aimed to the north. The idea sprang from a phrase in Spanish, dar de 
cocoas, which means rapping children on the head with knuckles when they're 
naughty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll put coconuts in the slings because they aren't being nice to us," 
Escobedo said. "It's a very gentle bit of black humor in a rather hopeless 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 A few yards away, next to a whitewashed lighthouse, the border fence is made 
of chain link and a van is parked on either side with public address systems on 
their roofs. People can climb up to the microphones and say whatever they want 
to the people on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poet Robert Frost said, 'Good fences make good neighbors,' but bad fences 
don't make good neighbors," an unidentified man said in English from the 
Tijuana van. 
</P>
<P>
 " Viva Mexico, Viva Los Estados Unidos, " said Shirley Wright of San Diego, 
speaking from the Tijuana side. "Let's be friends forever." 
</P>
<P>
 On the American side, two U.S. Border Patrol agents and a ranger were 
stationed at the state park where the exhibit is located, but they appeared 
uninterested in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Escobedo: "If we don't all in some way hold hands, there won't be 
anyplace to go."

DISTANCE LEARNING MAY PAY DIVIDENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found your article "A New College Course" (Nov. 8) on expansion of college 
education through distance learning interesting and informative. It is true 
that distance learning is likely to become a factor in education at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike business and industry, education has not changed with the development 
of new tools and technologies. One reason for this may well be that education 
has been unchallenged by marketplace forces such as cost, competition and 
quality control. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these factors are present . . . to bring about radical change to the 
education establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Education may become a new source of revenue for technically sophisticated 
corporations who possess the capital and intellectual resources to challenge 
the monopoly the traditional public and private schools have enjoyed. Now we 
change or others will engage our clientele!

THE COST OF DISNEYLAND'S FREE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Walt Disney's "Pinocchio" the little boy-puppet started on his way to 
school one morning but was lured to a carnival along with hundreds of other 
children and turned into burros. We just had a real-life repeat of this classic 
when Disneyland held an all-day Halloween party on a public school day. 
</P>
<P>
 I had 30% absentees in my high school science classes in Santa Ana as kids in 
costume tried to make the 8:30 a.m. "get in free" deadline that morning. Not 
only did we lose a day of instruction from this disruption of our classes, but 
each school affected will lose the state "ADA" (average daily attendance) 
funds, about $17 for each absent student. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 50,000 attending Disneyland's "Halloween Megabash" were students, our 
schools lost some serious money to pay for an added day of Disneyland profit. 
The rascals who inherited Walt's magical kingdom should be held up to public 
censure and advised not to do this again. 
</P>
<P>
 GARY REYNOLDS

</P>
<P>
 * I am amazed at the number of people, including teachers and school 
superintendents, blaming Disneyland for the lack of school attendance during 
the recent free admission day on a Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are the ones ultimately responsible for the well-being of their kids. 
They are encouraging unacceptable behavior by allowing their kids to goof off 
and ditch school. If parents were teaching the proper values at home, they 
wouldn't succumb to stupid distractions that compete with the classroom for the 
attention of their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland has every right to promote business during the slow season. I'm 
sure there were legitimate users of the free day, including vacationers with 
kids in year-round schools on authorized breaks and home-schoolers who didn't 
have rigid Monday through Friday class schedules. Don't blame Disney for all 
the parents who obviously should but just can't say no.

HUNTINGTON BEACH SETS WELFARE EXAMPLE; CITY'S PROJECT SELF-SUFFICIENCY WOULD BE 
A WORTHY MODEL FOR WASHINGTON LAWMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For battle-weary government officials in Washington interested in going beyond 
the rhetoric to have a fresh look at what's actually possible, we suggest a 
look at what has been going on in the area of welfare reform in Huntington 
Beach. Last year in Washington, the debate over welfare became so polarized 
that it was almost impossible to find any common ground of reality from which 
reform could spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Republican tide nationally in the recent election, 
there is renewed interest on both sides of the aisle in approaching the area of 
entitlements anew. But there is still no shortage of platitudes and hot air on 
the national stage in the welfare debate. What the country clearly needs are 
models that have been tried and tested as examples of how to do it right, and 
that show how to incorporate the best ideas of partisans who may have very 
different philosophies of government. 
</P>
<P>
 A program called Project Self-Sufficiency has been in place for about a decade 
in Huntington Beach with the simple and laudable goal of helping ease single 
parents off welfare. The objective is to find them housing, education and 
employment, and to achieve the larger result of disengaging them from the 
welfare system.  
</P>
<P>
 The program's triumph seems to lie in its ability to incorporate something of 
all the best ideas that are out there: the participation of a compassionate 
government, the contributions of volunteers, the enlistment of donations and 
grants, and that intangible "family values" component of getting people to look 
out for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this what everybody on the national scene is talking about achieving -- 
breaking dependency and fostering self-reliance? Both sides in the polemical 
discussion of welfare have seized on the idea of individual responsibility. 
Here is a program that has results, not just talk. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its key components is the establishment of individual goals and the 
comprehensive one-on-one support it turns on. The staff works with participants 
to evaluate what they need in the way of housing, job training, education, 
child care, transportation and emergency services. And there is follow-up after 
written "action plans" are agreed to.  
</P>
<P>
 The program reports that of 280 families in the project since it began a 
decade ago, 210 no longer receive welfare subsidies. One participant says the 
program "is meant to help you get the life you want; it's not meant to be your 
life." What we ought to do is bottle this program for other places trying to 
get to the bottom of the welfare dilemma.

A DOWN PAYMENT ON CRIME REDUCTION; O.C. CITIES CAN'T AFFORD TO SNUB U.S. CRIME 
BILL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month's approval of $1.7 million in federal funds for Santa Ana and more 
than $400,000 for La Habra was welcome news. The money was part of the crime 
bill that narrowly passed Congress last summer, and will put more police on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 There were strings attached to the money. Cities must put up hefty matching 
funds, a requirement that caused some Orange County police chiefs to criticize 
"bureaucrats" in Washington for trying to influence local matters. Others 
wondered if the funds will be diverted from other crime-fighting programs, or 
will vanish before the three-year commitment promised in the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are valid concerns. However, Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton was 
right when he observed that law enforcement has been faced with shortages of 
cash like other city departments, and opportunities for outside funding "don't 
come along that frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, the county's biggest city and one of the poorer ones, bit the 
bullet and wisely applied for the funds. In return, the city will have to 
contribute more than $1.7 million of its own funds over three years. But the 
money will put another 15 police officers on the street, boosting the ranks of 
sworn police officers to 413. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra, too, must match the funds it receives, and will hire another five 
officers, putting the total at 73. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be little doubt that residents favor more police. Across the county, 
state and nation, crime has become a major issue in recent years. A Times poll 
last summer found that compared to two years ago, more Orange County residents 
ranked crime as the county's biggest problem. That was despite more than 80% of 
the county residents reporting that they felt secure in their own communities, 
and more than 90% feeling secure in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the increasing activity of gangs, the increasing violence in crimes, 
especially murders, and the increasing number of guns on the streets have 
people worried. It has become common for politicians to talk tough on crime, 
laud initiatives like "three strikes" and demand tougher prison sentences. With 
the crime bill, cities had a chance to match tough talk with their own dollars. 
Where City Councils choose not to apply for federal funds, residents should 
ask, why not? There may be good reasons, but city officials should spell them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, for various reasons, were nearly unanimous in opposing the crime 
bill last summer in Congress, where they now will hold power. That could mean 
some changes after the three years of federal funds for police expires. And 
that would mean that cities would have to make the tough choice of raising 
taxes or cutting spending elsewhere if they want to continue with beefed-up 
forces. But even if they choose not to keep the expanded forces, at least they 
will have gained three years of greater crime-fighting ability, no small 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill required communities wanting federal funds to hire police to 
tell the U.S. Justice Department how the new officers would be used in 
community policing projects. A number of Orange County cities have embraced 
community policing, getting officers out of the cars and into the neighborhoods 
to hear residents' concerns and enlist their help. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports are that community policing does reduce crime. But it is more 
expensive than having police patrol the streets in black-and-whites, waiting 
for a crime report and then responding. The federal funds will be an asset to 
cities willing to meet the challenge of coming up with funds of their own to 
try to allay residents' fears.

COAL CANYON BETTER OFF WITHOUT HUNTING; NAMING ECOLOGICAL RESERVE IS 
PRAISEWORTHY; ALLOWING SHOTGUNS, BOWS AND ARROWS ISN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Fish and Game Commission made an unfortunate choice in keeping the 
952 acres it owns in Coal Canyon open to hunters, a decision in stark contrast 
to its praiseworthy designation of the same property as an ecological reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is right off the Riverside Freeway, ignored by most people and 
accessible only through two gates, which are usually locked. Those entering on 
foot get the chance to escape urban clamor and envision Orange County as it 
used to be, covered more with trees, bushes and flowers than tile-roofed homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's designation of its Coal Canyon acreage as an ecological 
reserve this month was intended to protect the Tecate cypress forest, a rare 
phenomenon this far north, and other rare plant species. Such preservation is 
one of the worthwhile mandates of the state Fish and Game Department, which 
wisely purchased the canyon site in 1991 with funds from a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Another function of the Fish and Game Department is to preserve the interests 
of hunters, a valid objective. Coal Canyon and the adjacent Cleveland National 
Forest are the only two Orange County public properties where hunting is 
allowed, so it is understandable that the commission would be reluctant to pare 
the territory. But in this case it should have. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hunting has been allowed on the property under private ownership and 
even after the state bought it, few people knew that. Environmentalists 
complained with reason that listing it as an ecological reserve where hunting 
was permitted would bring it to the attention of more hunters, perhaps 
jeopardizing the plant life and increasing the potential for conflicts with 
hikers and nature study groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was wise to scrap hunting with rifles, which is allowed now, 
and to limit weapons to bows and arrows and shotguns, which have less range. 
That decreases the chance of harm to others.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; SUGGESTIONS FROM THE DEMOCRATS; REPUBLICANS GET A CHANCE 
TO PROVE THAT IT'S BEEN THE DEMOCRATS' FAULT; IT'S TIME TO DEAL WITH THE 
ISSUES, COMBINING PRAGMATISM WITH THOUGHTFULNESS.

 When Bill Clinton's election victory ended 12 years of Republican control of 
the White House in 1992, The Times ran columns from Orange County Republicans 
offering advice to the new President. Turnabout is fair play. Now that 
Republicans have won a majority in Congress for the first time in 40 years, 
some Orange County Democrats offer their advice.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To all Republicans out there: Congratulations on your stunning Nov. 8 victory! 
Even though I am a Democrat, I truly harbor no ill feelings about the victory. 
In fact, I find it exciting. The opportunity that all my Republican friends 
have been dreaming about is now at hand. After all these years of a Democratic 
majority, the Republicans have a chance to prove that they can execute and not 
just conceptualize. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the electorate feels the country is heading the wrong way and, like 
Peter Finch in the movie "Network," they screamed out with their votes, "We're 
as mad as hell and we're not going to take this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 I sincerely believe you only have two years to prove yourselves. I hope you 
don't mess it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that the electorate -- all of us -- are Americans first, who love 
their country and want to see the United States rise to its fullest potential. 
Please don't polarize us anymore . . . we need consensus-building, not 
name-calling. We are so, so tired of the name-calling. (OK, Newt?) Please get 
rid of your personal vendettas and start setting the wheels in motion. Start 
dealing with issues and combine your pragmatism with thoughtfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 That may mean that you have to actually work with the President of the United 
States. He really does have some good ideas -- you should try listening to some 
of them. (Rehashing Whitewater probably won't get anybody anywhere, but it will 
most definitely waste time and a great many resources.) 
</P>
<P>
 You know, your victory really is a win-win for everybody. You have the chance 
to prove that it really has been the Democrats' fault. But if you waste the 
next two years, you almost ensure another Democratic majority for the next 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory is also a major win for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 10 years Orange County has been represented by an entirely 
Republican congressional delegation. The Democratic majority on Capitol Hill 
has found this delegation a little difficult to reckon with on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a lobbyist for the County of Orange explained the difficulty of being 
a representative from Republican Orange County and getting the proper attention 
in a Democratic-controlled House. The lobbyist reported that once a 
congressional staffer all but slammed the door in his face. "After all," they 
reasoned, "why should we go out of our way to help you when your congressional 
delegation goes out of its way to obstruct so much of what we are trying to 
do?" That should all change now, and Orange County should definitely reap many 
benefits from that change. 
</P>
<P>
 So, ladies and gentlemen, please stop bashing us, and stop calling our 
President and First Lady names. This will help us work with you and lead us to 
the belief that you really are sincere. Let's work together in making the

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; SUGGESTIONS FROM THE DEMOCRATS; BIPARTISAN CONGRESS 
SHOULD TACKLE AGGRESSIVE AGENDA; A LACK OF ACTION WILL ONLY PROLONG GRIDLOCK 
AND INVITE FURTHER PUBLIC OUTRAGE.

Orange County in Congress, served in the House from 1975 to 1985. He now

 When Bill Clinton's election victory ended 12 years of Republican control of 
the White House in 1992, The Times ran columns from Orange County Republicans 
offering advice to the new President. Turnabout is fair play. Now that 
Republicans have won a majority in Congress for the first time in 40 years, 
some Orange County Democrats offer their advice.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Congress must learn how to do what the architects of this great American 
Democracy intended: to act as the agents of the American people, to find common 
ground and reach collective decisions for the development of a strong and free 
nation. This election gave the Republicans a great victory. The mandate given 
by the majority of Americans is really to both parties: We want lower taxes, 
less government and more individual or local government control over our daily 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is up to the new Congress to decide upon the terms of how best to 
achieve that mandate. With the Republicans in power, the Democrats should turn 
over the levers of power in the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of Congress from Orange County for 10 years, I now view the 
Congress as a private citizen. We want things to work. Congress must work as a 
bipartisan institution or it simply won't work. The Democrats must yield 
control of what will be on the legislative agenda to the Republicans. Hopefully 
the Congress will adequately address all 10 of the points in the Republicans' 
"Contract With America" as rapidly as possible. The Republicans must allow for 
reasonable differences to be expressed and resolved through amendments and then 
vote! 
</P>
<P>
 Attitude is everything and the leadership in both parties need some attitude 
adjustments. Republicans have been the critics and now they must take 
responsibility. Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who seems destined to be the next 
Speaker, must change his attitude that he will "cooperate but not compromise" 
or his legislative programs will be doomed to failure and his speakership to 
one term. 
</P>
<P>
 As most everyone knows, compromise is the essence of democracy and no 
legislation is passed until a majority of both houses and the President give 
some form of concurrence. If the word compromise is too difficult to accept, 
then call it consensus building. In any event, a lack of action only prolongs 
the gridlock of a "do-nothing Congress" and invites further public outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats like Rep. Henry Waxman have said the Democrats will have to 
fight back with the same "obstructionist warfare" that the Republicans have 
used. This attitude is dangerous, if not fatal, to the Democrats as well as 
unacceptable to the American people. Apparently these Democrats are in shock 
from the election, or they simply still don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some very positive aspects to the change in leadership. There is 
talk of reorganizing some of the congressional committees, a task that I 
chaired with limited success in 1979-80. A fresh look at the way Congress works 
is definitely needed. Would the sky fall if we had a balanced-budget amendment, 
a line-item veto and term limits? I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Democrats -- and hopefully enough Republicans will join 
them -- should resist any reductions in Medicare or Social Security. Also, they 
should oppose a repeal of the ban on the sale of assault weapons and increases 
in defense spending. Any tax cut must be accompanied by a specified equal 
expenditure cut, and Democrats should try to direct tax cuts to working 
middle-class people and particularly single-parent households. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Congress will have a very aggressive legislative agenda. Much of the 
agenda should be adopted and the Democrats will not be forgiven by the voters 
if they become the new critics and fight back with obstructionist warfare. The 
Republicans who become blindly partisan with an uncompromising agenda will risk 
both presidential veto and the wrath of the voters, whose political loyalties 
have undergone political swings of unprecedented proportions in the past few 
years. As columnist James Flanigan wrote, voters gave the Republicans "a 
two-year tryout, after which there will be a performance review."

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; SUGGESTIONS FROM THE DEMOCRATS; THE GOP MUST CHANGE ITS

 When Bill Clinton's election victory ended 12 years of Republican control of 
the White House in 1992, The Times ran columns from Orange County Republicans 
offering advice to the new President. Turnabout is fair play. Now that 
Republicans have won a majority in Congress for the first time in 40 years, 
some Orange County Democrats offer their advice.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Republicans willing to listen, here's some advice for the party now 
responsible for governing the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Republicans must quickly learn the difference between the politics of 
opposition and the politics of coalition-building. After decades as the 
minority party, Republicans naturally developed a legislative style which 
eschews compromise, emphasizes obstruction, and encourages rhetorical bombast. 
Indeed, they're far more adept at hurling rhetorical bombs than at building 
legislative bridges. Yet coalition-building, even within the new Republican 
majority, is essential to legislative accomplishment. It's a skill to be 
nurtured, not dismissed as signifying a lack of ideological commitment. 
Becoming the majority might turn out to be easier for many Republicans than 
behaving as the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Performance must take priority over pontification. Americans were promised 
action and results from the new Republican Congress, not heightened levels of 
ideological rancor. They rightfully expect no less. This is the unstated 
underpinning of the "Contract With America." However, floor votes alone on 
welfare reform, tax cuts, a line-item veto and congressional term limits will 
not satisfy public expectations for fulfillment of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans expect Republicans to vote on as well as for the promises made in 
the contract. Yet, in the first 100 days of the new Congress, voters may 
discover that Republicans are no more in agreement on the more contentious 
issues than were the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Concentrate on the issues most consequential to the majority of Americans. 
Americans want effective solutions to real problems, such as unemployment, 
business flight, crime, the deficit, access to health care, poverty, and a 
decline in educational achievement to name a few. If what they get instead is 
drawn out debate on social issues such as school prayer, abortion rights, 
family values, or private morality, the public will soon lose faith in 
Republicans as agents of substantive change. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Avoid the temptation to settle old political scores. No Republican in the 
House or Senate has ever served when Republicans controlled both chambers of 
Congress. Consequently, pay-back may be on the minds of many Republicans, long 
subjugated to careers spent as marginalized members of the minority. But 
Americans didn't elect Republicans to unleash witch hunts against Democrats, be 
they in Congress or the White House. The GOP leadership should hesitate to 
devote much time and energy revisiting old investigations or kindling new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Do not aggrandize the results of this election. Republicans won a historic 
victory, winning more House seats in a midterm election than either party since 
1938. However, Republican puffery aside, voter turnout was low at only 38% of 
the eligible electorate; many Republican victories were close, with the winner 
receiving less than 50% of the vote; and, according to a CNN/Time poll 
conducted after the election, only 12% of the voters attribute the sea of 
change in Congress to support for Republican programs. These electoral findings 
do not validate GOP claims that their victory constitutes a sweeping mandate 
for conservative policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, after 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, Republicans are 
entitled to a period of gloating, boasting, and rhetorical posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats should neither resent this celebration, nor take offense from it. 
Once the 104th Congress convenes in January, Republicans will face the 
challenge of reinvigorating and restoring legitimacy to an institution they've 
spent decades denigrating. An awesome responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 If they succeed, representative democracy will be healthier. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they fail, an impatient public may well send Republicans back into the 
wilderness.

MWD SHOULD REVISE TUNNEL ENTRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metropolitan Water District project manager Adam Kear is quoted in a recent 
Times article ("It's More Than a Pipe Dream," Nov. 10) as saying that 
residents' concerns are understandable and that he is ". . . counting on canyon 
folks to help us come up with solutions" regarding MWD's proposed massive water 
tunnel under our homes. 
</P>
<P>
 While this project will certainly benefit developers and provide job security 
for MWD employees and their consultants, many of us canyonites are experiencing 
a queasy, sinking feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 15, Mr. Kear received numerous individually written letters from 
canyon residents, a letter signed by all the officers of Silverado Elementary 
School's Parent Faculty Committee and petitions signed by more than 400 people 
indicating their opposition to this project as presently envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The parts of this project to which most of us object are MWD's suggested 
tunnel entrance site within the Silverado-Modjeska area, and putting an 
estimated 70 truckloads of debris per day on Santiago Canyon Road for the 
project's 24-hour-a-day four-year duration. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago Canyon Road is an already overused two-lane road that is the lifeline 
to our community, The trucks' dust, noise and engine emissions will inhibit 
learning and jeopardize the health of our children in Silverado Elementary, as 
well as the safety of the 20,000 commuters who use this road to avoid crowded 
freeways. There are other, much less disruptive places to locate the tunnel 
entrance and haul and dump the debris. Tons of gravel trucks already make runs 
to a nearby gravel pit. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter accompanying the petitions was an offer to send an elected 
five-person delegation to help MWD come up with mitigation solutions. If MWD 
truly wants to work with us, that's a good way to begin.

OUT WITH DORNAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, it didn't take very long for Orange County's favorite loudmouth, "B1" 
Bob Dornan, to show his true hypocritical stripes once again. 
</P>
<P>
 It took less than three days for "B1" Bob, one of the "term limits heroes," to 
break his promise to his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 After his ninth term, "B1" Bob was supposed to gracefully retire from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he says if his bid for the presidency in 1996 fails (and all sane people 
hope it will fail miserably) he might go for a 10th term. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this time "B1" Bob should lead by example and step down and leave us 
in peace.

GOLFER MET BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was in your area the week of Nov. 1 attending the Institute of Real Estate 
Management conference. I booked a tee time at the Anaheim Hills Golf Course for 
Wednesday, Nov. 2 at 9:30 a.m. for nine holes of golf.I thought everything was 
in order. I was mistaken. I had to deal with a discouraging humiliation known 
as prejudiced treatment toward women. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as I arrived at the golf course (I) became painfully aware that women 
were not welcome to use the course with the men during the morning hours. My 
treatment and the stall tactics they utilized at the check-in desk left a taste 
that I will not soon forget and will relay to my associates in the field of 
real estate throughout the country. I was intentionally delayed from my 
scheduled tee time and was eventually turned away from playing the course 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 I never thought that this progressive area of the country known as Orange 
County is still in the dark ages of discrimination.

HEALTH PLAN ROBS POOR OF DIGNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, it has come to my attention that Orange County residents who are on 
both Medicare and Medi-Cal will have their Medi-Cal portion moved into a county 
program called Optima and will be assigned to an HMO or consortium, apparently 
without any say as to where they will be assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, I could be forced to leave the family doctor whom I have been 
seeing for 25-30 years and whom I can reach easily by bus and go to another 
doctor, perhaps one who is harder for me to reach. I do not like government 
interfering with my patient-doctor relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 I get my prescriptions at a pharmacy within walking distance of my residence. 
Under Optima, I could be assigned to a more distant pharmacy. With all the 
problems I have had in my lifetime, I do not need government making my life 
more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the matter of self-determination. Poor people have many choices 
removed from their lives. They cannot take a trip to Grand Canyon or Wild 
Animal Park or go see a ballet or a circus or a special museum exhibit or do 
any of a number of things; the cost is too high. It is difficult to replace 
worn-out clothes and household linens -- never mind thinking about a VCR or a 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, the poor cannot even choose where to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Medicare and Medi-Cal, health care has been one area in which the poor 
person has been able to exercise self-determination. For government to tell 
people they have to go into HMOs and for corporate executives to ration health 
care is removing yet one more of the few opportunities for self-determination 
that are left to the poor person. Every opportunity for choice that is removed 
is a blow to the individual's human dignity. Those of our seniors who worked 
hard, "paid their dues" and ended up poor because of hard luck deserve better 
than to have their human dignity chipped away.

PROTECTING CANYON

<TEXT>
<P>
 As both a hunter and a conservationist, I read with interest your Orange 
County Perspective, "A Calm Space Faces the Shotgun" (Oct. 14).By designating 
Coal Canyon an ecological reserve the state Fish and Game Commission is not 
telling hunters to "come and get it." Use of this area does not create rivalry. 
Hunters, hikers and nature study groups coexist in many areas. Coal Canyon is 
an example of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Designating the area as an ecological reserve would only ensure protection 
from a more ominous threat, urban development.

TREE LOSS TRAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cutting down of 2,500 trees at a Mission Viejo development is a tragic 
loss that brings to mind several questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the developer required, as part of his plan, to plant trees? Did the 
county approve planting eucalyptus trees rather than a more sensible species? 
Will the developer be required to replace the trees? 
</P>
<P>
 Why were they not topped before they rose to such heights? 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there not a law in Orange County, as there is elsewhere in California, 
requiring a permit to cut trees down because they are a beneficial and precious 
environmentally contributive resource?

OREGON GOING TO PASADENA; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: O'NEIL RALLIES TEAM TO 17-13 
VICTORY FOR DUCKS' FIRST ROSE BOWL BERTH SINCE 1958. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a simple screen pass from Danny O'Neil, like so many others that Oregon 
tailback Dino Philyaw had caught before, yet it was unlike any other Philyaw 
would ever grab out of the air. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a pass Philyaw never will forget, because it was the one that launched 
the Ducks to a 17-13 comeback victory over archrival Oregon State on Saturday 
and gave them their first outright Pacific 10 championship and a Rose Bowl 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw everybody make their blocks," Philyaw said, "and it was like the Red 
Sea parting." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to key blocks by tight end Josh Wilcox and linemen Mark Gregg and Eric 
Reid, a path opened for Philyaw to run 19 yards untouched. Buoyed by the 
resilience of their offense, the Ducks' "Gang Green" defense lived up to its 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 After holding the Beavers to 221 yards rushing, 60 yards below their average, 
the Oregon defense pressured Beaver quarterback Don Shanklin into throwing 
three incomplete passes from the 21-yard line as the clock ticked down the 
final seconds. That last, fervent stand touched off a mad celebration for the 
Duck fans among the 37,010 jammed into Parker Stadium, sending them rushing 
onto the field to bring down the goal posts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, I was kind of praying to the Lord upstairs at that point," Philyaw 
said. "I knew we were going to get there, but I knew the game was going to be 
dramatic. It was a little too dramatic for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It was among the most dramatic games they've played since the teams' first 
"Civil War" in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon fans, anticipating their team's first New Year's trip to Pasadena since 
1958, roared their approval at each announcement that USC was trailing UCLA in 
Pasadena because they knew the Ducks would still go to the Rose Bowl as long as 
USC lost. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Shanklin sneaked in from the one-yard line to give Oregon State a 
13-10 lead with 6:01 left in the third quarter -- and USC pulled closer to UCLA 
-- they began to fear another Duck failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, this time. O'Neil rallied the Ducks (9-3, 7-1 in the Pac-10) for 
the third time in five games, capped by a five-play, 70-yard drive that ended 
with Philyaw's catch and run with 3:43 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oregon teams aren't supposed to go to the Rose Bowl. No one expected this, 
and that's why this team had to come together," said O'Neil, who previously 
engineered comebacks over Washington and Arizona in leading Oregon to its first 
six-game winning streak since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the fourth quarter today, we showed what this team is made of. I told 
everyone (the Beavers) would come to play, and they played hard defensively. 
But we stepped up and did it." 
</P>
<P>
 They did it because Cristin McLemore, who was taken to Oregon State's student 
health services building in the third quarter for X-rays of his bruised left 
hand, insisted on coming back for the fourth quarter despite a painfully 
bruised and swollen hand. 
</P>
<P>
 On his first play back, an incomplete pass, "I landed right on my butt," he 
said. But on the next series, he caught passes of 31 yards, four yards and 21 
yards as the Ducks marched up field for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at their head trainer and said, 'I don't hate you guys too much. 
Thanks for helping me,' because they were hustling to get me back in there," 
said McLemore, who caught four passes for 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving through campus (to the medical facility), wearing an Oregon uniform, 
I was hearing people yell at me. I almost fell off the cart a few times. They 
were yelling at me and cussing and it got me angry. I played with a little bit 
of anger when I went back in." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates shared that anger, having watched several pregame shows that 
picked the Beavers (4-7, 2-6) to pull off an upset Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a while, those predictions seemed justified. Although Oregon scored 
first, on an 18-yard pass to Philyaw in the first quarter, Oregon State's 
staunch defense kept O'Neil from staging the kinds of aerial shows he put on 
last week against Stanford (339 passing yards and six touchdowns) and the 
previous week, when he passed for 234 yards against Arizona in three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ups and downs and the momentum swings were really frustrating," said 
Beaver halfback Cameron Reynolds. "When we needed to move the ball, we showed 
we could. . . . There was no point where either side said, 'We've got this game 
wrapped up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State's Chris Cross recovered a blocked punt for its first score, with 
12:29 to play in the second quarter, but Randy Lund missed the extra point. 
Matt Belden missed a 47-yard field-goal attempt for Oregon but later made a 
34-yarder to give Oregon a 10-6 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers went ahead on an eight-play, 65-yard drive, sparked by 
short-yardage runs from J.J. Young and fullback J.D. Stewart. That's when 
O'Neil, McLemore and Philyaw took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was going to be a great game with key plays that would win it, and 
Oregon made those plays," Oregon State Coach Jerry Pettibone said. "I was proud 
of the way we tried to come back and compete at the end. If we would have 
competed that pass (from Shanklin to Joe Douglass) at the end, it would have 
been a storybook ending, but credit goes to Oregon. . . . I know they'll be a 
class representative at the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Ducks celebrated, still clutching roses given them by Coach Rich Brooks 
when he was officially invited to Pasadena by a member of the Rose Bowl 
committee, they were still getting used to the idea of being Pac-10 champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dream come true," said O'Neil, who was 11 for 25 for 173 yards. "Doing 
this as a comeback, and against Oregon State, makes it so great."

ALABAMA SURVIVES CLOSE CALL, 21-14; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CRUCIAL FIRST-DOWN 
MEASUREMENT FAVORS THE CRIMSON TIDE IN THE WANING MOMENTS OF A VICTORY OVER 
AUBURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alabama free safety Willie Gaston held his black-gloved hand up and nearly 
pinched all the air between his thumb and forefinger. There was just enough 
room for a piece of paper, a thin slice of ham or, as it turned out Saturday at 
Legion Field, a tiny portion of chain link. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say about a centimeter," said Gaston, the first to arrive at the scene of 
the most crucial first-down measurement of Alabama's 21-14 victory over Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 With no timeouts remaining, the ball on the Alabama 42-yard line, the Tigers 
faced with fourth and three as 38 seconds remained on the clock, Auburn 
quarterback Patrick Nix found wide receiver Frank Sanders open across the 
middle. Nix passed, Sanders caught and strong safety Sam Shade hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shade's 191 pounds met Sanders' 200 and down they went. The officials rushed 
in, spotted the ball and then summoned the chain crew. No way were they going 
to make this call by themselves, not with a sellout crowd of 83,091 looking on. 
</P>
<P>
 Out came the crew. A first down gives the No. 6-ranked Tigers the ball at the 
Crimson Tide 39 and 31 seconds to score, convert a two-point conversion and end 
third-ranked Alabama's undefeated season and hopes for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really believed," said Nix, "that we were going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston stood near the ball and complained. "I didn't like the spot the 
officials made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shade was busy trying to ignore the pain in his neck after making the hit 
against Sanders. But he saw the marker and he watched as the officials 
stretched the chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got real nervous then," he said. "I'm thinking, 'Man, we got a bad spot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nix was so sure of the first down that he motioned the Tiger offense to the 
line of scrimmage. That's when the official turned toward the Auburn end zone 
and pointed Alabama's way. End of a desperation drive that began on the Tigers' 
one-yard line. End of Auburn's 21-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I didn't see what he saw," Nix said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Crimson Tide had rolled on, but not before its customary 
Perils-of-Pauline finish. This time Alabama (11-0) nearly blew a 21-point 
first-half lead and with it, the Crimson Tide's national title run. 
</P>
<P>
 If Alabama Coach Gene Stallings were smart -- and there were moments Saturday 
that you wondered -- he would hand letter jackets to the two chain gang members 
who pulled the links taut. 
</P>
<P>
 How close was it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Close," said Stallings, staring straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Stallings who decided to go for a first down rather than a field goal 
on a fourth and one at the Auburn 16 with 12:39 to play and Alabama leading, 
21-7. Quarterback Jay Barker got the yard, but four plays later he threw an 
interception in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker, always the good soldier, later defended the call. Stallings, though, 
wasn't so sure, especially after Auburn cut the lead to seven points with 2:23 
remaining. He didn't have only one second thought, but "a bunch of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Woody McCorvey was even less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't comment on the call," he said. "Can't comment on no calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Now faced with his own big decision, Auburn Coach Terry Bowden instructed Matt 
Hawkins to try an onside kick. The ball took one bounce and popped into the 
arms of Alabama fullback Tarrant Lynch. The Crimson Tide went nowhere, but not 
before chewing up all three Tiger timeouts and 36 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, punter Bryne Diehl came on and promptly stuck his kick at the Auburn 
one-yard line. Nine plays later it was over. All thanks to Shade and a 
defensive scheme called "10 Middle," where the strong safety stays in the 
middle of the field as the rest of the Alabama players funnel everything 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Shade becomes part of Alabama-Auburn lore. 
</P>
<P>
 "That play right there, that's big," he said. "I'll never forget that play. I 
think the fans will never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the possible exception of, say, North Korea vs. South Korea, there isn't 
a more intense rivalry than the one between Alabama and Auburn. The annual game 
is the single-biggest event in a state where a recent newspaper poll revealed 
that 69% of the respondents were more interested in football than the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriages have ended and families split because of the rivalry. Kids have been 
ridiculed in school for their football allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that's the semi-sane stuff. Alabama fans also have been known to 
fire shotguns over the heads of Auburn supporters -- or so said the guy who 
wrote to the Atlanta Journal to complain about past treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more. Wrote an Alabama fan: "The thing I can't stand about Auburn fans 
is that they root for Auburn." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no more serious topic of conversation in this state than 
Auburn-Alabama. So intoxicating is its power that years ago, while watching an 
Auburn-Alabama game at home on the tube, a young Nix actually dived over his 
mother's sofa to try to block a Crimson Tide field-goal attempt. He missed. 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened Saturday, except this time it was Nix's passes that 
fell short . . . and long . . . and wide. The poor guy didn't pass for a first 
down until the second quarter. Alabama's defense had him so unnerved that his 
passes had that heave-and-hope look before first half's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Barker, now an amazing 34-1-1 as a starter, completed six of 13 
first-half passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns -- a 74-yarder to wide 
receiver Toderick Malone and a 49-yarder to wide receiver Marcell West. 
</P>
<P>
 In typical Barker fashion, he left the stadium with so-so numbers (eight of 17 
for 177 yards), but a big, big victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Sherman Williams also had a touchdown, a 13-yard run on which he 
broke a pair of tackles. He finished with 164 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama now moves on to the Southeastern Conference championship game at 
Atlanta on Dec. 3. A victory over the Florida Gators and it goes on to the 
Sugar Bowl. A victory there and. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think the schedule is definitely in our favor," Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the chain gang was. By about a centimeter.

CRIS CARTER CATCHES ON; PRO FOOTBALL: THIS YEAR, HE LEADS THE LEAGUE IN 
RECEPTIONS AND IS ON PACE TO BREAK STERLING SHARPE'S YEAR-OLD RECORD FOR 
CATCHES IN A SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cris Carter tells you he might join the seminary after football, and you don't 
know what to make of him. 
</P>
<P>
 He is serious, it seems, but it can be hard to tell with Carter sometimes. 
Like when he was in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was serious about football, but it was never very easy to be sure. 
There were times he seemed more interested in carousing until early Sunday 
morning than playing on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan didn't like it, and he let Carter know. Carter didn't like that, so 
the Eagles let him go. Minnesota spent $100 to grab Carter off waivers, and he 
has turned into one of the best bargains in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 In his eighth season, Carter leads the league with 77 catches and is on pace 
to break Sterling Sharpe's year-old record of 112. This year, there is no 
question that Carter is serious about football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just young, just enjoying it, living life day by day," Carter said of 
his rocky three years in Philadelphia. "I decided one day that I needed to do 
some things different." 
</P>
<P>
 That day was Sept. 4, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan called Carter to his office to tell him he would start the season as a 
backup. Cocky and quick-tempered, Carter wouldn't accept that, and the Eagles 
released an angry young man five days before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were ups and downs in Philadelphia, just like anything else," Carter 
said. "I had some success there, played at a young age, had some big plays, 
went to the playoffs. I was just never really happy." 
</P>
<P>
 And never really in control of his life, a carryover from the tumultuous end 
to his college career. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was an All-American his junior year at Ohio State, and most believed he 
would be a first- or second-round pick following his senior season. But he 
never got to play after admitting he took $6,800 from agents Norby Walters and 
Lloyd Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters and Bloom both received prison terms two years later for their 
involvement with athletes, including Carter. For his role, Carter pleaded 
guilty to mail fraud and obstruction of justice, and was handed a $15,000 fine 
and 600 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles took Carter in the 1987 supplemental draft. He played in nine games 
and had five catches as a rookie, but had 87 catches and 17 touchdowns over the 
next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He was on the verge of NFL stardom, but seemed more interested in his showy 
lifestyle. That changed the moment he walked out of Ryan's office that 
afternoon in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never really did anything outside the 20-yard line," Ryan said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter refuses to vent any bitterness about Ryan or his release from the 
Eagles. He just continues to prove Ryan wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he hasn't touched alcohol since -- he never had a drinking problem -- 
and gradually has developed deep religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to a point in your life when you just get tired of rippin' and 
runnin'," he said. "You just want to be happy, and I really wasn't happy until 
I found God, regardless of what I had done on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 He caught 27 passes his first season in Minnesota, and has led the team each 
of the past three years with 72, 53 and 86 catches from a steady rotation of 
mediocre quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally emerged as one of the league's premier receivers this year after 
Minnesota traded for Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had a guy who was going to get the ball to him a lot, he could put up 
some unbelievable numbers," said Vikings coach Dennis Green. "He's got a lot of 
years to play, and I think the timing is right for him and Warren to hook up at 
a stage where they both have a real good appreciation on what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Only slightly less volatile on the field than his days in Philadelphia, Carter 
has benefited from Moon's calm personality as much as his tight, accurate 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I ever get out of line, he's the guy who can get me back in line," Carter 
said. "He's one guy who I look up to. The other guys I respect, but he's the 
one guy I look up to, as a person and as a football player." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter needs to catch six passes a game for the rest of the regular season to 
break Sharpe's record. On his current pace, Carter would finish with 123 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Jets coach Pete Carroll said all Carter needed was a quarterback who 
would get him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you're seeing what he's got," Carroll said. "That's probably why he's 
been frustrated at times over the years, because he knew he had it. He's real 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter doesn't have the speed to beat defenders deep often, but he is fearless 
across the middle and has outstanding hands. At 6-foot-3 and 192 pounds, Carter 
also can use his 36-inch vertical leap to go over most defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's rare in that sense," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's stormy stint with Philadelphia may have cost him a chance to be 
recognized sooner alongside Sharpe, Jerry Rice, Michael Irvin and the NFL's 
other elite receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Paired with Moon, he is making up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think now people will also look at Cris in the same light as they view the 
other guys, because he is more acrobatic, will make more difficult catches, 
than all those other guys," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Carter finally has found his peace on the football field. He is getting the 
ball nearly as often as he wants -- "In his mind, he's always open," says Green 
-- and he has matured into a leader on the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions of life after football remain unanswered. For now, Carter says he is 
leaning toward the seminary and service as a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn more about the Bible, to study it in a situation where I 
won't have that many distractions," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also considering coaching or TV commentary. But there's plenty of time to 
decide which career he wants to take seriously.

'MY SHE-RO': WILMA RUDOLPH; TRACK AND FIELD: THE 20TH OF 22 CHILDREN, SHE 
SURVIVED CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES AND WENT ON TO BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE TO WIN 
THREE GOLD MEDALS AT ONE OLYMPICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KNISLEY, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anita DeFrantz was 8 years old when Wilma Rudolph sprinted to three gold 
medals at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The bond was automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was my she-ro, absolutely," says DeFrantz, who became an Olympic medalist 
herself (bronze in rowing) 16 years later in Montreal. "We knew her story. I 
grew up in the Midwest, and she was someone that I certainly admired. . . . 
There she was, with the whole world focused on her. And wasn't it wonderful. 
Here was someone who looked like me, and she'd done something that everybody 
celebrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph, the first American woman to win three gold medals in track and field 
at one Olympics, lost her battle with brain cancer last week in Nashville, 
Tenn. It was the end to a remarkable life. Rudolph was born in 1940 in 
Clarksville, Tenn., the 20th of 22 children, and survived childhood bouts with 
double pneumonia, scarlet fever and a mild form of polio. Until she was nine, 
Rudolph walked only with the help of an unwieldy brace on her left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time she enrolled at Tennessee State and joined Ed Temple's famed 
Tigerbelles track team, she was one of the fastest women in the world. She made 
the Olympic team that competed in Melbourne in 1956 and ran the third leg on 
the bronze-medal-winning U.S. 400-meter relay team. Then, four years later in 
Rome, she won the 100 meters in a wind-aided 11.0 seconds and the 200 meters in 
24.0 (after an opening-heat time of 23.2), and anchored the 400-meter relay 
team that set a world record of 44.4 seconds in the semifinals and won the gold 
medal in 44.5. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one of the greatest sprinters of all time," says Dr. LeRoy Walker, 
the president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. "I sometimes think what it would 
have been like -- and I say the same thing about Jesse Owens -- if they 
(competed) on the facilities we have today: the synthetic surfaces, the great 
starting blocks, the equipment, the shoes. What would it have been like if 
Wilma had been in those circumstances rather than on the cinder tracks? I 
wonder what her times would have been today." 
</P>
<P>
 When she left competition, Rudolph served as a goodwill ambassador for the 
United States to French West Africa in the early 1960s and founded the Wilma 
Rudolph Foundation, a non-profit organization devoted to teaching youngsters 
that they can overcome obstacles as she did. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 54 when cancer claimed her last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to (former Olympic long jumper) Ralph Boston last night, and we 
were shaking our heads as to why she'd decided she could smoke and beat the 
odds there," said DeFrantz, now one of two U.S. members on the International 
Olympic Committee. "We came to the conclusion it was because we all knew she 
was immortal. And maybe that's her legacy. She is immortal. We'll know about 
Wilma Rudolph forever."

MORNING BRIEFING: MCNALL LEGACY COULD BE FEWER COOKED BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems the situation of King President Bruce McNall, who will plead guilty 
to federal charges that he defrauded banks for more than $236 million, has 
become something of a cautionary tale. 
</P>
<P>
 At an NHL media briefing in Toronto, Glen Sather, Edmonton president and 
general manager, was asked whether the league was willing to make its books 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "You imply the league's numbers are not real, and that's the same story I get 
from my players," Sather said. "I had my player rep to my house and showed him 
the information on our team and he said, 'Wow, is that real?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Do you think I want to go to jail?' We already have one guy in this 
league who is going to jail, and I don't want to be the second one." 
</P>
<P>
 Add McNall: Sather's final comment was not included in the league's official 
transcript, although it was used by several reporters and a Canadian cable 
outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What two NFL quarterbacks played junior college football in Los 
Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 Telltale tattoo: The tattoo on Joe Smith's chest at first seems like nothing 
more than a collection of deep blue lines set against his skin. But a slight 
flex of his muscle condenses the lines, sharpening the image and bringing it 
forth: the face of a bulldog, half snarling, half smirking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted a tattoo," says Smith, center on the Maryland basketball 
team. "My friends got tattoos also. They told me to get a dog." Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they call me 'the Beast.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No problems: Roy Firestone asked Pat Haden if, when he played quarterback for 
the Rams, he'd had any arguments with Coach Chuck Knox over play calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only had three plays to question," Haden replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Right man for the job: Former Raider Howie Long, speaking on "Inside Pro 
Football," says quarterback Steve Walsh is the perfect fit for Coach Dave 
Wannstedt's Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave's philosophy is keep the game close, do not screw it up," Long said. 
"For him, it's not the quarterback who makes the big play that matters, it's 
the quarterback who doesn't make the bad play." 
</P>
<P>
 Picture perfect: After left wing Brendan Shanahan of the St. Louis Blues posed 
for a picture in GQ, teammates asked him what it was like. 
</P>
<P>
 "The photographer doesn't say, 'Give us your best side,' " Shanahan said. "He 
says, 'Give us your least-damaged side.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Takes one to know one: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, asked to name the best center in 
the NBA today, didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to go with Hakeem (Olajuwon)," he said. "He can do more things on 
the court. Shaquille (O'Neal) is certainly a force to be reckoned with and he's 
going to be around a long time, but I think Hakeem is clearly a better player." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Minnesota's Warren Moon played at West L.A. and the Bears' Erik 
Kramer played at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, analyzing the George 
Foreman-Michael Moorer fight: "George is a big truck, but if he runs over you, 
he'll kill you. He phoned (Moorer) from Chicago and said, 'I'm coming,' and the 
fool waited there for him." SHAV GLICK

COLLEGE BASKETBALL, LISTED FROM A TO Z 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything you need to know about the college basketball season that begins 
Wednesday night: 
</P>
<P>
 A is for the Arkansas Razorbacks, defending champs, everyone back, and they 
won't repeat. You watch. Something always happens to the lock teams. 
</P>
<P>
 B is for Bubba Bill Clinton, your No. 1 Hog-callin' hoopologist. It isn't his 
year, if you hadn't noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 C is for Coppin State. With Stephen Stewart, Sidney Goodman and Keith 
Carmichael back for a third season together, this could be the year for 
Baltimore's best team to make it to the NCAA tournament and beat someone. 
</P>
<P>
 D is for the Dream Team starting lineup at the Summer Olympics in 2004: 
Rasheed Wallace, Marcus Camby, Joe Smith, Grant Hill, Jason Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
 E is for Brian Ellerbe, the new coach at Loyola, who is in a tough spot. (His 
team is coming off a miracle NCAA season that raises expectations, but the two 
players that made it happen are gone.) Go easy on him, Greyhounders. 
</P>
<P>
 F is for Adonal Foyle, the most amazing freshman of the year, a 6-foot-10 
center who chose nonscholarship Colgate over Syracuse and Duke because his 
legal guardians are professors there. He plays Maryland at Cole Field House in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 G is for the good teams I don't like this year. I don't like Duke. (Too many 
good players in the NBA.) I don't like North Carolina. (Something missing.) I 
don't like UMass even though everyone else does. (Too many D's in easy 
classes.) 
</P>
<P>
 H is for the Houston Cougars. The Phi Slamma Jamma glamour team of the '80s 
has fallen hard, averaging less than 3,000 fans at home, lacking a conference 
to play in when the Southwest folds next year. Say it ain't so, Benny Anders. 
</P>
<P>
 I is for Allen Iverson. He's the real deal, folks. The word at Georgetown is 
that it's scary how good he is. 
</P>
<P>
 J is for Joe, as in Maryland's Franchise Sophomore Joe Smith. There'll be a 
lot of talk about him moving on to the NBA after this season. And he should if 
he can get himself one of those $30 million jobbies they're throwing around 
like nickels. 
</P>
<P>
 K is for Brent Kell of Evansville, the only Division I player who made more 
than 50% of his three-point attempts (62 of 123) last season. 
</P>
<P>
 L is for the lost season at Towson State, which probably would make the NCAA 
tournament as the champion of the Big South, except the league has lost its 
automatic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 M is for the Mid-Continent Conference and Midwestern Collegiate Conference. If 
you can name every team in both MCC leagues, you're watching way too much 
cable, sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 N is for the new math of college sports. Starting in 1996, the Big Eight will 
have 12 teams and the Big Ten will have 11. 
</P>
<P>
 O is for the (seven!) opponents on Maryland's schedule ranked in the preseason 
Top 25 (UMass, Carolina, Duke, Cincinnati, Virginia, Georgia Tech, Wake 
Forest). 
</P>
<P>
 P is for powerhouse conferences (top five, in order): ACC, SEC, Big Ten, Big 
East, Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Q is for the many questions you're better off not asking. Such as, "Say, how 
did that guy get in school?" 
</P>
<P>
 R is for Rollie Massimino, whose slimy shadow deal with UNLV is the hands-down 
winner of this year's symbol of everything wrong with sports. And he'll get 
another job, you watch. 
</P>
<P>
 S is for the St. Joseph's University Classic, a holiday tournament that was 
canceled because the hosts couldn't find anyone willing to play Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
 T is for Billy Tubbs, famous smart mouth, now coaching at TCU. Even he can't 
find the words to explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 U is for unbearably porky, which is what you'll be if you get hooked on ESPN's 
199-game regular-season schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 V is for Dickie V himself, of course. I can't help it, I like the guy's act. 
The whole stupid schtick. 
</P>
<P>
 W is for the Westerners, the ideal nickname for East Tennessee State, of the 
Southern Conference's Northern Division. So named, they would become the first 
team in NCAA history to use all four directions at once. (Alas, they're called 
the Buccaneers.) 
</P>
<P>
 X is for Xavier, which had the gall to steal Loyola's Skip Prosser. 
</P>
<P>
 Y is for the yawner that is the pointless regular season. One win in the NCAA 
tournament is worth more than 20 during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Z is for my zippy, zesty Final Four prediction: Alabama, Georgetown, Kansas, 
Kentucky. Take that and smoke it.

<P>
 It's nice to dream, and that's about all Florida State can do in trying to win 
another national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have two hopes left in regard to the national championship," Seminole 
Coach Bobby Bowden said Saturday night after Florida State defeated No. 25 
North Carolina State, 34-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1, we would have to beat Florida to have any hope," he said, referring to 
next weekend's game. "No. 2, somebody would have to knock Miami off so that we 
would be the No. 1 coalition team and get to play whoever plays in the Orange 
Bowl. Some people would have to fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Kanell tossed two touchdown passes for the Seminoles, 9-1 overall and 
8-0 in the ACC. Nine Florida State players had to leave because of injuries. 
Four are out for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolfpack fell to 7-3 and 5-2.

<P>
 No. 3 Florida has enough offensive weapons to beat a letdown and Vanderbilt on 
the same afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida got past Vanderbilt, 24-7, Saturday at Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators, 9-1 overall and 7-1 in the Southeastern Conference, clinched their 
third consecutive SEC Eastern Division title last week against South Carolina 
and will face No. 8-ranked Florida State next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24 points Saturday was Florida's lowest output of the season. The Gators' 
previous low came in a 31-0 victory at Tennessee in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play very well today," Florida Coach Steve Spurrier said. "We threw 
the ball a lot better last week. But give Vandy credit for being able to cover 
and for having a good pass rush." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt (5-5, 2-5) lost to the Gators, 52-0, last year but blitzed and 
stunted in sacking Danny Wuerffel four times and holding Florida to 221 yards 
passing, well below its 367-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offensively, we sputtered again," Spurrier said. "It seems like (Vanderbilt 
defensive coordinator) Carl Reese's defense is tough on us. We never go far 
throwing the ball against Vandy. We didn't do very well last year, we didn't do 
very well this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida rushed 42 times for 229 yards behind Taylor and Elijah Williams, who 
had 15 carries for 96 yards. The Gators had averaged 167 yards rushing while 
leading the SEC in total offense at 488 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana State 49, Tulane 25 -- Jamie Howard threw two touchdown passes and 
ran for a score at New Orleans as the Tigers (3-7) won one for fired coach 
Curley Hallman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hallman, fired Tuesday after four consecutive losing seasons, is 15-28 heading 
into next Saturday's finale against Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Kennison 49 seconds into the 
game, but Tulane (1-10) got even on 72-yard run by Adam Moorhead. LSU was on 
top, 28-10, by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee 52, Kentucky 0 -- Peyton Manning passed for two touchdowns and ran 
for one at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee (6-4, 4-3) dominated every phase of the game, rolling up 471 yards 
to 162 for Kentucky (1-10, 0-8). 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tennessee's 10th consecutive victory in the series.

ATLANTIC COAST ROUNDUP; RESERVE LEADS NORTH CAROLINA PAST DUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Mike Thomas was languishing on the bench as North Carolina's 
backup quarterback, having thrown only 18 passes all season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas, subbing for injured starter Jason Stanicek for the second 
consecutive week, shook off two months of rustiness Saturday to pull off 
another successful finish against No. 24 Duke, connecting with Octavus Barnes 
on a 71-yard scoring pass play with 2:01 left in a 41-40 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to be involved in any win," Thomas said. "It's just great to be 
involved with this football team, period. There is a lot of heart and fire. 
There was a lot of pride and bragging rights on the line today." 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the 11th consecutive time the Tar Heels, 8-3 overall and 5-3 in the 
Atlantic Coat Conference, have won when both teams entered the game with 
winning records. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was painful for Duke (8-3, 5-3), which started the season 7-0 but 
failed to gain its first nine-victory season since the 1941 Rose Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke lost each of its last two games by one point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils appeared to have won when Spence Fischer, who completed 33 of 
57 passes for 395 yards -- all career highs -- connected with Corey Thomas with 
two touchdown pass plays in a 4 1/2-minute span late in the fourth quarter. The 
first came after Duke blocked a punt with North Carolina leading, 34-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, however, needed only 46 seconds to move the Tar Heels 85 yards for the 
winning score. Barnes caught the winning pass over the middle about 15 yards 
downfield, ran to the outside and down the right sideline, and avoided a final 
Duke defender and the sideline before racing into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Virginia 42, No. 14 Virginia Tech 23 -- The Cavaliers intercepted five 
passes off Maurice DeShazo and recovered three of the Hokies' four fumbles at 
Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia turned six of the turnovers into 29 points on the way to their 
highest point total against the Hokies since a 42-0 victory in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Crocker led the Cavaliers with two interceptions, and Virginia, which came 
in with the nation's top rushing defense, allowing only 58.6 yards per game, 
held the Hokies to 33. Virginia Tech's 17 rushes represented its lowest total 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in front of scouts from the Fiesta, Gator, Peach, Carquest and 
Independence bowls, Virginia (8-2) kept itself in contention for a coalition 
berth. The Cavaliers also accomplished one of their preseason goals: win more 
than seven games, something they had been unable to do in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Garcia kicked a school-record five field goals -- from 28, 43, 37, 50 
and 22 yards -- as Virginia ended the Hokies' 11-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia turned two turnovers by Virginia Tech (8-3) into nine points on the 
way to a 19-13 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers added two field goals in the third quarter to stretch the lead 
to 25-16, and blew the game open by scoring 17 points in the first seven 
minutes of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina 33, Clemson 7 -- Brandon Bennett rushed for 104 yards and two 
touchdowns in the Gamecocks' biggest victory against their archrivals at 
Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Taneyhill threw for 226 yards and an 18-yard touchdown to Toby Cates as 
South Carolina (6-5) qualified for its first bowl trip since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson (5-6), which had won its three previous games, was limited to 177 
yards overall and 122 yards rushing. The Tigers, 9-3 a year ago, ended with 
their second losing season in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest 20, Georgia Tech 13 -- Freshman Herman Lewis ran for 149 yards, 
including a 27-yard scoring run, as the Demon Deacons took advantage of six 
Yellow Jacket turnovers to upset Georgia Tech in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Demon Deacons (3-8, 1-7) ended a five-game losing streak. It was the 
eighth loss in a row for the Yellow Jackets (1-9, 0-8).

NOTRE DAME IS THANKFUL FOR AIR FORCE'S WISHBONE

 Notre Dame's Derrick Mayes caught two touchdown passes and set up another 
score Saturday as the Irish defeated Air Force, 42-30, ending the Falcons' 
seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Zellars, playing his second game since an ankle sprain against Stanford on 
Oct. 1, rushed for two touchdowns for the Irish (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Mayes' two touchdown catches gave him 11 for the season, a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory kept alive bowl prospects for Notre Dame, which must finish with 
seven wins for a guaranteed spot in either the Orange, Sugar, Cotton or Fiesta 
bowls. The Irish (6-4) visit USC next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force (7-4) scored four touchdowns in the second half with its wishbone 
offense, but couldn't overcome the 28-3 lead that Notre Dame built at halftime, 
helped by several Falcon miscues. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry blamed some of his team's problems on a wet 
field, which caused several players to lose their footing, and stopped at least 
one Falcon drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track benefited their style of play better then it benefited ours," 
DeBerry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had put that much water on my lawn at home, my wife would have fired 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gimme a break," Holtz replied.

PENN STATE WINS, BUT IT'S NOT PRETTY; BIG TEN: NITTANY LIONS GIVE UP 475 YARDS 
AND NEED TURNOVERS TO GET PAST NORTHWESTERN, 45-17. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When is a 45-17 victory unsatisfying? When you're the No. 2 team in the nation 
and looking to move up. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State, 10-0 overall and 7-0 in the Big Ten, extended the nation's longest 
winning streak to 15 with a 45-17 victory over Northwestern on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rose Bowl-bound Nittany Lions, missing four injured defensive 
starters, looked vulnerable in giving up 475 yards and lost another player. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of late in the year to not be able to stop guys," linebacker Willie 
Smith said. "We won, but I'm disappointed in the way we played defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats gained 172 yards more than their average, despite the suspension 
of career rushing leader Dennis Lundy. Darnell Autry replaced Lundy and ran for 
171 yards in 39 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State overcame the defensive problems by coming up with four first-half 
turnovers that led to 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Kim Herring scooped up Chad Lilly's fumble on the Wildcats' first 
possession and ran it back 80 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, he 
intercepted a pass intended for Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Bobby Engram took a short pass from Kerry Collins, broke a 
tackle and ran 50 yards for a score. At the end of the first quarter, Penn 
State led, 14-0, despite having the ball for only 19 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Herring injured his knee and he will miss next week's 
game against Michigan State, although he might be ready for the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern (3-7-1, 2-6) used everything in the playbook, setting up a field 
goal with a pass from quarterback Steve Schnur to Mike Senters and back to 
Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern recovered an on-side kick and drove to the Penn State 31, but 
Brad Scioli intercepted Schnur's pass and ran it back to the Northwestern 17, 
setting up the first of three touchdown runs by Ki-Jana Carter.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; FLETCHER'S CAREER DAY HELPS WISCONSIN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior tailback Terrell Fletcher ran for a career-high 192 yards in a 
career-high 40 carries Saturday as Wisconsin defeated Illinois, 19-13, in a Big 
Ten game at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Bevell threw for two second-half touchdowns as Wisconsin, 6-4-1 
overall and 4-3-1 in the Big Ten, earned a trip to the Hall of Fame Bowl in 
Tampa, Fla., on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers, winners of last season's Rose Bowl game, will face a team from 
the Atlantic Coast Conference -- Duke, North Carolina or North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois (6-5, 4-4) settled for a trip to the Liberty Bowl to face East 
Carolina (7-4) on Dec. 31 in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher, for the second consecutive week, carried the Badgers in the absence 
of star senior tailback Brent Moss, who was suspended after his arrest on a 
drug charge Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge Thursday and 
received two years' probation, but he remained suspended from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman nose tackle John Todryk, who pleaded innocent on Tuesday to a charge 
of delivering an ounce of cocaine to an undercover agent, also was suspended by 
Coach Barry Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin overcame the distractions to win consecutive games for the first 
time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevell had touchdown pass plays of 13 yards to J.C. Dawkins and eight yards to 
fullback Ron Johnson after Illinois had taken a 7-3 lead on the opening drive 
of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 33, Purdue 29 -- Alex Smith ran for 245 yards and two touchdowns, 
setting Big Ten freshman rushing records for a game and a season in the 
Hoosiers victory at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a redshirt freshman tailback, scored on a 66-yard run in the first 
quarter, then added the winning touchdown on a one-yarder early in the fourth 
quarter, three plays after a Purdue fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Hoosiers (6-5, 3-5) took over at the Boilermaker 24, Smith lost a 
yard, ran 24 yards to the one and scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (4-5-2, 2-4-2), using third-string quarterback Brian Goehl after 
starter Billy Dicken was injured, threatened on its final two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time, the Boilermakers reached the Indiana 27 before Goehl was 
sacked by Nathan Davis and fumbled. The next time, Purdue got to the Indiana 26 
before Goehl lost 13 yards on another sack by Davis, and after two incomplete 
passes, Indiana took over on downs with 44 seconds left and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa 49, Minnesota 42 -- Matt Sherman threw two touchdown passes and caught 
one and the Hawkeyes converted three turnovers into 21 points at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, a redshirt freshman, threw for 331 yards and three touchdowns last 
week in his debut as a starter and followed that with an equally impressive 
showing against Minnesota. He completed 13 of 18 passes for 256 yards and two 
touchdowns without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second year in a row against the Hawkeyes, turnovers killed the 
Gophers (3-8, 1-7). This time, Iowa (5-5-1, 3-4-1) converted a fumbled punt 
return, a fumbled kickoff return and an interception off Tim Schade into three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawkeyes lost the lead twice before moving ahead for good with 7:12 
remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman took less than two minutes to march his team 73 yards, ending the 
drive with a 34-yard touchdown pass play to Demo Odems to put Iowa up, 35-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry Cooks intercepted Schade's pass on the Minnesota 29 on the Gophers' next 
possession. Four plays later, Sherman pitched the ball to Tim Dwight, who then 
connected with a wide-open Sherman in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The 91 points were the most ever scored between the teams. The previous high 
was 75 in 1903.

BIG EIGHT ROUNDUP; SALAAM FUELS VICTORY BEFORE BOMBSHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rashaan Salaam became the fourth 2,000-yard rusher in major-college history, 
running for 259 yards and two touchdowns in 29 carries as No. 7 Colorado closed 
the season with a 41-20 victory over winless Iowa State on Saturday in a Big 
Eight game at Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam, the nation's leading rusher and scorer, joined Oklahoma State's Barry 
Sanders, USC's Marcus Allen and Nebraska's Mike Rozier in surpassing 2,000 
yards. Each won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl-bound Buffaloes, 10-1 overall and 6-1 in the Big Eight, generated 576 
yards in total offense, and afterward came Coach Bill McCartney's stunning 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State (0-10-1, 0-6-1), which drew within 20-13 on Troy Davis' 99-yard 
kickoff return late in the third quarter -- the longest in school history -- 
had its first winless season since the 1930 team went 0-9. 
</P>
<P>
 With Colorado leading only, 20-13, after three quarters, quarterback Kordell 
Stewart ran 23 yards for a touchdown with 13:20 left and Salaam dashed 67 yards 
for another with 10:27 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam, a junior, broke the 2,000-yard barrier on that run, giving him 2,055 
yards for the season. He was mobbed by teammates and hoisted on their shoulders 
in the corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out of breath," Salaam said of his 67-yarder. "The guys were saying, 
'Strike the (Heisman) pose, strike the pose.' But that's not my style." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart set a Big Eight record for career total offense. He had 196 yards 
passing and 89 rushing for a total of 285 on Saturday, giving him 7,770, 
bettering the 7,749 of Oklahoma State's Mike Gundy from 1987-89. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam and Stewart became only the second set of teammates to have 2,000 yards 
rushing and 2,000 passing in the same season; Oklahoma State's Sanders and 
Gundy did it in 1988. Stewart joined Gundy as the only three-time 2,000-yard 
passers in Big Eight history. 
</P>
<P>
 This game also marked the end for Coach Jim Walden at Iowa State. Walden 
earlier announced his resignation. Walden spent the game in the radio booth, 
having been suspended by the Big Eight for criticizing officials.  
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Kansas State 23, Oklahoma State 6 -- The Wildcats (8-2, 5-2) can do no 
worse than third in the Big Eight following this victory in a driving rainstorm 
at Manhattan, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-2 conference record is the best for Kansas State in 24 years. The 
Wildcats are probably headed to the Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State (3-7-1, 0-6-1) took a 6-0 lead in the first quarter but failed 
to win a Big Eight game for the second consecutive year, a span of 17 games 
that includes two ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas 31, Missouri 14 -- L.T. Levine ran for a career-high 221 yards and two 
touchdowns in 25 carries as the Jayhawks (6-5, 3-4) handed the Tigers (3-8, 
2-5) their seventh consecutive loss at home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Missouri's sixth winless home season in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas, which gained 365 yards on the ground, pulled away from a 14-14 tie in 
the second half. The Rundown 
</P>

 Colorado's Rashaan Salaam became the first player since Barry Sanders in 1988

 Mike McCoy flipped a swing pass to Charlie Brown, who ran for a 20-yard 
touchdown with 56 seconds remaining, giving Utah a 34-31 victory over Brigham 
Young on Saturday at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah defeated BYU by the same score in Provo last year. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy finished with four touchdowns passes, two of them to Deron Claiborne, 
while connecting on 18 of 29 passes for 247 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had 107 yards rushing -- his fourth consecutive game of 100 yards or 
more on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah is 9-2 overall and 6-2 in the Western Athletic Conference. The Cougars 
finished the regular season 9-3 and 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ruined a stellar day for BYU quarterback John Walsh, who connected on 
29 of 46 passes for 324 yards and four touchdowns, with one interception.

UNLV BEATS NEVADA, GETS BOWL BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tumult, long-range salvos and bitter feelings of the past year died a 
noisy death as dusk fell on Sam Boyd Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Battle of Nevada had been fought and won in remarkable fashion by Nevada 
Las Vegas, 32-27, over rival Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no ugly scenes, no fistfights, few confrontations and, in the end, 
no bad feelings between the two men who made this such an intriguing matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV Coach Jeff Horton, called a traitor among other things by Nevada Coach 
Chris Ault after Horton abruptly left Reno for Las Vegas last November, met his 
mentor and his toughest critic face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
 All around them was chaos, as UNLV players and fans celebrated a 
come-from-behind victory that earned the Rebels a share of the Big West 
championship and their first bowl bid in 10 years. They'll play Central 
Michigan in the Las Vegas Bowl on Dec. 17 after finishing the regular season 
against Kansas State next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 When Saturday's game was over, after UNLV lost a 26-14 lead only to regain it 
in the game's final minute, Horton and Ault spoke in conciliatory tones. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton had been hired by Ault, who also is Nevada's athletic director, to 
replace him as football coach last year. But after 5 1/2 months on the job, 
Horton jumped to UNLV to pump new life into the sagging program. Never mind 
that Ault had turned down the job himself four days earlier. Ault unleashed his 
anger on Horton. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton fired back, saying the move to UNLV was his only way out of Ault's 
shadow. By game's end Saturday, that ill will seemed to be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Ault gave me my start in college, not only as an assistant, but as a 
head coach as well," Horton said. "I owe him so much. I respect him so much. 
Hopefully, everything is behind us now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ault: "The bottom line is it's a football game. Two teams played and they 
outplayed us." 
</P>
<P>
 DeJohn Branch's four-yard touchdown run with 58 seconds left in the game ended 
an 80-yard drive into a 25 m.p.h. headwind and made UNLV, 6-4 overall and 5-1 
in the Big West, a winner for the first time in five games against Nevada (9-2, 
5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 With 2:32 to play and the ball at their own 20, the Rebel players huddled. 
Moments earlier, Marcellus Chrishon had given Nevada a 27-26 lead by turning a 
draw play into a 38-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, UNLV was heading into the wind with time running out. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-yard pass play to wideout Kofi Banks, open over the middle, set up 
Branch's four-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee you," Brown said later. "we couldn't have done it without Coach 
Horton. He made all the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Branch: "I guess this was the biggest win ever for UNLV football."

 E.J. Watson ran for three touchdowns Saturday night as No. 10 Colorado State 
overcame a 21-point deficit to defeat Fresno State, 44-42, at Fresno to clinch 
the Western Athletic Conference title and a Holiday Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, questionable for the game because of a sprained right ankle, ran for 
touchdowns of two, 24 and 22 yards as the Rams, 10-1 overall and 7-1 in the 
WAC, earned the WAC's host berth in the Dec. 30 game at San Diego. Colorado 
State will play Michigan, which was beaten on Saturday by Ohio State, 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State won its first WAC title since joining the league in 1968 and 
finished the best regular season in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (4-7-1, 2-4-1) had its first losing season in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State took its first lead of the game with 1:09 to play in the third 
quarter when Raymond Jackson blocked John Brown's punt, scooped up the ball and 
ran 30 yards for a 31-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthoney Hill's 78-yard pass to Paul Turner with 9:29 to play increased the 
lead to 37-27. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State pulled to within 37-35 on a one-yard scoring run by Reggie Brown, 
his second touchdown of the game, and a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Ward's eight-yard run with 2:02 to play restored the margin, but Fresno 
State again cut its deficit to two points with 48 seconds left on a three-yard 
pass from Richie Donati to Michael Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State recovered an on-side kick, however, and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico 25, Texas El Paso 21 -- Stoney Case finished his record-filled 
career by passing for two fourth-quarter touchdowns and running for another as 
the Lobos (5-7, 4-4) rallied to beat the Miners (3-7-1, 1-6-1) at Albuquerque, 
N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Case brought the Lobos back from a 21-6 deficit.

<TEXT>
<P>
 This was a college game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, but the crowd 
acted as if it were a Raider game. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami quarterback Frank Costa, who led the Hurricanes to a 38-14 victory over 
Temple on Saturday, now knows how Raider and Ram players felt last Sunday in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 A brawl that broke out during the third quarter Saturday was in the section 
where Costa's friends and family were seated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want anybody to get hurt," said Costa, who grew up three blocks 
from Veterans Stadium. "I really didn't know what was going on and I had a lot 
of family up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Several fans among a tiny crowd of 11,873 were treated for scrapes, bumps and 
bruises, as were four security guards, according to the official in charge of 
the stadium's security detail. The official said some fans were trying to get 
on the field, and as one fan was being escorted out, others got involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami, 9-1 overall and 6-0 in the Big East, plays host to Boston College next

Taffoni submarined through the line to stop Omari Walker for no gain. . . . 
Kirby Dar Dar rushed for a career-high 159 yards in 22 carries as Syracuse 
(7-3) scored on long drives on its first three possessions to end a two-game 
losing streak with a 21-16 nonconference victory over Maryland (4-7) at 
Syracuse, N.Y. Maryland, which doubled its victory total from a year ago,

possession but a holding call and an interception ended the comeback. . . .

 Corey Pullig threw a touchdown pass on a third-and-long play and the Aggies 
came up with two drive-stopping plays in the third quarter in defeating TCU, 
34-17, at College Station, Tex., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies 10-0-1 overall and 6-0-1 in the SWC, completed their first unbeaten

</P>
<P>
 The Aggies extended their Kyle Field winning streak to 26 games and their home

 Texas Tech, which has never represented the Southwest Conference in the Cotton 
Bowl, is the frontrunner to go after defeating Houston, 34-0, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech, which has been in the SWC since 1960, last played in the Cotton 
Bowl in 1939, taking on St. Mary's of California.

 The Red Raiders, 6-4 overall and 4-2 in the SWC, will go to the Cotton Bowl 
with a victory over Texas Christian next Saturday or with a combination of 
outcomes of other SWC games.  
</P>
<P>
 The Red Raiders had little trouble handling the Cougars (1-9, 1-5) at the 
Alamodome. Byron Hanspard led Tech, rushing for 109 yards and scoring two 
touchdowns. It was Hanspard's third 100-yard game of the season.

 Derek Sparks rushed for two touchdowns and Kevin Hicks ran for one as 
Washington State defeated No. 18 Washington, 23-6, Saturday in icy Martin 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State, 7-4 overall and 5-3 in the Pacific 10, finished fourth in 
the conference and is expected to be invited to the Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (7-4, 4-4) is on probation for NCAA rule violations and ineligible 
for any postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks, filling in with Hicks for injured starter Frank Madu, scored on two 
one-yard runs in the first half. Hicks scored on a three-yard run as Washington 
State took a 21-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars scored after lengthy drives kept alive by long passes from Chad 
Davis to his tight ends. Davis completed nine of 20 passes for 193 of the 
Cougars' 327 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars held Washington to 197 yards, only 102 on the ground. Washington 
tailback Napoleon Kaufman, who rushed 20 times for 66 yards, set a school 
all-purpose yardage record of 4,041 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington scored on its first possession on Leon Neal's seven-yard run to end 
a 67-yard drive. John Wales' attempted point-after kick was tipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars answered on the next series with a 67-yard drive. Sparks scored on 
a one-yard plunge to make it 7-6 with 3:30 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis's 49-yard pass play to Bryant Thomas and a 17-yard pass to Hicks set up 
Sparks' second touchdown to complete a 79-yard drive with 3:26 to play in the 
second quarter.

CAL WINS WHEN GAMBLE BY STANFORD FAILS; PACIFIC 10: BEARS STOP TWO-POINT 
CONVERSION ATTEMPT WITH 2:06 TO PLAY IN 24-23 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a matchup between two teams with losing records, but Saturday's 97th 
"Big Game" between California and Stanford was far from boring. 
</P>
<P>
 In what might have been his last game at Stanford, Coach Bill Walsh's final 
gamble of the season came up short on a late two-point conversion in the 
Cardinal's 24-23 loss before 75,662 at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, who hinted early in the week that he might step down as coach after the 
season, decided to go for the victory after a one-yard touchdown run by Ethan 
Allen with 2:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, which had rallied from a 14-point first-quarter deficit, saw its 
chance for victory die when quarterback Scott Frost's desperation pass was 
knocked away by the Bears' Matt Clizbe in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage of my life, I have to think of the best options for me and for 
the university," said Walsh, whose team finished with a 3-7-1 record after 
posting a 4-7 mark last season. "These are troubled days at Stanford with two 
seasons like this." 
</P>
<P>
 If Walsh does decide to call it quits, he will look back at his last game and 
remember Cal senior running back Tyrone Edwards, who ran for a career-high 208 
yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, who had never rushed for more than 74 yards, scored the first time he 
touched the ball when he raced 41 yards for a touchdown 54 seconds into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into the game thinking that I had to have a good game because this is 
my last one," said Edwards, a former Nogales High standout. "I wanted to end on 
a good note for the team, the seniors, the fans, and everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, which has not held an opponent to fewer than 21 points for more than 
two seasons, did its part early in making sure Edwards' wish was granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without senior quarterback Steve Stenstrom, whose season ended two 
weeks ago when he suffered a broken finger on his passing hand in a victory 
over Washington, Stanford turned the ball over on its first two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, a sophomore making his second start, had his first pass of the game 
intercepted by Clizbe, setting up Edwards' first touchdown run. Two plays into 
Stanford's next drive, freshman tailback Anthony Bookman fumbled a handoff into 
the arms of Cal lineman Andy Jacobs deep in Cardinal territory. One play later, 
the Bears took a 14-0 lead on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Pat Barnes to 
Iheanyi Uwaezuoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of crumbling, Stanford bounced back to score 10 consecutive points 
during the next six minutes. Aaron Mills kicked a 30-yard field goal and, on 
the Cardinal's next possession, Frost connected with Brian Manning on a 29-yard 
touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew all the time that it was going to be that kind of game," said Cal 
Coach Keith Gilbertson, whose Bears finished 4-7 overall and 3-5 in the Pacific 
10 Conference. "These teams are so similar in a lot of ways that we knew it was 
going to be close." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest similarity between the teams proved to be turnovers. After Cal 
took a 17-10 lead on a 38-yard field goal by Longwell, the Bears allowed 
Stanford back into the game on a 69-yard interception return by linebacker Coy 
Gibbs to the Cal one-yard line in the second quarter. That led to a touchdown 
run by Adam Salina, which tied the score at 17 before halftime.  
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, it was more of the same as the teams took turns turning 
the ball over and wasting scoring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, who played at Trabuco Hills High, did his share with two fumbles and 
two interceptions, while Stanford had three trick plays fail, including a fake 
field goal at the Cal nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears finally got back on track when they turned to Edwards on their first 
possession of the fourth quarter. Edwards completed a 12-play, 92 yard-drive by 
gaining the last 22 in three carries, including an eight-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that this was my day and I wanted the ball," said Edwards, who 
credited former teammate Russell White for getting him ready for the game. "I 
wanted to get over 100, but I didn't expect to go over 200. I just know that it 
felt good on my second touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 With the ball on its own 22, Cal gave Stanford one more chance when Barnes 
fumbled a snap with 3:30 to play.

COMMENTARY; IT'S ANOTHER YEAR, BUT JETS LOOK THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jets have six games left and, if they cannot win four of them, then it is 
another season when they cannot get over .500 and it is another season when 
they are out of the playoffs, and someone else has to be brought in to run the 
team and quarterback it and maybe even coach it. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Jets coach to have a winning season was Joe Walton in 1988. The Jets 
were 8-7-1 that time. Bruce Coslet never had a winning season, which means Dick 
Steinberg, the general manager, still hasn't had one either. 
</P>
<P>
 There are six NFL teams that have not had a winning season in the '90s: 
Patriots, Cardinals, Bucs, Browns, Rams -- and Jets. If they keep talking about 
the spot of the ball and weeping about officials, they will be December's 
doormats again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets could be 7-3 today. They should make the playoffs even though they 
are not 7-3. They should be able to win a big game on the road with the 
playoffs on the line, because they have the defense for it. It is about time 
the Jets lead the league in something other than could and should. It is about 
time the Jets are champions of something other than excuses about why they lose 
so many games like the one they lost to the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 So we are right where we always are with the Jets at this time of year. We 
wonder if they have it in them to look like a real team for more than 60 
minutes at a time. If they can't, if they can't win four of six down the 
stretch, then there is no reason for Jets fans to believe Pete Carroll is much 
different from Walton or Coslet, or Boomer Esiason is anything more than the 
lefty Ken O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets lost to the Packers in Green Bay last Sunday because they could not 
do the job the last time they had the ball. They lost to the Colts a couple of 
weeks ago because they could not do the job the last time they had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Colts, they could not make a yard on fourth-and-1 and blamed that 
one on the refs. Now they are talking about bad calls in Green Bay. One 
official ruled a touchdown catch for Rob Moore and then another one overruled 
him. The replays didn't settle anything, so maybe it was a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
 And if it was, so what? There have been a million bad calls this season. There 
were a couple against the Giants a couple of weeks ago, both of them involving 
Herman Moore of the Lions. Those calls cost the Giants a game. In the 
Giants-Cardinals game last Sunday at Giants Stadium, Kent Graham was ruled for 
intentionally grounding the ball even though he never got his arm up. If the 
officials needed to call anything there, they should have called intentional 
gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just the Jets, it is everybody being victimized by hack officials. 
Anybody who thinks otherwise just engages in loser's talk. But then there is 
always a lot of talk from the Jets. Usually they are telling us that November 
and December are going to be real different this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets are 5-5 instead of 6-4 because Esiason threw an interception after 
the Jets recovered a muffed punt in the fourth quarter. The Jets are 5-5 
because they couldn't score a touchdown in the second half. Everybody keeps 
talking about poor Rob Moore slipping on the fourth-down play that would have 
tied the game for the Jets in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole game is supposed to be one unlucky play when the Jets had three 
plays before that with the goal line right in front of them and could not put 
the ball in the end zone. You are supposed to score there. 
</P>
<P>
 It is like a play from the playoffs. Maybe that was the trouble. Always 
remember that we are talking about a team that has won one playoff game in the 
last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Steve Beuerlein made big plays against the Giants and won the game for 
the Cardinals. The Cardinals have been treated as one of the great jokes of pro 
football this season. We all have belted Buddy Ryan around because he showed up 
in Arizona saying, "You've got a winner in town." The Cardinals are one game 
worse than the Jets today, with a record of 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a lot of injuries for the Jets against the Packers. Ronnie Lott, 
who perhaps could have been in there if he hadn't tried to use his helmet like 
a battering ram against the Bills, didn't play, and neither did Aaron Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Johnson is hurt. There was trouble on the offensive line. The Jets were 
up against a terrific Packers defense, and they were on the road. It would have 
been a tremendous win. It would have been the kind of win that would make this 
Jets season look different from the second-rate ones that have preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets had chances to take charge against the Packers after they took the 
lead, but never did. The Jets were such a terrible team on first down you were 
amazed they had any kind of chance at the end. There was always a sack or a 
runner getting caught behind the line of scrimmage or a penalty. It always 
seemed to be second-and-12 or second-and-15. They had to keep climbing out of 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots managed to climb out of a huge hole last Sunday. The Patriots had 
lost four games in a row and Drew Bledsoe suddenly had turned into Dave Brown. 
The Patriots got behind the Vikings, one of the three best teams in the NFC, by 
20-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe threw 59 passes after halftime and the Patriots came back and beat the 
Vikings in overtime. In a few weeks, the Jets will have to beat Bledsoe and the 
Patriots up in Foxboro. Before that, the Jets must play the Vikings on the road 
and the Dolphins at home. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a wide-open season in the AFC. The Jets had the same chance as such 
teams as the Chargers and the Browns to break away from the pack. The Jets want 
to talk about injuries? The Dolphins, who have lost Terry Kirby and Keith Byars 
and just about anybody else who can run with the ball, probably want to have 
the same conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't talk about injuries any more than you talk about the officiating. 
Because you sound like weepers and no one cares. 
</P>
<P>
 I was sitting at Madison Square Garden the other night with Derek Harper. It 
was right before the Knicks' home opener, and I started to tell Harper that 
with three more baskets in Game 7 against the Rockets, the Knicks would have 
won the title and he would have been MVP of the Finals. Harper waved the whole 
notion away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you start playing coulda and woulda," he said, "you're just setting 
yourself up to fall short again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets can talk about all the little things that have put them at 5-5 
instead of in first place. They can talk about Johnny Mitchell's dropped pass 
against the Bears. They can talk about coming up a few inches short against the 
Colts. They can talk about the touchdown taken away from Rob Moore, and they 
can all cry themselves to sleep about Moore slipping in the end zone. All that 
is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 They have six games left and are supposed to win four. If not, then they are 
terminally mediocre with this operation, and Leon Hess should at least make a 
call to Jimmy Johnson.

COMMENTARY; OPPOSITES DON'T ALWAYS DETRACT AS FAVORABLE PARTNERS FOR A HUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANGUS PHILLIPS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hunting makes strange bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 5:30 a.m. on a cool October day, opening morning of Maryland's first 
early muzzleloader season for deer. Woods frame the gravel lane to the little 
field patch we'll hunt. Waiting by the gate, right on schedule, is Bob Simmons. 
We've not hunted together but I know a bit about Bob -- for example, that a 
bumper sticker on his pickup says: "Guns cause crime like flies cause garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob wears his hair slicked to a ponytail and favors camouflage clothes. He 
works for the county maintenance department and displays his choice for 
governor on a bumper sticker. One year he took an 11-point buck on the morning 
of his office Christmas party and drove back to work with the deer in his van, 
later giving a woman co-worker a ride to the party with the buck still in back. 
She was quite surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd have found an excuse not to do that. That's because I'm an urbanite 
without bumper stickers, just my U.S. Sailing membership and the kids' school 
emblem discreetly tucked away on the Wagoneer. 
</P>
<P>
 We're an odd couple, for sure. But throw us together in the deer woods and we 
manage to spend a long and thoroughly happy day, counting on one another not to 
do anything stupid up in the tree stands, wishing for mutual success, sharing 
lunch in the shack, snoring together through the mid-day break and having about 
as good a time as two middle-aged men can have without actually accomplishing 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a few deer wander by, but neither of us takes a shot. We are hunting a 
sunflower field on the Eastern Shore from which Bob has taken some big bucks 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of his responsibility as the elder statesman on the excursion, he puts 
me in the prime place -- a field corner where shoots of fresh winter wheat pop 
up among the deer tracks. I wander back there in the dark before dawn, the full 
moon hidden behind clouds. The flashlight's feeble beam sweeps the trees for a 
sign of the tree stand I'm to climb, but it's nowhere to be found. It's a weird 
feeling, probing deeper into unfamiliar woods at night. Tree stands are hard 
enough to find when you know where they are. Eventually it appears. I climb up 
and settle in. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after 20 years of deer hunting you still get wired for opening day. 
Neither of us has had much sleep. I feel myself nodding and worry about the 
muzzleloader, a primitive, single-shot gun I've not hunted with before. What if 
you snooze and drop it; will it go off? Solution: stay awake! 
</P>
<P>
 Which is no problem when three fawns and a doe appear, picking through the 
woods with nervous tail-flicks and no sound at all. It is 7:10, five minutes 
till sunrise. The woods are gray. The deer are 50 yards off, too far to shoot 
through all the brush; not that I'd have much stomach for taking a doe from her 
fawns. Still, they're deer, and close. 
</P>
<P>
 Heart pounding, I watch them pass noiselessly into the field, quartering away 
from both me and the place where Bob sits. After 10 minutes I ease down from 
the tree and tiptoe the 20 yards to the field edge to see if they've bedded 
down. Halfway there, a sharp exhalation from behind stops me. 
</P>
<P>
 A buck has been following the doe, nose to ground; now it has whiffed my scent 
and blown an alarm. I turn slowly; the buck is 50 yards away on the same woods 
trail the doe and fawns took. We have a standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The buck can't see me; it wants to continue in hot pursuit of the doe, this 
being mating season, but its nose says no. The deer prances and snorts, stamps 
the ground trying to smoke me out, advances, retreats, its soft silhouette 
blurry in the half light and confusion of trees and brush. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point it draws so near -- 40 yards -- that I begin to raise the gun, 
but the chance is quickly gone. A snort, a flash of white tail and he's off 
through the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hours later I tell the tale over lunch, savoring the details. Bob was 
close enough to hear the buck snort. He shrugs, having seen it all a hundred 
times, a hundred different ways. That's deer hunting, he says. Sometimes they 
march right up, mostly they don't. If it wasn't difficult and unpredictable, it 
wouldn't be much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob curls up in the bed of his truck with his camouflage sweatshirt rolled up 
for a pillow. I take a bunk nearby in the shack and we perform the snore 
chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening he sees four deer, including a doe that sneaks up under his 
tree stand from behind, taking him by surprise. I see only one, close but not 
close enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of muzzleloaders is that even if you don't get a shot, you get to 
shoot. It's the only way to unload the thing. So as dusk embraces night, I pick 
out a good stump, draw down, cock the hammer and let fly -- BOOOM! 
</P>
<P>
 Bob comes by a few minutes later, picking his way by flashlight, hoping to 
find me tracking a deer. No such luck. We stroll back to the shack together, 
reliving events of an uneventful day, pondering tomorrow's strategy. Perfect 
partners. Just What Traits Should Hunting Partners Possess? 
</P>
<P>
 A hunting partner is a precious commodity. Here's what I look for, in order of 
importance: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Punctuality. Getting up at 4 a.m. was hard enough; you don't want to wait 
at the rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Trustworthiness. If you're 100 yards apart and a deer strolls between you, 
will your partner shoot? Would he bring beer to the duck blind? 
</P>
<P>
 3. Adventurousness. Sometimes what you always did doesn't work and you have to 
try something new. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Skill. Can he run a boat, work a dog, start a fire, cook? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Charm. You didn't come to argue, you came to hunt. If you don't agree on 
something that doesn't pertain, why bring it up?

NBA ROUNDUP; WARRIORS WIN, GUGLIOTTA HAS SHAKY DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Latrell Sprewell scored a season-high 39 points, making 17 of 18 free throws, 
as the Golden State Warriors defeated the Utah Jazz, 119-115, on Saturday night 
at Oakland for their seventh victory in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gugliotta, acquired Thursday from the Washington Bullets along with three 
first-round picks in exchange for Chris Webber, was greeted by a standing 
ovation and "Welcome Tom" signs in his Warrior debut. He got into foul trouble 
early and had only three points and five rebounds in 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone scored 32 points to lead Utah. Jeff Hornacek had 24 and John 
Stockton added 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Hardaway scored 26 for the Warriors and Ricky Pierce scored 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 109, Denver 101 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 26 points and reserve Sam 
Cassell scored a season-high 22 at Denver as the Rockets remained undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth consecutive road victory and ninth overall for the Midwest 
Division leaders and defending NBA champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Williams scored 26 points for the Nuggets, who lost for the second game 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver was only the second opponent to score more than 100 points against the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 111, Dallas 85 -- Scottie Pippen scored 19 of his 36 points in the 
third quarter and the Bulls rode a 16-0 second-half run at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls outscored Dallas, 34-15, in the third quarter to build on a 10-point 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the 300th for Chicago Coach Phil Jackson (300-119). 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen added 14 rebounds and helped contain the Mavericks' top scorer, Jamal 
Mashburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mashburn was shut out in the third quarter and finished with 16 points, all in 
the first half and 12 under his average. Jim Jackson led Dallas with 18 points. 
Roy Tarpley, playing his second game after being out of the NBA for four 
seasons, added 14 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 120, Milwaukee 96 -- Gary Payton scored 18 of his season-high 25 
points in the first half at Milwaukee as the SuperSonics ended a three-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Perkins had 18 points and Shawn Kemp 17 for Seattle, which had six players 
score in double figures. The Bucks were led by Lee Mayberry, who scored a 
career-high 22 points. Johnny Newman and Glenn Robinson each scored 17. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 109, Minnesota 101 -- Chuck Person scored 23 points against his 
former team, and Avery Johnson had 16 points and 15 assists at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson made all seven of his field-goal attempts, and David Robinson had 20 
points and 10 rebounds as the Spurs ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Laettner scored 22 points to lead the Timberwolves, who lost their 
ninth in a row at home dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 92, Atlanta 79 -- Charles Smith made up for the absence of injured 
Patrick Ewing with 24 points and the Knicks held the Hawks scoreless for almost 
four minutes down the stretch at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 With leading scorer Ewing on the bench because of a sore right knee, the 
Knicks had a 26-point first-half lead cut to eight at the end of the third 
quarter, but their defense in the fourth quarter prevented a comeback.

 Two overtime goals by Eddie Soto propelled Cal State Fullerton to a 3-1 
overtime victory over the University San Diego in the opening round of the NCAA 
soccer tournament Saturday night at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto, a senior from Cerritos, scored in the 99th and 107th minutes, breaking 
the 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bradbury had given Fullerton a 1-0 lead in the seventh minute off an 
assist by Soto, and the goal appeared likely to stand up until San Diego 
striker Guillermo Jara scored with only 28 seconds remaining in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory advances Fullerton (13-6-2) to next weekend's second round against 
the winner of today's match between Fresno State and the University of San 
Francisco.

 Seventh-ranked UCLA (15-4) will play host to unranked Alabama Birmingham 
(15-3-1) in the first round of the NCAA tournament today at 1 p.m. at the North 
Soccer Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins have been shut out in their last three games -- a 2-0 loss to 
second-ranked Indiana, and two 1-0 losses to third-ranked Fresno State in the 
regular-season finale and the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Those losses are partially explained by late-season injuries to starters Eddie 
Lewis (fractured cheek), Frankie Hejduk (back), Adam Frye (strained knee). 
Robbie LaBelle sat out the MPSF championship game because he received five 
yellow cards this season. Everyone is available for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA received an at-large bid in the NCAA South Region and Alabama Birmingham 
received an automatic bid after winning the Great Midwest Conference 
championship. LON EUBANKS and WENDY WITHERSPOON

PREP VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; SYLMAR IS A WINNER IN 5 GAMES

<P>
 Sylmar High needed five games, but the Spartans' 15-11, 15-4, 14-16, 13-15, 
15-11 victory over Franklin on Saturday night at Occidental College gave them 
their first City Section Division 3-A girls' volleyball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Mayra Ariza served nine consecutive points, including six aces, as 
Sylmar (16-1) appeared to be making quick work of the Panthers after winning 
the first two sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariza, who suffers from chronic back pain, aggravated her back in the fourth 
game but played every point and finished with 30 kills and 13 aces. Eight of 
the kills came in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my last game, I had to give it 100%," Ariza said. "It was now or 
never." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar middle blocker Deanna Turner added 17 kills and six blocks. Outside 
hitter Anne Guevarra added 15 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin (16-1), the division's top-seeded team, was led by middle blockers 
Angelica Barraza and Joy Sukphranee. Barraza had 14 kills and 15 blocks and 
Sukphranee added 19 kills and 13 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew with their defense and blocking, there was no way it was going to be 
three games," said Sylmar Coach Bob Thomson. "I thought going in it would be 
four or five." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Owens turned in another impressive performance with 20 kills to lead 
Santa Ana Calvary Chapel to a 15-4, 15-6, 15-6 victory over Santa Ynez in the 
Southern Section Division V championships at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 The title was the second in a row for Calvary Chapel (17-4), which defeated 
Cerritos Valley Christian last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Roberts added eights kill and five blocks for the Eagles, whose four 
losses were to teams that reached sectional finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division II, Torrance Bishop Montgomery upset top-seeded Long Beach 
Millikan, 10-15, 9-15, 15-13, 15-9, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Arrowhead Rim of the World defeated San Luis Obispo, 16-14, 15-13, 15-6, 
in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending state champion Brentwood improved its record to 18-1 with a 15-4, 
15-10, 11-15, 15-6 victory over previously undefeated Los Angeles Baptist in 
Division V. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division VI, top-seeded Windward defeated Carpinteria Cate, 15-9, 15-7, 
16-14. MICHAEL LAZARUS

COLLEGE TOWN WINS BARRERA HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Horse owner David Brown couldn't have asked for much more Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, Gary, was married in Napa and his 3-year-old gelding College Town 
proved his victory in last month's California Cup Classic was no fluke by 
winning the $112,300 Lazaro S. Barrera Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown and trainer Mel Stute weren't on hand to see College Town's 
$13.60 score, all they had to do was remember the 33-1 shocker in the Cal Cup 
because the Barrera was a carbon copy. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the pace early under Laffit Pincay, the son of Snow Chief again rallied 
along the inside and beat 24-1 shot Just Java by nearly two lengths in 1:41 for 
1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pincay's a genius," said Stute, who called the Hollywood Park press box and 
listened to the race over the phone. "This really makes this a totally perfect 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 The race used to be called the Affirmed Handicap, but it was renamed the 
Barrera in honor of the Hall of Fame trainer, who died in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do recall that I was excited about winning this race two years ago (on 
$57.40 upsetter Star Recruit) because it had been named after Laz Barrera," 
Pincay said. "He was so special to me. It's a very sentimental thing to me. Laz 
was a great trainer and a good friend. I felt very good to see his wife 
(Carmen) in the winner's circle. It was just so nice for me." Horse Racing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Betting on the eight races simulcast from Hong Kong Friday night exceeded the 
expectations of Hollywood Park management. The total California handle was 
$311,472 on the races, which began at 9:30 p.m. local time and concluded at 1 
a.m. Saturday morning. "The Hong Kong races were a hit," Hollywood Park 
chairman R.D. Hubbard said. "People like the action. We saw people at the 
racetrack and in the (Hollywood Park) casino who were here for the first time 
because of the Hong Kong races."

PREP CROSS-COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS; GARFIELD AND PALISADES TEAMS END LONG RUN OF 
LEAN RESULTS 
</P>

 Garfield High won its first City Section boys' cross-country title since 1963, 
and the Palisades girls won their first title in 13 years in the finals 
Saturday at Pierce College in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Gilmore of Palisades led from the start to win the three-mile race in 14 
minutes 56 seconds -- the fastest winning time since 1983 -- and the Dolphins 
placed three runners among the top six. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield's depth was decisive. Paced by runner-up Richard Martinez (15:25) and 
seventh- and ninth-place finishes of David Jimenez (15:54) and Eddie Sanchez 
(16:00), Garfield placed its fourth and fifth runners, Junior Camacho and 
Armando Morales, in 19th and 20th, ahead of Palisades' No. 5 runner to edge the 
Dolphins for the team title, 43-48. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two teams qualified for the State championships Saturday in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Kara Barnard (19:21), Diana Epstein (19:21) and Genevieve Cruise (19:37) of 
Palisades finished fourth, fifth and seventh, respectively, to lead the 
Dolphins to the team title with 54 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfina Martinez of Belmont won the girls' race in 18:58 for the five-time 
defending champion Sentinels, who finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks boys' team placed five runners among the top 16 to win the 
Southern Section Division I finals at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Keith O'Doherty (15:16 over the three-mile course), Jeff Fischer 
(15:18) and Kevin Marsden (15:19) were third, fourth and fifth as Thousand Oaks 
won with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The top four teams in each race and the top five individuals not on a 
qualifying team advanced to the State championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' top five runners compiled a cumulative team time of 77:09, 
lowering their previous best of 77:56 set in last year's finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, paced by runner-up Kim Mortensen, also won the Division I 
girls' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo and freshman Elaine Canchola of Ojai 
Nordhoff turned in the top boys' and girls' times of the meet. KIRBY LEE and

NEWSWIRE: SAMPRAS RALLIES TO DEFEAT AGASSI AND REACH FINAL

<P>
 Top-ranked Pete Sampras wore down Andre Agassi for a 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 
victory Saturday and advanced to the final of the IBM/ATP Tour World 
Championship at Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, seeking his second title since 1991, overcame his own erratic play 
and an inspired performance by Agassi, who pressured Sampras into numerous 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Agassi's game collapsed in frustration after he lost the second set and 
had a point penalty after several outbursts that could have even earned him a 
default from umpire Rudi Berger of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras will face Germany's Boris Becker, who also fell behind before rallying 
for a 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-1 victory over Sergi Bruguera of Spain.

 Gabriela Sabatini's giant step toward winning the Virginia Slims Championships 
in New York got a little help from Kimiko Date's leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabatini, seeking her first tournament title in 2 1/2 years, grabbed a spot in 
today's best-of-five-sets final when she defeated Date, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentine right-hander will take on seventh-seeded Lindsay Davenport, 18, 
of Murrieta for the title and $250,000 in this season-ending event. Davenport 
advanced by defeating Mary Pierce, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the mental part has a lot to do with it," Sabatini said of her 
winless streak. "In 1990, I was mentally very focused and I played a great 
tournament, you know, at the (U.S.) Open when I won." 
</P>
<P>
 Date strained the thigh muscle in her right leg, an injury that bothered the 
Japanese right-hander.

 A strong performance by Huang Huadong on the pommel horse helped China win the 
men's title in the World Team Gymnastics Championships at Dortmund, Germany. 
China and Russia turned the meet into a two-nation duel that wasn't decided 
until the final routines. China finished with 283.333 points, with Russia 
second with 282.158. Ukraine won the bronze. . . . An all-star team headed by

South African Vuyani Bungu retained his International Boxing Federation 
junior-featherweight title by unanimous decision over Puerto Rican Felix

NASDAQ PROVIDES MANY BENEFITS TO INVESTORS, COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the chief executive of a company that could easily list on the New York 
Stock Exchange but chooses to remain on the Nasdaq Stock Market, I believe the 
benefits provided by the Nasdaq to companies and investors are many and 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' series of articles (Oct. 20-25) comparing Nasdaq and the 
traditional exchanges overlooked crucial benefits of Nasdaq as well as 
fundamental differences in the way stocks are traded in these markets. 
</P>
<P>
 A great deal of weight was given to quotation spreads as a measure of market 
quality in comparing Nasdaq and the exchanges. This is like comparing the size 
of icebergs by measuring the tips above the surface -- without regard to the 
mass underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq's growth speaks for itself: from 2 billion shares traded in 1971 to 
66.5 billion annually today, from 54% NYSE annual volume to trading volume that 
now exceeds that on the NYSE. We believe that part of our company's growth is 
attributable to the Nasdaq growth environment: In the seven years Octel has 
been a publicly traded company on Nasdaq, our revenues have gone from $40 
million to $400 million and our market capitalization from $100 million to $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, Nasdaq succeeds because it offers companies and investors the 
benefits of a totally different trading system. On an exchange, each stock, 
regardless of the company's revenue or market capitalization, has one market 
maker, the specialist. Exchange specialist firms, by and large, do no business 
with the public, conduct no research, underwrite no securities. As the name 
denotes, they are specialists who make markets in stocks on an exclusive, 
assigned basis. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nasdaq, each stock has several market makers. Octel has 28, of which 13 
trade more than 100,000 shares each in a single month. This provides 
competition for order flow in our stock which, we believe, gives our stock 
better overall liquidity and pricing to stockholders. Nasdaq market makers are 
the same 510 firms that do virtually all of the public securities business in 
this country. They provide most of the capital in the securities business, 
issue most of the reports on companies, and underwrite most of the public 
offerings. Most of our market makers have an interest in the stock and our 
industry and help their customers (stockholders) better understand when to buy 
and sell the stock. A specialist doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another reason my company -- and I suspect many others -- continues 
to favor Nasdaq. Call it a cultural affinity, if you will. Nasdaq is a market 
in a constant state of self-examination and improvement, adapting and combining 
the best features of its own system and that of the exchanges. As many of us 
have discovered, finding new ways of doing things is not only how we got where 
we are, it's how we continue to grow. Nasdaq is a huge electronic network 
designed to allow a freer, more competitive market in trading stocks. It is 
probably the structure an exchange would have if it could start over and not 
lose face. It is certainly the structure that many exchanges outside the United 
States are moving to. If the NYSE didn't have a rule that makes it very 
difficult for a listed company to switch from New York to Nasdaq (or any other 
market), which by all rights would probably be held invalid if anyone 
challenged it in a court, many NYSE companies would likely switch to Nasdaq.

CFC REPORTING MARRED BY POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article about conversion of CFC-based cooling systems ("Deep-Sixing 
CFCs," Nov. 8) was incomplete, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 The first point that needs to be made is that there is a considerable amount 
of doubt as to whether or not man-made CFCs have any significant effect on 
atmospheric ozone levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the jury is still out as to whether or not the variations in the ozone 
level are natural cycles, normal variations or the beginning of a trend; there 
is no scientific consensus on this. In fact, there is a growing movement to 
refute the ozone hole theory in general. 
</P>
<P>
 While you may not agree with it, you should mention it nonetheless to ensure a 
balanced story. Likewise, the potential for HFC-134a to contribute to the 
alleged-potential "greenhouse effect" is similarly debatable; there is no 
scientific consensus here, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, the full costs of conversion were never fully stated; they are 
considerably higher than what was mentioned. With questionable, if any, 
benefits to be derived from conversion, many of us feel these costs are 
unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times must come to realize that the EPA and environmental groups are not 
always right; this has been proven both in legal and scientific arenas. The 
Times' responsibility to report balanced and complete information should not 
ever be compromised by political correctness.

SIMPLE TAX RATE CHANGE WILL STIMULATE SAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "GOP Poised to Cut Capital Gains Tax -- and Clinton Could Join It" (Nov. 
11), columnist Tom Petruno discusses the possibility and benefits of a cut in 
the long-term capital gains tax rate. It appears to me that the primary 
deterrent to such action is that some people would consider it to be a reward 
for wealthy (Democrat and Republican) political interests. 
</P>
<P>
 An obvious and fair way to create this economic stimulus would be to make a 
simple change in the income tax math. The first $25,000 of net long-term 
capital gains would be subjected to a specific tax rate of, say, 10%. This 
amount would be indexed to protect against future inflation. All other parts of 
the calculation would be unchanged (with or without the present 28% cap). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the IRS would lose $4,500 on a few returns, the "wheeler-dealers" 
would see little benefit, while average working people would find a strong 
incentive for saving through serious investment. Of course, such a policy would 
have to contain the expectation of being permanent (unlike the betrayal of the 
"workers' $2,000 IRA"). Over a few years, the impact on the economy would be 
truly dramatic.

 Tom Petruno addresses cuts in capital gains taxes as a means to create jobs: 
More private investment creates more private sector jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the above were true, we would not have passed through a multiyear recession 
while the market hit record highs and volumes. As a dabbler in finance, I 
suspect the money firms raised on their offerings went to pay debt acquired in 
the "merger mania" '80s. Little went to expand capital investment and create 
jobs. Instead, companies desperate for shareholders cut personnel to 
streamline. 
</P>
<P>
 The real question is: Will a capital gains cut lead to another deep recession?

WORKWEEKS SHOULD PEAK ON WEDNESDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since increasing productivity is one of the best ways to be competitive, it is 
in every business interest to "Find the Week that Works" (Nov. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 The article outlines several alternative workweek ideas. I have one more 
solution to add to the list, which I call the "efficient schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees work the following schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: 7 hours 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: 8 1/2 hours 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: 9 1/2 hours 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: 9 hours 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: 6 hours 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that Monday has long been one of the least productive days 
and the one with the most absenteeism. By letting employees arrive an hour 
later, a business is in a better position to have workers who are refreshed and 
ready to work. Also, if an employee does miss work, the employer does not lose 
an entire workday. The employees will appreciate being able to sleep in to 
shake off those Monday morning blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees will be motivated to work on Tuesday because they will be fresh from 
a shorter Monday workday and they will feel that working the extra half an hour 
is only slightly longer than a "normal" workday. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have also shown that Wednesday is the most productive workday. By 
having the employees work longer, the business will be able to tap into that 
higher productivity for a long time. The employees will not notice the longer 
time because it will only be one hour longer than the day before and they will 
know that it is "hump" day and that the rest of the week will be all downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees will figure out that they should use their sick or personal days on 
Wednesday to get a longer day off. The employer will have to create a reward 
for the employees if they do not take off on Wednesday, such as getting an 
extra day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees will work efficiently on Thursday because they will be looking 
toward a shorter day on Friday and will know that they can leave work sooner 
than they did the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Fridays will also be efficient because the employees will be looking forward 
to getting their weekend started sooner than they have been used to, and the 
day will seem extremely short because of the perception from the previous 
longer days. Fridays have traditionally been the second-most missed day of 
work, so if any employee takes off, the employer does not lose an entire 
workday. 
</P>
<P>
 By implementing an efficiently scheduled workweek, a business can expect 
higher profits, which means it can, in turn, pay higher wages to its employees.

MOVIES; HIGH ATOP MOUNT GOOFINESS; WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING AN UNLIKELY PREMISE

<P>
 Surrounded by recumbent grips and gaffers, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny 
DeVito are perusing a bookcase's worth of X-rated videos between takes on the 
set of "Junior." Modeled after a fertility clinic, the sprawling set, crammed 
onto a sound stage on the Universal lot, is rigged with an antechamber for 
sperm donors that the movie's cast and crew have dubbed the Masturbatorium and 
turned into an unofficial lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see," DeVito says puckishly, scanning titles such as "Triple Header" 
and "Double the Pleasure." "Seen it, seen it, seen it. . . ." Schwarzenegger, 
dressed in a pink maternity smock that bulges over a prosthetic stomach, 
chuckles grimly and puffs on a stubby cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 In a moment the actors will venture down the hall to another set, where 
Schwarzenegger, his character "pregnant" with an embryo implanted in his 
abdomen by research partner DeVito, will explore the presumably fertile comic 
possibilities of a man going into labor. But for now, there is only the 
desultory kibitzing that makes a day on a movie set seem like a hitch in the 
peacetime Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the director is ready, and the entire surreal assemblage -- towering 
pink-clad former bodybuilder, riotously diminutive co-star and slumping union 
brethren -- disappears in a cloud of cigar smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, arguably, only one director likely to gather such unlikely 
characters around an equally unlikely premise. And while this director hasn't 
earned an Oscar, his films have grossed more than $2 billion at the box office 
and permeated the pop-cultural consciousness to the point that, right here on 
the shelves of the Masturbatorium, there's a porn homage to his most successful 
movie, evocatively dubbed "Sexbusters." 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I get attracted to difficult premises," Ivan Reitman says 
with a shrug, settling into his director's chair as Schwarzenegger, DeVito, 
co-star Emma Thompson and a gaggle of supporting actors take their places. "I 
mean, they're somewhat gimmicky: Ghosts exist and you can zap them; Arnold and 
Danny are twins; a man who looks like the President takes over and does a 
better job. But I try as hard as I can to find a level of reality in the 
fantastic premises that I latch onto." 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, Reitman rattles off this resume without mentioning any titles. He 
doesn't need to. You may not have seen "Ghostbusters" (1984) or "Twins" (1988) 
or "Dave" (1993), but their stories and characters have had an uncanny way of 
burrowing into the cultural topsoil, there to sprout catch phrases, ancillary 
toy lines, hit singles, talk-show debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to those films, as well as "Meatballs" (1979), "Stripes" (1981), 
"Kindergarten Cop" (1990) and hits such as "National Lampoon's Animal House" 
(1978) and "Beethoven" (1992), which he produced, the 48-year-old Reitman, a 
Czech refugee and Canadian expatriate, enjoys a level of discretion available 
to few directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, he moved his Northern Lights production company into an imposing 
compound on the Universal lot within hailing distance of fellow zillionaire 
Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. Rather than fret over the availability 
of his favorite film editor and sometime associate producer, Sheldon Kahn, he 
simply put him on the Northern Lights payroll. And it was Reitman who helped 
pioneer the practice of having stars trade huge upfront salaries for a 
percentage of a film's box-office take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's one of the few people capable of being a really excellent movie 
director one day and running a studio the next," says producer Sean Daniels, 
who as a young Universal Pictures executive worked with Reitman developing 
"Animal House." "He understands this bizarre combination of entertainment and 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman's financial acumen has, to his frustration, tended to obscure his 
filmmaker credentials.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am not confused at all about this one," producer Julia Phillips sniped 
about Reitman in her scorched-earth Hollywood memoir, "You'll Never Eat Lunch 
in This Town Again." "He is a businessman, not an artist." 
</P>
<P>
 "Comments like that really hurt a lot," Reitman admits. "I think I am a 
businessman, in terms of I'm not a fool with regard to how the business works. 
But setting all that aside, when I start on a film, from the moment I start 
working on a screenplay to the last point of editing, it's really an intensive 
creative endeavor. The films I've made are pretty complicated and have worked 
for a number of creative reasons, and I'm very proud of them. Since 'Twins' and 
'Dave,' there's been a kind of grudging respect." 
</P>
<P>
 That tide may be turning, even if "Junior" has more in common with "Twins" 
than the more cerebral "Dave." "I think after 'Dave' people took him a lot more 
seriously," says one of Reitman's contemporaries. "That was a huge step 
forward, both creatively and as an artist." 
</P>
<P>
 While no one would confuse "Meatballs" or even "Dave" with a Merchant Ivory 
production, Reitman does bring a gloss of sophistication to the sort of 
mainstream populist comedies that can gross upward of $100 million. And in a 
field strewn with tortured would-be auteurs , Reitman is by all accounts 
precise, organized and workmanlike. A former musician, he obsesses about tone, 
rhythm and pacing. The upshot is Reitman's better films click along with the 
sureness of a metronome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like working with him because he has his act together," Schwarzenegger 
says. "He's well prepared. He gives you the feeling: OK, he's not frantic, not 
worried, everything is mapped out, he knows what he wants to do. That's a big 
advantage, unlike some other directors." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's sharp as a needle," adds Thompson, who cut her teeth in rough-and-tumble 
British sketch comedies before perfecting early 20th-Century ennui in "Howards 
End" and "The Remains of the Day." "Comedy directing is the hardest, because 
you tread that line between engaging the audience with story and character, and 
making them laugh. It's a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Once known to sic packs of writers on problematic scripts -- such as the 
misbegotten 1986 Robert Redford-Debra Winger vehicle "Legal Eagles," Reitman's 
first attempt to appeal to more mature sensibilities -- Reitman has tended to 
work closely with one or two writers on his most recent projects. On "Dave," 
for example, Reitman used only Oscar-nominated screenwriter Gary Ross ("Big"), 
who wrote the original script. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found him very sensitive to the aspirations of the material," Ross says. 
"'Dave' is very difficult. You're trying several things at once -- a political 
satire with a fantastic premise that needs to be rooted in reality. (Reitman) 
was amazingly thoughtful and inclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years Reitman has also learned to tickle, rather than bludgeon, 
laughs from the absurdist premises that form the backbone of most of his films. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting the tone for "Junior," Reitman says, "was a very delicate thing. 
Because you can so easily go into farce with this." Instead, the film's best 
moments come from juxtaposing Schwarzenegger's bodybuilder physique and 
Teutonic bearing with a feminine awareness of the physical and emotional swings 
of pregnancy. At one point he turns to a smitten Thompson, who is unaware of 
his condition, and pleads with wide-eyed sincerity: "Does my body disgust you?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Reitman's satiric edge is countered by a sentimental streak, manifested in 
"Junior" with lingering, dewy close-ups of newborns and beaming parents. The 
combination of anarchy and treacle can be found in the director himself, who 
relished developing the authority-tweaking "Animal House" but insists that "I 
couldn't make a film with despicable people." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have villains," Reitman says, "but my movies have the kind of people we'd 
all like to be. Go back to any of my films -- even with a rascal like Bill 
Murray (in "Meatballs," "Stripes" and the two "Ghostbusters") -- and you know 
when you get right down to the bottom there's a good person there with the 
right heart who's going to do the right thing at the right time.  
</P>
<P>
 "I could never make a movie like 'Short Cuts' or the (Quentin) Tarantino 
movies. They're great films but have a very black outlook on life. My outlook 
is the opposite. I keep looking for that thread of decency that keeps us as 
humans special." 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman pulls off a pair of headphones and regards the tableau before him: 
cameras, snaking cords and literally expectant characters. To his left, Aida 
Turturro, James Eckhouse and Pamela Reed, who plays DeVito's ex-wife, hugely 
pregnant and slumped in a wheelchair, wait for Reitman's cue to enter. DeVito, 
Schwarzenegger and Thompson huddle behind a wall, ready to burst in from a side 
entrance. The scene about to be shot is part of "Junior's" climax, and though 
it will last no more than 15 seconds in the final cut, Reitman has spent much 
of the morning blocking the cameras and actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is basically a Marx Brothers scene," Reitman says, grazing from a plate 
of watermelon chunks. The crux of it is the discovery of the male-pregnancy 
experiment by DeVito's gynecology partner, played by Eckhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman pulls the headphones on and stares intently at a video monitor. 
"Action!" 
</P>
<P>
 DeVito, Thompson and Schwarzenegger stumble onto the set; Eckhouse and Reed, 
wheeled in by Turturro, enter from stage right. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is going on?" whines Eckhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up, up, out of here," DeVito huffs, shooing Reed from the wheelchair and 
depositing in it the grimacing Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hurry!" bleats Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman hunches forward in his chair, nodding in time to the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our patient," DeVito sputters at Eckhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean, 'patient' -- what's wrong with him?" 
</P>
<P>
 "My best guess," DeVito says, "is that his baby's tangled in the large 
intestine." 
</P>
<P>
 "His baby ?" Eckhouse gasps, as the entourage scrabbles for the door. "Oh my 
God . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cut." Reitman pulls off the headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim?" he addresses Eckhouse, "that's too big." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene rolls out again and again, identical except for Eckhouse's changing 
the inflections of "Oh," "God" and "baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally: "Cut. Print that. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman pulls off his headphones and confers with the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's do one more," he says, turning from the monitor. "Something wonderful 
might happen, and I have to give us the opportunity to discover that . . . and, 
action ." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing apparently more or less wonderful than the previous 11 takes reveals 
itself. "All my focus was on Jim and getting that moment right," Reitman 
explains, "because that's where the laugh is." 
</P>
<P>
 DeVito plunks himself into Reitman's chair and regards veteran director of 
photography Adam Greenberg. "Lighting's good, Adam," he needles Greenberg, an 
Academy Award nominee ("Terminator 2"). "You've got a future, Adam." 
</P>
<P>
 Is DeVito enjoying the filming? "Yeah, yeah, having a good time," he mutters. 
"It's always a good time." What does he think of Reitman? "He's a very good 
director." What distinguishes Reitman from the other directors that DeVito -- a 
director himself -- has worked with? 
</P>
<P>
 DeVito bristles, as if Jim Ignatowski has asked him to make change for the 
coffee machine on "Taxi." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's Canadian." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Czechoslovakia, Reitman was barely 5 when his father and mother, an 
Auschwitz survivor, smuggled the family out of the country in the hold of a 
tugboat. They eventually settled in Toronto. "I remember learning to speak 
(English) very quickly," Reitman says, though a few Canadianisms -- he 
pronounces been as bean -- linger in his sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman attended McMaster University in Hamilton, outside Toronto, around the 
same time as Martin Short, Dave Thomas, Eugene Levy and other young comics, 
some of whom would go on to form the seminal SCTV troupe. Soon, an entire 
generation of Canadian talents -- among them Dan Aykroyd, John Candy and 
"Saturday Night Live" producer Lorne Michaels -- would set the tone for comedy 
in movies and television for much of the '70s and '80s.  
</P>
<P>
 Reitman, who would later find himself in the thick of them producing a 
National Lampoon stage show in New York in 1974 that would metamorphose into 
"Animal House," instinctively grasped the withering irony of their humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens with Canadians, suffering from a national inferiority complex 
from the day they're born, is that they become great voyeurs of life -- 
standing back and watching. I have this sort of odd combination: the optimism 
of a refugee and the odd, ironic cynicism of a Canadian who is sort of 
commenting on things all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 While at McMaster, Reitman directed a comedy short, "The Orientation," which 
was packaged with the 1969 Dustin Hoffman feature "John and Mary" in Canadian 
theaters. ("Frankly, it got way more laughs than 'John and Mary' did," Reitman 
chuckles.) 
</P>
<P>
 Flush with the film's warm reception, Reitman and some college chums raised 
enough money to produce a feature-length film, "Cannibal Girls," which Reitman 
directed after graduation and sold to producer Samuel Arkoff. He then produced 
several low-budget films for director David Cronenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Cannibal Girls' was a mess," Reitman says. "I realized I knew nothing about 
directing. But in retrospect, I wish I'd kept doing that -- I would have had 
three or four other films. This whole producing thing just got in the way. I 
learned an awful lot, but it's not what's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 What drove Reitman back to directing was "Animal House." "I had worked real 
hard on it, developing the script and getting John Belushi and all those 
people. I was hoping to be able to direct it myself, but it was very hard for 
the studio to go with me. (John) Landis had just finished 'Kentucky Fried 
Movie,' which was a big hit, and he did a wonderful job. But it was clear I was 
going to get no creative credit for it, and did not, except retrospectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman could console himself somewhat because, as a producer of the film, 
"probably individually, I made the most money from that movie of anybody. 
(Landis) was on a small deal, and John Belushi was paid $60,000 for his part. 
So I got none of the credit for the movie, but I got the lion's share of the 
income. Actually, Universal got the lion's share. I got a decent share." 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to direct, Reitman dragooned Hamilton buddies Dan Goldberg (still with 
Reitman, he is one of "Junior's" executive producers and directed the film's 
second unit) and writer Len Blum and, with a script polish by Harold Ramis and 
a reluctant Bill Murray playing the lead, started filming the summer-camp romp 
"Meatballs" two days before "Animal House" opened. The film was a hit, and 
launched Reitman's remarkable string of box-office success throughout the '80s 
and early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after wrapping photography on "Junior," Reitman and editor Sheldon 
Kahn sit in a darkened editing room at Northern Lights, playing and replaying a 
20-second snippet of the movie on a massive console. 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman looks exhausted. He's taken only one week off since shooting ended in 
early July, and the deadline to turn the film over to the studio by early 
November to make its Thanksgiving release seems to sit leadenly on his 
shoulders. Still, he's satisfied -- perhaps a little relieved -- with an early 
assemblage of the footage that he screened for Northern Lights employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good. It's clear there's a movie there, and the performances are 
very strong. There's also a strong emotional kick to the movie, which is what I 
was really hoping for." (It isn't always thus. At an early screening of 
"Ghostbusters II," Reitman had what he calls "a moment of exquisite focus" when 
he realized the last two reels of the movie "just died a horrible death. We 
went out and shot 25 minutes in four days to replace everything that happened 
from that moment on.") 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman and Kahn dig in. On Reel 9, they grapple for an hour trying to 
transpose an entrance by Pamela Reed to speed up a romantic pratfall by 
Schwarzenegger and Thompson at a crucial juncture in the story. "This should be 
a huge laugh and it's not yet," Reitman says ruefully. "I've got a real problem 
because of the way I've blocked the damn scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, editor Wendy Greene Bricmont is sifting through a slate of 
takes from Reel 12 in which Thompson fumblingly tries to comfort Reed, who has 
suddenly gone into labor. ("Picture a garden," Thompson soothes in a lilting 
Welsh accent, "with trees, and birds, cheep, cheep, cheep. . . .") Here, the 
problem is more insidious. All of the takes are funny, but funny in different 
ways. Reitman must choose. "This is what makes you crazy -- too much wealth, 
and how do you spend it?" 
</P>
<P>
 And so goes the rest of Reitman's summer, cocooned in the sleek silver 
compound financed by some of the most profitable comedies ever made. As a rule, 
films that gross more than $100 million -- films such as "Ghostbusters" and 
"Twins" -- must play to a demographically immense audience. Does Reitman, then, 
consciously choose projects that will somehow satisfy the entertainment 
cravings of everyone from sullen mall rats to doting seniors? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very fortunate that my films have played over the broadest spectrum 
of age," Reitman says. "Everybody loved 'Twins,' 'Ghostbusters,' even 'Dave.' 
(But) I don't think of an audience. I place myself in every moment of every 
scene that I do. It's the only gauge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seek," declares the highest-grossing comedy director of his generation, 
"only to please myself."

THE TOAST OF NEW YORK? (OR WILL HE BE JUST TOAST?); THE L.A. PHILHARMONIC 
HASN'T PLAYED THE BIG APPLE IN FOUR YEARS, AND NEVER WITH ESA-PEKKA SALONEN. 
NEITHER CONDUCTOR NOR ORCHESTRA HAS EVER BEEN THE TOAST OF THE TOWN, SO WHAT 
MAKES THEM THINK NEXT WEEK WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT?

 The Los Angeles Philharmonic comes to Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall next 
week, its first visit to New York in four years and its first trip here with 
its music director, Esa-Pekka Salonen. Once more, the orchestra joins the great 
New York musical jostle for recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade of orchestras visiting New York this season has already included 
the Boston Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra (both of which offer short 
seasons here), the Pittsburgh Symphony, the St. Louis Symphony, the Houston 
Symphony, Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal, along with orchestras from St. 
Petersburg, London, Osaka, Weimar, Wales and Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 And the season is only 2 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to come are dozens more orchestras, from Oslo to Austria, from 
Cincinnati to Costa Rica. They come because the record business is still based 
here, because the music management companies are here, and because New York 
reviews help sell tickets and please boards at home.

 Many orchestras make regular annual visits, coming here with their own 
well-oiled publicity machines operating at full tilt, and they get additional 
publicity support from either Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall -- the two major 
New York concert venues. Some even hire private local public relations firms 
for further hype expertise. The competition for attention is steep, and New 
York, of course, has its own several orchestras, including two world-class ones 
-- the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, can any single orchestra -- or at least any orchestra that is not 
the Vienna Philharmonic or the Concertgebouw -- really make much of an impact 
in such a climate? Especially given the fact that space in the local newspapers 
and magazines (all of which have reduced classical music coverage, some 
drastically, in recent years) is at a premium. The fight (and it really has 
become just that) for big audiences has become tougher than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which hasn't performed in New York for four 
years, compete? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently it can and will. A surprising amount of attention seems to surround 
the upcoming appearances in Fisher Hall next Sunday and Nov. 28, since they 
will be not only the orchestra's first New York appearances under Esa-Pekka 
Salonen but the start of an annual pilgrimage by the orchestra and its music 
director to Lincoln Center. Both the New Yorker and the New York Times, the two 
most influential publications in town, have commissioned pieces on Salonen. If 
anything is likely to produce a buzz, such a rare double publicity whammy 
should. 
</P>
<P>
 But what makes this interest especially noteworthy is the fact that New York 
has in recent years not shown much enthusiasm for the Philharmonic, for its 
previous three music directors, for other conductors closely associated with 
it, or for Salonen. Andre Previn, who lives in nearby Westchester County, is 
now a regular in New York, guest conducting the New York Philharmonic and 
Orchestra of St. Luke's, appearing in chamber music, but he tends to generate 
cool respect and is no longer a hot box-office draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlo Maria Giulini, however beloved internationally, never had much of a 
presence in New York. Zubin Mehta, who left the Los Angeles Philharmonic to 
become music director of the New York Philharmonic, remained here for 13 years, 
after which time the press had become decidedly hostile toward him, and the 
orchestra, itself, dispirited. Although Mehta is not regularly invited back to 
conduct the New York Philharmonic, he does return regularly with the Israel 
Philharmonic, and he does retain a public. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has the Los Angeles Philharmonic had much better luck with former 
principal guest conductors who toured with it. Simon Rattle, one of the most 
admired conductors in Europe and elsewhere in the United States, has conducted 
little in New York, and his couple of appearances with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic or his own highly regarded City of Birmingham Orchestra did not 
leave a lasting impression. Michael Tilson Thomas, once a regular in the city, 
now seldom appears. Kurt Sanderling, much revered in Los Angeles and Europe, 
was somewhat dismissed in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen, himself, has not had any better luck in New York. He, too, has 
practically no presence here, outside of his recordings. Eight years ago he 
guest conducted the New York Philharmonic, generated no sparks, and was not 
invited back. Three seasons ago, Salonen returned with the Swedish Radio 
Orchestra to no better acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salonen has little to say about such matters: "I am looking forward to 
returning to New York, especially since these will be the first concerts I 
conduct in New York with the Los Angeles Philharmonic," he cautiously remarked 
during a break between rehearsals with the orchestra last week. "I know the 
players anticipate our New York concerts, and the prospect of returning 
regularly in the future to play for New York audiences is especially appealing 
for both them and me." 
</P>
<P>
 It is never clear why a city as complex and chaotic as New York acts the way 
it does, whether in matters of politics, social attitudes, eating habits, 
fashion trends or the arts. But this time, several factors in play seem to have 
the potential to change New York's outlook on the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is canny planning on the orchestra's part. "We've purposely waited 
with Esa-Pekka until he and the orchestra have had time to settle down and get 
to know each other," explains Ernest Fleischmann, managing director of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a strategy that appears likely to work, given the fact that New York is 
hungry for exciting young conductors. Last year both Kent Nagano and Russian 
conductor Valery Gergiev had startling successes, although in previous seasons 
they had not attracted nearly such attention. Many have their eyes on Franz 
Welser-Most. 
</P>
<P>
 Among established conductors, Colin Davis, on the rare occasions he can be 
enticed here, is a much-admired figure, and so, too, is Pierre Boulez, now that 
a couple of decades have passed since his troubled music directorship of the 
New York Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, it is hard to find a conductor, young or old, who is much of 
a draw -- more often it is the orchestra, soloist or repertoire that attracts 
the main attention. Moreover, while sophisticated New Yorkers might like to 
think themselves aloof from some of Salonen's more obvious attractions -- his 
youth and good looks -- they have been known to be seduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen will also have some of the same advantages that Nagano, Gergiev and 
Welser-Most have had, namely an aggressive push from his record company, Sony 
Classical. Unlike many American cities, the New York audience for concerts and 
recordings overlaps, and Salonen comes to town with many acclaimed recordings 
with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sony has released two new compact discs to coincide with the 
tour, including the premiere recording of Witold Lutoslawski's Fourth Symphony, 
which will be getting its New York premiere. Sony will also actively promote 
Salonen, including throwing a luncheon to introduce him to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischmann also has had some good luck on his side this time around. It so 
happens that the two Philharmonic dates -- the Sunday and Monday following 
Thanksgiving -- offer few conflicts to music lovers or press. There are no 
important events at Carnegie Hall at that time. At Lincoln Center, in the 
smaller Alice Tully Hall, the popular American soprano Sylvia McNair offers a 
recital at the same time as the Philharmonic's Sunday matinee; Monday night the 
Metropolitan Opera performs "Don Giovanni," but it is not a new production or a 
first night. 
</P>
<P>
 This really is sheer luck. The Philharmonic's two-week tour -- which begins in 
Mexico City on Tuesday, moves on to Washington Saturday night, and follows New 
York with four days in Florida -- is planned, according to Fleischmann, because 
Thanksgiving tends to be a slow time at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
Moreover, December, while always the slowest month for visiting orchestras in 
New York, is unusually uncluttered this year (only the Oslo Symphony at 
Carnegie Hall), which means that if the Philharmonic makes a good impression, 
it is likely to be better remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 But what may also most affect the Philharmonic's reception is that New York 
itself is a changed town from what it once was. Both the New York Times and the 
New Yorker have changed chief music critics since the last time the 
Philharmonic was in town, and both have shown considerable interest in the 
Philharmonic. The Times' Edward Rothstein has traveled to Los Angeles the past 
two seasons to review the orchestra (although neither time when Salonen was 
conducting), and the New Yorker's Paul Griffiths has also spent time in Los 
Angeles preparing his piece on Salonen. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a sampling of past New York Times Philharmonic reviews indicates 
that they have not been all that harsh, simply a bit lackluster. For instance, 
when the Philharmonic last visited New York, it had a prestigious date, the 
opening concert of Carnegie's 100th season. Donal Henahan, then the chief Times 
critic, wrote that performances under Previn were "hardly different from what 
might be encountered from a visiting orchestra on almost any night during an 
ordinary Carnegie season" but seemed a bit pallid only because this was 
supposed to be a gala occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years earlier, Peter G. Davis, now music critic for New York magazine, 
wrote that "excellent though it may be in many departments, (the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic) is not a virtuoso orchestra." It was good enough, however, for 
Davis to find in a performance of Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique," under Giulini, 
that "expressive intensity was achieved with utmost discretion and fastidious 
attention to detail." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York press is not, in fact, really quite so tough as its reputation. 
Very few reviews of any major orchestra are outright pans. But while those 
reviews may sound just fine at home, many in New York view a modest success as 
no success at all, since it will do nothing to make an orchestra stand out from 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a myth that there is, particularly these days, a unified voice or 
attitude in the press. But too much hype always presents a danger. If a major 
publication takes too emphatic a stand, it is a sure bet that some other 
publication will find the need to react to that . 
</P>
<P>
 And New York would hardly be New York if it didn't push its visitors around, 
at least a little. It is no secret that Previn and the Philharmonic did not 
part amicably, so could it be just a coincidence that at McNair's Tully 
recital, the same hour as the Philharmonic's Sunday concert, the soprano will 
sing the premiere of four new songs by Previn to texts of Nobel Laureate Toni 
Morrison? 
</P>

p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall, New York.

MOVIES; A HERO OF ANOTHER FASHION; IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW A FILM LIKE 'SCHINDLER'S 
LIST,' AND LIAM NEESON TOOK HIS TIME DECIDING ON HIS NEXT ROLE. WHEN HE DID, IT 
WAS ANOTHER HERO: 18TH-CENTURY SCOTSMAN ROB ROY.

<P>
 Talk about a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 When you've starred in a hugely serious, consciousness-raising film like 
"Schindler's List," the most praised movie of our times, and won an Oscar 
nomination for your efforts, what do you do next? Come to that, what do you do 
for the rest of your life? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think Liam Neeson didn't ponder hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited a whole year before committing to anything," he says. " 'Schindler's 
List' was a curse and a blessing in that respect. Every script that came my 
way, I was comparing it to 'Schindler's List.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing that film made me aware of the importance of what you say on a 20-foot 
screen that 20 million people are going to see. There's a responsibility. It's 
not that I wanted to play good guys all the time. But it made me wary of doing 
a piece of trash just because it had a large budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that there's anything wrong with entertainment, and Hollywood will churn 
that out regardless. It's just that I was suddenly made aware of the 
responsibility I have as an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 He is telling me this in unlikely circumstances -- dressed in plaid and a 
kilt, with a hairpiece to enhance his already straggly mane. You see, what 
Neeson did next, in the wake of the adulation over the Holocaust-themed 
"Schindler's List," was to choose a substantially lighter piece of work -- the 
title role in "Rob Roy," a United Artists movie about the legendary 
18th-Century Scottish hero immortalized in the novel by Sir Walter Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only in recent weeks, since starting work on "Rob Roy," that Neeson says 
he has felt able to move forward from "Schindler's List," accept his part in 
the film as a defining experience and recognize that such a role might never 
come his way again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I was shooting it, I knew it was going to be special, and it was a 
story that needed telling," he mused. "Leaving aside the joy of working with a 
great master like Steven Spielberg, it was Hollywood at its best, a team of 
workers at their peak doing something unique. We all knew it was special, but 
we didn't have a sense it would become the event it did. It seemed to touch the 
psyche of the whole world. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a side of you that thinks, well, perhaps I've stepped into another 
league now, as regards how I'm viewed in Hollywood. Yet in a way that was 
bastardizing what we'd done in 'Schindler's List,' you know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He was not alone in his dilemma. His "Schindler's List" co-stars Ralph Fiennes 
and Ben Kingsley also voiced concerns that other films would inevitably seem 
anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralph and Ben and I spent a long time talking about it," Neeson recalled. 
"We'd say, 'What has Steven created here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Fiennes was quick off the mark, accepting the role of 
Charles van Doren in "Quiz Show," a script he greatly admired, before he had 
even finished "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsley waited several months, until after the release of "Schindler's List," 
before agreeing to a role in Roman Polanski's adaptation of the acclaimed play 
"Death and the Maiden." 
</P>
<P>
 Neeson himself had already made a commitment before being exposed to the 
Schindler experience. He plays a North Carolina country doctor in the Christmas 
release "Nell," which stars Jodie Foster and Natasha Richardson, whom he 
married earlier this year (the couple recently announced they are expecting a 
child early next year). 
</P>
<P>
 But around the time "Schindler's List" was released to such a rapturous 
reception, it became clear to Neeson that having been a part of the movie had 
changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in New York when the film came out, walking along the street, and an 
old man came meandering toward me. I stopped out of deference to his age. He 
was obviously Jewish. He shook my hand, and there were tears in his eyes. And 
he said, 'Thank you for saving my people.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That incident really got to me. It made me realize what an impact you have if 
you're a film actor. It's different if you're playing, say, Batman, but this 
was serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Neeson thinks he might well have been mentally immobilized by such 
considerations but for a conversation he had around this time with MCA 
President Sid Sheinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sid said to me, 'Look, a "Schindler's List" comes along maybe every 30 
years,' " Neeson recalled. "He said, 'Now you have to get on with the rest of 
your life.' And it's right, it's a good philosophy. Films like that do only 
come up every so often, and you can't wait for them." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was that Neeson read the script of "Rob Roy," by Scots-born screenwriter 
Alan Sharp ("Ulzana's Raid," "Night Moves") and immediately liked it. "I 
attached myself, and suddenly there was a green light straight away," he said 
appreciatively. "No shilly-shallying." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Rob Roy," due next year, is a swashbuckling romantic adventure yarn 
far removed from the terrors depicted in "Schindler's List," Neeson insists: 
"The story has great moral dignity. The word honor is written all the way 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 His character, Rob Roy, head of the McGregor clan, finds himself embroiled in 
an enmity between the dukes of Argyll and Montrose at a time in Scottish 
history when many Highland clans were Catholic and resentful of English rule; 
their loyalties lay instead with James Stuart, a pretender to the English 
throne. In Sharp's story, Rob's wife is raped, his home burned to the ground 
and his fellow clansmen murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 "These clans, you know," reflected Neeson, "they were people who if they made 
a verbal oath, they were bonded by it. They accepted the responsibility of it. 
Rob Roy is part rogue, part romantic hero, but he's a man of his word. So it 
was attractive to play a character like that." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused to mull this over. "Plus it's great to dress up in kilts," he said, 
eyes twinkling. 
</P>
<P>
 Neeson has been joined in the "Rob Roy" cast by Jessica Lange, who plays his 
wife, Mary; Tim Roth as a villainous hired swordsman, and Eric Stoltz as a 
lieutenant to Rob Roy. The film is being directed by another Scot, Michael 
Caton-Jones ("Memphis Belle," "This Boy's Life"), whose association with Neeson 
stretches back 15 years to when Neeson occasionally visited Britain's National 
Film and Television School near London, where Caton-Jones was a student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go up there, sometimes with (director) Stephen Frears, just for the day," 
Neeson remembered. "Michael and I dabbled a couple of times together, me as an 
actor, he as a student. Even then I thought he had something." 
</P>
<P>
 Caton-Jones for his part is relieved the film has an authentically Celtic 
flavor: "It's written and directed by Scotsmen, it's shot in Scotland and it 
stars a Celt," he said. "Liam's the preeminent Celtic actor in Hollywood along 
with Sean Connery, and he's the only one who could play Rob Roy with this sort 
of conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Neeson was actually born and raised in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, which is 
only 100 miles away from Ft. William as the crow flies: "All this seems 
familiar to me," he noted, looking around at the mountainous scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something very easy about working with Liam," Jessica Lange said. "I 
felt an instant familiarity. It's not hard to imagine being in love with him or 
married to him. Sometimes you get on stage or screen with an actor and you 
think -- there's no way in hell I'd be with him in a million years! You can't 
say that about Liam." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Neeson's handsome features and impressive frame (he is 6 feet, 4 
inches tall) make him look daunting even in an anachronistic kilt and plaid. 
The locals here have been turning up to watch exterior sequences being filmed 
and it is clear Neeson is very much the main attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular day he has arrived on the set for an interior shot inside a 
studio converted from a whiskey distillery. It is only a wordless head shot in 
front of a cascading waterfall in which Rob Roy conveys a sense of powerful 
forces being marshaled against him and his family; but Neeson has taken the 
trouble to don clansman's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have felt a bit of a cheat if I hadn't," he confessed. "I couldn't have 
gone in just like this (he indicates the denim shirt and jeans he has now 
changed into) and thrown a tartan over my shoulder. It was a tight shot, but a 
demanding shot emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has determined how to proceed with his career, his next project is 
lined up. In February he starts shooting "Before and After," a film to be 
directed by Barbet Schroeder, also starring Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a family suspense drama," he said. "In it, Meryl and I have two 
children, and our teen-age boy is accused of murder. It's about how we all 
react to that, and how the rest of the community reacts to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Classy company, he is told. "I know," Neeson muttered. "My God, here I am with 
Jessica, and next it's on to Lady Meryl. It doesn't get much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Surely he must have a sense that things are going his way? "Well, yeah," 
Neeson, who is usually resistant to talking about career patterns, said with a 
sigh. "I suppose I could say, 'Well, I've paid my dues,' but in general, of 
course, it's wonderful what's happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm only glad it happened when I was 40, as opposed to when I was 19 1/2 -- 
essentially because you can cope with it better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got considerable experience now, so it's great to have the chance to 
improve on it."

ART; LABORING UNDER NO ILLUSIONS; PRATAPADITYA PAL HAS BUILT ONE OF THIS 
COUNTRY'S PREEMINENT COLLECTIONS OF INDIAN AND SOUTHEAST ASIAN ARTWORKS AT 
LACMA. DO WE APPRECIATE HIM? WELL, HE'S PRETTY REALISTIC ABOUT POPULAR ACCLAIM.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ph.D.s. Twenty-two major museum exhibitions. Two hundred fifty-seven 
publications. Nineteen editorships. Six professional appointments. Eight 
university teaching positions. Twenty fellowships and awards. Too many lectures 
to count. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratapaditya Pal's resume reads like a committee's lifetime work, but the 
credits all belong to one man, the senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian 
art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. What's more, Pal's curriculum 
vitae doesn't even mention his most visible legacy: a collection that he built 
from a handful of items to about 4,000 pieces, giving LACMA one of the nation's 
preeminent holdings of Indian and Southeast Asian art. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is quite staggering to see what we have done," Pal says. "If you 
gave me $30 million or $40 million to put this collection together today, I 
couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Casting his net wider to emphasize this unheralded aspect of Southern 
California's cultural wealth, Pal says: "If we put our collection and the 
Norton Simon collection -- which I also helped to build -- together with the 
Edward Binney collections of paintings at the San Diego Museum of Art and at 
our museum, without question this would be absolutely the No. 1 place in 
America for the No. 1 collection of art from India, Southeast Asia, Nepal and 
Tibet." 
</P>
<P>
 Having played a lead role in amassing these riches is enormously satisfying, 
the 59-year-old curator says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But whether the city knows about it or not, and whether they appreciate it or 
not is another matter," he says. "One day maybe they will, 100 years after I'm 
gone, which is OK. It's all right. You can't expect instant rewards." 
</P>
<P>
 Within museum circles, however, Pal is no secret treasure. Earl A. (Rusty) 
Powell III, who directed LACMA for 12 years before taking over the helm at the 
National Gallery of Art in Washington, praises Pal's intellect and talent: 
"He's very gifted, he's a great scholar, and he has worked with donors to build 
the premier collection of its kind in the country. His is a rarefied field, and 
he's at the top of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching his 25th year at LACMA and having recently organized the museum's 
critically acclaimed exhibition "The Peaceful Liberators: Jain Art From India" 
(which runs through Jan. 22), Pal is in the limelight. And he is delighted that 
the art of a little-known religious sect -- whose pacifist devotees believe 
that every living creature has an immortal soul -- is getting so much 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am putting Jain art on the map," he says. "No major exhibition of Jain art 
has ever been done, even in India. . . . This is the first and only major 
attempt at representing one of the great artistic traditions -- under the 
umbrella of Indian art's aesthetic tradition of course, but through the eyes of 
the Jains." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a break from welcoming out-of-town visitors and fielding inquiries 
about the show, Pal has agreed to an interview. Seated at a long table that 
serves as his desk in a loft behind the museum's Indian art galleries, he 
reflects on his career with a mixture of contentment and regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Pal is unabashedly proud of LACMA's collection and his scholarly 
accomplishments -- preserved in voluminous writings that put his less 
industrious colleagues to shame -- but far too truthful and art-world weary to 
pretend that all his ambitions and dreams have been fulfilled. As a senior 
curator in an institution he loves, he is grateful for the opportunities that 
have come his way and for friends who have faithfully supported his collecting 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't easy being a curator of Indian art in a country that has little 
interest in the subject, let alone in a city whose collectors favor 
contemporary art. Neither has it been pleasant to watch his department's 
acquisitions budget diminish -- from a high of $545,251 in 1981 to a low of 
$28,000 in 1993 -- as the museum threw its resources into expanded facilities 
during the 1980s, then tightened its belt to deal with an economic crunch in 
the early 1990s. Yet another sore point is multiculturalism, which he says is 
the subject of too much talk and too little action, not only at LACMA but 
throughout the museum community. 
</P>
<P>
 This is vintage Pal -- or Pratap, as friends call him. Gracious and witty but 
brutally frank, he is LACMA's eminence grise, resident critic and perpetual 
outsider. Pal, born in Bangladesh and educated in India and England, has 
thrived professionally as a Los Angeles County civil service employee, but he 
does not suffer the bureaucratic system gladly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in wasting time," he says, when asked how he has published so 
much without the benefit of sabbaticals. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of his career begins in 1957 at the University of Calcutta, where he 
was working on a master of arts degree in ancient Indian history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to specialize in anthropology," Pal says. "But that year they 
did not offer an anthropology course, so I had no alternative but to take fine 
arts. I did extremely well. I topped the list at the university, so I was given 
a scholarship to go for a Ph.D." 
</P>
<P>
 He earned his first doctorate in 1962 in the history of architecture in Nepal, 
then won a scholarship to Cambridge University, where he was granted a second 
doctorate, in Nepalese sculpture and painting, in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to go back to India and teach in a university," he says, "but 
I couldn't get a job. Not because there weren't jobs. There were dozens of 
university jobs. The problem was the Indian system. Things were slow. No one 
cared about looking at applications. Things just didn't move. Also some people 
may have felt threatened because I had two Ph.D.s. I may have been 
overqualified. Whatever it was, I didn't get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the British Museum in London, the University of Utrecht in the 
Netherlands and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston all made offers. Pal opted 
for Boston, which appointed him keeper of the Indian Collection. The title had 
been created for an illustrious predecessor, Ceylonese art historian Ananda 
Kentish Coomaraswamy, who died in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a prestigious opportunity for a young scholar, but Pal thought of it as 
temporary until he found employment in India. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is one of the tragedies of India," he says. "It is not very kind to 
its expatriates, who -- even if they want to go back -- are treated with 
apathy, if not hostility. I didn't leave of my own doing. I was a forced brain 
drain, you might say." 
</P>
<P>
 While working in Boston in 1969, Pal consulted with the Los Angeles County 
Museum on its first important acquisition of Indian art, 235 works from the 
Nasli and Alice Heeramaneck collection. The next year, Pal accepted LACMA 
Director Kenneth Donahue's offer to head the museum's newly created department 
of Indian and Islamic art. (Pal became acting director in 1979-80, after 
Donahue's retirement, and senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art in 
1981, after the formation of a separate department of Islamic art.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Apart from the Heeramaneck collection, the museum had nothing in Indian art 
-- maybe half a dozen or a dozen objects, of which two or three were 
interesting," Pal says. And indeed, some of his colleagues questioned his 
judgment, if not his sanity. Sherman Lee, the eminent director of the Cleveland 
Art Museum and an Asian art specialist, "reprimanded me and said it was a 
mistake, that I was taking a demotion," Pal recalls. "But to me it made no 
difference whether I stayed in Boston or Los Angeles. They are both in America 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, I felt the Boston collection had been built by Coomaraswamy, and it was 
really not going to go anywhere in terms of support . . . so I felt it would be 
more exciting to work with a new collection. And Kenneth Donahue was very 
dedicated in terms of his desires to build up the Asian collection. The 
Heeramaneck collection was his purchase, so I knew that I would get whatever 
support I could." 
</P>
<P>
 The late Franklin D. Murphy, a longtime museum trustee and Times Mirror 
director, also impressed Pal with a promise to find funds for an Indian art 
library requested by the young Indian curator. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me how much it would cost," Pal recalls. "I said $50,000, which was 
just a guess. And he said, 'Fine. On the day you join us, I will send you a 
check for $25,000, and when you have spent it I will send you another check.' 
Well, that was it. That decided me. Any institution that could make decisions 
that quickly seemed like a good place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pal came to Los Angeles with no idea of what he was getting into, he 
had enormous support in the 1970s. His major patron was longtime LACMA trustee 
Anna Bing Arnold, whose gifts helped fill in gaps in the Heeramaneck collection 
and acquire major pieces of sculpture. Back then, the museum paid big prices, 
say $300,000 or $400,000, for special pieces. In addition, Joan Palevsky bought 
the Heeramanecks' collection of Islamic art for the museum, and the Ahmanson 
Foundation helped to fund an additional purchase of West Asian art from the 
same collection. 
</P>
<P>
 One thrill for Pal was working with Norton Simon, who sought Pal's help in the 
mid-'70s when Simon began collecting Asian art for his museum in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting to help Mr. Simon," Pal says. "But -- although I didn't 
realize it at the time -- he made it increasingly difficult for (LACMA) to buy. 
He was such a potent force and such a sudden force in the market that I think . 
. . he was the most important influence in upping the price of Indian art." 
</P>
<P>
 In these days of tightened budgets, many curators across the country are 
required to raise their own acquisitions funds and court donors more actively 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every curator in every department has the same problem," Pal says. "You find 
an object and then you try to identify who can be seduced by it. . . . I would 
say that has been the greatest stress in my 24 years." Today he counts on 
personal friends such as New York collector Paul F. Walter to donate artworks 
and on LACMA patrons Harry and Yvonne Lenart to provide cash for acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning appreciation for Indian art has been difficult, Pal says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, I would have probably felt bad about it," he says, "But now 
when I think of the narrow parameters within which Los Angeles collectors 
collect, I don't feel as bad, because there are hardly any collectors of Old 
Masters here either or of great classical works or African or Asian art." 
</P>
<P>
 It will take another two generations to nurture private collectors of Indian 
art in Los Angeles' Indian community, Pal believes. 
</P>
<P>
 While he pointed out that "Jain Art From India" lists Indians among its 
supporters, he believes that the future of general art museums such as LACMA is 
not a matter of persuading ethnic groups to value their own cultural heritages. 
He would rather see widespread community support for museums, libraries and 
other cultural institutions. And museums should do their part by pointing out 
intercultural relationships, Pal contends, as he did in "Light of Asia," a 1984 
exhibition of art from India, Nepal, Tibet, China, Japan, Korea and Southeast 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sit around the table and yak about multiculturalism but we do not do 
intercultural shows," he says. "We build national boundaries, so we are really 
contributing to fragmenting the world. In a sense, we are ourselves responsible 
for the Saddam Husseins and the Bosnian crisis and all that. If we are going to 
try and say that this is one world, that we have the same challenges, the same 
vision, the same dreams, what better way than to do it with art?"

COVER STORY; FORGET JELLY, GEORGE IS JAMMIN'; GEORGE C. WOLFE IS RIGHT ON 
SCHEDULE WITH NEW YORK'S PUBLIC THEATER. HIS FIRST TWO SEASONS WERE TRIAL RUNS. 
NOW WOLFE TACKLES THE CRITICAL THIRD SEASON -- YOU KNOW, THE ONE IN WHICH THE 
BLOSSOMING TAKES PLACE.

<P>
 Doors have of ten played a central role in George C. Wolfe's produc tions. "Up 
for Grabs," which he wrote and directed as a student at Pomona College, saw a 
young black man metamorphose from corporate executive to revolutionary to 
superhero as he moved through a revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jelly's Last Jam," Wolfe's 1991 Broadway musical about Jelly Roll Morton, 
used an upstage door as a portal through which figures of the jazz great's past 
are evoked to tell his bitter story. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Blade to the Heat," Oliver Mayer's new play that Wolfe directed as the 
season opener for the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Public Theater, he 
used a door as a kind of stylistic opening to the insulated world of a 1959 Los 
Angeles boxing ring and its battered Latino and black fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there wasn't a door in 'Jelly's' when I did it in L.A.," Wolfe 
said, referring to the 1991 production at the Mark Taper Forum that he wrote 
and directed before its Broadway appearance. The idea for the door, he 
explained, came about when he took a trip to Senegal and visited one of the 
main embarkation points where Africans were shipped out to America to become 
slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very cerebral experience until I came to a door, what remained of a 
wharf on the site," Wolfe said. "And suddenly I became very emotional. I got 
it. On one side of that door, those people were their own definition. They had 
an existence. But once they went through that door, they became all these other 
people's definitions -- slave, nigger, coon, African American -- contrived, 
convoluted, negative-positive definitions of who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always a desire, but one can never ever go back through that door. 
And so you have this dramatic tension. It's Jelly's story but it's really the 
story of America, the story of the immigrant experience, whether you're talking 
about the pilgrims or the Irish or the Italians, or Latinos or whomever. That's 
what theater can do: open the door on those experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Broadway production of "Jelly's Last Jam" is finally on its 
national tour, West Coast audiences will have a chance to see Wolfe's 
interpretation of one man's life on the other side of that door. (The show 
plays Nov. 29-Dec. 4 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa 
before moving in January to the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert, the Pasadena 
Civic and possibly San Diego.) 
</P>
<P>
 But capturing those stories of America has taken on an even greater urgency 
for the 40-year-old writer-director since he himself first went through the 
revolving doors into the Public Theater, in 1987, with his play "The Colored 
Museum," a satire of black stereotypes. With that production he emerged as one 
of the hottest young talents in the American theater. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Wolfe was just the new kid on the block, a comer who was to score 
big on Broadway four years later with the musical "Jelly's Last Jam." He 
followed that triumph with multiple Tony-winning Broadway productions of Tony 
Kushner's "Angels in America," Parts 1 and 2, after replacing Oskar Eustis, who 
directed "Angels" at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 And in March, 1993, he took on what is one of the most prized jobs in show 
business: the directorship of the Public, replacing JoAnne Akalaitis, whose 
stormy tenure there followed the death of the Public's late, much-revered 
founder, Joseph Papp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe is now in the thick of his third season at the Public, but this year 
marks his first full test as producer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his appointment, he was still rehearsing "Millennium 
Approaches," the first part of "Angels in America," on Broadway, with the 
second part, "Perestroika," due to open the following fall. In addition, he had 
on his agenda directing the national touring productions of both "Jelly" and 
"Angels," which will come to the Doolittle Theatre next summer. Now that these 
shows are touring, they can only heighten his already high profile as producer 
of the Public. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations of the Public Theater are high because it is considered one of 
the most influential and powerful forces in American theater. Founded by Joseph 
Papp in a church basement 40 years ago, the theater first produced such 
acclaimed yet diverse musicals as "Hair," "Two Gentlemen of Verona," "Pirates 
of Penzance" and "A Chorus Line," and it nurtured the early careers of 
now-famous playwrights such as Sam Shepard, Ntozake Shange, David Rabe and 
David Hare and actors including Raul Julia, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Kline and 
Meryl Streep. All that, while its mandate is still to be the preeminent 
producer of Shakespeare in this country -- established by its traveling shows 
in the barrios in the early years to the continuing free summer productions in 
Central Park at the Delacorte Theatre, to its present mission to produce 
Shakespeare's entire 40-play canon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe's challenge is to integrate the commercial and artistic agendas at a 
theater that, according to Larry E. Condon, chairman of the theater's executive 
board, is facing a financial crisis which he describes as "daunting, but not 
fatal." 
</P>
<P>
 "While last season was not as successful as we might have wished," Condon said 
recently, "what George was doing was right on target: presenting daring new 
work, like (Suzan Lori-Parks') 'The America Play.' There may be a lot of stress 
and strain and some things may not function as well as they might, but George 
is institutionally savvy and a fast learner. Sure, we'd like another hit like 
'A Chorus Line.' But George knows, like Joe did, that our primary mission is in 
our name: Public." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at Wolfe's lineup of the 13 productions slated for the 1994-1995 
season at the Joseph Papp Public Theater and Delacorte Theatre in Central Park, 
there appears to be something for everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the world premiere of "Blade to the Heat" by Mayer, a 
29-year-old West Coast playwright and literary associate at the Mark Taper 
Forum, Wolfe is presenting the return of veteran Sam Shepard with his new play, 
"Simpatico," featuring a glamorous cast that includes Ed Harris, Beverly 
D'Angelo, Fred Ward and Marcia Gay Harden; "Him," Christopher Walken's debut as 
a playwright in which the actor also stars as an Elvis Presley-like character; 
Broadway titan Harold Prince's debut at the Public, directing "The Petrified 
Prince" by Michael John LaChiusa and Edward Gallardo; "A Language of Their Own" 
by Chay Yew, about a young gay Asian couple (seen at L.A.'s Celebration Theatre 
earlier this year); solo shows by cabaret diva Jenifer Lewis (who had a 
long-running hit engagement at L.A.'s Hudson Theatre) and downtown artist Danny 
Hoch, and, of course, Shakespeare. The 27th production in the ongoing 
Shakespeare marathon will be "The Merchant of Venice" with Ron Leibman. And 
that's just for starters.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first season was to re-establish the theater," said Wolfe, just before 
"Blade" was to kick off the Public's new program earlier this month. "The 
second, to push it forward, the third to blossom into a vision. I think we're 
on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter is ushered into Wolfe's modest quarters half an hour after the 
appointed time, which appears to be par for the course. But then everything 
seems to be bobbing along in a state of mild-but-friendly chaos in the warren 
of administrative offices at the Public. "I'm the most democratic fascist 
you'll ever meet," said Wolfe. "I listen to everybody and then I make a 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 By his own admission, one of Wolfe's chief failings as an administrator is his 
inability to delegate responsibility. "George, like Joe (Papp), is very 
demanding, but George is really much more accessible than Joe ever was," said 
one staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in khakis and a sport shirt, Wolfe is a curious mixture of 
aggressiveness and shyness, rather like a Mr. Peepers crossed with Ninja 
Warrior. He raises his voice only to issue reprimands to Chica, his Jack 
Russell terrier puppy, who is busy ripping apart a stuffed animal in the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-boned and bespectacled, Wolfe speaks in an amazingly fast patter -- a 
torrent of ideas, images and concepts occasionally interrupted by a sharp, loud 
bark of a laugh. His staccato style reminds many people of Papp. In fact, the 
late founder of the Public had named Wolfe one of three resident directors in 
1990, and seemed to be describing him when he talked about his ideal successor 
as someone with a good knowledge of the theater, music, fiscal responsibility 
and maturity. "Once people get past a certain age," Papp once told the Village 
Voice, "a kind of cynicism sets in, a kind of worldliness. That's OK, as long 
as they're still idealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 All that seems to reflect Wolfe, a romantic who speaks movingly of the 
transfiguring power of theater, a realist who has few illusions about being in 
the hot seat. No avant-garde snob, he can speak as enthusiastically about the 
film "Valley of the Dolls" as he can about German Expressionist theater. And he 
appears to integrate all the emotional contradictions and complications of a 
gay black man who grew up in a segregated world, achieved a cult following in 
inner-city Los Angeles and catapulted to fame as the first African American 
director of a non-black-themed Broadway hit -- "Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the disarming facade, Wolfe is still one shrewd player. "Jelly" 
and "Angels" demonstrated he had the mettle necessary to create in the 
high-stakes pressure cooker of the commercial theater. But these uptown 
successes also made him suspect to the downtown not-for-profit theater crowd 
who, as he put it, has dubbed him "the whore of Babylon." 
</P>
<P>
 "He talks the good talk and walks the good walk, but I'm not sure if he isn't 
a triumph of style over substance, of hype over talent," said one critic, who 
in deference to Wolfe's power wished to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Margo Lion, who produced both "Jelly's Last Jam" and "Angels in America," 
however, counters that Wolfe has been tempered in both the commercial and 
not-for-profit arenas, and she believes he can lead theater into the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "George brings a contemporary sensibility in terms of both his interests and 
his artistry," she said. "He's not somebody who wants to preach. He wants to 
thrill an audience, to provoke it, to stimulate it. And he does that quite 
bravely and daringly." 
</P>
<P>
 I ndeed, Wolfe has rarely shied away from facing down the powers that be when 
he feels his artistic integrity is at stake. His smart and tough production of 
"The Colored Museum" aroused the ire of some black activists who felt that the 
parody was demeaning. And when he was directing "Jelly's Last Jam," he refused 
to accept pressure from the cast to tame some of the more negative and harsh 
aspects in the musical. In it, he unflinchingly examined the contradictions in 
the life of Jelly Roll Morton, a self-hating black who nonetheless drew on his 
African heritage to create some great music.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who will tell you I'm very ruthless," says Wolfe. 
"I'm very fierce. If I feel I'm right, if I feel I've been violated, then I am 
like a warrior from hell!" 
</P>
<P>
 That gladiatorial spirit has come in handy in his task to bring direction and 
vision to a theater that was generally thought to be listing dangerously after 
the death of its charismatic founder in 1991. In fact, his accession at the 
Public came with a little bloodletting, when the board of directors fired 
Akalaitis, his Papp-anointed predecessor -- on the Ides of March, no less -- 
and offered Wolfe the crown. It came with the title of producer, which only 
Papp had held before him, creative power that Akalaitis never enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe has brought in his own team, which now accounts for almost half of the 
staff. Among them is Donna Walker Collins as director of community affairs, a 
new department directly geared toward enlarging the scope and diversity of the 
Public's audience. He has also added three new board members -- Ken Lerer, 
Catherine P. Saxton and George W. Haywood, the latter two expressing his 
commitment to increasing the presence of women and people of color on the 
board. There have been setbacks, such as last summer's fiasco of "Kiss Me, 
Kate," which was canceled because of disagreements with the co-producers even 
after it had been advertised. And the Public Theater's production of Anna 
Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992" had a very short run on Broadway, 
despite critical praise. But there is a kinetic energy on Lafayette Street that 
hasn't been seen there in some time. Both donors and subscribers are 
significantly up over recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, however, is still out on whether Wolfe can combine intellectual 
depth with commercial savvy, as Papp did so well. "Blade to the Heat," a boxing 
drama that opened earlier this month, was almost universally criticized for 
being short on substance, though the production itself was praised for Wolfe's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard's "Simpatico," which opened last week, fared better with the critics, 
earning generally favorable reviews, though Shepard's direction was faulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Wolfe defended his choice for the season's opener as exactly the sort of 
work to viscerally excite and stimulate the Public's audiences. Playwright 
Mayer evokes the sweat-and-blood-stained boxing world of 1959 in his drama. 
Black and Latino fighters spar with their inner selves as much as with each 
other in this testosterone-soaked drama. And when the specter of homosexuality 
is raised, the taunting leads to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tale of fragility inside of this harsh, shifting landscape," Wolfe 
said. "When I read it, I knew its power lay in its emotions much more than in 
its cerebral impact. But I loved what it was about, the boys' club. When the 
rules of the boys' club change -- and what defines a man is constantly being 
challenged as we enter the '90s -- then there's a lot of disturbing and 
provocative stuff to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 A ccording to Wolfe, the Public has one overriding mandate: to present work 
reflective of the diverse community outside its doors. "Theater should address 
the stories of its communities or I don't know why it's here," he said. "I want 
to create a theater that looks, feels and smells like America." 
</P>
<P>
 As a producer, he feels that creating theater in today's politically 
conservative climate provides opportunities as well as dangers. While he fears 
that a new round of censorship could come from the newly empowered 
congressional conservatives, Wolfe said that any efforts could be met by a 
re-energized and vigilant artistic community. He also feels that it is 
incumbent on artists to creatively fight against what he calls "a polarized, 
let's-retreat-into-our-own-corner dynamic as a society." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the last hurrah of the old order and they know it," he said of 
the right's re-emergence. "That's why the fight is going on with such a 
vengeance. The question is how complicated and bloody the fight is going to be. 
But no matter what they do, I think there is a certain inevitability of the 
world spinning forward. You can't retreat back. What are they going to do, kill 
off everybody that doesn't fit into their picture of what is an American?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe adds that another reason he wanted to direct "Blade" was because it is 
set in 1959, in a white Republican America in which everybody is "exactly alike 
-- there was a distinct good and bad, a right and a wrong in the American 
thought process," he says. "Now all those edges are blurring. You've got black 
people wearing blue contacts, white kids trying to become hip-hop. In America, 
everybody is an outsider, no matter what they might think or say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a scary time, but it's also an exhilarating one," he added. "Because 
when 'the party' is falling apart, then you can help to reconfigure 'the party' 
in a very significant way. Now, all the stories that couldn't be told before 
can be told." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe's two-fisted populism was forged early on as one of four children born 
to a father who worked as a state government clerk and a mother who was a 
grammar-school teacher and principal in Frankfort, Ky. A portrait of Addie 
President, Wolfe's maternal grandmother, now holds a place of honor in his SoHo 
apartment, alongside cultural artifacts reflecting an interest in African 
spiritualism passed down by a grandmother who used to keep snakes in a jar of 
formaldehyde by the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother made me feel safe as a human being," he said. "If I'm an 
artist today, it's because I was able to live within my childhood state for a 
very long time. Because I rarely left that world until I was 13 or 14, I grew 
up with no concept of racial inferiority." 
</P>
<P>
 Addie President's "pit-bull" energy, however, could not entirely protect her 
grandson from the trauma of segregation. As a black, the door of the movie 
house, the Capitol Theatre, in Frankfort was closed to him. It was, says Wolfe, 
"the defining event" in his relationship to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what made a 7-year-old kid so threatening to the spiritual and 
moral fiber of the Capitol Theatre, but I've spent an entire life making sure 
that I got into any place I wanted to get into," he says. "It was also a given 
that once I got into the room, I was supposed to open up the windows and doors 
and let in other people. I suppose if I stand still long enough, there is an 
incredible rage that I feel about that event, but a channeled rage can become a 
fuel." 
</P>
<P>
 His mission as an "integration warrior," as he describes it, took him to 
Pomona College in California, partly to get away from Kentucky's cold winters 
and partly to immerse himself in the study of theater. His ambition was 
galvanized at 13, when his mother took him to New York and he saw productions 
of "West Side Story" at Lincoln Center and "Hello, Dolly!" with Pearl Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe now says that he is "disturbed" by the musical revival frenzy of 
Broadway ("Silly things done by really smart people are lots of fun; silly 
things done by not so smart people are really annoying"). But at the time he 
was hooked. "It was like, 'People make money doing this?' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 His closely held tenet that theater needed to have purpose evolved during his 
three-year stint at Los Angeles' Inner City Cultural Center where, as he put 
it, he not only learned from "smarter, older people about theater," but also 
expanded his definitions beyond the world of blacks and whites to include the 
Asians, gays and Latinos who were working with him there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a very hard time with Los Angeles," he said. "I'm someone who responds 
very intensely to rhythms and I think you probably have to be in L.A. a long 
time before you get to know those rhythms peculiar to the place. I also thought 
that if I stayed too long I'd get much too comfortable. I had to get out of 
town before it became too seductive." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe is circumspect in talking about whether the extended family that raised 
him in Kentucky fully accepted his homosexuality. But he does say, "for all my 
ambiguities and oddness, I'm claimed. That's what I love about the black 
community. They'll say, 'Well, you know, we don't know how we feel about that 
homosexuality thing, Junior. But take off that dress and come on in.' The 
ownership is there." 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of being Other and being claimed at the same time has given Wolfe 
confidence to test the boundaries of tolerance within his own circles. After 
leaving California, he kicked around New York for about five years before 
scoring with "The Colored Museum." In the biting satire, he attacked such 
sacred cows as "A Raisin in the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that what I was a part of was so strong that it could withstand my 
scrutiny," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Wolfe had a flop with the musical "Paradise" at Playwrights 
Horizons just before the success of "The Colored Museum" has only served to 
reinforce his pit-bull commitment to playwrights over the long haul. Oliver 
Mayer, who wrote "Blade," said that he never felt hamstrung by his own 
background as a half-Anglo/half-Latino heterosexual to write as he felt. 
"George never told me what to write," he says. "But he did encourage me to push 
the envelope, to be brave. He's not limited by identity questions. He wants to 
know whether it's a good play, not a black or Hispanic or Asian play. He's 
interested in a good story." 
</P>
<P>
 As idealistic as Wolfe is about finding and producing groundbreaking stories 
on the stages of the Public, he is pragmatic enough to know that money has a 
way of editing dreams -- not only for new and experimental theater but also for 
Shakespeare and the classics, which are much more expensive to produce. For 
better or worse, the financial windfall that "A Chorus Line" provided for years 
at the Public has created the pressure for another cash cow to emerge from the 
downtown stable. 
</P>
<P>
 If it does, Wolfe says somewhat wearily, it will have to come from the 
"organic process" of presenting good work and letting the chips fall where they 
may. He acknowledges that taking "Twilight" to Broadway may well have been a 
mistake -- "It was a bold move but I think it would still be running had it 
remained Off Broadway," he said. However, it was the messy debacle of "Kiss Me, 
Kate" last summer that taught him the toughest lessons of trying to, as he put 
it, "graft on" relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought we could get there," he said. 'So much of what I've been 
able to accomplish is my belief, 'I can make this work. Full speed ahead. I can 
defy the obstacles.' But sometimes you can and sometimes you can't and it was a 
painful experience." 
</P>
<P>
 His "warrior energy" may have been tempered by his experiences of last season, 
but it still appears to be at near-full throttle. "The biggest problem with 
this job is that it never stops," says Wolfe. "People respond to the theater in 
the most personal way. It's like a marriage between you and them and God help 
you if you let them down." 
</P>
<P>
 While Wolfe has been praised for his "cinematic" productions, he says that 
he's been much too busy in theater to devote much time to the film projects he 
had been developing before he was tapped for the Public. Among them were 
commissioned screenplays about a pygmy placed in a Bronx Zoo and a biography of 
Josephine Baker, which he says may first be a Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Wolfe has a three-year contract with the Public but has initiated 
enough projects to keep him busy for the next decade. Though board chairman 
Condon says that new structures are being devised so that the Festival can run 
with or without Wolfe at its helm, it is clear that the producer and his 
fortunes are becoming almost as inextricably linked and identified with the 
Public as Papp's once were. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't leave Wolfe much time for himself, as was certainly clear from 
the events of last month as he turned 40. That same week, he learned that a 
friend had died of AIDS, a memorial service was held at the Public for Danitra 
Vance, an actress and close friend who'd been in the cast of "The Colored 
Museum," and at a board meeting a donor had pledged what Wolfe called "a 
tremendous amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Wolfe said, pressures and ambitions were put in the proper 
perspective. "You just keep going. Sometimes it rains, sometimes the sun 
shines. I wasn't allowed the pure and extraordinary luxury of dealing with the 
emotion of it all. The stuff kept swirling around. And it will continue with or 
without you."

FILM CLIPS / LAPTOP ENCOUNTER: SAMI AND SANTA, 'MIRACLE'S' MUTUAL ADMIRATION 
SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howell J. Malham Jr. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Director Les Mayfield pulls off a fairly creditable remake of the classic 
"Miracle on 34th Street," but there is one scene, lasting only a minute or two, 
in which the holiday themes of faith and charity are especially crystallized. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scene, a young deaf girl is brought to sit on the lap of Kriss Kringle 
at the fictional Cole's department store. Kringle (Richard Attenborough), who 
hasn't been told of the child's disability, asks her what she would like for 
Christmas. After her mother informs him that her child is deaf and that all she 
wanted was to sit on Santa's lap, Kringle summons his seasonal powers and 
begins a sign-language conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 The stoic girl is transformed on camera with a delighted, surprised smile, 
signing back her answers, much to the tearful surprise of her mother -- and 
more than a few audience members. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, there is something even more touching about the scene: It is 
acted by 5-year-old Sami Krieger, the second of three deaf children born to Jay 
and Linda Krieger, both of whom are also deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 In the living room of their modest duplex in Hanover Park, a middle-class 
suburb of Chicago, Sami fidgets in her father's lap, grappling with a temporary 
case of acute shyness, while her sisters Amanda, 6, and Wanda, 1, look on.  
</P>
<P>
 Jay Krieger, with the help of a sign-language interpreter, says of making the 
film, "The experience was wonderful, really great. The (John) Hughes 
(production) people treated Sami like royalty, giving her a trailer with a star 
that had her name on it, which made her feel special," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife had mixed feelings about it, and so did I at first, but if she 
decides to do something like this again, I think that would be fine with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sami, all warmed up for her interview, signs: "It was really fun being in the 
movie. Being with Santa and seeing all those toys was the best part," though it 
was "hard," she says, to pretend it was Christmas in the middle of a sweltering 
Chicago summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have pretended it was Easter, because that's my favorite 
holiday," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original, it is a Dutch war orphan who pays a magical visit to Santa, 
who instinctively knows her native language and sings to her in Dutch. Hughes 
rewrote the script, substituting a hearing-impaired child. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read the scene with the deaf girl," says Mayfield in a phone 
interview, "that represented the reason why this movie could be remade in 
relation to a more modern view of the world. And I think this had to be an 
honest moment -- it would only work with a real deaf girl, who probably never 
sat on Santa's lap." 
</P>
<P>
 After a five-state search for such a girl, Mayfield's casting department found 
Sami through a Chicago audition, sponsored in part by a local center for the 
deaf. With her family and a translator on the set for two days, Sami endured 
the controlled chaos of the environment with nary a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scene tore my heart out," says Mayfield, 34, who was lauded in 1991 for 
his brutally stark documentary, "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse." 
</P>
<P>
 And apparently, Mayfield's wasn't the only heart captured. Attenborough says 
he asked Mayfield not to rehearse Sami, who came to the set unaware that he was 
going to sign a reply to her request for a Christmas present.  
</P>
<P>
 "So when I signed 'What is your name?' the surprise on her face was genuine,' 
" Attenborough recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "And after the scene, she signed 'Thank you' to me. Well, I was gone, I can 
tell you. That got me," he thumps his heart, "right there."

FILM CLIPS / SPY VS. SPY: CAINE REOPENS 'THE IPCRESS FILE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Howard Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what do you do if you want Michael Caine to star in an original movie for 
your premium cable channel but he's more interested in making feature films? If 
you're the executives at Showtime, you give him a feature film -- provided that 
he shoot the follow-up cable TV sequel for Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Caine just completed work on two projects in Russia, reprising the Harry 
Palmer spy character who made him famous in director Sidney J. Furie's "The 
Ipcress File" in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did the TV movie because it was the only way they would make the feature," 
said Caine by phone from Russia. The actor has only played a handful of roles 
for television in three decades, his last one earlier this year as Stalin in 
the NBC miniseries, "World War II: When Lions Roared." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bullets to Beijing" and "Midnight in Saint Petersburg" were both filmed for 
12 weeks in areas around St. Petersburg for a cost of $9 million, with 60% or 
so of the budget allocated to the first film. "Beijing" is expected to receive 
a limited theatrical release next fall; Showtime will try to find a distributor 
in February at the American Film Market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beijing" will then follow the normal path down the entertainment food chain, 
coming out on video six months later, and then hitting Showtime six months 
after that. The sequel, "Saint Petersburg," will probably be seen on Showtime a 
few months after the theatrical release of "Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be difficult to get Michael Caine to do an original movie. He's a 
well-established star, who comes with a certain price. By having a theatrical 
locomotive we could make it work," explained Matthew Duda, senior vice 
president of program acquisitions and planning for Showtime Networks, which put 
up half of the budget for domestic rights. The rest of the film was paid for by 
Canadian, Russian and British interests.  
</P>
<P>
 Both movies revisit the character created by author Len Deighton in a series 
of espionage thrillers about a Cockney crook turned secret agent. For those who 
don't remember, Harry Palmer was a sort of reaction to the cult of James Bond. 
While Bond sipped his vodka martinis -- shaken, not stirred -- and then jumped 
into his Aston Martin, Palmer slammed a beer in the pub and then hopped the bus 
home. He first volunteered for espionage to escape a jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ipcress File" was the first film featuring Caine's name above the title, and 
it led to "Alfie," which cemented Caine's career in 1966. Two more Harry Palmer 
sequels, "Funeral in Berlin" (1966) and "Billion Dollar Brain" (1967), were 
made. A couple years ago, veteran producer Harry Alan Towers was wondering what 
would have happened to the Palmer character once the Cold War ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there was a story here about what happened to the out-of-work spies 
left over from the Cold War," said Towers, 74, who executive produced the 
Showtime productions and wrote the screenplays for them under the name Peter 
Welbeck. His credits range from producing the Orson Welles radio series "The 
Lives of Harry Lime" to producing two back-to-back "Lost World" movies, for 
B-movie distributors Harmony Gold, that went straight to video. 
</P>
<P>
 Towers secured the Palmer series rights about six months ago, after some 
difficult negotiations with Deighton and original producer Harry Saltzman, who 
also produced the early Bond films. Because Deighton didn't give his character 
a name, Saltzman, who died recently, and Caine came up with the Palmer name 
together before they made "Ipcress File." 
</P>
<P>
 "We set these sequels in Russia, because I was in Russia about two years ago, 
and I learned about a security agency flourishing under the name of Alex," 
Towers said. "It's the first private security organization ever licensed in 
Russia, and largely staffed by ex-Red Army intelligence." In the second movie, 
Caine establishes a private investigation agency in Russia, based on Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 But not without help from Jason Connery, the son of the original Bond, Sean 
Connery. They team up in both Showtime productions. If these movies turn out to 
be a hit on Showtime, Dudas said, viewers can look forward to seeing a series 
of TV movies starring Connery. Caine describes their work together as "comedy 
thrillers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Caine is a super comedian," Towers said. "I don't think he's a lively 
leading man any more. That's why Jason Connery fits so perfectly into the 
package. Michael is perfectly content to get the laughs and let Jason get the 
girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Most feature film actors do cable television for the prestige. Caine makes no 
bones about the fact that he's doing these for the money. He won't reveal how 
much he is getting paid, but he says he has never received more for a role. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing financially is very advantageous," said Caine, who also has 
10% interest in anything the Showtime movies make in theaters or on video. 
"This is not an entirely artistic endeavor. I'm not out busting my neck like a 
youngster trying to get somewhere. I've got a very beautiful home in London, a 
home in the country in Oxford and one in Los Angeles. To get me out of there, 
you have to pay me."

JUST AN AVERAGE-LOOKING GUY; NATHAN DAVIS HAS LENT HIS 'NONDESCRIPT FACE' TO A 
WIDE ARRAY OF CHARACTERS (INCLUDING SEVERAL IN SON ANDREW DAVIS' FILMS). HIS 
LATEST: THE WEAK-BLADDER GUY IN STEVE MARTIN'S 'PICASSO' PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Getting fired was probably the best thing that ever happened to Nathan Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a relief, a liberating feeling," says the Chicago native, 
whose job termination at age 59 -- after 25 years as a salesperson for a 
wholesale drug company -- gave him the opportunity to return to his first love: 
acting. Now, at age 77, Davis is making his Los Angeles stage debut in the 
Steppenwolf Theatre Company's production of Steve Martin's "Picasso at the 
Lapin Agile" at the Westwood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm enjoying playing this guy, Gascon, whose expertise is (with) women," says 
Davis, who originated the role in Chicago workshops with Steppenwolf more than 
a year ago. In Martin's hypothetical 1904 meeting between a young Pablo Picasso 
and Albert Einstein in a Paris cafe, Davis' Gascon is a spirited senior whose 
periodic bathroom breaks are one of the show's running gags. "He's more or less 
the cue man for the entire group, the transitional character," notes the actor. 
"And Steve has given me a lot of funny bits." 
</P>
<P>
 The role is in stark contrast to Davis' screen work, which has often found him 
in a much more sinister mode. In his first film, "Thief," he was an older 
safecracker advising James Caan. He played a Russian murder conspirator in "The 
Package" with Gene Hackman, a "Mafia character" in "Code of Silence" with Chuck 
Norris, a "Mafia relative" in "Above the Law" with Steven Seagal (his role was 
subsequently cut from the finished product) and a "Mafia guy" in three episodes 
of the '80s television series "Wiseguy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have a nondescript face, and directors don't want to stick with 
stereotypes," Davis theorizes, relaxing backstage at the Westwood Playhouse 
before a recent performance. "I get a wider variety of roles in the theater." 
In Chicago, those outings have included "The Sunshine Boys" at the National 
Jewish Theatre, "The Time of Your Life" and "Lakeboat" at the Goodman Theatre, 
and "Awake and Sing" and "Fool for Love" at Steppenwolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go a little batty when I'm not working," admits the actor, whose last 
touring experience -- playing Grandpa Joad in Steppenwolf's acclaimed 
production of "The Grapes of Wrath" -- was a two-year excursion that took him 
to La Jolla, London and Broadway. During off-time at home, Davis adds, "I do 
some recording for a blind service in Chicago, I'm active in Actors' Equity. 
And my wife and I don't stay in one place very long; we do a lot of traveling. 
Just before this we spent three weeks in Turkey." (His wife of 53 years, Metta, 
has accompanied him for the "Picasso" run.) 
</P>
<P>
 The local sojourn has also enabled the couple to spend time with their two 
eldest children and their families. Daughter Jo Friedman is ombudsman of the 
OB/GYN department at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; middle son Andrew Davis 
directed the hugely successful films "Under Siege" and "The Fugitive." "Andy's 
first film (as director) was a low-budget picture called 'Stony Island,' " says 
proud papa. "Meshach Taylor was in it, Dennis Franz, Rae Dawn Chong. Our 
youngest son, Richard (a Chicago-based musician), was the star. And I was in it 
too. I played a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The familial connection has apparently served both Davises well. Nathan's 
turns in "The Package," "Code of Silence" and "Above the Law" were all directed 
by Andrew; the director also cast his mother as Steven Seagal's mom in "Above 
the Law." "My mother told everyone she got the job because she slept with the 
director's father," chuckles Andrew Davis, speaking by phone from his Santa 
Barbara home. "Having my parents in my films is a joy." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, adds Andrew, he was well aware of his father's artistic 
frustration. "I knew he didn't love his work; it was a real Willy Loman thing," 
says the director. "But all of their friends were from the theater. I think a 
lot of my ease with actors now comes from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan was also instrumental in his son's future career: It was his friend 
Studs Terkel who recommended Andrew, fresh out of the University of Chicago, to 
cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Andrew subsequently became Wexler's protege and 
served as his assistant cameraman on 1969's "Medium Cool." 
</P>
<P>
 For Davis pere , it's really a life come full circle. As a young man, he 
worked as an actor (he met his wife at an acting class), then served overseas 
in World War II; afterward, he returned to Chicago and for a short time worked 
in radio as a soap opera performer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the only (acting) outlet during that period," he explains. "There 
was no professional theater to speak of, just road companies. And I was raising 
and supporting a family." During his salesman years, Davis did the occasional 
community theater production, but not without conflict: "I worked for a firm 
that wanted your total allegiance, every moment of your life. So if I had a 
dress rehearsal that conflicted with a sales meeting, the guy would say, 'Do 
you want to be a salesman or do you want to be an actor?' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his firing, Davis' two eldest children were grown, and his wife 
was working as a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I took a shot at it," he says with a shrug. "It took me a few years to get 
established in (local) theater, then after the original Mayor (Richard J.) 
Daley died, we started getting some movie productions in Chicago." (Many of his 
son's films have been shot there.) Although there's the inevitable actor's 
insecurity, Davis has reached a place of personal and professional calm. "I 
don't worry if I'll work again, not at my age," he says with a laugh. 
"Something always seems to come up. Our house -- which I bought on the GI Bill 
-- was paid for a long time ago. Between our pensions and Social Security, 
we're OK." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, there's also the pleasant bonus of avoiding a Chicago winter -- and 
getting to flex those still-limber acting muscles eight times a week. Still, he 
can't help hungering for more. "I've got a little chair in the wings, where I 
sit and wait for my cues," Davis says of Gascon's bathroom breaks. "I was 
hoping in the development of the play Steve would cut some of those exits, but 
he didn't. What's happened is, people seem to focus on one thing about the 
character -- that he has a weak bladder. He has some wonderful lines, but all 
they remember is that he pees a lot."

THEATER NOTES; THE OSCARS STARTED SMALL TOO

<P>
 As the first winner to accept one of the new, competitive Ovation Awards Mon 
day night, Marga Gomez ("Carpa Clash") told the 1,250 assembled at the Alex 
Theatre: "I feel like Janet Gaynor." 
</P>
<P>
 She was referring to the winner of the first best actress Oscar, presented in 
1929. That was before the Oscars were seen worldwide, of course; Gaynor later 
recalled that the ceremony "was more like a private party." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ovation ceremony was open to the public, but it too resembled a private 
party. Loud cheers and whoops erupted from corners of the hall at the mention 
of certain nominees, signaling that a lot of theater people were there to 
support friends and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In scripted remarks before presenting an award, director Allan Miller observed 
that "in Russia, the actors applaud the audience," to which Rue McClanahan 
snapped back, "In L.A., the actors are the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Ovations sponsors eventually hope their annual ceremony will be 
famous among a much larger audience. The primary purpose of it is public 
relations -- to spread the word about the size and depth of the L.A. theater 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Emcee Mariette Hartley picked up a phrase that seems to have become a mantra 
among Ovations officials -- L.A. can boast of "more shows on more stages than 
any other city at any time, anywhere on the planet." (The number of shows on 
Mars has yet to be confirmed.) 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. offers more than just quantity, she added, pointing out the recent 
Pulitzers for shows that passed through Los Angeles before going to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the evening's biggest winner, "Sunset Boulevard," just opened in New 
York, after it found its footing in its Shubert Theatre run here. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone assumed the "Sunset" winners were all in New York Monday. So by the 
time Joyce Van Patten announced that John Napier, who designed "Sunset," had 
won an award, she simply said "We know where he is" and started to walk off the 
stage with his trophy. But then Napier rose from the audience, exclaiming "I'm 
here!" With his trophy finally in hand, he announced that he's moving to L.A., 
and "it's comforting to know there may be some work here for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunset" hardly took all the honors. Among the evening's biggest surprises was 
that Tracy Young, director of the Actors' Gang's "Hysteria," won the 
director/musical award over such competition as Trevor Nunn of "Sunset" and 
James Lapine of "Falsettos." 
</P>
<P>
 The best play awards to "Fool Moon" (larger theaters) and "Men on the Verge of 
a His-panic Breakdown" (smaller) prompted a bit of post-ceremony grumbling that 
these were not real plays, but rather revues or performance pieces. Even "Men" 
playwright Guillermo Reyes, accepting his Ovation, referred to his show as 
"these monologues." Of course, the definition of "play" is not very precise. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been interesting to see how the winning plays would have fared 
if South Coast Repertory and the Cast Theatre -- two theaters whose productions 
have won many of the recent playwriting awards from critics' groups -- were 
among the competitors. They don't belong to Theatre LA, so their shows aren't 
eligible for Ovations. 
</P>

 AT THE LOBERO: West End Artists Theatre Company, formerly based at the West 
End Theatre in Van Nuys, has announced a season of shows at Santa Barbara's 
Lobero Theatre: Michael Kavanagh's solo performance "Bein' With Behan" (Jan. 
28-Feb. 12), Michael Valenti's Off Broadway musical "Lovesong" (Feb. 25-March 
4), Gene Castle's new musical "Tin Pan Alley" (June 30-July 14) and a revival 
of West End's production of the musical revue "Broadway Sings Out!" (Dec. 9-16, 
1995). 
</P>
<P>
 The company presented "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes" at the Lobero last summer, in 
the wake of the untimely departure of Pasadena-based Theatre Corp. of America, 
which left a number of Santa Barbara subscribers grumbling about their 
unfinished subscriptions. Although West End has nothing to do with Theatre 
Corp., West End will offer a discount to the Theatre Corp.'s Lobero subscribers 
(available only until Dec. 1) in recognition of the fact that they otherwise 
might be leery of subscribing to another Lobero series.

 One of the hippest records to have come out this year is a CD resurrection of 
goofy early Spike Jones recordings. Spike Jones was the drummer from Long Beach 
who played in radio bands in the 1930s and then, in the early '40s, set out on 
his own as a musical satirist, famous for making lots of nerdy noises to parody 
popular songs, with his band, Spike Jones & the City Slickers. By the '50s, 
when he went on television, his act had become tired and its spirit a little 
mean; his old LPs, for most of his old fans, have wound up in attic with the 
tattered Mad magazines and other nutty juvenalia. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes "Spiked! The Music of Spike Jones" hip is that it is released on 
Catalyst, a trendy and sophisticated new-music label; it contains liner notes 
by the reclusive cult novelist Thomas Pynchon, and it flaunts flashy cover art 
by cartoonist Art Spiegelman, of "Maus" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Some extravagant claims are made for this record. Its executive producer, Tim 
Page, who is also chief classical music critic at Newsday, adds to the liner 
notes that all Jones' cowbells, gunshots, car horns and crashes helped pave the 
way for everything from John Cage to Public Enemy. Jones was not nearly that 
prescient, of course; American experimental music was honking car horns and 
smashing beer bottles years before Jones came on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spike Jones did reveal at least one particularly quirky and genuine sign 
of prescience buried in some of the cuts. For a couple of years in the 
mid-'40s, Jones' clarinetist -- and what Pynchon calls "Slicker glug 
specialist" -- was Mickey Katz. Katz went on, in the '50s, to create his own 
comedy routines of Yiddish musical parody. In the process, Katz bowdlerized an 
old Yiddish folk music style, klezmer, sometimes called Jewish jazz, the 
celebratory secular music of weddings and bar mitzvahs. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz's LPs went out of fashion with the '50s, and Katz ultimately became 
better known as the father of the entertainer Joel Grey than of any musical 
trend. But then, last year, Nonesuch put out a recording called "Don Byron 
Plays the Music of Mickey Katz," resulting in a startling cultural confusion. 
Don Byron is a Boston-based young black clarinetist who is also a regular in 
Manhattan's downtown avant-garde jazz scene. In addition, he heads an 
Afro-Cuban jazz band as well as a modern classical ensemble, and he is 
currently writing a string quartet for the Kronos Quartet. He is not Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Byron the only member of the hip art world lately drawn to klezmer. 
Anyone looking for a particularly off-the-wall Hanukkah party record might try 
the klezmer-tinged title track from "Transylvania Softwear," (John Marks 
Records), the latest effort from the avant-garde accordionist, Guy Klucevsek, 
who has practically single-handedly made his instrument newly fashionable in 
the downtown new-music dance clubs. But then even John Zorn, saxophonist and 
avatar of downtown postmodern improvisers, has begun playing his versions of 
klezmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Klezmer has, in fact, invaded the avant-garde in a number of unlikely ways. 
The postmodern choreographer David Gordon directed the klezmer musical 
"Shlemiel the First" last year for American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, 
Mass., which became a New York hit last summer when it visited Lincoln Center's 
showcase of avant-garde performance, "Serious Fun!" And now Richard Forman, the 
avant-garde director, is currently preparing a new work of music theater, 
"Yiddisher Teddy Bears," for his Ontological-Hysteric Theater, with music by 
Stewart Wallace, also composer of the forthcoming opera "Harvey Milk." 
</P>
<P>
 Why klezmer? And why now? 
</P>
<P>
 There are all kinds of issues that can be raised here, issues of postmodernism 
and multiculturalism. There are all the usual social and ethnic questions to be 
asked. But there is something else. It is what the Polish klezmer musician, 
Leopold Kozlowski, says while chopping garlic in a new documentary, "The Last 
Klezmer" (which plays weekends at the Sunset 5). Of the garlic, Kozlowski says 
simply, "It's a pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Klezmer is back, most likely, for the same simple reason. It's a pleasure, and 
it's all the more one because it is a pleasure that had been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Klezmer is the ultimate low-rent party music. Its roots are murky, but it 
comes from the entertainment music that developed in Eastern Europe sometime in 
the latter part of the last century. There seems to have been little room in 
Jewish culture for secular music before that. Unlike the fabulous body of 
sacred music that arose out of Christianity, Jewish music of worship remained 
unadorned chant. Klezmer, which means in Yiddish vessel of music , was the 
entertainment at weddings and bar mitzvahs. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally klezmer was the musical equivalent of Yiddish, a folk-based music 
that adapted to whatever musical language was around it. But with the rise of 
Yiddish theater in the late 1800s, it traveled to the United States along with 
the huge wave of Jewish emigrants from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, klezmer adapted. It took on many of the trappings of jazz. Klezmer 
big bands were formed in the '20s, and many klezmer musicians also got jobs in 
regular jazz bands as well. Indeed, like much else in Jewish life, klezmer 
became an assimilated art. 
</P>
<P>
 By World War II, with American Jews becoming increasingly assimilated into 
middle-class culture and society, the klezmer bands died out almost entirely, 
surviving only to play weddings and bar mitzvahs. But that also made klezmer a 
particularly apt vehicle for Mickey Katz's parodies of the middle-class 
assimilation. So where Spike Jones would spoof Stephen Foster with "I Dream of 
Brownie in the Light Blue Jeans," Katz came up with "Haim Afen Range" ("Home on 
the Range") and "Paisach in Portugal" ("April in Portugal"), both hilariously 
included in Don Byron's recording. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all else in ethnic culture, klezmer also eventually entered the academy, 
most notably at the New England Conservatory of Music, where Hankus Netsky, 
chairman of the jazz studies department, founded the Klezmer Conservatory Band. 
Coming out of that department and that band, Byron became the most prominent 
musician of new generation that viewed klezmer perhaps in a more true spirit 
than many who attempt to preserve it as tradition. Recognizing that klezmer was 
a musical expression of Jewish secular life, not of Judaism, and that klezmer 
never was any one definable sort of tradition, Byron, in a true postmodern 
fashion, removed the tradition from its usual context so as to appreciate 
things in it that might have been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron does this mainly through shock -- the shock of a jazz cat with 
dreadlocks. Byron plays exact transcriptions of Katz recordings. He even 
employs a singer who mimics Katz's accents and Yiddish humor. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also creates a new, late 20th-Century context in which to hear Katz 
anew. He begins his recording by musically identifying both himself and Katz, 
dubbing old Katz recordings on top of Byron's own hallucinatory jazz style. 
That sets the scene for the more subtle shock effect of hearing Katz's music 
played with exquisite virtuosity in clear, clean sound, re-created with a kind 
of loving care for the music itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron's is ultimately a surreal vision. He may, like Page, get carried away 
when, in the notes, he compares Katz to the unlikely likes of Art Blakey and 
Harry Partch -- Katz was no more a precursor of progressive jazz or 
experimental American music than his mentor, Spike Jones, was of rap or the 
avant-garde -- but the music does have a way changing perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as curious as Byron's cultural confusion is the fact that klezmer has 
also now reached the concert stage, where it never has been welcomed. Its poor 
reputation has traditionally made even important Jewish composers wary of it. 
Copland could happily turn to jazz or mariachi music; Leonard Bernstein could 
adapt just about any popular music; Marc Blitzstein was happy with the seediest 
styles -- but none touched klezmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the American Paul Schoenfeld, whose flute concerto, "Klezmer Rondos," 
recently recorded on Argo, is attracting a great deal of attention just about 
everywhere except Israel, where he lives on a kibbutz and where klezmer 
remains, at least in high culture circles, declasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld, himself, says that his attraction to klezmer had little to do with 
his ethnic background. A converted modernist, the first time he heard klezmer 
he had the same reaction that he had when he heard Scott Joplin piano rags for 
the first time. He liked it. And he likes to use music he likes in his music, 
whether that music happens to be swing or country fiddle music or klezmer. 
</P>
<P>
 But, now, there is no predicting where klezmer will turn up next. Later this 
season, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center will perform a new chamber 
piece, "Seven Prayers of Isaac the Blind," for clarinet and string quartet, by 
the Argentine composer of Russian Jewish parents, Osvaldo Golijov. Golijov, a 
composer much in demand these days and a particular favorite of the Kronos 
Quartet, lives in Boston and writes in a style that has much in common with the 
intense spiritual minimalism very in vogue in Eastern Europe and the Russian 
republics. But his new quintet happens to be written for the klezmer 
clarinetist Goira Feidman. 
</P>
<P>
 There is but one parallel in recent years to this klezmer craze. Despite the 
growing interest in world music, the tango is the only other ethnic musical 
style that has a widespread assimilation into pop and classical, dance, music 
theater, performance art, opera, as well as uptown and downtown venues, all at 
the same time. And if it keeps up like this, klezmer could well become the next 
tango.

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS; A RETURN TO MONTECITO FOR HORNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cariaga, Daniel Cariaga is The Times' music writer.

<TEXT>

 There is logic and symmetry in Marilyn Horne's returning, in the summer of 
1997, to the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, to become director of 
the vocal program at that summer conservatory: In the early 1950s, the 
now-celebrated mezzo-soprano was a student there of the late Lotte Lehmann, the 
legendary German soprano who founded the then-new program. 
</P>
<P>
 Horne's connection to the famous summer school continued in subsequent years 
through her association with pianist-vocal coach Gwendolyn Koldofsky, a 
longtime member of the academy faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer's assumption of duties in Montecito will actually begin in 1995, 
with "a few master classes," Horne said on the phone from her home in New York 
recently. She will spend half of the summer there in 1996, then become full 
time with the academy's 50th anniversary, the following summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about her return to Santa Barbara, Horne several times indicated some 
trepidation at inheriting the mantle of both Lehmann and the late Martial 
Singher, who between them, and for 40 years, inspired and launched virtually 
three generations of budding singers through their summer classes at 
Miraflores, the academy's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see," she replied self-deprecatingly upon being told she now belongs to 
a solid tradition. "I'm making no predictions," she said later. At the end of 
our conversation, she repeated, "I hope I am up to the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being retired, the 60-year-old singer continues her association with 
the Metropolitan Opera (where she appears in two operas this season), and this 
month has been engaged in a two-segment European recital tour. But she 
acknowledges that "I really enjoy teaching. And that was a surprise to me, 
until I considered that, whenever -- in all these years of singing on the stage 
-- I gave advice to other singers, I was already teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 The day before this conversation, indeed, Horne had been giving a master class 
at Yale University. Among other places her "Vocal Workshops" have been situated 
has been the stage of Carnegie Hall in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her continuing performances, the singer spends time and energy on her 
recently formed foundation, which aims to bolster the declining fortunes of the 
song recital through support of young artists dedicated to the form. She talks 
about a benefit for the foundation, scheduled in Alice Tully Hall on her next 
birthday, Jan. 16, which will raise money for foundation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within five years, we expect to be funding 25 recitals a year." 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment at Santa Barbara was not something she sought, she says. "I 
never wanted to be part of a formal (academic faculty), but when David Kuehn 
(president of the academy) came to talk to me, it sounded like the perfect 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the time of life. Transition is here. The thing is, I didn't realize it 
would be so easy." 
</P>

 BRIEFLY: In 1995, the Carmel Bach Festival will again offer three weeks of 
performances, July 15-Aug. 6. Besides the Sunset Center in downtown Carmel, 
other venues for festival events include the Carmel Mission Basilica, the 
Chapel in the Forest at Pebble Beach and the sanctuary at All Saints Church. .

ART; THIS BOISE LIFE, OR HUT HUT HOUDINI; MATTHEW BARNEY'S ART IS A MULTIMEDIA 
EXPLORATION OF HIS BODY IN RITUALIZED PERFORMANCES THAT EXPLORE ENDURANCE,

 When something truly new turns up in the art world, nobody knows quite how to 
talk about it at first. New words and categories are by necessity coined to 
accommodate unprecedented methods of art-making. Such has been the case with 
New York-based artist Matthew Barney. Just 27, Barney has made only eight 
pieces so far, but each has elicited intense scrutiny from the art world and 
generated reams of theoretical analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly does he do? It's hard to describe, exactly, but essentially 
through a series of arcane videos, performances, photographs, drawings and 
sculpture, he's conducting a highly abstracted multimedia exploration of his 
own body. Barney, a former football player who put himself through Yale by 
working as a model, examines ideas of physical transformation in ritualized 
performances that explore endurance, androgyny and self-imposed restraint. His 
work functions simultaneously on several levels, however, and also can be read 
in terms of Formalist sculpture, spatial relationships and medical biology. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to create a language that can be understood on its own terms. 
It's like inventing a universe, and it doesn't happen overnight, because it's a 
cumulative process. But I have faith that art can unfold in its own time and on 
its own terms," says Barney, the subject of an exhibition at Regen Projects in 
West Hollywood through Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I've done is part of a single ongoing work about the balance 
inside a specific organism, and each project locates different pressure points 
within that organism and describes it further. I certainly draw from my 
experience, but I wouldn't describe the work as autobiographical." 
</P>
<P>
 Barney's debut in New York in 1991 at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery was hailed 
by the New York Times as "an extraordinary first show," and since then he has 
been able to support himself through his art. He was included in last year's 
Whitney Biennial and the 1992 Documenta and is currently in the midst of a 
massive project that will take three years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-site piece, titled "Cremaster," includes actions performed in a 
football stadium in Boise, Ida. (where Barney grew up), an icecap, a room at 
the top of the Chrysler Building, a racetrack on the Isle of Man and a 
bathhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the exhibition at Regen Projects are photographic stills and 
drawings from "Cremaster 4," a 40-minute video shot this year at the Isle of 
Man, which makes up the first part of "Cremaster." The video will premiere next 
month at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and will also screen in an 
exhibition in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, next September. Barney hopes to 
complete the second part of the piece at the football stadium in Idaho in the 
summer and then move on to the bathhouse segment the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with the artist, who took an afternoon break from installing his show 
to sit in an empty parking lot and talk about his work, one encounters a 
slender, soft-spoken young man dressed in regulation artist garb (a thermal 
T-shirt, black jeans and work boots). 
</P>
<P>
 The aggression necessary for Barney to perform his fanatically focused actions 
is completely absent when he's out of character, and he comes across as a 
gentle man with a good sense of humor. There's nothing slick about him either, 
and he's clearly new to being interviewed; asked a question, he can comfortably 
sit in silence for an unbelievably long time until he arrives at an answer he's 
comfortable uttering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cremaster is the set of muscles that pull the internal sexual organs back up 
into the body when the temperature drops -- it functions sort of like a 
thermostat," says Barney, lighting a cigarette that he smokes with the same 
slow care with which he speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The configuration of those muscles has been in every project I've done since 
1990, and 'Cremaster' explores the form of those muscles in five different 
states. The first action, shot at the Isle of Man, involves a race -- a single 
rotation around the island creates the linear movement of the piece. Each 
action involves a different cast of characters, all of whom land somewhere 
between 1910 and 1920. That was a period of physical culture when health cults 
first started appearing, Harry Houdini was working and the Victorian 
relationship to physicality was overthrown." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cremaster 4" has clear links with Barney's last multisite work, "Ottoshaft," 
which revolved around the central metaphors of former Oakland Raiders center 
Jim Otto and escape artist Harry Houdini. For "Ottoshaft," Barney made a 
three-hour climb across the ceiling at Regen Projects in the nude, making his 
way to a refrigerated chamber where sporting equipment coated with Vaseline was 
stored. For a segment of the piece Barney appeared in drag, dressed in a white 
swimsuit and turban a la Lana Turner -- which prompts the question of whether 
he intends that there be humor in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah," he says, "I find it funny -- it's humorous in a tragic way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always a Raiders fan," he says in explaining "Ottoshaft," "and during 
the years Al Davis coached them they developed an aerial attack that made 
football much more interesting to watch on television. I wanted to deal with 
the point where preparation ended and the ball went into play, so I needed to 
use a center, and Otto interested me because of his number, which was 00. For 
me, that second zero is like a roving orifice that allows Otto to exist in an 
undifferentiated state of sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houdini had an intelligence that was completely visceral, and his art dealt 
with restraint, which is also central to my work. As is true in my work, 
Houdini's restraints were self-imposed, and through discipline he developed an 
intuitive understanding of them. People would invent locks to hold Houdini, but 
he understood the form of the lock so well that none could hold him. Houdini's 
work also dealt with time, which interests me as well. In wrestling, a 
two-minute round goes by in your head in five seconds -- things move so fast 
that you can't intellectualize wrestling moves, and you have to know where 
somebody else's body is in relationship to yours by feeling pressure on 
different points of your body. You can only learn to do that through outrageous 
amounts of repetition and training." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been suggested by several critics that Barney is lampooning the 
zealotry and skewed sexuality of sports. He says, however, "I have no interest 
in satire. Yes, there's a lot of sexual energy in the cycle of training, which 
is highly psychological space, and that interests me. But I'm less interested 
in the more obvious sexual metaphors in sports -- receiving, penetration and so 
forth. Every once in a while I go to a sporting event, but I've never really 
been much of a sports fan," Barney adds, casually smashing one of the central 
tenets of much of the critical analysis of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Barney was born in San Francisco in 1967, where he lived until he was 7, and 
is the younger of two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father worked in food service, and my mother was an artist who made 
abstract paintings, so I grew up with art around," he recalls. "We moved to 
Boise in 1974 because my father got a job there. Idaho is a very conservative 
place, and I was lucky I had an aptitude for football because it helped me get 
the hell out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was recruited by Yale in 1985 to play football and planned to go into 
premed, but I also intended to study art. I discovered you can't do more than 
one thing in a serious way at Yale, though, because there are a lot of very 
ambitious people there, and the art took over fairly quickly for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making objects and paintings early on, and the paintings led to 
experiments in my studio that I referred to as 'Drawing Restraint Pieces,' " he 
says of work that found him creating conditions that made drawing as difficult 
as possible. He would attach himself to rubber cords, for instance, and strain 
up an incline to make a mark on the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was finding his own voice as an artist, Barney was paying his bills 
through modeling and discovered that his moonlighting gig was feeding into the 
art he was making. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working as a model taught me how to detach myself from my body and use it as 
a raw material. It was a good job and I learned a lot doing it, but it's a 
little frustrating to not be able to control your own degradation," he says 
with a laugh. "So I'm glad I no longer need to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started the 'Drawing Restraint Pieces,' I was trying to locate 
different pressure points and psychological narrative zones that I already 
understood in my body as an athlete. Having spent several years thinking about 
those zones, I developed a set of ideas that led to a definition of sculpture I 
wanted to free myself from. By transforming those ideas into a structure of 
narrative conflict, and developing characters to act out those conflicts, I 
found a way to explore the relationship I'd always had with my body as an 
athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 Barney's obvious forebears are Vito Acconci, Joseph Beuys, Chris Burden and 
Bruce Nauman, particularly in their more temporal performance work, and he 
concedes that "their work was important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "But because of the nature of it," he says, "I never actually saw any of it. 
My experience was with the secondary form those actions took -- the 
documentation -- which led me to reconstruct those events in my mind in ways 
I'm sure are inaccurate. I think that's OK, though, and is in the spirit of 
that work." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Acconci, Beuys and Burden, Barney has never done a live performance in 
public, and he says that "the idea of performing live doesn't appeal to me. I 
don't want to be an entertainer and don't work with an audience, because these 
aren't performances -- they're video actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm planning to do something live in a year and a half in Frankfurt, but 
generally I hate theater. I want the characters to exist simultaneously in an 
external space and to be able to fold into an internal space, to fluctuate in 
scale and maintain themselves as parts of a sculptural whole, and for me that 
doesn't happen so easily in theater. On the other hand, I'm interested in 
dealing with the space of a theater and would like to make a piece that is the 
theater it takes place in." 
</P>
<P>
 Barney's work, described by critic Jerry Saltz as "the most labor-intensive 
art I've ever seen," invariably telegraphs a sense of herculean effort and 
danger. One senses he could hurt himself doing the things he does for the video 
camera, and Barney concedes that "some of the actions have been very 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't intend that the actions look difficult," he says. "If I were to 
make a great piece, I think it would appear to be effortless because that's the 
nature of a great work of art -- I've yet to do one, though." Vital Stats

 'The field behind us was full of tents with people just sitting around, 
smoking a few joints and listening to the music," recalls Paul Hartnoll. "I've 
never seen such a huge crowd in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartnoll, who with his older brother Phil makes up Orbital, the most 
compelling force in '90s British dance music, is talking about the 
10,000-strong Ravestock, the all-night dance party at Woodstock '94. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, Ravestock provided a symbolic merger of the once warring dance and 
rock cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part is that I don't think a lot of the audience at Woodstock had 
gone there for a rave or anything like that," Hartnoll says, "but we got a 
wonderful response from the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Deee-Lite, Aphex Twin, the Orb and a handful of big-name deejays spinning 
records were also at Ravestock, but Orbital is the act that sets the standards 
in the '90s for the merger of dance and rock sensibilities -- and the one best 
equipped to reflect on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Orbital has been wowing adventurous music fans since 1990, when its debut 
single, "Chime," marked it as one of the most assured forces in the techno 
genre. A melding of sounds that featured a gorgeous melody, shifting rhythms 
and a crisp, sparse groove, the single is now considered a dance classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chime" made the Hartnoll brothers darlings of the techno set, but they don't 
view themselves as techno artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing influences as diverse as arty electro-pop group Cabaret Voltaire, 
punk's Dead Kennedys, industrial rock and '70s movie soundtracks, the twosome 
-- who will perform at a rave on Saturday at the Long Beach Exhibit Hall -- 
insist they don't want to be identified with any single genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Labeling our music as techno is really limiting," Paul Hartnoll says. "The 
only description I can ever really stomach is 'electronic music,' and that only 
covers the technical side of how it is made. It's not really saying anything 
about what type of music it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hartnolls were born and reared in West Kent, a rural suburb of London, and 
had little formal training in music. In fact, they took only a handful of piano 
lessons, the family piano ending up little more than a conversation piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dad was a builder, and he always ended up bringing home the odd bit of 
furniture from when he worked in someone's home," says Phil, 30, who speaks 
with none of the aloofness often associated with the British rock scene. "Once 
a year they got the piano tuned so it would be there if we wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the home was always filled with music. Their parents loved 
records, and their father was especially fond of film soundtracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to get up on Sunday morning and our dad would be blaring the theme to 
'Shaft,' " says Paul, 26. "The Carpenters were another big favorite in our 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 As teen-agers, the brothers had varied tastes. In addition to the punk and 
industrial music that was all around them, they fell in love with electro-pop 
and the faster, more electronic variation of disco known as HI-NRG (pronounced 
"high energy"). 
</P>
<P>
 "The only real exposure HI-NRG got in England at the time was in gay clubs 
that we didn't know anything about," Paul says. "We'd stumble over it in the 
record stores, and we thought we were the only people in England listening to 
the stuff. That and the electro-pop is what finally pushed us into getting a 
drum machine, and that's how the whole thing started." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul eventually finished the equivalent of American high school, landing work 
doing odd jobs in a London recording studio when he was 18. Phil dropped out of 
school when he was 16. Prodded by his father, he worked for a few years in 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated every second of it," Phil says emphatically. "The attitudes and the 
bigotries (of many co-workers) were totally against everything I stood for, and 
it was a horrible period in my life. I got away from that as soon as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 His escape came after he and Paul began experimenting at home with a cheap 
drum machine and a synthesizer. Some early solo tracks Paul did for a 
compilation album led to a contract with FFRR Records. 
</P>
<P>
 With the release of "Chime," they not only changed the course of their own 
lives but also helped take the entire techno dance movement to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 On their 1992 debut album, "Orbital," and 1993's "Orbital 2," the Hartnolls 
were obviously influenced by both the sugary pop and the sweeping film scores 
they'd grown up with. That lightness gains emotional weight when mixed with the 
current of darkness culled from their punk and industrial roots. Balancing 
frenetic beats and samples from films and other records against minimalist 
grooves, they created a standard for beauty and harshness that few others have 
been able to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Neil Harris, director of artists and repertoire at FFRR Records, "What 
makes them stand out in the electronic music field is that there is a lot more 
humanity in their music, both in the thought process that goes into it and in 
the way they interact with their machines." 
</P>
<P>
 With the recently released album "Snivilisation," on the FFRR/London label, 
those alternative backgrounds are more pronounced than ever. Where the first 
two albums were essentially collections of independent tracks that the duo had 
already been working on, they set out this time to write a cohesive album from 
start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 What separates the new record from the earlier albums is its experimentation 
with more traditional rock song structures, which helps emphasize the 
alternative-rock elements. There is also more emphasis on the non-sampled human 
voice, courtesy of some ethereal female vocals that the Hartnolls see as a 
continuation of their trademark ambiguity -- the link between their new and 
older works. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can almost make up your own words," Phil says. "I find that very 
appealing because it opens the album up not only across language barriers but 
even (among) fans that speak English. By not being so linear, by not being so 
set in meaning, it's more inclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many dance-oriented artists, especially those affiliated with the 
studio-bound creations of techno, either dread performing live or are awkward 
in that situation, the Hartnolls thrive on the exchange of energy that comes 
with playing before a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love performing live," says Phil, looking forward to the Long Beach date 
-- one of just three shows on a brief North American swing. "We get to 
improvise the songs, to play around with the structure and feed off the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds his brother: "We hope to get a real mixture of types to come out. . . . I 
don't like the elitist attitude that exists in the techno scene, the clinging 
to one area of music at the exclusion of any others. We want to try to bring as 
many different people together as possible. That's our goal."

PRIVATE LIVES; YES, PARENTS, THERE IS A SANITY CLAUSE; SHOPPING WITH THE KIDS 
DURING THE HOLIDAYS DOESN'T HAVE TO TRY EVERYONE'S PATIENCE. SOME MALLS ARE 
GOING ALL OUT TO COURT FAMILIES' BUSINESS.

 Entertaining a child in a mall is no easy feat, as most heartily embrace the 
credo "I'd rather be at Chuck E. Cheese's." 
</P>
<P>
 But parents who need to drag their children along while holiday shopping, take 
heart. Though some shopping meccas -- such as Beverly Center -- are geared more 
toward adult shoppers, many others willingly woo little consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 By entertaining kids and making them feel special -- and sometimes with the 
help of a few money-saving inducements for their parents -- savvy marketing 
types can sell consumers on the idea that shopping can be enjoyable, even 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of whining, complaints and other assorted verbalizations of boredom 
can be minimized when parents choose their destinations well, with their 
children's needs clearly in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a kid who loathes being inside might fare better at Century City 
Shopping Center and Marketplace, one of the few large alfresco shopping centers 
in Los Angeles. Cool breezes blow through the walkways. Fourteen movie theaters 
offer diversions. The extensive food court houses 22 eateries. 
</P>
<P>
 The sit-down dining here will also tempt the kiddies. Few can resist the pull 
of Dive! -- the novel submarine-themed restaurant (whose investors include 
filmdom's Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg). The seagoing design is 
complete with portholes and recorded voice-overs describing diving expeditions, 
periscope depths and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as actually shopping with and for the kids, the mall has a variety of 
toy and curiosity shops. Imaginarium, which features educational, scientific 
and environmentally sensitive toys, is a favorite with children. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those who love animals, the display cases at the pet store Chien et 
Chat house a variety of exotic reptiles. It's a popular gathering spot for the 
curious, though parents might want to bone up on the "no, we're not buying an 
iguana today" speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Videos play inside the Disney Store, which also surrounds shoppers with 
tempting goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's clothing stores include the ever-popular GapKids and Mille Petites 
Fleurs, a shop featuring European and domestic fashions, and Petit Jardin 
Children's Shoes, offering complementary footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 10250 Santa Monica Blvd., (310) 277-3898.  
</P>
<P>
 The Del Amo Fashion Center is so large (before Mall of America, it was the 
nation's largest) that you'll actually find two Kay-Bee Toys and five sports 
equipment stores under the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Animated movies and cartoons blare continuously inside the newly expanded 
Disney Store and the Warner Bros. Studio Store, home to assorted Looney Tunes 
paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall also houses 12 theaters and a variety of children's clothing shops, 
including GapKids, Limited Too and Kid's Foot Locker. And when it comes to 
food, parents can select from among the four dozen restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hawthorne Boulevard at Carson Street, Torrance, (310) 542-8525.  
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Plaza's giant indoor carousel ($1 per ride), decked with 
elaborately painted horses and playing whimsical music, is probably enough to 
draw most young children to the mall. But across Bear Street, in the 
less-crowded Crystal Court section of the mall, the Launch Pad awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 For $5, kids ages 5 through 12 can operate more than 30 hands-on scientific 
exhibits. The facility offers previews of what the public will find inside the 
Discovery Science Center, scheduled to open in Orange County in about two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pint-size fashion plates will find stylish apparel and shoes in both parts of 
the mall, at stores that include GapKids, Benetton 012, Jacadi, 
Stride-Rite/Keds and Friends, and a new preteen boutique inside Judy's. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the stores with toys and amusements: the Disney Store, Sesame Street 
General Store, Sanrio Gift Gate and FAO Schwarz, a branch of one of the world's 
most famous toy emporiums. Fifty or so eateries offer light snacks to full 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3333 Bristol St., Costa Mesa, (714) 435-2000.  
</P>
<P>
 At Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, children are treated with all the respect 
accorded adult consumers and even have a play area and shopping-incentive 
program, called Kid's Club, just for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The free club meets regularly at 6 p.m. every Tuesday inside a "playhouse" 
(meetings are supervised). The club will be on hiatus during December, however, 
but will resume in January. In the interim, Santa Claus will be available for 
consultations in various spots throughout the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Members (that's kids, not their parents) receive discounts and other benefits 
from participating mall merchants year-round, and there are special purchasing 
incentives on a child's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several stores featuring fashions and toys for kids, such as 
BabyGap, Cuddle Me, Kids Mart, Imaginarium, Gymboree and Warner Bros. Studio 
Store. Even the food court has tiny tables and chairs just for the younger set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6600 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Canoga Park, (818) 594-8740.  
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Town Center will offer special children's entertainment such as 
marionettes and musical acts throughout the holidays, beginning Saturday. Among 
the stores of interest to kids are Cartoon Junction, Kay-Bee Toys, Sanrio 
Surprises, Recordtown and Edo Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 24201 W. Valencia Blvd., Valencia, (805) 287-9050.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kid's Club at Westside Pavilion meets at 5 p.m every Wednesday in the food 
court. Entertainment, crafts and other activities for children are featured. 
(Note: Parents must bring and stay with their children.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bergstroms, Brooks Shoes for Kids, GapKids and Limited Too offer clothing and 
accessories their sizes. One children's fashion store -- Gymboree -- also 
offers games, crafts and activities such as climbing exercises for parents and 
children up to age 5 to work on together once they have officially shopped 
until they dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 10800 W. Pico Blvd., (310) 474-6255.

THOUSAND OAKS DOUBLES UP; CROSS-COUNTRY: LANCERS WIN BOYS' AND GIRLS' SOUTHERN 
SECTION DIVISION I CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's too bad high school cross-country races weren't always contested over a 
three-mile distance. 
</P>
<P>
 If they had been, it would be much easier to compare the 1972 Lompoc High 
boys' team -- regarded by some as the best in state history -- to this year's 
Thousand Oaks squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc won the 1972 Southern Section 4-A Division title -- held on a two-mile 
course -- by an astounding 26-118 score over runner-up Palos Verdes. But 
Thousand Oaks' 29-111 victory over Peninsula in the Division I race of 
Saturday's section finals at Mt. San Antonio College nearly equaled that 
winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, paced by individual winner Eleazar Hernandez, was third with 117 
points, followed by Hart at 122. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, led by runner-up Kim Mortensen, was also victorious in the 
Division I girls' race. Thousand Oaks became the first program to win boys' and 
girls' major-division section titles in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' race, Keith O'Doherty was Thousand Oaks' highest finisher with a 
third-place time of 15 minutes 16 seconds, but he was followed by senior 
teammates Jeff Fischer (fourth in 15:18) and Kevin Marsden (fifth in 15:19). 
</P>
<P>
 Add juniors Todd Disney (13th in 15:34) and Josh Carolan (16th in 15:42) to 
the equation and the Lancers posted a cumulative time of 77:09, which slashed 
47 seconds off the course record the team set in last year's meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought if we got really, really good weather, we had a chance at the 
team-time record," Coach Jack Farrell said. "But I thought it would be by a few 
seconds. I had no idea it would be by this much." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of cool, clear weather conditions, Thousand Oaks won its 
third consecutive Division I title to become the first boys' team since Compton 
in 1950-52 to win three major division championships in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which brought up the obvious question: Is Thousand Oaks the best boys' 
team in state history? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say how we'd compare against Lompoc because they ran two miles 
back then," Farrell said. "But I definitely think we're the best team since 
they started running three miles in 1977." 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' race, Mortensen timed 18:00 to finish second behind Courtney 
Pugmire (17:45) of Esperanza, and teammates Bridget Roy (18:47) and Tara 
Marsden (18:49) added ninth-and 10th-place efforts to pace the Lancers to a 
54-79 victory over Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, the defending State Division I champion, finished third with 99 
points, followed by El Toro at 109. 
</P>
<P>
 The top four teams in each race and the top five individuals not on a 
qualifying team advanced to the state championships in Fresno next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff made a clean sweep of the Division III titles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' race, senior Javier Ramirez timed 15:10 to win his second 
consecutive championship and the Rangers defeated second-place El Modena, 
58-93. Nordhoff's team time of 79:46 was the third fastest of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Elaine Canchola continued her meteoric rise in the girls' race by 
setting a freshman course record of 17:35 and leading the Rangers to a 69-85 
victory over El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola, who burst onto the scene in finishing third behind Amy Skieresz of 
Agoura and Mortensen in the Ventura County championships last month, had the 
fastest girls' time of the meet and cut two seconds off the previous freshman 
course record set by Agoura's Deena Drossin in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought about coming up with a race plan for her this week," Nordhoff 
Coach Ken Reeves said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we figured the only thing we could teach her is to run slower." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and Adalberto Sanchez of Capistrano Valley staged the best 
individual dual of the meet in the Division I boys' race. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who paced last week's preliminaries with a 15:08 clocking, appeared 
to have the race won after opening up a 20-meter lead on Hernandez with 
three-quarters of a mile left.  
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez caught him at the top of the last hill on the course and 
gradually pulled away in the final 400 meters to win by a second in 14:54. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he had me," Hernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But he died up that last hill. I think he went out too fast and used up too 
much energy in the first part of the race. When it came time to kick, he didn't 
have anything left." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, local runners won five team and six individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Arce of Palmdale ran 15:10 to hold off defending champion John Greene 
(15:13) of Agoura in the Division II boys' race as the Falcons defeated Mater 
Dei, 74-77, for their first section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz ran 17:50 to win the Division II girls' race and Shaluinn Fullove of 
Louisville won the Division IV title in 19:15. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Skieresz won her third consecutive section title, she was 
disappointed with her time, which was 26 seconds slower than her personal best 
at Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it was, but I just didn't run very well," she said. "I 
didn't have any specific time in mind, but I wanted to run a lot faster than I 
did."

NOT LOSING HOPE, CSUN JUST LOSES

 Quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin struggled to find the words to describe his senior 
season at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 He pushed his baseball cap back on his head and searched for the appropriate 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bunch of great guys who had to deal with a lot of frustration," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Add another log to the fire. Northridge had a chance to win down the stretch 
but lost to Cal State Sacramento, 23-22, Saturday night in an American West 
Conference football game before 1,628 at Hornet Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (3-7, 0-3 in the conference) lost its fifth game in a row, the 
longest losing streak in Coach Bob Burt's nine-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors had the ball in the closing minutes and a chance to end the skid. 
</P>
<P>
 However, cornerback Marvin Brown intercepted O'Laughlin's pass at the 
Sacramento 45 with 2:45 remaining and the Matadors were dealt a final, crushing 
blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we were playing, I was so confident we'd make it happen," Burt said. 
"We didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge held a 19-16 lead entering the fourth quarter, but it didn't stand 
up long. Sacramento's ground attack, slowed to a halt in the first half, 
lumbered into gear just in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Jesse Klinge scored on a 12-yard rumble up the middle with 12:29 
remaining to hand the Hornets (5-5, 2-1) a 23-19 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge didn't cave in. The Matadors drove to the Sacramento eight and Matt 
Ornelaz kicked a 26-yard field goal -- his third of the game -- to bring 
Northridge to within a point with 7:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors' defense, which allowed 290 yards, made a huge stand on 
Sacramento's next possession. Faced with fourth and two at the Northridge 23, 
Sacramento pulled its field-goal unit off the field and elected to go for the 
first down. However, quarterback Joe Garofalo scrambled and was knocked out of 
bounds for a one-yard loss by linebacker Joe Pierro. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin's 17-yard completion to Duc Ngo moved the Matadors to their 41, but 
Brown made the play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping I wouldn't drop it," Brown said. "I didn't look it into my 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a few Northridge players, seniors and underclassmen alike, shed 
tears afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing, extremely disappointing," tight end Travis Hall said. 
"Going into the season, there was no doubt in my mind that we'd win the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Matadors finished dead last. But in comparison with the four 
previous losses, the game was definitely "a moral victory," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it as another kick in the pants," Burt said. "We had every reason 
on God's earth to fold and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge played its best overall game in at least a month. O'Laughlin 
completed 27 of 45 passes for 278 yards and a touchdown. The defense held 
Sacramento to 120 yards in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been a tough year," O'Laughlin said. "We made the best of what we 
could." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento took a 16-13 lead when Jake Hoffart caught a screen pass and ran 27 
yards for a touchdown with 6:24 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin connected with David Romines (eight catches, 95 yards) from 18 
yards as Northridge reclaimed the lead, 19-16, with 45 seconds left in the 
quarter. But Ornelaz missed only his second extra point of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge seemingly had taken control in the final moments of the first half, 
but a special-teams letdown killed the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Mark Harper (18 carries, 57 yards) scored from two yards to finish 
off one of the Matadors' best series in weeks, a 17-play, 72-yard drive. The 
score gave Northridge a 13-3 lead with 2:58 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Demetryst Cornish returned the kickoff 49 yards to the Northridge 
39-yard line. Cornish scored six plays later on a five-yard run to bring 
Sacramento to within 13-9. The extra-point attempt was blocked by lineman Oscar 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors crossed midfield on their first four possessions of the game, two 
of which were converted into field goals of 43 and 31 yards by Ornelaz. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento closed to within 6-3 on a 27-yard field goal by Tyson Becker with 
10:14 remaining in the half. Matador Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In a game that decided the AWC title, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo defeated 
Southern Utah, 35-21. Cal Poly finished 3-0. Had Southern Utah won, there would 
have been a three-way tie for the title.

TAKING THE LONG WAY, MOORPARK WINS, 39-35 
</P>

<P>
 Trailing by a point after three quarters, Moorpark College rallied to defeat 
Santa Barbara, 39-35, Saturday night in a Western State Conference Northern 
Division football game. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Raiders (8-2, 8-1 in WSC play) the division title for the 
third consecutive year. Santa Barbara (5-5, 5-4) had been one game behind 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 It also meant that the Raiders will play in the Strawberry Bowl at Cerritos on 
Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders used a pair of long touchdown pass plays from Damian Delfino to 
Isaiah Mustafa to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfino and Mustafa hooked up on a 61-yard pass play with 3 minutes 17 seconds 
remaining that put Moorpark ahead, 33-29. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, Santa Barbara took a 29-26 lead on a three-yard pass from 
Jarrod DeGeorgia to Simon Banks and a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfino and Mustafa, who finished with 10 receptions for 171 yards, had 
combined on a 55-yard touchdown pass play early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of several long-range passes by Delfino, who was 17 of 23 for 312 
yards. He also had pass plays of 35, 31 and 30 yards to Aaron Whitley. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark got a big defensive play from tackle Eddie Flores, who intercepted a 
deflected pass by DeGeorgia and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown and a 
39-29 advantage with 2:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second interception for Moorpark against DeGeorgia, who was 28 of 
41 for 355 yards and two touchdowns. De Georgia entered the game with 2,713 
passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeorgia found Banks open on a deep slant pattern for an 88-yard touchdown 
pass play seven seconds after Flores' score that cut the Vaqueros' deficit to 
39-35, but could not rally his team one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders pounced on a costly Santa Barbara mistake to take a 17-14 halftime 
lead when it seemed they would go into intermission trailing by four points. 
</P>
<P>
 On a kickoff return after Steve Sabbe pulled Moorpark to within 14-10 with a 
26-yard field goal with 24 seconds left in the second quarter, Banks fumbled 
and Raider John Osoril returned it 24 yards for a touchdown with 12 seconds 
remaining before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara jumped to a 7-0 lead when Chad Marsalek scored on a 14-yard run 
midway through the first quarter. Marsalek broke several half-hearted tackling 
efforts by the Raider defense, which appeared to relax because flags were 
thrown on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros extended their cushion to 14-0 on a two-yard pass from DeGeorgia 
to wide receiver Rick Demarest on a fourth-down play early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark answered a few moments later with the 55-yard touchdown pass play 
from Delfino to Mustafa, cutting the deficit to 14-7.

SYLMAR BEATS FRANKLIN FOR FIRST CITY TITLE; VOLLEYBALL: DESPITE BACK PAIN, 
ARIZA RECORDS 30 KILLS AND 13 ACES IN SPARTANS' FIVE-GAME WIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After the second game of the girls' City Section Division 3-A volleyball 
final, the last thing Sylmar High expected was to battle for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Mayra Ariza had just served nine consecutive points, including six 
service aces, and the Spartans were on the verge of a sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 But Franklin fought back by taking the next two games and scored the first six 
points in the fifth game before Sylmar responded with a 15-11, 15-4, 14-16, 
13-15, 15-11 victory Saturday night at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar clinched its first City title in dramatic fashion, needing five match 
points before Franklin middle blocker Erica Montiel made an error on a kill 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariza, who suffers from chronic back pain, aggravated her back in the fourth 
game but played every point and finished with 30 kills and 13 service aces. 
Eight of the kills came in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my last game, I had to give it 100 percent," Ariza said. "It was now 
or never." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar middle blocker Deanna Turner added 17 kills and six blocks, and outside 
hitter Anne Guevarra added 15 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Franklin (16-1) was led by middle blockers Angelica Barraza and Joy 
Sukphranee. Barraza had 14 kills and 15 blocks and Sukphranee added 19 kills 
and 13 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew with their defense and blocking, there was no way it was going to be 
three games," Sylmar Coach Bob Thomson said. "I thought going in it would be 
four or five." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (16-1) almost depended on Ariza too much. On a game point in the first 
game, Ariza had four consecutive kill attempts without success. But on another 
Sylmar game point, Ariza clinched the victory with her eighth kill of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin raced to a 10-1 lead in the fourth game, but had to hold on for a 
15-13 victory.

GLENDALE STAVES OFF PIERCE IN POINTED SEASON FINALE; FOOTBALL: VAQUEROS WIN, 
57-51. BRAHMAS' MUIR PASSES FOR 530 YARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time this season when members of the Glendale College football 
team entertained notions of a division title and perhaps even a bowl 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Glendale entertained Pierce Saturday in both teams' final game, all 
the Vaqueros were hoping for was a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The got it -- barely -- behind the rushing of Ilan Zilberman and Hector 
Valencia, holding off Pierce, 57-51, in a Western State Conference North 
Division game at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was interrupted for 35 minutes late in the fourth quarter when Pierce 
defensive back Ron McKelvey suffered what appeared to be neck and back injuries 
in a pileup after the Brahmas recovered a Zilberman fumble. McKelvey, reporting 
numbness in his extremities, was placed on a stretcher and was taken by 
ambulance to Glendale Adventist Medical Center where he was undergoing tests 
late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bent over and a landslide of players hit his head," Pierce Coach Bill 
Norton said. "He was moving his feet and hands; the feeling was coming back. I 
think he's going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Zilberman gained 219 yards in 33 and scored on runs of two, one, four and two 
yards for Glendale (5-5 overall, 4-5 in WSC play). Valencia gained 182 yards in 
22 carries and had touchdown runs of one and three yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Both backs recorded season-high yardage totals against the WSC's worst rushing 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Zilberman also returned an onside kick 47 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to have gone to a bowl game," Zilberman said. "Stuff just didn't go 
our way." 
</P>
<P>
 David Muir completed 36 of 57 passes for a season-high 530 yards and six 
touchdowns for Pierce (2-8, 2-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Jibri Hodge had 13 receptions for a season-high 284 yards. Cedrick Meadows 
caught eight passes for 128 yards and two touchdowns, and Iman Mohtashemi added 
eight receptions for 79 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, which never led, had one final chance after Raphael Zavala recovered 
Zilberman's fumble at the Glendale 44-yard line with 19 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But, after the delay due to McKelvey's injury, Muir was sacked. He threw an 
incomplete pass as time expired.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; GOLDEN WEST WINS 6TH STRAIGHT STATE WATER POLO

<P>
 Golden West captured its sixth consecutive State water polo championship 
Saturday, beating Long Beach, 10-6, in the finals of the State tournament at 
Long Beach Belmont Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers (30-3) took an 8-1 lead and held on in the final two quarters to 
win. The victory was the Rustlers' fourth in seven meetings with the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 3-1 lead in the first quarter, Golden West outscored Long 
Beach, 4-0, in the second on goals by John Chomin, Tom Anderson, Matt Braun and 
Jason Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead grew early in the third quarter when Chomin added his second goal to 
make it 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers struggled the rest of the quarter, allowing three goals by Jaime 
Ramirez that helped to pull the Vikings to only two goals down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little flat," Golden West Coach Ken Hamdorf said. "We went away 
from the basics. But when we got back to the basics we were OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach pulled to within three in the fourth quarter on a goal by Stan 
Reyes with 2 minutes 13 seconds remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Rustlers sealed the victory when Young stole the ball, setting up 
Braun for his third goal of the game with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach won, 11-9, in the Southern California tournament final Nov. 12 and 
topped the Rustlers, 13-12, in a South Coast Conference game Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West beat the Vikings, 11-6, in the conference tournament championship 
game Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Rancho Santiago men's basketball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 83, Yavapai (Ariz.) 61 -- Marlon Watson had 15 points and Nick 
Holt had 13 points as Rancho Santiago (3-0) won the championship game. Watson 
also had 10 rebounds and Nathan Small had 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Scott led Yavapai (2-1) with 21 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Fullerton men's basketball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback 78, Fullerton 75 (OT) -- Frank Allen scored eight of Saddleback's 
15 overtime points to lead the Gauchos (4-0) in the championship game. Allen 
finished with 18 points and teammate Micah Kroeger scored 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonconference men's basketball:

rebounds and Josh Porter added 20 points to lead visiting Irvine Valley (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 91, Mesa 65 -- Rod Scheuerman had 18 points and Marquis Patterson 
had 10 assists for host Golden West (1-2).

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / STEVE HENSON: TAFT HAS TROUBLE RECOVERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Garfield players went after the ball the way Garfield the cat goes after a 
plate of lasagna. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft players reacted like frightened kittens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreadors barely held on for a 34-27 first-round City Section 3-A playoff 
victory Friday night after Garfield twice recovered onside kicks in the fourth 
quarter. One led to a touchdown and after recovering a second time, the 
Bulldogs moved to Taft's eight-yard line before time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the film against San Fernando and they don't seem to have the courage 
to step up and grab the ball," Garfield Coach John Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Against San Fernando two weeks ago, Taft failed to recover two consecutive 
onside kicks in the fourth quarter and had to sweat out a 35-28 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft practiced Saturday, the team's first weekend workout this season. The 
onside recovery unit, called "the hands team," worked overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rest of its game clicking, Taft has a good chance to beat powerful 
Dorsey on Wednesday. As long as "the hands" don't turn into paws again. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Footnotes: With three field goals in Notre Dame's 22-17 victory over Santa 
Barbara, Chris Sailer tied the single-season state record of 16. Sailer has 
seven field goals in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignacio Brache, the Village Christian kicker who tied the record a week ago, 
did not attempt a field goal in his team's 19-7 first-round loss to Ontario 
Christian. Brache, a senior, finished his career with 32 field goals, one short 
of the state record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating not to kick but it was more frustrating watching our team 
not score many points," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brache did get off a career-long 70-yard punt in the game and finished the 
season with a 40.1-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer, a former club soccer teammate of Brache, has been the better punter, 
but until recently Brache had a leg up on field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brache's longest was 60 yards and he hit one of 67 yards in pregame warm-ups 
Friday night. Three times in his career he sent kickoffs over the crossbar, a 
distance of 70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer might have three games remaining. Certainly, his presence enhances the 
Knights' chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so great having Chris," said Don Ebenhoch, Notre Dame's 
fullback-linebacker. "With his punting, teams don't get good field position, 
and with his kicking, we get something positive out of almost every drive." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Twelve minutes of fame: In the wildest, most-dramatic quarter played in the 
region, a 5-9, 155-pound junior named Colin Butterfield became the savior for 
Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions withstood three touchdowns by Pasadena in the fourth quarter by 
scoring two of their own and held on to win, 35-32. Butterfield had a hand in 
the three biggest plays. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pasadena scored to pull to pull within 28-26, Butterfield batted down a 
pass on a two-point conversion attempt to preserve Saugus' lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quarterback was scrambling, so I released my man and read his eyes," said 
Butterfield, a defensive back. "He threw toward the middle and I knocked it 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena took a 32-28 lead but Saugus took the kickoff and drove to the 
Bulldogs' eight-yard line. Butterfield took a handoff on a counter play, cut 
behind a block by tackle Beau Cherry and raced into the end zone to give Saugus 
a 35-32 lead with a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even get touched," Butterfield said. "We ran that play a bunch of 
times and got about 10 yards every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena drove to midfield and tried a hitch-and-go pass. Butterfield didn't 
bite on the hitch and made a clinching interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked up the quarterback's audible signals and knew they were going to try 
that," he said. "The quarterback overthrew him and I caught it over my head." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First-round tips of the helmet go to. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Newbury Park for playing like a defending Southern Section champion and 
going for a two-point conversion with under a minute left and Rowland leading, 
21-20. The pass fell incomplete, but the Panthers left the field with their 
heads held high and a 6-5 record in a rebuilding year following their 14-0 mark 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buena Coach Rick Scott for being quasi-diplomatic in the face of a 36-28 
loss to Diamond Bar. Said Scott: "I'm not blaming the officials for the loss, 
but I'm blaming them for ruining my night." 
</P>
<P>
 * Quartz Hill for keeping its cool during a 33-9 upset of Muir while Mustang 
players were being ejected for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jeff Diamond, whose four-touchdown performance against Muir made him the 
most precious gem in Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Birmingham for responding to news of the impending retirement of their 
coach, Chick Epstein, by knocking off No. 1-seeded Reseda in the City 3- A 
playoffs.

DIVISION IV GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL; CALVARY CHAPEL WINS SECOND TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel rolled to its second consecutive Southern Section championship 
Saturday at Cypress College, but no one was taking any bows. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Owens had 20 kills and Jenny Roberts had eight kills and five blocks 
to lead Calvary Chapel to a 15-4, 15-6, 15-6 victory over Santa Ynez in the 
Division IV final. Last season, the Eagles won the Division V championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no individuals on this team," Lynn Lovingier said. "We're all so 
close. It seems like the championship just fell into place." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Owens: "The experience from last season helped a lot. We just went out 
and did what we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Setter Kensy Zulueta had 33 assists. When Santa Ynez's defense tried to key on 
Owens or Jenny Roberts, Sara Roberts helped to keep them honest with five 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingier, who also had five kills and a team-high eight digs, has orally 
committed to Tennessee. Lovingier and Owens, who has committed to Colorado, 
will be the first female athletes from Calvary Chapel to receive Division I 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the top-seeded Eagles (17-4) were favored, the lopsided victory over 
third-seeded Santa Ynez (19-3) took Calvary Chapel Coach Jim Downey by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting a tough match," Downey said. "But this team has been focused 
throughout the playoffs. No one has scored more than eight points in a game 
against us in the playoffs. Everyone has stepped it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel's defense frustrated Santa Ynez's attack throughout the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't mentally focused," Santa Ynez senior Meighan Jackson said. "Their 
defense was really good and their quick hits were hard to block." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jenny Roberts was busy stuffing Pirate middle blocker Meghan 
Mosebar. Three times in the match, Roberts blocked Mosebar, who has orally 
committed to Purdue. Mosebar finished with only seven kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best team we've had in some time," Santa Ynez Coach Kit Myers 
said. "But we'll never be able to compete with a team that plays at that 
level." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pirates were close in Game 3. After a Kristen Farnum ace put Santa 
Ynez one point behind, Owens took over. 
</P>
<P>
 She dinked for a side out, then Zulueta served out the final eight points of 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens had three kills in the run, and two hitting errors by Santa Ynez's 
Ariana Kemnitzer closed out the match. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship for the Eagles was part of the payoff of a tough nonleague 
schedule that Downey set up for his team. Calvary Chapel's four losses came 
against Newport Harbor and Stockton St. Mary's (Division I), San Jose 
Archbishop Mitty (III), and Los Angeles Brentwood (V). All are CIF section 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, those losses showed us that we hate to lose," Lovingier said.

<P>
 Newport Harbor's dismantling of Manhattan Beach Mira Costa in the Division I 
finals was systematic and complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors won, 15-5, 15-1, 15-7, in the Southern Section Division I 
championship match that took only one hour Saturday at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 Misty May, who has orally committed to Long Beach State, had 25 kills and 12 
digs and Melissa Schutz, who has committed to Colorado, had 12 kills for the 
Sailors (23-1), the top-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors, the top-seeded team in the section Division I playoffs, posted 
the most lopsided victory in the history of major division finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa managed only 13 points. The biggest blowout previously came in 1981 
when Irvine defeated Santa Monica, 15-8, 15-2, 15-13, to win the Division 4-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Sailors weren't pushing around any patsies. The Mustangs (28-2) were 
unbeaten in the Ocean League and cruised through the playoffs, including a 
three-game thrashing of Huntington Beach in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed with Mira Costa but we jumped on them early," Newport Harbor 
Coach Dan Glenn said. "That was our best match of the year. I just hope we have 
a few more like that left in us." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the State tournament begins Tuesday. A State Division I title 
eluded the Sailors a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors lost to Corona del Mar in five games during the State Division I 
final last season. The Sea Kings also beat Newport Harbor in four games to win 
the section Division I championship. Those were the second consecutive section 
and state championships for Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's title was the first Southern Section championship for Newport 
Harbor since 1987. That season, player of the year Jenny Evans helped the 
Sailors defeat Corona del Mar in five games of the section Division 5-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who is now married and goes by Jenny Griffith, is an assistant coach at 
Calvary Chapel. Griffith helped the Eagles win the Division IV championship 
earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Griffith might be the best of Newport Harbor's past, their present 
team might be the school's best yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors dominated the match from start to finish. They scored the first 
four points of the match and built a 14-2 lead. Tina Bowman, who had three 
kills and a block, finished off the game with a kill from the middle to make it 
15-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors scored the first 10 points of Game 2 with May posting eight kills. 
But she had plenty of help. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Fairborn finished with eight kills and five digs and setter Jenny Hecker 
had 40 assists and eight digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Esparza, who had six kills, and Lori Garber, who had four kills and 
three blocks, tried to spark the Mustangs in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa took a 2-0 lead before the Sailors scored 13 consecutive points. 
After building the lead to 14-3, Mira Costa battled back to make it 14-7, 
before Schutz ended it with a kill from the right side.

DIVISION V FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; LOARA MAKING THE MOST OF ITS POSTSEASON 
INVITATION 
</P>

 First the Loara Saxons weren't invited to the Southern Section playoffs. Then 
they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are in the second round of the Division V playoffs after upsetting 
Canyon, 10-9, Saturday night at Western High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore quarterback Archie Lappin, who had never taken a varsity snap, 
conducted the Saxons' game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Saxons trailing, 9-6, with 2 minutes 30 seconds remaining, Lappin 
began his fourth drive of the night at the Saxons' 17. He completed six of 
seven passes, including a 40-yard strike to Shane Thompson that put the ball at 
the Comanches' 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Lappin connected with Dalbert Rodriguez on an 18-yard pass that moved the ball 
to the seven. 
</P>
<P>
 After three plays left the Saxons (6-5) at the two, Rob Crabtree kicked an 
18-yard field goal that cleared the crossbar by less that two feet, giving the 
Saxons a 10-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Lappin) came through in the clutch," Loara Coach John de Fries said. "He hit 
some big, big passes. We made the decision to go with him at the end of the 
third quarter because we needed someone to give us a spark." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting quarterback junior Jim Kirkland didn't complete a pass in two 
attempts, and was sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons trailed, 6-0, in the first quarter when Canyon quarterback Adam 
Hoover scored on a five-yard run. The extra-point kick went wide right, leaving 
the Comanches ahead, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But Loara, which plays El Toro this week, answered early in the second quarter 
on a one-yard run by Kerry Peoples, giving the Saxons a 7-6 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon (7-4) jumped ahead with 6:06 left to play on Clay Kilbarger's 26-yard 
field goal.

SAN MARCOS SAVES BEST FOR LAST AGAINST AGOURA; WATER POLO: TOP-SEEDED TEAM 
BEATS CHARGERS, 11-10, WITH LATE GOAL IN DIVISION IV SEMIFINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Nearly upsetting the top-seeded team in the Southern Section Division IV 
playoffs meant little to the Agoura High water polo team. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the Chargers were concerned, it wouldn't have been an upset anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we could beat this team," Agoura Coach Jason Rosenthal said after his 
team lost, 11-10, to San Marcos in the semifinals of the Division IV playoffs 
on Saturday at UC Santa Barbara. "We knew what we had to do, and for 3 1/2 
quarters, we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura didn't trail until Jeff Kircos, a preseason All-American, spun in the 
hole and fired the go-ahead goal just as his cap was being ripped off his head 
with 2 minutes 3 seconds to play in the match. It was Kircos' sixth goal -- 
including three in the fourth quarter -- and it gave San Marcos (21-6) its 
first lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura (20-5) had a chance to tie the score when San Marcos' Marc Klein was 
called for a foul with 49 seconds to play, giving the Chargers a six-on-five 
advantage. Agoura's Joey Vona got off a solid shot from just in front of the 
goal, but it hit goalie Parsa Bonderson squarely in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight seconds to play, Agoura's Andy Cohen took a shot that hit the left 
post, ending the Chargers' hopes in their first semifinal appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach said we played well against the No. 1 team," Agoura senior Chris 
Driscoll said. "I thought we outplayed them, but we made mistakes at crucial 
times and that hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 David Arons and Harvey Wilford each scored three goals for the Chargers. 
Goalie Chris Miko made 13 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 The match could not have been much closer through three quarters. The score 
was tied seven times before Wilford scored on a breakaway with 1:51 to play in 
the third quarter, giving Agoura a 9-7 lead, its largest of the match. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Marcos' defense then tightened. Several times in the fourth quarter, 
the Chargers used up the 35-second shot clock without getting off a good shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't driving much at the end," Wilford said. "They were playing good 
defense on us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals, who will play Santa Barbara on Wednesday for the championship, 
were especially tough on Driscoll, the school's all-time leading scorer with 
202 goals. Driscoll was held to two goals in his final high school match, but 
the loss temporarily overshadowed his statistics and the Chargers' otherwise 
successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty and five," Driscoll said, referring to the Chargers' record. "That's 
not bad, but it's still going to haunt me because I didn't think we went as far 
as we could have."

CRESCENTA VALLEY CLOSES GAP AGAINST LA SERNA BUT FALLS, 6-5; WATER POLO 
PLAYOFFS: FALCONS PUSH TOP-SEEDED TEAM MORE THAN THEY DID IN REGULAR-SEASON 
MATCH.

 Crescenta Valley High's run through the Southern Section Division III water 
polo playoffs came to an abrupt end in the semifinals thanks to a familiar 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 La Serna, the top-seeded team, defeated the Falcons, 6-5, on Saturday at 
Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the teams' regular-season match, which La Serna won, 11-6, 
Crescenta Valley posed a more difficult challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a better ballgame today," Falcon Coach Pete Loporchio said. "I am 
proud of how we battled back." 
</P>
<P>
 La Serna (27-4) held the upper hand most of the match. The Lancers scored two 
quick goals and kept Crescenta Valley on the defensive early. 
</P>
<P>
 However, each time La Serna appeared on the verge of breaking it open, the 
Falcons (24-5) responded. Crescenta Valley scored two goals early in the fourth 
quarter, forcing La Serna to call a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley's Joey Bennett scored on a perfect two-on-one with Eddie Kim, 
closing the gap to 6-5 with 4 1/2 minutes remaining.

SANTA BARBARA TEACHES ROYAL A PAINFUL LESSON; WATER POLO: HIGHLANDERS LOSE, 
18-8, IN SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION IV SEMIFINAL. 
</P>

<P>
 If they learn from their mistakes, the members of the Royal High water polo 
team ought to earn master's degrees out of this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders were slow, sluggish and sloppy and lost, 18-8, to Santa 
Barbara in the semifinals of the Southern Section Division IV playoffs on 
Saturday afternoon at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 But it might not have mattered if Royal had played better. They still might 
not have beaten the second-seeded Dons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to use this film as a training film," Royal Coach Steve Snyder 
said. "What not to do for us and what to do for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara (23-6) features three All-Americans -- Brad Kittridge, Katsuma 
Gufuku and goalie Billy Drown -- and they all did their part in beating Royal. 
Kittridge scored seven goals, Gufuku three. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kittridge) is outstanding," Royal goalie Randy Zielinski said. "Geez. That 
guy's got a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's real fast and he's not a ball hog either. He made some passes when he 
had the shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara, which will play San Marcos on Wednesday for the championship, 
used deft passing to exploit man-advantage situations created by quick 
counterattacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons led, 5-1, after the first quarter and 9-3 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense kind of got burned today," Zielinski said. "They were a better 
fast-break team than us." 
</P>
<P>
 When Zielinski tried to start counterattacks for Royal with long passes down 
the pool, Drown swam out to grab the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally those passes would be fine," Zielinski said, "but that goalie was 
real fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Zielinski made eight saves for Royal (16-12). Bill Bruininga scored three 
goals and Curtis Richeson had two for the Highlanders, who won a share of their 
14th straight Marmonte League title.

BELL-JEFF GETS OVERWHELMED IN SECOND HALF BY BIG BEAR

<P>
 After a dormant first half, the Big Bear High football team came out of 
hibernation, scoring 22 second-half points to beat Bell-Jeff, 28-19, in a 
first-round game of the Southern Section Division X playoffs Saturday night at 
Aquinas High. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 21-13, late in the game, Bell-Jeff quarterback Richard Szeptycki 
connected with David Matekel on a 20-yard scoring pass to close to within 
21-19.The Guards went for a two-point conversion, but Szeptycki's pass sailed 
through the hands of receiver David Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had a good shot at the two-point conversion," Bell-Jeff Coach 
Doug Woodlief said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They grabbed our back coming out of the backfield." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff (6-5) tried an onside kick but the Bears' Jesse Winkler returned 48 
it yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
 Szeptycki completed 17 of 24 passes for 271 yards and three touchdowns. He 
threw scoring strikes of 79 and 20 yards to Matekel (five catches for 151 
yards) and added a 20-yard touchdown pass to Victor Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Bear's Robert Benson completed 10 of 14 passes for 101 yards and a 
touchdown, and scored on a three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 John Clays rushed for 71 yards in seven carries for the Bears (8-2-1). He also 
kicked a 30-yard field goal and returned an interception 32 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff's John Pawlik gained 51 yards in 10 carries.

TAFT GIRLS WILL STAY ON THE RUN; CROSS-COUNTRY: TOREADORS FINISH SECOND IN CITY 
SECTION FINALS TO GAIN FIRST BERTH IN STATE MEET.

<P>
 The Taft High girls' cross-country team placed second to Palisades in the City 
Section finals Saturday but that was about the only disappointment for the 
Toreadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Taft's top five runners ran lifetime bests on the three-mile Pierce 
College course to notch the school's highest finish and its first berth in the 
State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreadors' previous best finish was third in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is the time to run your best race in the biggest meet of the season," 
Taft Coach Mel Hein said. "I'm tickled to death and the girls are tickled to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have asked for anything more today." 
</P>
<P>
 The top two teams and first five individuals not on qualifying teams advanced 
to the State championships Nov. 26 at Woodward Park in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft, a team of underclassmen, came within a point of defeating Palisades in 
the Nov. 9 semifinals, but the Dolphins placed three runners among the top 
seven Saturday to win their first title in 13 years with 54 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft had 64 points, third-place Huntington Park 109 and five-time defending 
champion Belmont 127. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew all season (Palisades) was the team to beat and we were proud to be 
only one point away from the last week," Hein said. "We talked about the 
difference between being the bride and bridesmaid, but we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft junior Sedaf Sehati, who lowered her best by 28 seconds, was ninth in 19 
minutes 43 seconds. Junior Michele Klein was 11th in 19:50. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Daisy Roque (20:23), sophomore Jill Fairchild (20:24) and freshman 
Francis Santin (20:41) rounded out the Toreadors' scoring in 22nd, 23rd and 
24th place. Roque lowered her best by 17 seconds and Fairchild took 27 seconds 
off her best to set a school record for 10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to have run the best this season," Sehati said. "Our goal was to 
qualify and we thought if we stayed focused and concentrated on it we could 
make it as a team."  
</P>
<P>
 Brooke Page of Granada Hills bolted to a quick lead in the first mile before 
she was overtaken by Belmont's Delfina Martinez shortly after the halfway mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez cruised to a 14-second victory over Elizabeth Bernier of Hamilton in 
18:58 while Page, who came into the meet with the fastest qualifying time, 
faded to sixth in 19:29. Page and 10th-place finisher Sarah Wilkes of El Camino 
Real (19:49) qualified for the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have much pressure last week," Page said. "This race was a learning 
experience for me. Next time, I'll do better. You never know what's going to 
happen during a race. You have to expect the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to prepare as much as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' division, Garfield, paced by runner-up Richard Martinez (15:25) 
and seventh- and ninth-place finishes by David Jimenez (15:54) and Eddie 
Sanchez (16:00), edged Palisades, 43-48, to win its first City title since 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time champion Belmont, winner of 10 of the last 12 City championships, was 
third with 65 points. Birmingham (104) was fourth, Monroe (131) fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Gilmore of Palisades won the three-mile race in 14 minutes 56 seconds -- 
the fastest winning time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Cortes of Reseda finished fourth in 15:35 to qualify for the State meet. 
Birmingham's Jose Torres (15:59) and Alejandro Tinajero (16:04) qualified by 
finishing eighth and 11th. Poly's Uzzrel Gray (16:03) qualified by finishing 
10th.

L.A. BAPTIST EXPERIENCES ITS FIRST LOSS IN LAST MATCH; GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL: YOUNG 
KNIGHTS (19-1) BEATEN BY TOP-SEEDED BRENTWOOD IN FINAL.

 There is no substitute for experience. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist High learned that lesson the hard way Saturday when top-seeded 
Brentwood won the Southern Section Division V girls' volleyball championship at 
Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (18-1), defending state champions, took advantage of mistakes and 
tentative play by the Knights to post a 15-4, 15-10, 11-15, 15-6 victory over 
previously undefeated L.A. Baptist (19-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned what it takes to win big matches when we lost in the (Southern 
Section) quarterfinals last year," Brentwood Coach Jeff Porter said of his 
team, which won the state title after gaining an at-large berth. "We didn't 
change our game plan at all. We played with more confidence than them."  
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood benefited from three net violations, two rotation errors and five 
service errors by the Knights to build a 12-2 lead in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure got to us," L.A. Baptist Coach Sue Newcomb said. "The first two 
games -- that was our inexperience coming out." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist led, 9-7, in the second game but Brentwood went on a 6-1 run 
after the Knights' Tracy Durose hit a serve long. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Knights settled down by the third game, which they won, 
15-11, mostly due to senior outside hitter Darcie Frazier, who finished with 16 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if we were going to come back and win, I needed to do something," 
Frazier said. "That's my responsibility as captain. I have to fire everyone 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist was unable to stop Brentwood's 1-2 combination of setter Sarah 
Neal (46 assists) and outside hitter Kelly Gentile (21 kills), who play on the 
same club team as Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were confident if we could stop (Frazier) we could stop them," Neal said. 
"I've never seen our defense this good." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal and Gentile were freshmen when L.A. Baptist defeated Brentwood in the 
1991 title match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revenge was definitely on our minds," Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist built a 13-3 lead in the third game helped by Sarah Garcia's 
three aces, and teammate Tracy Jensen closed out the game with another ace. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 6-2, in the fourth game, Porter inserted outside hitter Padideh 
Raphael into the lineup and Brentwood went on a 13-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volleyball is a game of momentum," Newcomb said. "We had it turning our way 
until (Raphael) came in."

DIVISION I WATER POLO PLAYOFFS; CORONA DEL MAR USES EDGE TO CUT UP FOOTHILL 
DEFENSE 
</P>

<P>
 Top-seeded Corona del Mar used its man advantage to defeat No. 4 Foothill, 
6-4, in a Division I semifinal water polo game Saturday at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings (22-4) will play third-seeded Long Beach Wilson in the finals 
Wednesday night at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill squandered its six-on-five chances, but the Sea Kings converted on 
theirs, producing four consecutive goals to break open a tight game. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar Coach John Vargas praised his team's defensive effort, 
especially from the two-meter defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thad Buzolich, Adrian Strelzow and Kevin Tucker were great defensively," 
Vargas said. "I'm extremely pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Doug Jetton also came up big, making 13 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 After Foothill's Brian Brown scored to tie it, 2-2, the Sea Kings converted on 
the first of their man-advantage situations when James Palda beat goalkeeper 
Ryan Brown with 1:12 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Palda scored his second goal on a lob shot with seven seconds left in the half 
to give Corona del Mar a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more Foothill ejections produced two goals for the Sea Kings, one by 
Buzolich in the third quarter and another by Palda with 3:56 left to play, 
giving the Sea Kings a 6-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (22-6) converted on only one of five man-advantage opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Wilson 8, San Clemente 6 -- Adam Wright had a goal and assisted on 
seven others as the third-seeded Bruins won at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilson took a 2-0 lead, the score was tied twice: 3-3 at halftime and 
5-5 at the end of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins broke the tie when Wright lofted a pass to Micah Miller who scored 
his second goal with 3:59 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente caught Wilson with two minutes remaining when Andy Bailey forced 
a turnover at mid-pool, broke away and skipped his fourth goal past Nick Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wright set up Keith Feldman for the go-ahead goal with 1:08 left and 
then fed Rick Westover for another in the closing seconds.

SOUTHERN SECTION TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; THREE PLAYERS FROM COUNTY ADVANCE TO 
ROUND OF 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corona del Mar freshman Nina Vaughan took a longer route to the Southern 
Section individual round of 16 than El Modena senior Brandi Freudenberg and 
Villa Park sophomore Faye DeVera, but she got there just the same. 
</P>
<P>
 While Freudenberg and DeVera rushed the net and played aggressively and 
quickly in winning their two matches, Vaughan played moonball tennis and never 
ventured far from the baseline in beating her friend, Michelle Bray of Laguna 
Beach, 6-0, 4-6, 6-2, in 2 hours 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played a game that I didn't like to play," said Vaughan, who cruised past 
Rosary's Eleanor Luzano, 6-2, 6-1, in her first match at the Huntington Beach 
High sectional, one of three held Saturday. "I hit a lot of high balls. I 
played that way because I know Michelle can hit as hard as I can and I figured 
that was the best way to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan, who was the Sea View League's No. 2 seeded player, apologized to the 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played a frustrating game," she said. "It was not a fun game to play or to 
play against . . . or to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Freudenberg and DeVera appeared to have fun in what little time they spent on 
the court. DeVera, who lost in the round of 16 last year, did not drop a game 
in beating Dana Hills' Marguax Pierog and Sunny Hills' Dana Rudolph. 
Freudenberg, who has reached the semifinals two of the past three years, 
dropped only two games in beating El Dorado's Mielle Weisz and Dana Hills' Lara 
Spica. 
</P>
<P>
 Freudenberg is hoping to be seeded second to Palos Verdes Peninsula's Amanda 
Basica, the nation's top-ranked player in the girls' 16 division, when the 
tournament continues Dec. 1 and 2 at the Lindborg Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Orange County players will be joined in the draw by Temecula 
Valley's Sanaz Ghazal, who beat an erratic Sarah Denson of Irvine, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The four teams which advanced to the round-of-16 doubles draw were El Modena's 
Holli Freudenberg and Amy Medlin, Corona del Mar's Megan Wachtler and Alissa 
Scott, Canyon's Shannon Wilkins and Kim Westermann and Dana Hills' Michele 
Johnson and Katie Tierney. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachtler and Scott had the toughest time reaching the round of 16. It took 
them almost three hours to beat Laguna Beach's Lindsay Weiss and Amanda 
Hastings-Phillips, 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 7-6, (12-10).

SOUTHERN SECTION CROSS-COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS; PUGMIRE HANGS ON TO FIRST PLACE 
IN DIVISION I 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Courtney Pugmire of Esperanza took first place in the Southern Section 
Division I girls' cross-country final Saturday, tying the 10th-best time ever 
posted at Mt. San Antonio College, finishing in 17 minutes 45 seconds. With the 
victory, she also qualified for the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugmire, whose team failed to qualify for the State final, led most of the way 
and was able to hold on to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I planned on striding with the rest of them for the first mile," Pugmire 
said. "And then I ran my own race from there. I was lucky to win the race." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Division I girls' team final, Irvine finished third on the three-mile 
course with 99 points to qualify for the State meet along with El Toro, which 
took fourth with 109 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Division I boys' final, Capistrano Valley's Adalberto Sanchez battled 
with Camarillo's Eleazar Hernandez. Sanchez held a narrow lead most of the 
race, but Hernandez overtook him in the final quarter-mile for the victory in 
14:54.57. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, a senior, took second place behind Hernandez in 14:55.06. His time 
was 11 seconds faster than his qualifying time in last week's preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edison girls' team took second place in the Division II-A finals, but were 
able to outdistance La Puente Bishop Amat to capture first place in the State 
qualifying. The Chargers finished with 89 points, one ahead of Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Vaicaro of Katella qualified in fifth place, with a time of 19:00. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division III boys, Brian Slingsby of Corona del Mar was disappointed with 
his second-place finish in 15:25, behind Nordhoff's Javier Ramirez (15:10). 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning, I should have caught him," Slingsby said. "I didn't want to 
do the first mile too quick, but he ran off and I didn't have time to catch up 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Slingsby's finish helped qualify the Sea Kings, who took fourth place with 140 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Also qualifying was Santa Margarita's Michael Murray, who finished in seventh 
place in 15:53. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena qualified, taking second place with 93 points, and La Habra 
advanced, finishing third, with 137 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Division III girls' race, Buena Park freshman Heather Garritson 
captured second place in 18:04, to qualify for State. Nordhoff freshman Elaine 
Candhola was first in 17:35. Corona del Mar's Tracy Clarke (fourth, 18:10) and 
Santa Margarita's Katie Nuanes (seventh, 18:49) also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division III girls' team competition, El Modena (85 points) and Foothill 
(107) finished first and second to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian's Brandon Pacheco took third place in Division IV, and 
qualified with a time of 16:00. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division I girls, Nancy Dollar of San Clemente qualified, finishing sixth 
in 18:43, and Elly Estrada of Santa Ana Valley qualified in 18:47. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division IV girls' team competition, Orange Lutheran, finishing second (97 
points) and Laguna Beach (103), taking third, qualified for the State meet.

ANTELOPE VALLEY ENDS WITH A BANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antelope Valley College fans could only shake their heads and wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this the same team that had looked so miserable at times this season? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently not, as Antelope Valley (3-7, 3-5) concluded its season in a big 
way with a 60-37 rout of Victor Valley (2-7-1, 1-6-1) in a Foothill Conference 
football game Saturday night at Apple Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Michael Gleich and Troy Searcy highlighted an Antelope Valley 
offense that gained 576 yards and averaged 9.3 yards per play. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleich finished 12 of 16 for 302 yards, and connected with Searcy for three 
third-quarter touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Searcy scored on pass plays of 56, 64, and 11 yards, and tied a school record 
for touchdown receptions in a game. He had four catches totaling 171 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleich's 302 passing yards just missed Antelope Valley's school record. Marty 
Washington had 314 in a 1991 game. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt Miller scored on a six-yard run and rushed for 106 yards in 12 
carries. Christopher Brown added touchdown runs of 21 and seven yards.

HANCOCK ROLLS OVER VENTURA, 51-9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BRESNAHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On paper, this game looked pretty bad for the Ventura College football team. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, it was even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura ended its season Saturday night with a 51-9 loss to Hancock in a 
Western State Conference Northern Division game. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was ugly, and the stats were uglier. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura had 18 penalties -- including eight for personal fouls and 
unsportsmanlike conduct -- for 175 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates gave up 447 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock's Reggie Etheridge gained 157 yards in 21 carries and scored on runs 
of two, four, 35 and 78 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Mick Sitarski completed 15 of 21 for 170 yards a and a touchdown 
for Hancock (7-3, 6-3 in the conference, 4-1 in the Northern Division), which 
will likely appear in its first bowl game in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Brown completed 13 of 30 passes for 114 yards for Ventura (4-6, 3-5, 
0-5). Brown had two passes intercepted.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura linebacker David Davis was ejected in the second quarter for throwing 
what the referee called a retaliatory punch.

VALLEY WRAPS UP BOWL BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley College football team gave a record-setting performance in its 
regular-season finale Saturday night against visiting Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Arellanes established a single-season school record for 
passing yardage and receiver Brian Comer tied Valley's single-season mark for 
touchdown receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important figure for the Monarchs was the final score, a 42-0 
Western State Conference victory that wrapped up a berth in a postseason bowl 
for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley (9-1, 9-1), ranked No. 9 in the state, is expected to receive a bid to 
play in the Orange County Bowl on Dec. 3 at Orange Coast College. Santa Monica 
finished 5-5, 4-5 in WSC play. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes entered the game needing 53 yards to break the passing-yardage mark 
of 3,134 set by Sean Fitzgerald last year. He completed 22 of 33 passes for 401 
yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Comer, who had eight receptions for 206 yards, scored on pass plays of 84, 55 
and 17 yards. Comer has 13 touchdowns, tying the single-season mark set by 
James Reaves in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley led, 14-0, at halftime.

CSUN WINS SORRY EXHIBITION; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MATADORS GET LITTLE RESISTANCE 
FROM RACE EXPRESS IN 107-67 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Are there no false-advertising laws? 
</P>
<P>
 Race Express, Cal State Northridge's opponent in an exhibition game Saturday 
night, bills itself as a run-and-gun outfit of former college players. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about half right. Many of them did play for small colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 But how about the team's other slogan, "The Wizards of Ahhhs"? 
</P>
<P>
 More like the wizards of whoops. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge did most of the running and gunning in a 107-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dorsey, Ruben Oronoz and Eric Gray, a trio of newcomers, provided most of 
the offensive punch for the Matadors, who had a 56-29 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, a 6-foot-6 transfer from Los Angeles City College, scored 23 points. 
Oronoz, who redshirted last season after transferring from Rancho Santiago 
College, added 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, came off the bench to score 15 points, hitting the first of his three 
three-point baskets two seconds after entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrek Byrd, who CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy once tried to recruit out of Skyline 
College, scored 21 points for Race Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, 8-18 last season, plays the Australian national team Tuesday night 
-- the Matadors' final tuneup before opening Saturday against UCLA at Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw some good things tonight," Cassidy said. "Of course, we still have 
many, many things to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. UCLA has a few more things going for it than Race Express, a team 
with uniforms which trumpet its sponsor, a "House of Catfish and Ribs."

<P>
 Perry is downplaying his team's chances of winning the league championship, 
but the other Garden Grove coaches aren't and are picking La Quinta as the 
favorite. "We're not as big and athletic as Rancho Alamitos or Pacifica or as 
big as Garden Grove," Perry said. "If our kids do anything, they have a great 
work ethic and they believe very deeply in the system." Garden Grove coaches 
like La Quinta because the Aztecs return four starters and have transfers 
Johnson and Brower, Perry's first transfers since 1986. Johnson didn't want to 
play behind Los Alamitos' Ali Ton, one of the county's premier point guards, so 
he took his quickness and his outside shooting to La Quinta. Brower has never 
played varsity basketball, but Perry likes his defensive toughness and his 
unselfishness. The top returning starter is two-year starter and three-year 
letterman Greenfield, who averaged 15 points, three assists and four rebounds 
last season.

 The Lobos reached the playoffs last year and they could be there again if 
their young inside players improve throughout the season. Los Amigos' trio of 
guards, Udell, Vuong and Ratanaphoulee, are as good as anybody's. Udell (9 
points) is the leading returning scorer, but he needs help from the other two 
guards who both averaged six points last year. But if the guards are forced to 
do all the shooting, Los Amigos could be in trouble in a league that has some 
talented post players. The top newcomer could be Stafford, who didn't play 
basketball last year. "We're hoping his shooting touch is as good as his touch 
around the green," Grable said of his all-league golfer. "We want to prove 
ourselves as the best defensive team in the league." Grable said.

 Becker predicted his team would win the league title last season and it did, 
easily. It also won the Southern Section and the Southern California Regional 
title. But with only one starter and two of his top 10 players returning, 
Becker is making no such statements this season. In fact, he's picking his team 
third or fourth, based on what it did during the summer. He's also prepared to 
abandon his up-tempo, frenetic style. "Our whole style is going to be more 
deliberate," he said. "We won't stall, but we will be more patient." Becker is 
trying to be patient with Miller (4 point average, 7 rebounds), whom he needs 
to have a big year. "He's been very frustrated," Becker said. "He's used to 
being unguarded while everybody else was on (Chris) Vlasic and (Jon) Surface. 
It was easy for him to score. Now, he's the guy everyone is going after and 
he's finding out the game is a lot tougher than he thought." Becker will also 
need big years from Bessho, who starts at point guard, and Martinez, who saw 
some playing time in the playoffs.

Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica Coach Bob Becker began the season by predicting his team would win 
the Garden Grove League. Becker, who had been the girls' basketball coach at 
Rancho Alamitos, was right and then some. The Mariners' up-tempo, almost 
frantic pace and suffocating full-court defense was too much for everyone in 
the Garden Grove League, the Southern Section and Southern California. The 
Mariners, led by center Jon Surface's 23 points, forward Chris Vlasic's 19 
points and a gimmick defense, won the III-A title over San Dimas, 63-49. It was 
the school's first section title in boys' basketball. Pacifica then won the 
Southern California Regional playoffs by defeating San Diego University High of 
San Diego, 60-55, behind Surface and Vlasic's 15 points and Ramon Alliman's 13 
points and three rebounds. "Every coach, every player, has a dream to get to 
Oakland," Becker said. "We're living our dreams now." Pacifica's dreams died 
hard in the finals, though, as the Mariners were not able to wear down 
Sacramento Foothill, losing 81-61. Vlasic, who averaged 20 points and shot 40% 
from three-point range, was a first-team Times' All-County selection,and 
Surface, who averaged 15 points, 9.3 rebounds and shot 60% from the field, made 
the second team. Bolsa Grande, led by seniors Brian Baughman (53% field goal 
shooting) and Brian Stewart, finished in second place. The Matadors lost to 
section runner-up Servite in the first round of the Division III-AA playoffs, 
54-40. La Quinta, which gave Pacifica its two biggest scares in league, 
finished third behind the shooting of Greg Greenfield (15.1 points) and Jason 
Gondringer ( 12.5), the rebounding of senior forward Kevin Doane (10.1 
rebounds) and the passing of Todd Snyder (9.3 assists). Los Amigos made the 
II-A playoffs as a wild-card team and lost to Tustin, 97-56, in the first 
round. Kennedy, which came into the season with a 33-game league winning 
streak, only had one returning starter and was never a factor. Garden Grove was 
led by junior all-league guard Mike Campuzano (15.0 points) and senior Tim Denk 
(16.8 points).

 With no starters back and only three lettermen returning, the Matadors don't 
figure to reach last year's victory total. Cardoza is working with an old, but 
inexperienced group of players who aren't very big. "Quickness will be our 
strength," Cardoza said. "We'll attack teams with our quickness. Hopefully, our 
guards will be able to force turnovers before teams are able to throw over the 
top of us." Park, the sixth man last year, is the team's most reliable inside 
scorer and Tan, the starting off guard, is the Matadors' best three-point 
shooter. Chavez, who played junior varsity last year, will start at center and 
be backed by Fair, an all-league water polo player in his first year of 
basketball. "He's big and strong and he should give us some good minutes and 
more five fouls to give." Guerra will start at point guard and Price, the 
football team's starting quarterback, gives Cardoza some bulk and athleticism 
at power forward.

 With six underclassmen playing significant minutes, the Vaqueros finished in 
last place last year. But with a little luck, they could be looking down at 
everybody this season. Five of those underclassmen are back, including Parrish 
(7.7 points, 4 rebounds), one of the league's better all-around players, and 
Frank (6.9 points, 3.5 rebounds), one of the league's more versatile players. 
Toscanani (5.3 points, 5 assists) will be the point guard and Silverman will 
start at center. "Our strengths are in our guards and our leadership," Hamamoto 
said. "The kids are really focused." Though he's only a sophomore, Hamamoto is 
excited about Silverman. "He had a great summer," Hamamoto said. "We played 
against a lot of kids from the inner city and he didn't back down at all." 
Hamamoto is somewhat worried that his big people are inexperienced, but he said 
the situation could be much worse. "We have young height, but I'd rather have 
young height than young guards."

 If nothing else, Garden Grove will be the league's tallest team. Whether the 
Argonauts will be the best team is open to debate. After suffering through a 
miserable 1993-94 season, Garden Grove should be able to create matchup 
problems for everybody. It has five players over 6-foot-4 and he has one of the 
league's better players in Campuzano, who averaged 16 points and eight 
rebounds. Campuzano is a good shooter, and he's quickly becoming a great 
scorer. "He's taken charge now," Van Cleave said. "He's the man out there. He 
certainly proved to people he can score this summer. He's got the college 
coaches looking at him." Sanders starts at small forward. "He has great jumping 
ability and body strength that's unreal," Van Cleave said. Alvarez will start 
at center and Ortiz backs him up. Williams starts at shooting guard. "I think, 
in time, he will be a Division I player."

TITANS FIGHT BACK IN 3-1 OVERTIME VICTORY; SOCCER: SAN DIEGO TIES SCORE WITH 28 
SECONDS LEFT, BUT FULLERTON KEEPS COMPOSURE TO ADVANCE TO SECOND ROUND OF NCAA 
PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton, which made it to the final four of college soccer last 
season, opened a new round of NCAA tournament play Saturday night with a 
dramatic 3-1 overtime victory over San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Soto and Matt Bradbury led the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto connected on an open-net goal 9 minutes into the first overtime period 
when San Diego goalkeeper Tom Tate came out too far and lost control of the 
ball. Soto nudged it away and connected from the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Soto, a senior from Cerritos, scored two minutes into the second overtime 
on Matt Bradbury's breakaway assist. It was Soto's 19th goal of the season and 
set a school career record for points with 96. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory advances Fullerton (13-6-2) to next weekend's second round against 
the winner of today's match between Fresno State and San Francisco in Fresno. 
The site and date of the next game will be determined Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 2,787 at Titan Stadium on a chilly, 50-degree night was the 
largest ever for a Fullerton home soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans appeared to be on their way to a 1-0 victory before San Diego 
striker Guillermo Jara took a pass low in the box and scored with only 28 
seconds remaining in regulation. Doug Barry, a former player at El Toro High, 
assisted on the goal. It was the seventh consecutive game in which Jara has 
scored at least once. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had the game won and then they scored that goal," Titan Coach Al 
Mistri said. "We did well to come back. Our guys did a tremendous job to come 
back the way they did. Matt and Eddie really maintained their composure when we 
needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Coach Seamus McFadden felt the Titans controlled the first half, and 
his team had the upper hand in the second half. "They seemed to be down at the 
start of the overtime, but they bounced back. You have to be good and you have 
to be lucky in this game, and they were good and they were lucky," McFadden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury gave the Titans a 1-0 lead in the seventh minute of regulation on a 
driving goal set up by Soto's assist from the side. It was the eighth goal of 
the season for Bradbury, who had three in the regular-season finale, a 4-3 
victory over Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Justin Johnston, who took over as the regular Titan goalkeeper this 
past week when Mike Kornock was suspended indefinitely for missing practice, 
had a solid performance. "I thought he made two very big saves," Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped San Diego to 13-6 for the season and ended its seven-game 
winning streak. Fullerton eliminated San Diego, 3-2, in NCAA second-round play 
last year in San Diego.

LA MIRADA IN PLAYOFFS DESPITE VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 La Mirada, which defeated University in the first round of the Division VIII 
football playoffs Friday, will be allowed to continue in the playoffs despite 
using an ineligible player in the regular season, Southern Section officials 
said. 
</P>

 Suburban League principals met Saturday morning and decided La Mirada would 
remain.The Southern Section did not learn of the matter until late Friday 
afternoon, and principals were unable to convene before the game. La Mirada is 
top-seeded in Division VIII. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I don't think they should be allowed in the playoffs because 
other teams that committed those same infractions aren't," University Coach 
Mark Cunningham said. "After the fact, they realized there was a wrong, and to 
not correct it is wrong from the standpoint of what message are we sending the 
kids? I'm not saying this from the standpoint that University should go on, I'm 
saying they shouldn't be seeded No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada is scheduled to play Duarte in the second round on Friday.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX; MONA COATES SPICES HER POPULAR ORANGE 
COAST COLLEGE HUMAN SEXUALITY CLASS WITH VISITS FROM TRANSVESTITES AND 
DISCUSSIONS OF INTIMATE TOPICS, BUT IN HER PERSONAL LIFE, SHE SAYS, 'I'M ABOUT 
AS VANILLA AS YOU COME.'

 Mona Coates stands in a lecture hall filled with college students and makes a 
few quick points about compulsions, pornography and "ejaculatory inevitability" 
before introducing three transvestites who are her guest speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the break, Coates props a mirror on her handbag and tries out a new 
mascara, on loan from one of the guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love transvestites," she says, blinking at her reflection. "They always 
know the best makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Coates has taught human sexuality at Orange Coast College since 1975, and she 
has emerged from the sexually tumultuous decades with her colleagues' respect, 
students' affection and one of the most popular classes on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Her blunt, unembarrassed responses have caused some students to dub her the 
"younger, West Coast version" of Dr. Ruth Westheimer, after the media 
personality famous for her frank discussions about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Coates' all-embracing teaching style contrasts sharply with her personal life, 
which is rooted in durable relationships, including her marriage five years ago 
to her fourth-grade sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just happens that my preferences and lifestyle represent mainline, 
middle-class WASP America," she says. "My life has always been rather 
conservative; sexual choices, sexual orientation. . . . I'm about as vanilla as 
you come." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is nothing bland on the menu in her human sexuality class, a 
three-unit extravaganza of sexual potpourri that attracts almost 1,200 
hormone-charged students every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her class is always full to capacity," says Chris O'Hearn, vice president of 
instruction. "And there is always a waiting list." 
</P>
<P>
 David Grant, president of the college since 1962, describes Coates as "a 
consummate professional" who plays best to a full house.  
</P>
<P>
 "She is an extraordinarily non-judgmental person in terms of her presentation, 
and (she's) very, very popular with students because of that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A fixture in her class is the Question Box, which is passed through the aisles 
at the beginning of each class and into which students drop anonymous -- and 
sometimes searingly intimate -- queries for Coates to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the questions have changed markedly over the past two decades. The 
shift has been from a sexually experimental '70s, to the more cautious '80s to 
the worried and health-conscious '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some questions are timeless. Males fret perpetually: "Is my penis too small?" 
Females wonder incessantly: "Am I sexy enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some queries are wary ("Can men tell if females fake orgasm?"), worrisome 
("Why do I feel like vomiting every time I have sex?"), playful ("Is there a 
lab for this class?") and plaintive ("How do you feel about loveless sex?"). 
</P>
<P>
 "I never get embarrassed answering the questions," she says. "I realize all 
our body parts are normal. I don't think it's so terrible to separate the knees 
and the elbows from the vaginas and the penises." 
</P>
<P>
 Coates, 50, who is a psychotherapist, licensed marriage and family counselor, 
certified hypnotherapist and certified sex therapist, began teaching sociology 
at the Costa Mesa college Sept. 5, 1967, when she was just 22. She launched her 
human sexuality class about eight years later at the urging of her students.  
</P>
<P>
 To prepare, she spent a year attending training workshops throughout the 
state, including Masters and Johnson seminars and the National Sex Forum in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an era of "sensual razzmatazz," she remembers, the "if it feels good, 
do it" decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '70s, it was, 'What all can we think of to do? What can we think of to 
experiment (with) sexually?' " she says. "In the '80s, it was, 'Should we be 
experimenting with our sexuality?' In the '90s, the attitude is, 'We'd better 
not experiment sexually unless we know it's absolutely safe.' You see the 
increasing conservatism." 
</P>
<P>
 In two decades, student inquiries about health have doubled, Coates says. In 
the past six years, questions about AIDS alone have tripled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concerns around the consequences of sex are far more serious," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex education is serious stuff. It's also great theater under Coates' sure 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mona is -- I don't want to cheapen it -- (but) more of an 
entertainer," Grant says. "She has more of a flare for the way the material is 
presented. She has an excellent (way of) inspiring large audiences." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Coates took center stage. Like a practiced talk show 
host, she dragged her microphone cord behind her, occasionally chopping the air 
with her hand to make her point. 
</P>
<P>
 The question in her hand from the Question Box was from a male, 19, who felt 
turned on by pornography but guilt-ridden because it demeans women. She 
applauded his sensitivity and warned him of developing a dependency on such 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you feel any compulsive need to use pornography, back off," she says. 
"Don't let anything run you . . . just wean yourself away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Coates readies the class for her guest speakers. Transvestites, she 
says, are "just normal people" with a "deep and profound need" to wear clothing 
of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "When women dress like men, nobody blinks an eye. The problem always exists 
when the men get out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men get this much space," she adds, pinching the air between her thumb and 
forefinger, "to express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cyndi," "Jennifer" and "Beverly" enter stage right. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a cool initial response, the students begin to warm to the smartly 
dressed and carefully coiffed trio as they take turns telling their life 
stories. Female students, in particular, quickly begin relating to the most 
feminine of the three men. 
</P>
<P>
 At the break, Coates approvingly notes the shift in the students' attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I really see the class (having) is a compassion for people," she says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mona Alberta Gordon was born June 5, 1944, in Johnstown, Pa., into a family 
she describes as "functional and genuinely happy." Her only sibling, Barbara, 
arrived four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Their father was a master electrician, hard-working and kind; their mother, a 
skilled seamstress of abundant good humor, Coates says. The couple had fallen 
in love during the Depression but waited until 1942 to marry because money was 
so scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 Coates' early childhood was snug and nurturing, she says. If the day held 
family conflicts, her parents sat late at the kitchen table, talking until they 
reached a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Life turned even rosier for the vivacious girl with the curly blond hair, 
when, at 9, she spied Eddie Jacobs in Miss Kramer's fourth-grade class and fell 
irretrievably in love. 
</P>
<P>
 By sixth grade, they were set to marry but, like Coates' parents, couldn't 
scare up the cash. "We only had 50 cents a week allowance," she remembers, "so 
we had to wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, her life caved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father died suddenly of a massive heart attack, and her mother slid into a 
deep depression that lingered for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the dark years," she recalls, her green eyes turning serious. "I 
literally grew up at age 11." Young Mona kept house, mowed the grass and cared 
for her mother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so grateful for the beginning," she says, brushing over the rough 
spots, "the first 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few years, Eddie was her bright spot. 
</P>
<P>
 They hiked, rode bicycles and attended Friday night sock hops. After school 
each day, they stopped at the corner drugstore and sipped cherry Cokes. They 
met regularly at the YMCA where, Coates says, they would "sit in the bleachers 
and make out." 
</P>
<P>
 But they only went so far, she adds. She believed her virginity should be 
preserved for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1959, as she prepared for junior high school, she suffered 
another life-altering blow when her family moved to California, and she had to 
leave Eddie behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stayed together as a real couple, very seriously, until we were 15," she 
says. After that, they lost contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at 19, Coates heard that Eddie, her "true soul mate," was dead. Killed 
in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 She was devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried," she says, "for about two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Still carrying Eddie's sixth- and seventh-grade pictures in her wallet, Coates 
hurried through college, cleaning her professors' houses to get spending money 
and earning her master's degree from Cal State Fullerton in 1967 (she received 
a doctorate from UC Irvine in 1980). 
</P>
<P>
 At 22, she claimed the job at Orange Coast College and began gathering 
outstanding teacher awards. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, she married John Coates, another Orange Coast College professor, and 
became step-mother to his 8- and 12-year-old sons. The couple were divorced in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, shortly after Coates' mother died five years ago, she received some 
startling news. 
</P>
<P>
 The schoolmate who had died in Vietnam was not Eddie Jacobs after all. Jacobs, 
as it turned out, was twice divorced and living in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 A stunned Coates "wore out about three Philadelphia information operators" 
trying to find his telephone number. Finally, she says, as if she still can't 
believe it, "Eddie himself -- the real Eddie -- picked up the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 They married seven weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanlee Phelps, one of Coates' best friends, was with the couple the night 
they were reunited. They ate at a seaside restaurant in Laguna Beach and then 
strolled through an oceanfront park at sunset. The mood was tender and edgy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mona, when she's nervous, talks a lot, and Eddie, when he's nervous, can't 
say anything," Phelps says. "They were both nervous. . . . It was so much fun 
to see how star-struck they both were and how grateful they were to find one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt funny being there, but I think both of them needed someone to 
really keep their feet on the ground. It was really a very precious evening," 
Phelps says. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie and Mona continued to float for the next couple years, so overwhelmed at 
their good fortune that they got married five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first wedding was June 15, 1989, in Ocean City, Md., at a ceremony 
attended by Jacobs' parents. When it was over, the groom couldn't resist asking 
his bride, "Would you marry me again?" 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Sure, I would marry you five times,' " he recalls. "So we did." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, returning to California, they stopped in Las Vegas and repeated their 
vows in a small chapel on the strip. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, they rented a hall in Westminster, invited about 100 friends and 
replayed the blissful event. The fourth ceremony was the next month, beneath 
the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, Jan. 5, 1991 -- surrounded by palm trees and a Polynesian 
setting -- a minister wearing a colorful shirt pronounced them husband and wife 
on the Big Island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 That will probably be the last of it, Jacobs says, since five is Coates' lucky 
number. But, he adds quickly, "you never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Jacobs, a computer programmer, and Coates live on a quiet Huntington 
Beach street. Inside, the walls are blanketed with pictures of the beaming 
couple and their extended families. Resting on the mantle in a heart-shaped 
frame are Mona and Eddie at 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Their married life, Coates says, is very traditional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not only very (sexually) discriminating, I'm very monogamous," she says. 
"I'm not attracted to any kind of fetish. I'm simply not attracted to any of 
the different sexual practices that I feel very tolerant of in others." 
</P>
<P>
 She is shy about only one thing -- her sex life with Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speaking about my sexual experiences with my own husband, they seem so 
private and sacred," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Coates has tenure at the college and a busy counseling practice, Jacobs 
agreed to relocate. He has since learned plenty from sitting in on his wife's 
classes and joining her when she treats her guest speakers to meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find myself sitting there with transvestites, hermaphrodites or gay 
people," Jacobs says. In fact, he now takes them to dinner if Coates is busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some days, Coates seems to have blown way past busy and entered a state of 
perpetual motion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her work at the college, Coates counsels at least a dozen 
clients four days a week in her private practice. She also attends seminars 
where she is sometimes a guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is probably one of the most active faculty members in staying abreast of 
the subject matter in her discipline," says Dick Marsh, dean of social and 
behavioral sciences. "She's constantly going to conferences all over the United 
States, and she usually pays for it out of her own pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversial subject matter, Marsh said he's had no complaints 
about Coates, unless he counts the one student who was booted from a lecture 
for talking and wanted back in. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended readings in Coates' class include "The New Joy of Sex," "The 
Ultimate Sex Book," "Hot Monogamy" and "How to Make Love All the Time." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is not required for any major, this class is one of the most hotly 
pursued on campus. (Coates also teaches advanced human sexuality, a more 
in-depth look at many of the same issues.) 
</P>
<P>
 James Kowalski, one of six teachers who now teach human sexuality at the 
college, says an instructor's personality and priorities determine how the 
subject will be tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 He, for example, emphasizes relationships, sexually transmitted diseases, 
child-rearing and other issues that "affect the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 "I rarely talk about sex as a positive thing independent of the relationship," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kowalski admits some students might find his class boring compared to Coates'. 
On the other hand, he says, some might find Coates' topics more superficial 
than his. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consistently, what I've heard from students about Mona's class is really 
quite positive," he adds. "They find her class enjoyable and extremely 
informative." 
</P>
<P>
 Coates' views her classroom discussions as anything but superficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "My big job is to create and teach only love," she says, and that "every 
person, regardless of sexual orientation or dysfunction, is a precious human 
treasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Coates says she tries by example and attitude to teach students how to talk, 
listen and "show up emotionally" so strong relationships can be forged.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just (giving) information, it's teaching attitudes and values that 
enhance human life and human development," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that is just the wrapping; many students want simply to rip into the 
gift -- the basics about sex. Coates does not disappoint them, even showing 
videos and using transparencies to describe sexual techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the first 20 minutes of each class are set aside for Coates to 
address queries from the Question Box. She may then proceed with a lecture 
based on a previous assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 On guest speaker days, a panel of attorneys may discuss sex and the law, 
members of the clergy may tackle sex and religion, or a medical doctor may 
describe venereal disease, contraception, pregnancy or childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there are speakers from "sexual minority groups" -- including 
gays, transsexuals and the sexually disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the broadly accepting attitude she displays with her students, Coates 
believes promiscuity "tears down the fabric of commitment" and makes it harder 
for "human beings to really grow." Sex before marriage? Well, that depends on 
the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 And she doesn't hesitate to tell a student he's doing wrong. For example, a 
20-year-old man claimed he was being seduced by a 15-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what the 15-year-old girl does -- if she throws her clothes off and 
jumps on him -- it is statutory rape in the eyes of the law. Period," Coates 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 When her personal beliefs contrast with her mission as a sex educator, Coates 
says she "centers herself" with a brief prayer or meditative technique. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about meeting my needs, it's about meeting their needs, whether it's 
a client or a student or a class as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Coates says she has continued teaching human sexuality in part because it 
allows her to take swipes at the myths, fears, guilt and ignorance that make 
people miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not necessary for people to suffer the way they do," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Her students seem to appreciate the effort. At the close of each semester, 
most leave behind glowing class evaluation forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs says his wife has taught so many students that, at times, it seems they 
can't escape them. 
</P>
<P>
 When they were returning from Paris two years ago, a flight attendant stopped 
suddenly at their aisle and said, "Mona Coates!" The attendant told Coates that 
one of the pilots was a transvestite. "I know all about it because I studied 
that in your class," the attendant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very bright and she could have done many things," Jacobs says of his 
wife. "But I personally believe she couldn't have found a better vocation, both 
for her and for all the people she's touched."

MAJOR REBEL WITH A COMMON CAUSE LEAVES LIMELIGHT; POLITICS: FRED WERTHEIMER IS 
ABOUT TO TAKE A BREAK. BUT WILL CONGRESS GET ONE? NOT A CHANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Wertheimer looks like the friendly neighbor in a sitcom -- the bald, 
bespectacled older guy dispensing advice to the nice young folks next door. 
</P>
<P>
 But mention his name on Capitol Hill and the reaction can be anything but 
neighborly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He acts as though he has a monopoly on reforming the political process," 
sputtered Rep. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), a target of Wertheimer's lobby, 
Common Cause. "The cause of campaign-finance reform will move more quickly with 
him gone." 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a quarter-century of prodding politicians to change the way they 
raise money to run for office, Wertheimer announced in October that he was 
resigning from the leadership of Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In his almost 24 years with the self-described good-government lobby, 14 of 
them as president, he has exasperated and infuriated scores of officials, along 
the way becoming almost as much an institution in this city as the system he 
would so like to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Congress-bashing was fashionable, Wertheimer was inveighing 
against the "corrupt" advantages of incumbency and the "arms-race mentality" of 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a combination of Democratic delay and a Republican filibuster 
killed the best chance yet to limit campaign spending, reduce the role of 
political-action committees and extend public financing -- already provided to 
presidential candidates -- to congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Congress had enacted the (recent) reforms urged on it by Fred Wertheimer, 
it would have a much higher approval rating from the American people," said 
Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), one of Wertheimer's few defenders on the Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said Wertheimer was part of the problem, adopting a rigid attitude 
that delayed agreement until it was too late to pass legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred has worshiped at the altar of public financing for so long that he would 
sell his first-born son for it," said Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer said his decision to step down had been made months earlier and 
that personal criticism wasn't a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 At 55, he wouldn't have lasted this long if he were thin-skinned. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio Congressman Wayne Hays, the salty-tongued chairman of the House 
Administration Committee in the 1970s, used to call him that "baldheaded 
bastard" from "Common Curse." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to take almost nothing that happens up there (Capitol Hill) 
personally," Wertheimer said in an interview at Common Cause headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an inherent tension built into what Common Cause does. Our issues 
are quite different than those of other people who worry about clean air or 
having a dam built. We are talking about your personal life, your professional 
life, your money and your integrity. It's going to lead to people getting angry 
with you." 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Nov. 8 elections, Wertheimer, who will remain at 
Common Cause until a successor is chosen next year, promised to be just as 
tough on the new Republican leadership in Congress as he has been on the 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though many Hill watchers believe the chances for reform will be slimmer, 
Wertheimer said he sees a big opportunity to push Republicans to keep their 
promises of change. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would focus on the next House Speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), 
"because he has spent his career attacking the House as a corrupt institution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Wertheimer talked about the subject that has absorbed most of his adult 
life, he looked his questioner straight in the eyes with an intensity that was 
a little disconcerting and gave a sense of how uncomfortable he has made 
politicians feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and bred in Brooklyn, a graduate of the University of Michigan and 
Harvard Law School, he imbibed his reformist zeal from an accountant father who 
"believed in playing by the rules" and a mother with "a great sense of fairness 
and justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many in his generation, Wertheimer said President John F. Kennedy's 
call to public service was also a powerful influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Wertheimer's first goal was to work on Capitol Hill, which he 
pursued with characteristic determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a job at the Securities and Exchange Commission and every six months 
would send out letters to 20 or 30 congressmen who sounded interesting. Three 
years later, Silvio Conte wrote back.  
</P>
<P>
 "Conte (D-Mass.) was a wonderful representative and a great teacher," said 
Wertheimer, who worked for the congressman for a few years. "I've had wonderful 
teachers and mentors and colleagues, like John Gardner and (Watergate 
prosecutor and former Common Cause chairman) Archibald Cox." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, a liberal Republican who served as secretary of Health, Education and 
Welfare in the Johnson Administration, founded Common Cause in 1970 to open 
government to greater public scrutiny and participation. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization reached its membership peak of 300,000 in the Watergate era 
and now has about 250,000 members and chapters in all states except Wyoming, 
Idaho and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, its tactics were relatively genteel, but got tougher in the 
face of continuing resistance to campaign-finance reform primarily from House 
Democrats and Senate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In a controversial tactic in 1990, Common Cause took out ads against 13 
Democrats, among them Torricelli, implying that their acceptance of PAC money 
in general implicated them in the savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a major blunder," said Kenneth Gross, former head of enforcement at 
the Federal Election Commission and now a lawyer specializing in campaign 
finance and ethics at the Washington office of the New York firm Skadden, Arps. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were his supporters -- not (Sen.) Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). He went for the 
jugular," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer, not surprisingly, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats kept campaign-finance reform off the floor of the House for 16 
years. Then (in 1990) they came forward with a phony bill and they wanted it 
blessed as reform. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this unbelievably difficult concept for Washington to understand: In 
order to change, you have to change. Washington loves the notion of change 
without doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Although recent efforts have failed, Common Cause claims numerous successes: 
public funding of presidential campaigns; "sunshine," or open-meeting laws; 
tougher ethics rules for the executive branch; the investigation that led to 
the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas), and the 1989 bill that 
banned members of Congress from accepting speaking fees from special-interest 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Another contribution to the political process was on view outside Wertheimer's 
office just before the recent elections. A group of young staffers sat munching 
bagels while turning reports filed to the Federal Election Commission into 
press releases on campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer has been with the group almost since its inception. He sought a job 
there after leaving Conte's office, while his wife, Linda, briefly supported 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the fall of 1970, we had been married for about a year and this place was 
just being formed. I knew I could do something I didn't want to do any time, so 
why rush into it? We decided Linda should find a job. There was this new thing 
called National Public Radio. That's how Linda started at NPR and I started out 
at Common Cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Wertheimer rose from being a tape editor to host of the acclaimed 
program "All Things Considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the Wertheimers, who have no children, occupy a niche in the city's 
liberal Establishment. They relax with journalist friends such as Cokie and 
Steven Roberts (the former with NPR and ABC, the latter with U.S. News & World 
Report). 
</P>
<P>
 Although ties with the media -- especially the editorial boards of major 
newspapers -- are said to be a key factor in his influence, Wertheimer said the 
couple doesn't "spend a whole lot of time socializing with the power structure 
in this town. We're old. We're tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe his typical engagements in a month, he said, "Going to a 
couple of movies on a Saturday night and dinner at the Pines of Rome," an 
untrendy restaurant in suburban Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred lives by all the rules he tries to force down other people's throats," 
said Nina Totenberg, legal affairs correspondent for NPR and the ABC TV program 
"Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
 In characteristically prudent fashion, she said, the Wertheimers' mortgage on 
their Georgetown townhouse was paid up before they bought a spacious Victorian 
bungalow in Washington's premier wealthy liberal neighborhood, Cleveland Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the new house, another luxury they have permitted themselves is trips 
to Paris for major birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 They may travel more once his successor is chosen, Wertheimer said. He was 
otherwise unsure of his future except to say that he will remain involved in 
the reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do like fighting for what I believe in," he said, his eyes shining. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded of all the politicians he has tangled with over the years, he looked 
suddenly youthful, and grinned. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that my resignation makes a number of people happy -- well, 
whatever I can do to bring happiness into this world," he said. "On the other 
hand, they shouldn't be too happy if they think I'm going to disappear from 
their lives. I'm going to be around."

 * STREET PROJECT: Approved the transfer of $455,000 of Proposition A transit 
funds to a project that is designed to ease congestion on streets affected by 
construction of the Harbor Freeway's elevated transit-way. The project calls 
for widening Figueroa Street from 33rd Street to 21st Street, a lane-striping 
change on Figueroa from 37th Place to Venice Boulevard to favor northbound 
traffic and conversion of Flower Street to one-way southbound from Washington 
Boulevard to 37th Street. This work is expected to be completed in six to eight 
months. Construction of the elevated transit-way, which will run from the Santa 
Monica (10) Freeway to the Artesia (91) Freeway, is expected to be completed by 
mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
 * PROBLEM BUILDINGS: Accepted several properties into the city's Rent Escrow 
Account Program, which is designed to encourage landlords to repair and 
maintain their buildings. Once a building is placed into the program, tenants 
place their rents into a city account; the city keeps $50 of every rent payment 
and the remaining money is turned over to the landlords only after repairs are 
made. Properties added to the program: 322 Edgeware Road; 2111 Cimarron St.; 
1029 E. 45th St.; 902-906 1/2 E. 41st Place and 840 W. Imperial Highway. Passed 
15-0. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Jackie Goldberg, Mike Hernandez, Nate 
Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr., Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFERED: Approved a $25,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the death of 77-year-old 
Edna Louise Kemper, who was killed last Monday when a black Camaro jumped the 
curb at 70th Street and Broadway and struck her. 
</P>
<P>
 * MISSION MEAL: Approved the closure of Winston Street between Wall and San 
Pedro streets on Wednesday from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. for the serving of a 
Thanksgiving dinner provided by the Los Angeles Mission to homeless people in 
Skid Row. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * CLUB HOURS: Overturned a decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals that would 
have allowed a 259-seat restaurant and club to stay open until 2 a.m. seven 
days a week. The club, which will be located at 1925 W. Olympic Blvd., will be 
allowed to stay open until 1 a.m. on weekends and midnight on weeknights. 
Councilman Mike Hernandez, who represents the district, said many residents had 
complained that the later hours would attract more criminal activity to an 
already crime-plagued area. Passed 12-1. Voting yes: Goldberg, Hernandez, 
Ridley-Thomas, Svorinich, Walters. Voting no: Holden. Absent: Alatorre. MICHAEL

NEW SITE TO STORE TOXIC JET FUEL SOUGHT; MILITARY: THE PENTAGON HAS RESISTED 
SHUTTING DOWN THE SUPPLY CENTER NEAR A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Defense Department is investigating alternatives to storing toxic jet fuel 
at a military supply depot near a residential neighborhood in Norwalk, a 
department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Adm. Edward M. Straw said defense representatives will ask operators of 
area refineries if they would be willing to produce, store and transfer fuel. 
Straw revealed the inquiry in a letter to Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), 
who has urged the Pentagon to close the depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite pleas from neighbors, the Pentagon has resisted shutting down the 
Norwalk supply center, which is accessible to the Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline, a 
key delivery route to several military bases throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding oil companies to bid on the contract, however, could be difficult. 
"Our problem has been that refiners with access to the Santa Fe Pacific 
Pipeline have not offered to sell us enough jet fuel to meet our requirements 
without the use of Norwalk," Straw's letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Charles Gross, commander of a defense fuel supply facility in San 
Pedro, said the companies have been uninterested in the contract because it may 
not be as lucrative as other orders. Another official said crowded Los Angeles 
pumping stations would slow fuel shipments to the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Straw's correspondence came in response to a Torres letter in September asking 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry to replace the 50-acre facility at Norwalk 
Boulevard and Excelsior Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and city officials have argued for years that the fuel stored at the 
facility, which was built in the 1920s, poses health risks and has decreased 
nearby property values. The depot can store 36 million gallons of fuel. The 
military has stated repeatedly that health risks are minimal to nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the negotiations with the refiners, defense officials said in a 
recent meeting with Torres, Norwalk city officials and residents that the 
department is stepping up efforts to decontaminate soil and ground water 
tainted by fuel leaks from the depot.

VOICES: CHILLIN' WITH THE BAKA BOYZ; THE MORNING DJS TALK ABOUT RAP, THEIR 
GENERATION AND 'TAKING IT TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Vidal, 25, and Nick Vidal, 21, are the Baka Boyz, morning drive hosts on 
Power 106 radio. The brothers take their moniker from their hometown of 
Bakersfield. High school dropouts, they are among the leading deejays in their 
time slot. Their station recently took heat for an advertising campaign 
promoting them as "2 Fat Mexicanz." The station has dropped the ads, but the 
Baka Boyz still use the label on-air. They were interviewed by Mike Wyma:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: This is a job we never thought we'd have. We set goals when I was 
younger, like 14 or 15. I wanted to be a deejay for a rap group. That was as 
far as my dreams went. And Eric wanted to produce records for rappers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: But every time we set a goal we would go for it and get it, and set 
another one, and set another one. Every one we've set, we've got. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: The Fat Mexicanz thing started with B-Real , from the big rap group 
Cypress Hill. He was on our very first show at Power 106. He came out and said, 
"Hey, I'm chillin' with the two fat guys," and we rode off of that. Eric V. 
came up one day with 2 Fat Mexicanz. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: We didn't expect no one to be offended. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: What I'd tell them is, "Hey, I'm sorry you got offended. We didn't mean 
it to offend you." That's not our thing. Especially older people, because you 
have to respect them. But at the same time, there's a whole new generation 
saying, "Just like you were popping drugs or going to Woodstock, this is my 
generation. You didn't want your parents to say anything about what you did. 
Don't mess with mine because we're taking it to a whole new level." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: There's nothing secret no more. Before, people wouldn't talk about sex, 
but now it's on TV. Everything's out in the open. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: People say there's no morality, but I don't think that's the fact. The 
thing is, it's gotten dangerous and people need to speak upon it. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: If this generation is troubled, it's because of the one before. They had 
the kids without the fathers and without the upbringing that they needed. The 
kids didn't have role models. There are a lot of kids that don't have dads. The 
family's split up, divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: Our base is Latin females, but we cross all barriers, such as high film 
executives listening to us and 40-year-old guys who live in Beverly Hills and 
own helicopter companies. I've spoken to people like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: We play more music than anyone else in the morning. Everybody else is 
mostly talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: We're not talking about the O.J. case and Heidi Fleiss. We don't care 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: We stay away from the news. Our show is probably the only morning show 
in Los Angeles that does not do news. Someone got killed, 68 people died in a 
plane crash -- people don't want to hear that in the morning. If they want that 
they go to a news station. If you want a Big Mac you don't go to Joe's Burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: Rap music is bringing everybody together. Pop culture is rap music right 
now. Pop culture is Snoop Dogg, is Dr. Dre, is Warren G, you know what I'm 
saying? Warren G just went 3 million records sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: Dre sold 3 million. Snoop sold 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: Rap is the new rock 'n' roll. It's going the same way rock did. No one 
wanted it to be heard, but you couldn't stop it. Snoop Dogg is the Beatles of 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 Eric: They're rapping about things that they see and things that they know 
about. It's a window to what's happening in the world. If you want to know 
what's going in the streets, listen to some records. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: We're regular people. That's where we came from and that's one of the 
reasons we're successful. We came from the streets, we know the street lingo, 
what the new music is. We're in our demo (demographic group), which is 18 to 
34, not old like Howard Stern or Rick Dees.  
</P>
<P>
 Eric: We started real young, deejaying at parties and like that. Our first 
show was an AM station in Bakersfield, Friday and Saturday night. It was funny. 
Nick was a little kid. He was 15 years old, talking on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: I started deejaying and I knew that was my heart, that was where I 
wanted to be. It had to be something with music. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: Not to take away from high school, but for what we were doing and the 
field we were going into, it wasn't going to help us. We decided to concentrate 
completely on our work, our music. We'd come to L.A. to buy records and listen 
to music because we had to be the hippest ones in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: A lot of people don't take what they learn and put it to work for them. 
They don't take 15 cents and make a dollar out of it. That's what you have to 
do these days. You have to get that little opportunity and blow it out of 
proportion. And if you don't, you're outta here. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: I'm always thinking. I'm thinking about what we're gonna do, what's the 
next step. I've been losing weight because my mind's not at rest. I used to be 
215 but I'm down from that. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: I weigh 247. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: We want to do a talk show or some type of TV thing. Basically what we do 
on the radio. Bring in guests, they do songs, just have fun with them. We're 
talking to some big TV people and we're looking for some people to take the 
chance on us. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: This is what we were born to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric: We like to make people feel good in the morning. We had one girl fax us 
and say her child had passed away from sudden infant death syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick: She said she didn't want to do nothing for two weeks. She just stayed 
home depressed. She was in bad shape but she had to get up in the morning and 
go to work. She said she turned on our show and we got her through. She laughed 
and it got her mind off the child enough that she could go to work.

VOICES: SHE'S 'ONLY JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT'; ALTHOUGH THE ELECTION RESULTS DID NOT 
GO AS SHE WISHED, FIRST-TIME VOTER CELIA VIRAMONTES WILL CONTINUE TO PUT HER 
FAITH IN THE BALLOT BOX

 Celia Viramontes is a freshman at Occidental College in Eagle Rock. The 
18-year-old Latina voted for the first time in the Nov. 8 elections. 
Viramontes, from the Eastside, said that although the elections did not go the 
way she wished, "I will continue to vote. I'm not going to allow one election 
to discourage me completely. I know some people say 'I'm never going to vote 
again' because they think they don't make a difference. But I still think it 
makes a difference, and it is my right. So why not? Why not exercise it?" 
Viramontes was interviewed by Yvette Cabrera:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is my first time voting and I understood the importance of the vote. I 
didn't view Pete Wilson's position in Sacramento as a very positive one and I 
knew that my role in this particular election was to vote and use that vote 
positively. That was my way of voicing myself as well as my community. 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest, I really didn't care about the politicians. In these elections I 
was really concerned with the propositions. I felt these initiatives were 
really going to affect the state of California.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to say that I was disregarding the politicians, but Proposition 
187 was a really central issue, and that's what I focused on. Basically, my 
community is very much an immigrant community so I came to the realization that 
politics was not only shaping my life but the life of my community. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of my friends are not citizens and don't have their documentation. They 
told me 'Please vote, since we can't vote.' They wanted me to make use of my 
privilege to vote.  
</P>
<P>
 I looked forward to being able to vote. I remember telling my sister, 'I can't 
wait to turn 18 so I can vote.' I voted in my neighborhood and I felt empowered 
and decisive about what I was voting for, but also a bit disoriented with the 
process.  
</P>
<P>
 I have two older brothers and two older sisters who didn't vote in the last 
elections and I was very bothered by it. They think that their vote won't 
count, and I've had to encourage them. I think Proposition 187 did it for them 
-- it got them to the polls to vote.  
</P>
<P>
 I feel people my age are apathetic about voting. There is a sense of 
hopelessness, and I think it's an attitude that needs to change. Those of us 
who feel apathetic need to regain our sense of hope and realize that we have 
more power in us than we realize.  
</P>
<P>
 My friends and I talk a lot about politics, racism and sexism. We talk about 
everything -- social issues and discrimination. There were a lot of conflicts 
regarding these elections between even my own friends.  
</P>
<P>
 There are some of my friends who wanted Proposition 187 to pass, and those of 
my friends who aren't citizens of course were very opposed to it. I was caught 
in between my friends who were strongly opposed to it and those who were 
strongly in favor of it. It caused a lot of conflict between us -- two of my 
friends aren't talking to each other now. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing that frustrated me about these elections was the number of Latinos 
who voted. The percentage of Latinos in the entire state is about 25% but 
Latinos only made up 8% of the total who voted. It's discouraging to an extent, 
but it is also like a wake-up call saying that we need to get into the 
political process and actually vote. 
</P>
<P>
 When I heard the results of the elections I almost thought that my vote didn't 
count at all because everything I voted for lost. I voted against 187, and it 
passed. I voted against Wilson, and he got reelected. But I know that if I took 
up the attitude that a vote doesn't count, and if others took up this attitude, 
then that 8% would be 5% or 4%. So I do realize the importance of a vote.  
</P>
<P>
 I felt like there was support from the Latino community in the marches and 
protests against Proposition 187. I marched to City Hall and I saw a lot of 
energy. I saw a lot of people committed to the ideals, but I also saw people 
with ambivalence, with mixed feelings, people unsure of how to react and how to 
deal with the results. But overall I did see a lot of positive energy.  
</P>
<P>
 The results of the elections made me realize how much racism actually 
surrounds us and how much people are actually willing to use that as a 
political weapon. I think with the passing of Proposition 187 discrimination 
has become politically correct. Not that racism didn't exist before, but this 
just reinforces it. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that illegal immigration was being used as a platform in this 
particular election. I think Pete Wilson was using illegal immigration as a 
vehicle to gain supporters, and I think he succeeded in doing so. But in the 
process I think his tactics hurt the immigrant community, scapegoated them and 
created an image of the community as a cause for the economic ills of this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 I went home to my neighborhood the day after the elections. I found a lot of 
gloomy faces and saddened faces. I also saw a lot of disillusionment in the 
people with the country and the government, and the realization that the 
American dream is not always fulfilled as it's claimed. But I also saw the will 
of the people to overcome this, and although others may think that the harm has 
been done, we've only just begun to fight this.

FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; GARFIELD'S SECOND-HALF RALLY FALLS SHORT AGAINST TAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taft 34, Garfield 27 -- Edgar Soto was stopped at the eight-yard line as time 
expired, cutting short Garfield's dramatic second-half rally against the 4-A's 
second-seeded team in a City Section first-round game at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs, seeded No. 15, held Taft scoreless in the second half, scored 
three touhdowns themselves while recovering two late onside kicks, and came up 
just eight yards short. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started slowly, but conditioning-wise, we knew that Taft had too many 
players going both ways," Garfield Coach John Aguirre said. "We felt the second 
half would be ours." 
</P>
<P>
 It was. Garfield (7-4) outscored the City's second-seeded team, 20-0, after 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The final touchdown, a 14-yard play, came with only 33 seconds remaining in 
the game. After recovering the onside kick, Garfield drew a pass interference 
penalty against Taft and had the ball at the Toreador 23-yard line with only 
five seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 After a time out, Garfield opted to go with the screen to Soto, who was 
tackled at the eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Hermoso passed for 352 yards and three touchdowns for Garfield. Rudy 
Burruel had eight receptions for 179 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor second half overshadowed a brilliant first half for Taft, in which 
running back Jerry Brown, who finished with 266 yards in 19 carries, had 
touchdown runs of five, 22, and 86 yards. Quarterback Dayon Shaw threw two 
scoring passes.KENNEDY COSGROVE

LOYOLA STARTS FAST IN SOUTHERN SECTION, 34-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Over the years, winning has become familiar to Loyola High School's football 
teams.  
</P>
<P>
 The CIF Division I champions in 1990 took their first step toward another 
title in Friday's first-round playoff game, a 34-8 triumph over Lakewood in the 
first round of CIF Southern Section play at Pierce College in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great to be a part of the tradition," said sophomore quarterback 
Scott Walter, who threw for three touchdowns in the game the Cubs controlled 
from the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to go to Loyola. My older brother 
went here, and it's great to be a Cub." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Lakewood coach Phil Dunaway sized up the Division I match.  
</P>
<P>
 "Loyola's been successful for a long time. They've earned their tradition of 
winning, and its something that our kids realize. Loyola expects to win, our 
kids are still learning how to win," said the second-year coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' play didn't do much to disrupt the Cubs' winning legacy. They 
were held to just 96 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs thoroughly dominated both lines of scrimmages from the first snap to 
the last. The first sign of a blowout surfaced after running back Mike Vanis 
scored on Loyola's first snap, a 59-yard run down the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 That set the tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanis, who leads the Cubs in rushing with 590 yards, went on to pile up 138 
yards and two touchdowns in 19 carries in three quarters of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter, who gave regular starting quarterback Kyle Spielbuehler a chance to 
rest his injured ankle, finished the game with seven completions in 11 attempts 
for 122 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood quarterbacks Joe Harris and Marquis Nave were held to a combined five 
completions on 14 attempts for 36 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola improves to 8-2, advancing into the next round of the Division I 
playoffs, while Lakewood ends the season with a 6-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola plays No. 2 seed, undefeated Santa Ana Mater Dei, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, who were Moore League tri-champs with Long Beach Poly and Long 
Beach Jordan, hadn't had a share of the league title in 11 years.

 At the end of the third quarter, the Tigers pulled to 19-15 on a five-yard run 
by Keijuan Douglas and his conversion run but a comeback attempt by San

NOTEBOOK; HUSKIES STIRRING MEMORIES OF 1990 CHAMPION SQUAD 
</P>

<P>
 East Los Angeles College Coach Orlando Brenes ranks his 1994 soccer team with 
the Huskies' 1990 state champion team. The squad is certainly living up to 
those expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies are the top-ranked team in Southern California and second in the 
state behind De Anza. East L.A. wrapped up its sixth conference title in seven 
seasons last week with South Coast Conference victories over Long Beach City 
and Cerritos to improve to 17-2-1 and 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
 East L.A. begins its quest of a state title Tuesday night at 6 when the 
Huskies play host to an opponent to be determined in the first-round of the 
Southern California Regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some lapses but we won the conference outright," Brenes said about 
the South Coast Conference, which includes six of the top 15 teams in Southern 
California. "If we can put things together, this team has the ability to be one 
of the best in the state and make it to the final four." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Prawit Namutawong is the top-rated goalkeeper in the state. He has 
11 shutouts and allowed only three goals against 110 shots for a 0.24 goals per 
match average. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Sergio Vasquez, along with Juan Carlos Rocha, scored in the Huskies 
2-1 victory over Long Beach on Tuesday. Vasquez leads the team with 15 goals 
and 12 assists. Roberto Hernandez has seven goals and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Thrill of victory -- The Garfield girls' cross-country team made its 11th 
consecutive appearance in the City finals Saturday at Pierce College. Bell, 
Belmont, Bravo Medical Magnet and Huntington Park also competed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the entrants in the boys' division were Belmont -- winner of 10 of the 
past 12 City titles -- Bell, Garfield and South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franklin High girls' volleyball team defeated Fairfax, 15-13, 15-6, 16-13, 
Tuesday to advance to Saturday's City 3-A final against Sylmar at Occidental 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Agony of defeat -- The Roosevelt High girls' volleyball team took defending 
City 4-A champion Palisades to five games before losing a semifinal playoff 
match on the road Tuesday, 16-14, 6-15, 11-15, 15-2, 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Zenobia Tyson Hunt, who had 27 kills to lead Roosevelt (12-4), and setter 
Minnie Alatriste are the only seniors on the team. Middle blocker Dawn Pellerin 
is a junior. Outside hitters Rose Zuniga, Anabel Tovar and Maricela Santoyo are 
freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had their backs to the wall and when they came roaring back, our young 
ladies kind of froze because they had never been in that position before," said 
Coach Ken Maki. "I think they were a little overconfident." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the outside -- The Bell Gardens football team was left out of the Southern 
Section playoffs for only the second time since 1977 after forfeiting an Oct. 
14 victory against Keppel over an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell elevated several junior varsity players because 
Keppel did not field a junior varsity team. A sophomore running back used 
sparingly in the 29-6 victory was only 14. State CIF rules require varsity 
players to be at least 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The forfeit forged a three-way tie for third place in the Almont League with 
Bell Gardens, Keppel and Schurr, all with 2-3 records. Keppel was awarded the 
final playoff berth by virtue of a coin flip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Names in the news -- Michael Granville of Bell Gardens High was selected to 
the Track & Field News magazine high school All-American team. Granville won 
the state 800-meter title and set a national sophomore record of 1 minute 48.98 
seconds -- the fastest time in the nation . . . Mercedes Edwards of Washington 
High has made the women's basketball team at Arizona State as a walk-on. The 
6-0 forward averaged 7.3 points and 8.1 rebounds a senior last season . . . 
Midfielders Jesus Gonzalez and Victor Arana, defender Dario Gomez and 
goalkeeper Claine Plummer of Cal State Los Angeles were selected to the 
All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. soccer team. The Golden Eagles 
finished 15-4-2 and reached the first round of the NCAA Division II playoffs.

 BAYWATCHERS: A firm preseason prediction by Hall of Famer Deacon Jones, now a 
Rams broadcaster: The Rams will win one of their two games against San 
Francisco. . . . The Rams have a reputation of playing the 49ers tough -- the 
Rams lead in their oldest rivalry, 48-40 with two ties. But: The 49ers (8-2), 
who host the Rams (4-6) today (C2), have won the last eight, including a sound 
thumping earlier this year. The game will be televised by cable ESPN at 5 p.m.

 BOB'S DAY: When Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) beamed on election 
night: "This is a great day for America," did you get the feeling he'd be 
backing down on his promise that this would be his last term? . . . . Dornan, 
who says he may reconsider after the GOP takeover on Capitol Hill, is a proven 
fund-raiser if he decides to run beyond this sixth term. Time magazine lists 
him the fifth-biggest campaign spender in the House this election, at $1.8 
million.

themselves "Hens & Chickens?" Anita Williams, a graphic designer at Golden West 
College, is a founding member of such a group. . . . They're an unusual 
fund-raising arm for the Huntington Beach college. The "Hens & Chickens" sew 
quilts -- a major group project is nearing completion -- which are then sold to 
benefit Golden West. . . . Says Williams: "People are very receptive to 
quilts." Note: The "Hens & Chickens" name actually comes from a type of quilt 
pattern.

 DISNEYLAND REDUX: The TV show "Disneyland" debuted 40 years ago in a neat 
swap: Walt Disney promised the show to ABC if it would help him build his theme 
park in Anaheim. Both sides won: The show became a blockbuster hit -- with a 
few title changes -- and Disneyland became a household name. . . . ABC has 
announced that on Dec. 10, it will run an hourlong retrospective of the 
long-running Disney TV show. Says Walt's nephew Roy: "Walt was one of the few 
people in town who saw TV as an opportunity and not as a threat."

USC LOSES ROSE BOWL BID -- AND GAME TO UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day that could have brought a spot in the Rose Bowl brought only frustration 
for USC's football team, which lost to archrival UCLA on Saturday at the Rose 
Bowl, 31-19. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain the Rose Bowl berth, plus an undisputed Pacific 10 Conference 
championship, USC needed to have Oregon State upset rival Oregon and then beat 
UCLA.Neither happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon won, 17-13, gaining a spot opposite Big 10 champion Penn State in the 
Jan. 2 game in Pasadena and its first Rose Bowl berth since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 And UCLA further ruined USC's day with an inspired second half in which it 
outscored the Trojans, 28-7, and took its fourth consecutive victory over 
favored USC. As the closing seconds ticked away, shortly after the Bruins' 
Teddy Lawrence made an interception in the end zone that throttled USC's final 
drive, the UCLA partisans in the crowd of 91,815 began chanting, "Four more 
years, four more years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans began the game with a five-game winning streak and a No. 13 
national ranking by the Associated Press. The loss left them with a 7-3 record 
(6-2 in the Pac-10), going into their regular-season finale Saturday against 
Notre Dame at the Coliseum, and still with an outside chance at a major bowl 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is out of the post-season picture with a 5-6 record (3-5 in the Pac-10), 
but the victory gave the Bruins an upbeat finish after a season that included 
an injury to All-American wide receiver J.J. Stokes and six consecutive 
defeats.

SCOTT HARRIS: PROPOSITIONS, AMENDMENTS AND BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She sat in a blue plastic chair, waiting her turn at the Pacoima Community 
Health Clinic. Elvia's baby, her second child, isn't due until April, but 
already her girth strains the fabric of her blouse. A button is missing at her 
breast. To compensate, she employs a lapel pin -- a tiny American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvia is a native of Mexico who illegally immigrated to the United States 
several years ago. She's quick to point out that her Mexican husband is here 
lawfully and she has some paperwork pending at the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she knows most California voters apparently wish she'd stay away from 
this public health clinic. She is here because enforcement of Proposition 187, 
despite its overwhelming approval, has been delayed by the courts. But above 
all else, Elvia is at this clinic because she wants her baby to be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a virtual certainty that Elvia's child will be born on U.S. soil and will 
therefore be an American citizen. The 14th Amendment doesn't care about the 
mom's immigration status; it just cares about the baby. Still, a large majority 
of California's voters -- though, incidentally, not nearly enough to pass a 
school bond measure -- think Elvia and her unborn baby shouldn't be entitled to 
the care accorded America's poor or its legal immigrants. Voters are right in 
defending the principle that people should not benefit from illegal acts. Then 
again, unborn children aren't usually considered criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's try to strip away the emotions and philosophical quandaries of 
immigration. Today's topic is prenatal economics -- a picture that seems to be 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, before he hitched his reelection bid to Proposition 187, 
Gov. Pete Wilson believed an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure. 
Prenatal care fit snugly into Dr. Wilson's moderate Republican prescription of 
preventive government. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous studies backed him up, asserting that prenatal care ultimately saves 
money by decreasing the number of premature babies and other medical 
complications that result in astronomical hospital costs. California health 
authorities concluded the savings to be about 2 to 1, according to Irene Riley, 
chief of government relations for the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the best spirit of a fiscal conservative, Wilson committed state funds 
to help pregnant women and their babies and to save the taxpayers greater costs 
down the road. Health professionals who applauded Wilson now say that 187, the 
governor's new prescription, will result in more health problems and greater 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But now comes a new study that suggests that maybe those old studies were 
wrong, and that the savings of prenatal care were exaggerated. In a paper 
published Nov. 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers asserted 
that earlier studies were flawed. The researchers haven't penciled in new 
estimates, but they say the assumption of great savings is a myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for this study to be touted as proof that prenatal care is a waste of 
taxpayers' money, though that isn't what the researchers concluded either. 
Indeed, the doctors who conducted this study are wary of how their report will 
be used politically. The doctors, wrote Gina Kolata of the New York Times, 
emphasized that "prenatal care is medically important and that all pregnant 
women should receive it." One of the researchers told Kolata: "I don't want 
this to be construed as an anti-prenatal-care article." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line in health care economics is that it's impossible to strip away 
the emotion. The ultimate question is the value of human life, and the market 
hasn't yet succeeded in fixing a price tag, despite the best efforts of 
lawyers, insurance companies, courts and kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 A premature baby is very expensive; a stillborn child isn't. What fate do you 
wish for Elvia's child? For society at large, a healthy baby, or a sick baby 
who gets well, has the potential to be a benefit to society, not a burden, 
especially if he or she is allowed to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angie Mejia has no doubt that prenatal care saves lives and money. A licensed 
vocational nurse at the Pacoima clinic, she counsels expectant mothers on their 
diets and warns them of folk remedies that contain lead, a potential cause of 
brain damage in their babies. She's looked for signs of toxemia and other 
conditions that could result in expensive complications at birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The 187 champions argue that the measure will stop immigration and thus 
prevent Los Angeles from becoming the Calcutta of California, a Third World 
nightmare teeming with crime, disease and death. Angie sides with health care 
professionals and law enforcement authorities, who say the causes of disease, 
poverty and crime will be served by the denial of medical services and 
schooling, not vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Angie helped me interview Elvia. She is 30 years old and came to the United 
States in search of work. She's cleaned houses and helped raise children, 
working for one family two years. Her husband, a sheet metal worker, rises at 
5:20 a.m. to go to work. She's up at 6 to get her 14-year-old son and her 
13-year-old sister ready for school. Elvia's mother, back in Mexico City, sent 
the teen-agers up a couple years ago. Their monthly household income is about 
$1,400, including the $300 they get from the boarder. Home is a two-bedroom 
apartment rented for $675 per month. The teen-agers have a bunk bed in the 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvia seemed to understand the voters' resentment, especially the anger toward 
immigrants who commit crimes and join gangs. But she thinks decent people are 
being blamed too. Proposition 187, she said, won't stop illegal immigration. 
Americans, she suggested, underestimate the desperate conditions that 
immigrants face back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're always going to be coming. Even though they take us out of here, 
we'll still come back," she said, "because they want a better life." 
</P>
<P>
 Elvia says she's glad her child will be born an American. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many people think her baby isn't worthy, since mom's an illegal 
immigrant. That's why a movement is afoot to close the illegal immigrant 
loophole created by the 14th Amendment. That amendment was adopted after the 
Civil War, affirming that quaint American notion that "all men are created 
equal." (We later figured that meant women too.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great topic for another time.

OFFICER WAS MISTAKEN AS TO PARENTAGE OF 'KIDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Police Net 74 Students in Truancy Sweep" (Times, Oct. 26), Officer Ken 
Knox "sternly told the principal of Taft High School after he brought in 31 
students last week" that "we are not here to baby-sit your kids." He is also 
quoted as saying, "We want to make the message clear to the principal that he 
has to control his kids." But your reporter did not attempt to get the 
principal's side of the story, leaving Officer Knox's misplaced paternity 
identification to stand uncorrected. 
</P>
<P>
 These truant students are not the principal's kids. They're not mine either. 
Our school classroom doors are open. They offer educational opportunity to all 
who are enrolled at Taft. Some students reject the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy at this point to blame the parents of the truants; shouldn't 
they be responsible for having their children in school? Would that it were so 
simple. A parent told me he asked his son to swear on his grandmother's grave 
that he was going to school. He did so, and when he was arrested for truancy he 
said, "I told the truth! I swore I would go to school. But I didn't swear I'd 
go to class in the school." 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when everyone resorts to such rationalizations to avoid personal 
responsibility, the time is overdue when we recognize that passing the 
responsibility to someone else doesn't solve the problem. Neither does a slap 
on the wrist. Maybe we should make the punishment a family one and put the 
parents and children together in the classroom to make sure the student is 
really getting to the classroom (just as soon as we build bigger rooms, since 
we're already stuffed to the rafters with 40-plus size classes).

WE'D BETTER START LIVING UP TO OUR STANDARDS; EARTHQUAKE SAFETY CODES ARE EASY 
TO WRITE, TOUGH TO OBEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's Seismic Safety Commission, based in Sacramento, is a state 
advisory panel that was created in 1975. It is an influential body on matters 
involving earthquake preparedness, and for good reason. Over the years, the 
commission's members and staff have included top-flight structural engineers, 
geologists and Caltech professors. In other words, these are serious folks who 
do not generally fall prey to hype, hyperbole or catchy sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has been concerned with several weighty issues since the 
Northridge earthquake. Among them: considerations on the need to retrofit 
schools, concerns about the adequacy of current construction standards, and the 
matter of how much can be done in these tight fiscal times. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the commission has dropped something of a bombshell involving the 
approximately 11,800 buildings damaged in the Northridge-centered earthquake. 
Its final report ought to be required reading for local and state officials in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The main conclusion: Building codes, in most instances, were adequate -- but 
many buildings weren't. The commission found that many of the structures that 
were damaged showed evidence of shoddy construction and flawed design. There 
also were building inspections, before the earthquake, that should have pointed 
out such shortcomings, but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 A quote that says it all comes from Paul Fratessa, the commission's chairman: 
"We would not have had a lot of the damage we had . . . if we had taken what we 
had today and used it properly." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time that we've heard this. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, experts at a hearing at Van Nuys Airport told the commission that 
such problems were to blame for a considerable amount of the damage that 
occurred in the quake. Again, the source was a persuasive one: Rawn Nelson, the 
president-elect of the Structural Engineers Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the items that we have commonly found is that there has been some poor 
methods of construction as well as some engineering done that did not 
understand the basic principles of engineering," Nelson said then. "We have 
found anchor bolts not screwed to plates, but simply lying beside them. That 
doesn't do any good at all. And there has often been improper bracing." 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering done that did not understand the basic principles of engineering? 
That's not just unsettling. It ought to be infuriating for businesses, building 
owners and the taxpayers who are footing the bill for quake repairs and 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important for one very big reason. Engineers eventually will 
determine the kind of standards that will be needed to prevent cracks in the 
welds of steel-frame buildings in a quake of similar intensity to the 
Northridge temblor. New standards are also attainable in the case of wood-frame 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the new standards won't matter a whit if architects, 
engineers, contractors and code-enforcement officials who weren't able to 
follow the old rules do the same thing when asked to follow new standards. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the commission's solutions is a call for mandatory additional training 
for architects, engineers, contractors and building inspectors. Who can argue 
with that?

BURBANK'S HOLLOW BOAST ABOUT ITS MALL; GETTING OUT OF THE MEDIA CITY CENTER 
DEAL WASN'T A COUP, BUT MORE LIKE A SALVAGE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quite a few superlatives are being tossed about by Burbank city officials in 
describing the deal they recently announced with the developer of the Media 
City Center mall. Under the terms, which are supposed to become effective later 
this week, the developer has agreed to pay the city a total of $10 million in 
1995 and 1996. "Great," some say. "A phenomenal success . . . an absolute 
coup," says City Manager Bud Ovrom. 
</P>
<P>
 Our reporter, Vivien Lou Chen, used quite a different term to describe the 
situation: The city is "salvaging $10 million," and that seems very much closer 
to the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the city of Burbank had tried desperately to build a major shopping 
center in the downtown area (emphasis on desperately). To do so, city officials 
eventually invested $120.7 million as part of a 1990 deal that seemed much too 
good to be true (emphasis on too good to be true).  
</P>
<P>
 Within 25 years, nearly $229 million in sales taxes, property taxes and hotel 
taxes were to be collected from the mall. The developer had even agreed to 
split 50-50, with the city, the mall's net operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy soured. Business is up a bit at the mall mainly because the 
Northridge earthquake knocked out several other malls around the Valley. But 
Media City Center doesn't figure to produce as much as a dime in profit in the 
foreseeable future. The mall's losses in 1992 and 1993, in fact, amounted to 
$9.4 million. And in the course of this disastrous sojourn through the 
recession, whenever the developer needed a major concession from the city, he 
got it. The city has even surrendered the taxpayers' rights to half of any 
future profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the property tax revenue money that the city counted on to make good 
on its investment was diverted to the developer. The city also agreed, last 
year, to give the developer all of its share of sales taxes from three Media 
City Center establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The salvaging points here include the fact that there is a mall in downtown 
Burbank. It has helped a bit to revitalize the downtown area. Weekend crowds at 
the mall are fairly strong and may hold up even as the quake-damaged 
competition in the San Fernando Valley continues to recover old business. Some 
new jobs have also been generated, and that's certainly a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burbank officials clearly need to stop crowing about the great deal they 
supposedly have made in finally getting out of the mall business; it ought to 
be good enough that the city's taxpayers aren't demanding that they eat one.

SOKA UNIVERSITY-CONSERVANCY COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Soka University-Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy compromise is good -- 
most importantly because it saves tens of millions of dollars that would need 
to be spent on the increasingly lengthy condemnation action and seizure of the 
property. The Conservancy admittedly does not even come close to having this 
kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed settlement preserves the King Gillette Ranch, which is the only 
portion of the property outlined for preservation in National Park Service's 
own documents. An adjacent part of the campus, in fact, has been previously 
entitled for development by no less than the State Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A scaled-down residential college and graduate school would cause virtually no 
environmental impact. And besides, the ultimate build-out of the school would 
have to be determined by the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission 
and the Board of Supervisors and not by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most opponents of Soka don't realize that the university, without a 
settlement, would continue to defend itself against condemnation and would 
eventually win. The school already has enough buildings to support well over 
1,000 students and at the very least, it can lawfully do that. 
</P>
<P>
 So the hope that Soka University may sell its campus is pie-in-the-sky. The 
site will either be a commuter university of more than 1,000 students or a 
well-planned park and residential university that will benefit everyone 
concerned and preserve the majority of the land as open space at no financial 
burden to the state. 
</P>

<P>
 * I was most disappointed to hear that the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
is considering abandoning its attempt to stop Soka from building a huge 
university campus in the middle of the scenic Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the conservancy is so uncertain of the success of its lawsuit 
against an international institution with enormous financial resources that it 
is happy to settle for anything that saves its face. 
</P>
<P>
 On the basis of the facts as we now have them, no other explanation seems 
plausible, because there can be no one on the conservancy who does not deplore 
the prospect of finding a footprint nearly twice the size of Topanga Plaza 
right in the middle of the parkland it is dedicated to protect.

EVERYONE IS AFRAID OF MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Genelin's Oct. 2 article on the Ahmanson Ranch project is right on the 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The many deals of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy are doing the 
mountains more harm than good.Something strange works within the webs of the 
conservancy. What kind of convoluted mandate is it to turn Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy property over to state and federal park once "public use" 
improvements have been made -- that is, once shopping malls, congestion, tract 
homes and golf courses have been established? It's about time someone had the 
courage to speak up about this deplorable situation. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of discontent among environmentalists with the way the 
conservancy does business. The trouble is, everyone is scared to speak up. The 
government employees certainly can't. They might lose their jobs. Neither can 
the individual groups interested in saving this or that canyon. They all know 
Joe Edmiston's conservancy has cornered all the land purchase money and he 
controls all the spigots. If a group opposes what he is doing, he threatens to 
pull the funding from their pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find many legislators of influential constituents criticizing the 
conservancy either. Isn't there anyone with the courage and authority to save 
the public from this outrageous waste of public funds?

CRIME BILL FUNDS SHOULD HELP 6TH LAPD DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman Richard Alarcon's recent motion to create a sixth police 
division in the San Fernando Valley deserves the full support of every resident 
in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman points out the need to concentrate a larger police presence in 
the higher crime areas, while relieving the five existing police divisions of 
being too spread out to effectively control the high-crime pockets.While some 
resistance to his plan may grow out of a concern over available funds, the 
recently enacted federal crime bill should help implement this plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alarcon has been successful in maintaining a gang truce in portions 
of the northeast Valley, but the recent murders of two elderly women in their 
homes and a businessman in Van Nuys emphasizes the need for an increased and 
more visible presence of the police on our streets.

RUBBISH-DUMPERS ARE TRASHING THE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Come on, homeowners in the west San Fernando Valley: Why are you still dumping 
refuse unrelated to the earthquake at your curbside with quake materials for 
free pickup by the city? 
</P>
<P>
 The Times recently ran an article stating Los Angeles had thus far spent $61 
million for earthquake removal and dumping and its services are expected to 
continue till Jan. 17, the anniversary of the quake.Would you hazard a guess on 
these final costs, ultimately born by the taxpayer? 
</P>
<P>
 As I ride my bike in the Chatsworth area, I see supposed quake-damage 
materials at the curb which include garage refuse, Christmas boxes and tree 
branches. What do these have to do with the quake?  
</P>
<P>
 Contractors should have been responsible for all debris resulting from their 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for Valleyites to exhibit some pride and responsibility in their 
towns.

GOD DIDN'T PLANT TREES ON THE RESEDA RIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Reseda Ridge Park controversy demonstrates the problems created when the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy strays from its mandate ("Ecologist 
Criticizes Park Tree Planting," Oct. 22). 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy wants the public to forget that it was created as a broker to 
buy lands for both the National Park Service and state parks in order to fill 
gaps within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area -- not to 
function as a third park agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy plans to plant 300 trees on Reseda Ridge while it owns it, at 
least temporarily. As much as God loves trees, she didn't plant many in the 
Santa Monica Mountains and none on Reseda Ridge. The National Park Service 
organic act of 1916, the guideline for the National Recreation Area, states it 
is "to conserve the scenery and the natural . . . objects and wildlife therein 
and to provide for the enjoyment of same in such manner as will leave them 
unimpaired." Trees introduced where they are not natural impair the natural 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Any development upon these lands the conservancy holds temporarily must be 
consistent with policies of the agency designated to receive the land.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Edmiston of the conservancy says it would rather keep the parkland than 
force it onto the state, to plant these trees in violation of the guideline so 
the land cannot be turned over to the very agency designated to receive it. 
Thus the conservancy would become a third park agency and no longer face 
termination when its job is done. The conservancy has proudly stated for years 
now that it is the "largest landowner along Mulholland Drive." 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy also owns much land outside the Santa Monicas. With no 
conservation guidelines, its expansion often sacrifices natural resources, 
within and outside the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 What inducement exists for the conservancy to follow its original mandate -- 
to turn over lands to state and national parks? None. The conservancy will hold 
those lands for itself. But at what cost to natural resources and wildlife? The 
Reseda Ridge Park controversy reveals that the conservancy is not a 
conservation agency. What irony!

 * My letter is prompted by the story "Ecologist Criticizes Park Tree 
Planting." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, members of our community agreed to plan for an entrance to 
the Santa Monicas from the south end of Reseda Boulevard. The plan called for a 
parking lot, a ranger station and an entrance into the park. Everyone agreed 
that the natural feel of the Santa Monicas should not be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan includes planting 300 trees, none of which is native to the area, 
where there were none before and keeping them alive by an irrigation system 
which will cost substantial sums to operate. Native plants survive on water 
they get naturally . 
</P>
<P>
 We have been told further that there will be no ranger station and no ranger 
due to lack of funds. This location is far more critical than the existing 
station at Glen Eagles and Corbin. If the conservancy cuts back on this 
artificial planting plan, it will have the money for the ranger and the station 
and then some. The conservancy intends to spend more than $1 million for the 
current plan, which has moved forward without public hearings in the three 
ensuing years. 
</P>
<P>
 We are interested in keeping the entrance to Topanga State Park from Reseda 
Boulevard as natural and unspoiled as it always has been. Its beauty has drawn 
hundreds of people each week to view the natural habitat as it originally 
existed. If Joe Edmiston, the conservancy executive director, would get out of 
his helicopter and walk into the mountains, he would know that and stop trying 
to fool Mother Nature.

A WELCOME DISCUSSION OF HATE CRIMES; GLENDALE'S LEADERSHIP HAS TOO LONG IGNORED 
BIGOTRY TOWARD ARMENIANS, AFRICAN AMERICANS AND JEWS. WITH OPEN DIALOGUE, NEW 
TASK FORCE CAN DEVELOP SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KRIKORIAN, John Krikorian is publisher of Business Life magazine, a 
past candidate for Glendale City Council and past chairman of the Glendale 
Community Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anything positive can be said about the recent acts of hatred against the 
Armenians and Jewish communities in Glendale, it is that for the first time 
there is open and public discussion of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Glendale's leadership ignored the many signals about the extent of 
the hatred toward Armenians and African Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago the city had the opportunity to take the initiative against hate 
crimes. But city officials had other things in mind and did not support the 
Glendale Community Council. City Council members and others in the city had a 
tough time accepting the words human relations and did not seize the 
opportunity. Instead they concentrated on pigeons, the Alex and the downtown 
strategic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the aftermath of the spray-painting of anti-Armenian slogans on the 
headquarters of an Armenian scout organization earlier this year, Mayor Eileen 
Givens created a Task Force on Community Relations to examine the issue. This 
represents a sharp -- and welcome -- change in direction for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals must not be intimidated into silence about racism and bigotry. 
Open dialogue is needed to develop solutions.  
</P>
<P>
 I should like to offer some suggestions to the new task force: 
</P>
<P>
 * Make this more than a press relations opportunity for elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish effective and direct communication links with Armenians and others 
in language and media that reach them directly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look outside the city for ideas. The Anti-Defamation League has developed a 
program called A World of Difference to confront and overcome the tensions 
associated with an increasingly diverse community and nation. It can be an 
effective means of providing strategies to those who work with young people to 
confront their biases, challenge prejudicial behavior and communicate the value 
of diversity. The Youth Service/Family Component, unique to the California 
region, was generously underwritten by the James Irvine Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Review Pasadena's Creating a Non-Violent Community program as a model for 
supplementing or replacing Glendale's weekly city-sponsored forums on issues. 
Pasadena's program includes a process for devising solutions to problems as 
well as discussing them. Discuss this with such organizations as the 
Pasadena-Foothill branch of the Los Angeles Urban League, which was 
instrumental in devising its program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring Glendale's school district into the process. "The youth of our country 
represent the best hope for the future in reducing bias. . . . We (must) get to 
young people as early as possible," said Sanford Cloud, National Conference 
leader. The National Conference is a religious organization whose main mission 
is to fight bigotry and intolerance through education and communication. It was 
founded as the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Its program, 
Straight From Kindergarten Through 12th Grade, could be the answer for 
Glendale. Take a look at the American Rights Foundation program, which teaches 
citizenship to our youth. The Times Mirror corporation is one of many 
co-sponsors of this program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Glendale's religious leaders have to assume a greater responsibility and 
take the initiative in the education and solution process in building brotherly 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 * Understand and help to recognize the many important minority/ethnic holidays 
that are observed in our cities, such as Armenian Genocide Day (April 24, 1995, 
will be the 80th anniversary of this tragic event), Martin Luther King Day and 
Cinco de Mayo, to mention a few. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand the Sister City program to establish a partnership with a city in 
Armenia (or Nagorno-Karabakh) and a possible Philippine connection.  
</P>
<P>
 * Implement a formal plan to increase citizenship and voter registration in 
the city. Glendale is far behind Pasadena and Burbank in the percentage of 
voters among the total population.

MAYOR RIORDAN IS BOLSTERING POLICE BY CRIPPLING THE DWP; A HEAVY-HANDED 
TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO FULFILL A CAMPAIGN PROMISE THREATENS TO WEAKEN SERVICE AND 
COMPROMISE THE UTILITY'S EXCELLENT BOND RATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON FURGATCH, Leon Furgatch is a retired manager of community relations and 
educational services for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That loud "sucking sound" you may be hearing is not emanating from Mexico, as 
Ross Perot is fond of saying, but it is coming from Mayor Richard Riordan's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor is siphoning off millions of dollars from the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power to fulfill his pledge to expand the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He is accomplishing this task with arm-twisting that belies his modest, 
nonpolitical public image. 
</P>
<P>
 The behind-the-scenes story began earlier this year when aroused employees at 
the DWP stalled efforts of Riordan appointees on the Board of Water and Power 
Commissioners to alter the DWP's retirement plan, which would have netted $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, the board was able to identify salable surplus assets through the 
efforts of General Manager Ken Miyoshi. Miyoshi, a former power system 
assistant who had been appointed interim general manager when former GM Dan 
Waters retired in February, had been a pleasant surprise for his managerial 
efforts to streamline the DWP's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyoshi's assistants identified a variety of properties in the power system 
that were no longer needed. They estimated the sales might bring $74 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, inquiries to brokers revealed the assets would bring about half 
their estimated value, and it would take time to sell everything off. 
</P>
<P>
 This was taking place when Mayor Riordan desperately needed cash to pay for a 
salary increase for police. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a board member moved to advance $10 million to the mayor from the 
water system's budget. This would have crippled the DWP's ability to make 
repairs and replace old water mains, such as those that recently ruptured in 
the southern part of the San Fernando Valley, creating chaos in the streets. An 
alarmed Miyoshi balked, and the motion failed. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Miyoshi, who had been expected to keep the job, was demoted, 
and the board went ahead with the $74-million transfer, half of which would not 
be recovered from the sale of surplus property. The unusual transfer is noted, 
without explanation, in a leaflet insert with bills currently going to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was in addition to the DWP's annual transfer of 5% of its gross 
revenues to the city's General Fund. The contribution is a substitute for taxes 
the DWP would pay if it were a privately owned utility operating in the city. 
The in-lieu tax this year was $122 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Riordan has moved his former City Hall assistant, William McCarley, into 
the GM job. McCarley has announced a plan to cut the DWP's payroll by 2,900 
over five years to make the municipally-owned utility more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The explanation is that the DWP must become more competitive in anticipation 
of a proposed new state law deregulating utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At this juncture, it should be mentioned that the DWP's residential electric 
rates are currently about 17% lower than those charged by the neighboring 
privately owned Southern California Edison Co. and about 5% higher on the 
commercial and industrial side. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarley said the projected salary savings of $160 million would benefit 
ratepayers. However, the mayor is on record as stating that he would 
appropriate any savings his appointees uncover from the city's three 
money-making departments, including the Airport and Harbor departments, for the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the City Council has also expressed an interest in sharing in this 
bonanza, it would be naive to believe any savings will be plowed back into the 
utility to improve operations. It would make more sense to reduce commercial 
and industrial power rates as a way to attract business and create more jobs in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that although the mayor had also pledged never to raise taxes, 
the reality is that his appropriations represent the addition of an open-ended 
third city tax on DWP customers. Besides the annual 5% transfer, electric users 
absorb a 10% tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's aides claim that the appropriations will not impede the DWP's 
efficiency, since they only represent waste from poor management. They also 
cite the recent council-sponsored audit that confirms such waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, they add, the mayor is not pocketing the money, and ratepayers 
will be repaid with safer streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The response, of course, is that the arbitrary $74-million transfer indicates 
his appointees are cutting sinew as well as fat. If these appropriations 
persist, even before symptoms of poor service become apparent, the first 
indication that the DWP is in trouble will come when Wall Street cuts the DWP's 
present excellent bond rating. This will increase the cost of borrowing money 
to compensate investors for the added risk of possible default. 
</P>
<P>
 On the question of ethics, it is becoming increasingly clear that the mayor is 
strengthening the Police Department at the expense of the DWP, and the public 
pronouncements about improving the DWP's efficiency are nothing more than a 
masquerade.

COMPROMISE OFFERED ON SOKA LAND A BAD DEAL; THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT ON GILLETTE 
RANCH WOULD NOT MAKE FOR A GOOD PARK. NOR WOULD IT RESOLVE THE UNIVERSITY'S 
DESIRE TO DEVELOP IN THIS RURAL SETTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE BROWN, Dave Brown is conservation chairman of the Santa Monica 
Mountains Task Force of the Sierra Club and a member of the citizens advisory 
committee of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monday night the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy will decide whether to 
move forward with its plans to purchase the Soka-owned Gillette Ranch, a 
scenic, unspoiled rural valley in the heart of the mountains, or accept a 
compromise that is considerably less than half a loaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed settlement would not create a good park, nor would it resolve the 
serious problems created by Soka's determination to build a major urban 
facility in this unspoiled natural setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement would require the conservancy to drop its attempt to acquire 
the Gillette Ranch through eminent domain, which Soka opposes in court. Soka 
would then apply to build a somewhat scaled-down institution of 2,500 students, 
as opposed to the 3,400 its present proposal would allow. 
</P>
<P>
 If -- and only if -- the new proposal were approved by Los Angeles County, 
would Soka sell the conservancy 173 acres of Gillette Ranch at market value. By 
fact or by implication, this would align the conservancy with Soka when county 
supervisors considered the plan amendment and zone changes necessary to make 
Soka's proposal a reality. The conservancy should not be clearing the way for a 
development that would spoil a rural valley in the heart of the beautiful 
mountains it was established to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The present Soka proposal would construct 1,810,000 square feet of building 
and parking structure floor space -- an area 70% larger than Topanga Plaza! The 
2,500-student "compromise" would involve about 1,330,000 square feet of 
building space -- "only" 25% larger than the big shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The park value of the Gillette Ranch has been recognized for more than two 
decades. Its oak-ringed meadows and secluded setting backed by rugged peaks, 
coupled with its easy access from the Ventura Freeway, make it ideal for the 
main visitor center and staging area for the Santa Monica Mountains park 
system. Buildings from an old seminary can easily be converted to park uses. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt visited the Santa Monica Mountains 
to view the Soka property. He left no doubt about his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park should really include these parcels of land which lie right at the 
crossroads of their ecosystem and transportation system," he said. "They're 
right at the heart of the park system." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Rep. Anthony Beilenson, author of the legislation that 
established the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, wrote to the 
conservancy opposing the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allowing Soka to build such a campus . . . would do more damage to our 
efforts to complete the National Recreation area than anything else I can 
imagine," he wrote. "The natural resources and beauty of that area would be 
ruined by such intensive use of that site." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is why the settlement would not create a very good park: 
</P>
<P>
 * It includes less than half the level, usable land on the 248-acre Gillette 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 * It includes less than one-third of the oak woodlands that Soka owns. 
</P>
<P>
 * It does not include all the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * A busy urban complex would sit next to the park's visitor center and main 
public areas, destroying the valley's natural ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillette Ranch and vicinity are presently designated for low-intensity rural 
uses in the county's local coastal plan. The development envisioned by the 
settlement violates that plan and would harm the surrounding area. Note: 
</P>
<P>
 * The site is served by two-lane rural roads that cannot be widened except at 
staggering cost, especially through Malibu Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * The project would generate pressure to build homes and businesses in 
surrounding natural lands to support the university. 
</P>
<P>
 * Malibu Canyon/Las Virgenes Road -- the main road serving the site -- is 
already 20% overloaded. Soka would add thousands of daily trips by students, 
employees and service vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some commuters who use the road as a shortcut across the mountains 
inevitably would be forced onto the Ventura and San Diego freeways, which are 
already crowded during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Malibu Creek, which drains the Soka site, supports the southernmost 
steelhead run in the United States. These fish are especially sensitive to the 
street oils, fertilizers and pesticides that the Soka campus would produce in 
abundance. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 15 years several attempts have been made to purchase the King 
Gillette property and other parcels now owned by Soka. In every case 
acquisition has been blocked by a failure to act decisively or by the 
intervention of unfriendly politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Public support for acquisition has grown with time, but every time government 
has balked at finishing the job, the price has gone up. What could have been 
acquired for the $6 million appropriated by the Legislature in 1979 will now 
cost $20 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy undeniably faces uncertainties and risks in continuing to move 
forward with its legal proceedings to acquire the property, but those risks 
pale in comparison to the risk of losing this magnificent property. 
</P>
<P>
 As Secretary Babbitt said, "We can't move this ecosystem around. Sites for

EVERYTHING'S DUCKY FOR UCLA; BRUINS RALLY IN SECOND HALF AS USC'S ROSE BOWL BID 
ENDS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: DONAHUE'S TEAM COMES ON STRONG FOR UNPRECEDENTED FOURTH 
VICTORY IN A ROW OVER TROJANS, 31-19. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rich Brooks and Terry Donahue, coaching kindred spirits, talked on the 
telephone last week as they always do, but with a different close than usual. 
It was an admonition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'If I screw it up, don't you,' " Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA tried to for a half before getting its offense on track in the third 
quarter Saturday. The Bruins then rode out the fourth and handed Donahue his 
fourth consecutive victory over USC, 31-19, in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon had already defeated Oregon State, 17-13, clinching a Rose Bowl berth 
for Brooks' team against Penn State. At day's end, USC's postseason picture had 
clouded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sugar Bowl was not as sweet on the Trojans, who are 7-3 overall and 6-2 in 
the Pacific 10 Conference with Notre Dame still to play. 
</P>
<P>
 It had all seemed under control. USC led at halftime, 12-3, with John Herpin's 
interception in the end zone turning back UCLA's best bid for a touchdown and 
canceling a major USC mistake. On the play after a Bruin fumble, Rob Johnson 
had connected with Keyshawn Johnson on a 29-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sort of thing that humbled UCLA (5-6, 3-5) this season, and some 
angry Bruins huddled after two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were upset," Donahue said. "We screwed it up because we couldn't get those 
points. We kick a field goal, then take off those points (because of a 
roughing-the-kicker penalty) and don't score because we threw an interception. 
. . . We shouldn't have been down 12-3. We felt like we had been betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, about one minute before we went out, the coaches, we talked. We said, 
'We've got to get ourselves together and got to get this team together. We can 
win this game, but we can't be upset.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The key was the first drive in the second half. Once we did that, the game 
was on." 
</P>
<P>
 Six plays covered 65 yards, with a Wayne Cook-to-J.J. Stokes pass covering the 
final 10 to cut USC's lead to 12-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The play went over USC's Mario Bradley, who was alone with Stokes. It was a 
mistake the Trojans did not repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "From then on, every time I looked at J.J. he was double-covered," Cook said. 
"That took some guys out of the middle of the field. You can cut off the run or 
cut off the pass, but you can't do both." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA tried. The Bruin defense sacked USC's Rob Johnson six times for losses 
totaling 43 yards, forced him to fumble once and intercepted two of his passes, 
one inside the 20-yard line, aborting a Trojan rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let Rob Johnson get sacked too many times," USC Coach John Robinson said. 
"And we made some errors in the third quarter that became disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
 A series of them led to the Bruins taking a 17-12 lead. Backed up on his 12 
after a 49-yard punt by Darren Schager, Johnson was hit hard by Phillip Ward, 
losing 11 yards on first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Green got two yards of breathing space, and Johnson faded to pass, 
looking for Ed Hervey over the middle. Paul Guidry was there, deflecting the 
ball to Abdul McCullough, whose diving interception came on the USC 33. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sharmon Shah lost a yard, Cook passed to Stokes for 29. Shah's five-yard 
touchdown run put the Bruins in front for good. He finished the day with 135 
yards in 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead became less tenuous on UCLA's next possession, which followed a 
series in which Johnson was sacked twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA played carefree and loose," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said UCLA nose guard George Kase, "we played Bruin defense, the way we 
should have played all season -- turned up a notch." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, some of the pressure on the defense was alleviated when Bruin 
freshman Jim McElroy scored his first touchdown, on a 30-yard pass by Cook over 
Herpin for a 24-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 USC answered with 74-yard drive, most of the work being done by Green. Seven 
of the eight plays were runs by Green, with Johnson's pass to Hervey for eight 
yards providing the only novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised," Bruin defensive coordinator Bob Field said. "They had been 
passing, so I thought they would pass more." 
</P>
<P>
 They had been getting sacked, so the Trojans decided to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had cut the Bruin lead to 24-19 and, in 27 of these USC-UCLA games, 
Donahue had seen some strange things happen. "But the important thing is that 
we came back and ran the ball down their throats," he said. "That made it 
easier for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Shah did most of the running. Seven times he went into the Trojan line for 35 
yards, eating yardage and, more important, time. Twice he was stopped for no 
gain within a yard of the goal line, which actually helped in that the clock 
continued, cutting off time for USC to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook sneaked over for a 31-19 lead with 8:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 With little to worry about from the running game, given the time, UCLA's 
defense went after Johnson as though on a mission. Ward sacked him on first 
down. He answered with a 20-yard pass to Keyshawn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Kirschke sacked Johnson, so he answered with yet another long 
completion, 34 yards to Keyshawn Johnson on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Johnson combined 11 times for 175 yards, and there was an attempt 
at a 12th, on second down from the UCLA 13. Scrambling to buy time, Rob Johnson 
located his favorite target, but didn't see Bruin cornerback Teddy Lawrence, 
who intercepted in the end zone with 3:11 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Game is over. Redeemed,' " said Lawrence, who was victimized in 
the closing moments of last year's game, which was won only when Marvin Goodwin 
intercepted a Johnson pass, also in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence was right. The game was over, and the Bruin fans among the 91,815 
present struck up a chant: "Four more years, four more years." 
</P>
<P>
 It was music to Donahue's ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost four in a row to them early in my career and people wanted to string 
me up," he said. "To have won four in a row feels great." 
</P>
<P>
 To finally catch up, a 9-9-1 record against the Trojans, feels greater. It 
gave the Bruins a three-game winning streak to end their season at 5-6, and 
Cook saw the irony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was just like the season -- a struggle at first, then strong at the 
end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than that. It was a dominating performance for a much-maligned 
defense. The Trojans were limited to 57 yards rushing, an aspect of their game 
that put increased pressure on Johnson. He passed for 246 yards, but spent much 
of the game scrambling for his life, the target of a defense that sent pass 
rushers from all directions, sometimes at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played better and deserved to win," Robinson said. "As for our team, I 
was worried about them being tired. Our football team gave us everything we 
asked for. They just came up short." 
</P>
<P>
 Fatigue was in part a product of playing Washington State, Arizona and UCLA on 
consecutive weekends. It gets no easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now our season depends on Notre Dame next week," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 So does the Trojan postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 * SHARMON SHAH: He rushes for 135 yards and the go-ahead touchdown to spark 
Bruins. C10

MCCARTNEY LEAVING COLORADO; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COACH WHO BUILT PROGRAM INTO 
POWER WILL STAY THROUGH BOWL GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorado football Coach Bill McCartney, who turned around a moribund program 
and produced a national championship in 1990, resigned on Saturday, moments 
after the Buffaloes' 41-20 regular season-ending victory over Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney, 54, will coach the Buffaloes through whichever bowl game they 
appear in, but he urged the administration to quickly appoint a successor so as 
not to disrupt recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking about this for some time now," McCartney said at a 
postgame news conference, with his wife Lyndi at his side and his family in 
attendance. "I've been here 13 years. It's time. There are things I want to do 
as a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "This chapter has ended. I don't know quite what's around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney, the winningest coach in Colorado history with a 92-55-5 record, has 
guided the Buffaloes to a 10-1 record this season, the loss to No. 1 Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no negatives here," he said. "Everybody -- from (Athletic Director) 
Bill Marolt to the administration -- has been tremendous. This has strictly 
been a very positive situation. We love this place a lot. I don't want to put a 
damper on what we accomplished here today, but it's time." 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney refused to rule out any future coaching ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. "I don't anticipate coaching soon, but I don't rule 
it out." 
</P>
<P>
 He did deny speculation that he might be interested in the vacant Michigan 
State coaching position. "I would put to rest any rumors about going to 
Michigan State," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to celebrate the 13 years of friendships we've had. I'll coach 
through the bowl game, but then I want to get out of the way. We'll need a new 
coach prior to next year's recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney signed a "lifetime contract" in 1990. "It's true I had a 15-year 
arrangement, but I had a five-year contract, and it will expire Jan. 1, 1995," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he informed Marolt and his assistant coaches earlier in the day of his 
decision, and told his players after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to talk him out of resigning," Marolt said, "and so did university 
President (Judith) Albino. When I talked to him this morning, it was the first 
time I had any indication. I was totally surprised, shocked. As I saw this 
program move forward, I thought he'd be in this for the long haul. He's been a 
tremendous asset to this program. We're going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Marolt said he would begin searching for a successor immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make it quick but not so quick that we make a hasty decision," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three assistants on McCartney's staff -- offensive coordinator Elliot 
Uzelac, defensive line coach Bob Simmons and quarterback coach Rick Neuheisel 
-- are believed to be coaching prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he doesn't do anything knee-jerk," Neuheisel said. "This has been a 
long, thought-out scenario, so he's doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said running back Rashaan Salaam: "It's a big loss. I'm used to seeing Coach 
Mac with his crazy look on the sideline. Not to see that is going to be real 
weird. People broke down and started crying when he told us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said safety Steve Rosga: "We're in disbelief, in shock. It's kind of like 
losing a dad." 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney, an assistant at Michigan, was named Colorado's coach in June 1982, 
assuming a program that had gone 3-8, 1-10 and 3-8 the three previous seasons. 
He was 2-8-1, 4-7 and 1-10 his first three seasons in Boulder, but a 7-5 record 
in 1985 began a string of 10 consecutive winning seasons, including an 11-1 
mark in 1989 and an 11-1-1 record in 1990.

 Th is week in the NFL . . . 
</P>
<P>
 SAN FRANCISCO -- The Rams play the 49ers at Candlestick Park at 5 p.m. today 
and does anybody really care anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES -- A league inquiry into the near-riot conditions at last week's 
Raiders-Rams game has determined that the eye-patched face on the side of the 
Raider helmet is either a season ticket-holding member of the "Hooligans For 
Hostetler" fan club or Al Davis inspecting the various outbursts of bloody 
face-bashing in the stands and winking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FOXBORO, Mass. -- Two of the most prominent themes of this NFL season -- "Why 
Can't Bill Parcells Run The Ball Anymore?" and "What Are The Chargers Doing At 
8-2?" -- are explored today as Marion Butts and Natrone Means compare 
statistics and thigh contusions at Foxboro Stadium. Butts, who gave the 
Chargers the best years of his life, is now a broken-down Patriot at 28, 
averaging barely 40 yards per game. Means, meanwhile, leads the AFC in rushing 
in his second season, carrying a workload that will turn him into Marion Butts 
by the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Leroy Hoard-led Cleveland Browns take an astounding 
8-2 record into today's game with the Chiefs, making them, officially, the 
dullest 8-2 team in NFL history, edging out Chuck Knox's 1975 Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO -- Detroit visits Chicago with Barry Sanders on pace for 2,111 yards 
and the Lions on pace for 8-8. How is this possible? A statistical breakdown: 
Times Sanders has carried the ball in 1994 -- 229. Times Sanders has carried 
the ball into the end zone in 1994 -- 3. Times Sanders has rushed for more than 
100 yards in 1994 -- 9. Times Sanders gets the ball inside the opposition 
10-yard line -- almost never. Time for Detroit to change head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PITTSBURGH -- Dissension racked the Steeler camp this past week as more 
players said they'd rather see Mike Tomczak start at quarterback than Neil 
O'Donnell. When reached for comment, Steelers Coach Bill Cowher said he'd 
rather start Terry Bradshaw, or, failing that, Joe Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DENVER -- The Atlanta Falcons face Denver today without the services of 
All-Pro wide receiver Andre Rison, who has been suspended for conduct 
detrimental to the team. Under those provisions, NFL experts surmise that the 
Falcons will attempt to play the Broncos without any defensive players, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Green Bay (6-4, same as Chicago and Kansas City) takes 
on Buffalo (5-5, same as Atlanta, Detroit, the Jets and the Raiders, and one 
game better than Denver, Indianapolis, New England, New Orleans, Arizona and 
the Rams), which means half the league is either at .500 or within one game of 
.500, which has made this season the best ever for long walks in the park with 
the dog on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CINCINNATI -- The Bengals play host to Indianapolis today riding high, having 
won two games in a row, something the Rams haven't done since October, 1991, 
and using the same starting quarterback for the fourth game in a row, something 
the Rams haven't done since December, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SEATTLE -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers go for their ninth loss today against the 
Seahawks amid reports that Peter Angelos is interested in buying the franchise 
and moving it to Baltimore. Angelos, who also has expressed interest in buying 
the Rams and moving them to Baltimore, will not attend the game as he has been 
ordered to round-the-clock care and observation by his physician. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TEMPE, Ariz. -- Rich Kotite brings his 7-1 Philadelphia Eagles, the only team 
to beat San Francisco in San Francisco this season, to Arizona to face Buddy 
Ryan's 4-6 Cardinals, who have lost to Rams and the Giants, needed overtime to 
get by the Redskins and plan to start Jay Schroeder and Mark Higgs in the 
offensive backfield today. Kotite is rumored to be out of a job come January 
while Ryan is as secure as a hog in slop, which goes to show the difference 
between coaching a football team owned by Jeffrey Lurie and one owned by Bill 
Bidwill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 IRVING, Tex. -- Barry Switzer went on record this past week to say that Jimmy 
Johnson took too much credit for the success of the Dallas Cowboys, that it 
doesn't take a genius to coach the Dallas Cowboys into the playoffs, and at 
8-2, Barry Switzer is living proof of this. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MINNEAPOLIS -- Having blown a 20-0 first-half lead in a 26-20 loss at New 
England last week, the Minnesota Vikings are able to host the New York Jets 
today because the pilot of the team flight back to Minneapolis, unlike the 
balance of the traveling party, did not quit at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HOUSTON -- The New York Giants, losers of seven in a row, play the Houston 
Oilers, losers of nine out of 10, in a "Monday Night Football" game that will 
be remembered years from now by members of Jeff Fisher's immediate family and 
absolutely no one else, not even first cousins.

AFTER FALL OF ROME, EVERETT IN COLISEUM; RAIDERS: QUARTERBACK HAS BEEN A BRIGHT 
SPOT FOR SAINTS, AND HE SHOULD BE THROWING TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He went from Ram to sacrificial lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't pleasant, the parting of the Rams and Jim Everett, their quarterback 
for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 He slammed the door on his way out, and he slammed talk-show host Jim Rome to 
the floor of Rome's studio, turning a table over onto him last April. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome had taunted Everett by repeatedly calling him "Chris," an apparent 
reference to former women's tennis star Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
 The inference was clear. Jim Everett was not a real man. Rome was hardly the 
first to make such an inference. The wimp factor was a big reason Everett 
became so unpopular here. Somewhere along the line, he went from the strong, 
excellent quarterback of the late '80s who passed for 31 touchdowns in one 
season and for more than 4,000 yards in another, to a man who was said to have 
nervous feet, who spent more time looking in fear at onrushing linemen than 
looking downfield for his receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair or not, Everett was buried under that image. He became the scapegoat for 
the Rams' collective failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it really only seven months ago that Everett bolted out of that studio, 
the frustration of his disastrous final years with the Rams vented? 
</P>
<P>
 As the quarterback of the New Orleans Saints, he comes back today to Southern 
California. Not to Anaheim Stadium, but to the Coliseum. Not to face the Rams, 
whom he has already beaten this season in New Orleans, but the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. He gets a chance to return and show people firsthand that there's 
still plenty of life in that arm and fire in that belly. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett has an 85.5 quarterback rating, sixth best in the NFC and eighth best 
in the NFL. Along with 11 interceptions, he has passed for 14 touchdowns, six 
more than he passed for all last season, has completed 64.9% of his passes, a 
mark higher than he ever achieved as a Ram, and has passed for 2,507 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Everett says, "I'm not bitter," when asked about being traded to the 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans Coach Jim Mora said, "I see a more confident Jim Everett than I 
ever saw before. I just think he feels good about things right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas many perceived Everett as the problem with the Rams, he is seen as the 
solution with the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans (4-6) is sixth in the league in yards passing but only 26th in the 
28-team league in yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans is hoping to change that by putting the ball in the hands of 
rookie Mario Bates. Bates, a second-round draft choice from Arizona State, 
started for the first time last week against the Atlanta Falcons and rushed for 
141 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have happened a lot sooner had it not been for an incident after the 
second game of the season that sort of defined the season for the Saints. Bates 
and fullback Lorenzo Neal got into an argument in a bar, Neal threw a punch and 
Bates wound up with a broken jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of frustrating for me because I couldn't contribute in any way 
until four or five weeks later," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't do much of anything with his jaw wired shut, except lose a dozen 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with Bates' emergence, look for Everett to go to the air a lot today. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll face a secondary held together with tape and bandages. James Trapp will 
start at right cornerback, for the first time this season, in place of Lionel 
Washington, who is hobbled by a bruised calf muscle, an injury suffered last 
week against the Rams. And Washington had started that game in place of Albert 
Lewis, sidelined because of a sprained knee. Safety Derrick Hoskins will be 
trying to come back from an ankle sprain that knocked him out of last week's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 There's much better news for the Raiders (5-5) on the other side of the ball, 
where quarterback Jeff Hostetler seems recovered from the injury that knocked 
him out of the Ram game in the fourth quarter. Hostetler suffered three jammed 
toes when tackle Gerald Robinson fell on his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Also coming back is offensive left tackle Gerald Perry, who sat out four games 
because of a broken right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Saints played in the Coliseum, the Raiders beat them, 23-13. 
That was in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was a senior that year at Purdue, dreaming of a career in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 He comes back today, his dreams perhaps a bit tarnished. But he seems as 
enthusiastic as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders might chase him and sack him and pound him. But they have been 
warned: Don't question his courage or his manhood.

COWBOYS TOUGH ACT FOR RAMS TO FOLLOW; PRO FOOTBALL: SAN FRANCISCO, COMING OFF 
BIG VICTORY OVER DALLAS, HASN'T LOST TO L.A. SINCE 1990. 
</P>

 Early last week, a Ram publicist said the team's prospects for today's game 
against the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park were not so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you know," he said, "that of the last nine teams to beat Dallas, eight of 
them lost the following week." 
</P>
<P>
 Emotional letdown: The Rams' best hope at 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, 8-2 and winners of five consecutive games, defeated the Cowboys a 
week ago in the biggest game of the season and prepares to play a team it has 
defeated eight times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they have an emotional letdown, but I won't count on it," said Jim 
Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers not only knocked off the Cowboys, but they come into this game 
having already whipped the Rams this season, 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the 49ers believe they are going to have an easy game," Ram tight end 
Troy Drayton said. "They pretty much had their way with us the past few years 
and so they will come out cocky." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Rams beat the 49ers, Irv Pankey, Doug Smith, Duval Love, 
Buford McGee, Jerry Gray and Vince Newsome were in the starting lineup: Nov. 
25, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you something about the 49ers," Ram assistant Joe Vitt said. 
"This is a great organization, filled with great players with absolutely the 
best offensive philosophy probably in the history of the National Football 
League. They have Pro Bowl players and Hall of Fame players at the wide 
receiver and quarterback position. Players like that don't let down. Teams like 
this don't let down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to play the best football game we have played this year. We're not 
going to let down, and we're not expecting them to let down. You're going to 
see the best we have and we're going to see the best they have." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers conducted a brief players-only meeting on the practice field Friday 
to remind themselves not to slack off against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a choice of any team to play after a bye or an emotional game, it 
would be the Rams," Harry Edwards, sports psychologist and special consultant 
to the 49ers, said in an interview with the San Jose Mercury News last week. 
"With them, it's like a bull staring at a red flag. . . . As one player told me 
these are the . . . Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will start Chris Miller at quarterback, although Chris Chandler 
played well the last three games. Chandler, the backup when the season began, 
led the Rams to victories over the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos, and 
was playing well against the Raiders a week ago when he was forced out because 
of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller suffered a serious concussion Oct. 23 and says he is still bothered by 
headaches but has thrown the ball well in practice. With Miller at quarterback, 
the Rams and 49ers were tied, 10-10, with 1:30 to play in the half. Quarterback 
Steve Young then completed six of seven passes to move the 49ers to the Rams' 
one-yard line with four seconds remaining in the half. Young ran the ball into 
the end zone for a 17-10 lead, and the 49ers went on to score 10 unanswered 
points in the first 18 minutes of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a bad defensive call in the two-minute drill and they got it down to 
the one, where they scored," Vitt said. "It's 17-10 at the half and the game 
remains virtually that way until the fourth quarter when we make a call, they 
hit Jerry Rice with a bomb and it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take away those two defensive calls and all of a sudden it's a game. I don't 
see a big gap between these two teams. After two years of building this defense 
there shouldn't be a gap there. We should line up and play these people tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers have averaged 31 points a game in their domination of the Rams the 
last four years, and in six starts against the Rams, Young has completed 70% of 
his passes, passed for 10 touchdowns with two interceptions, and rushed for 
four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Rice has caught 55 passes in his last nine games against the 
Rams for 860 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any team that's invincible," Ram linebacker Joe Kelly said. 
"San Francisco has Rice and Young, but their defense gave up 478 yards 
(actually 408) when they beat Dallas and everybody says they're great. You give 
up 478 yards and who are you kidding? That's not a great defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play them, you can slow down their offense at times, but the main 
thing is to keep them out of the end zone. Force them to take field goals. If 
we can get big No. 36 (Jerome Bettis) rolling and get our offensive line going, 
then we can control the ball. Teams that can control the ball, and keep their 
own defense off the field, usually have the best records. That's what San 
Francisco's offense does, it controls the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, who carried 10 times for 13 yards in last week's 20-17 loss to the 
Raiders, has averaged 103 yards in three starts against the 49ers. However, 
after gaining more than 100 yards in four consecutive games this season, Bettis 
has averaged only 62 in his last five. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep their offense off the field," Bettis said. "They can do so 
many things, they can kind of undress a defense, so it's up to us to play a 
game of keep-away with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know no one gives us a snowball's chance in hell of beating them in their 
place, but you know what? We think we can beat them."

OLD, NEW TOURS WOULD PREFER TO BE ON COURSE THAN IN COURT; GOLF: PGA'S FINCHEM 
SAYS IT WILL BE TOUGH TO GET ALONG WITH WORLD TOUR. CRENSHAW-CALCAVECCHIA LEAD 
SHARK SHOOTOUT.

 You don't need to know geography to figure out the World Golf Tour. A law 
degree might come in handy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the golf war drew lines in the bunkers Saturday when the World 
Tour vowed to begin in 1995 and PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said he 
doesn't see how it's possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem, who met with World Tour spokesman Greg Norman and a number of PGA 
Tour players Friday night, released a statement that said it would be 
"extremely difficult" to accommodate the new tour. 
</P>
<P>
 He also told CBS that a task force will be created to study the situation and 
a meeting will be held Tuesday at Ponte Vedra, Fla., with World Tour organizers 
and Norman's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem emphasized that the PGA Tour hoped to avoid "a confrontation," a court 
battle over the rights of golfers to play in non-PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hope it doesn't come to that," said Frank Williams, who is Norman's 
business adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, the last thing Greg Norman wants to do is to leave the PGA Tour," 
said Williams, who pointed out that players ought to be allowed to play 
anywhere as long as they meet the PGA Tour minimum of 15 events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a restriction of trade otherwise," Williams said. "That's what the (PGA 
Tour's) problem is with the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Finchem said that changes must benefit golf and "not just 
individual participants." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman said he has no personal financial interest in the World Tour, except to 
make up any potential financial losses the tour might incur in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he will have nothing to do with the television production of the 
events for Fox, which is underwriting the proposed eight-event venture at $3 
million per tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in it for the money," Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he hopes there is room for compromise with the PGA Tour. He said 
it is possible that the World Tour could establish new events that run 
head-to-head against PGA Tour events or that existing PGA Tour events take on 
the World Tour format of using the top 30 players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps there is a compromise (that) we don't go with as many events in the 
first season," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no question when the World Tour will begin, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to do it in '95, no matter what," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we wait for the PGA Tour . . . it's taken 30 years already. How long do we 
wait?" 
</P>
<P>
 Norman said he told Finchem that their being thrown together in this arena was 
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure (former commissioner) Deane Beman probably never would have met me," 
Norman said. 
</P>

 Ben Crenshaw and Mark Calcavecchia shot a 10-under par 62 Saturday to lead the 
Franklin Funds Shark Shootout by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw and Calcavecchia lead the team of Lanny Wadkins and Andrew Magee and 
the team of Fred Couples and Brad Faxon going into the final round today at 
Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw and Calcavecchia are at 131 after Saturday's best-ball format. 
</P>
<P>
 After a miserable day putting Friday, Crenshaw made an adjustment. He sawed an 
inch off the top of the shaft of his putter. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples and Faxon shot 64, and their 132 total is tied for second with Wadkins 
and Magee, who had a 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the final round, when the scramble format will be used, five of the 
10 teams are within four shots of the lead, including Norman and Nick Price, 
who shot 63 and are at 135.

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES: HEY, COACH, SIT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two things can be said today about the people who coach big-time basketball 
and football in America, college and pro alike: 
</P>
<P>
 * They have too much power. All coaches have more power than they need -- and 
more than they should be allowed to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 * They belong in the stands. On game day, every coach should be removed from 
the field, or from the basketball floor, and seated in the crowd -- far from 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly every instance, the role of America's football and basketball 
coaches is incompatible with modern trends in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other U.S. businesses have welcomed their employees into the decision 
making, thereby improving production. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, U.S. football and basketball teams are, almost everywhere, ever 
more autocratic. Football coaches, for example, increasingly intrude on the 
moment-by-moment action. And in basketball, coaches scream instructions even as 
a player is going for the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Large changes are due. Overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 At the university level, that seems self-evident. To bring sports into line 
with other campus and classroom customs, college coaches should depart at game 
time while their players demonstrate what they learned in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches wouldn't like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "A team is not a democracy," Indiana basketball Coach Bob Knight has said. 
</P>
<P>
 But why isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 In a nation that has strenuously opposed kings and dictators for more than 200 
years, thousands of Americans have shown that democratic measures are clearly 
more rewarding than an autocrat's. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the American way, when you think about it, for athletes to elect their 
leaders, and for coaches to instruct, not rule. 
</P>
<P>
 And as instructors, they should focus on two neglected areas: teaching players 
to be effective play-callers and productive captains. 
</P>
<P>
 In other sports today -- both individual and team sports -- most coaches are 
much less intrusive. For instance, coaching is against the rules in tennis. 
Most golfers are on their own. At the track, so are jockeys, and, at 200 
m.p.h., race drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although baseball managers micro-manage scandalously, the game tempo in hockey 
denies that privilege to NHL coaches. Track and field coaches are hard to see, 
and harder to find. And at a crew race, the coach, drink in hand, stands on the 
boathouse roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in World Cup soccer are there mixed signals. Mexico lost to Bulgaria when 
its coach failed to make any substitutions in overtime, despite his players' 
exhaustion. But other coaches intruded infamously, ruining big games with 
orders to their players to play only defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, World Cup meddlers are hardly world-class meddlers. That distinction 
belongs to American football and basketball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 With more democracy, the pros as well as the colleges would have a more human 
game, a more varied, more entertaining, more popular game. PLAYERS CAN LEARN 
</P>
<P>
 On the campus scene today, from one school to the next, the real surprise is 
that so few college presidents seem to realize that football ought to be a 
learning experience for their students. 
</P>
<P>
 As should basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a given at any university that activities such as debate teams and school 
plays are for learning. Although play directors are also university employees, 
no school president expects to see the director up on the stage managing 
Juliet's big love scene with Romeo. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next day, he does expect to see the football coach running the school 
team as if it were his personal property: ordering the players about, calling 
all the plays and defenses, and blaming failures on execution, which means, "I 
had a good idea and the players screwed it up." 
</P>
<P>
 College authorities apparently assume that football and basketball are without 
educational purpose even though, surely, student-athletes have a lot to learn 
about living -- about the values that matter to civilized adults -- lessons 
they can get playing a game. 
</P>
<P>
 For there are no born leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was any athlete ever born knowing when to lead, when to follow, when to 
speak up, when to pipe down, how to think under stress, how to interact with 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most 1990s players aren't learning any of that. Standing in the huddle between 
plays, instead of thinking and talking together, they wait like dumb animals to 
be led around. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbol of what's really wrong with big-time sports today is the NFL's 
radio in the helmet -- the tool that finally reduces the quarterback to an 
automaton, even in the two-minute drill, which used to be his. 
</P>
<P>
 Although, happily, the helmet radio hasn't yet reached the universities, they 
still don't see that coaches should be judged the way math professors are 
judged: on how well they prepare their students. 
</P>
<P>
 In basketball, quiz time is game time. And at a learning institution, while 
his students are taking a test in basketball, should the coach be stomping 
around, waving his arms, yelling at his team, insulting the officials? 
</P>
<P>
 What do players learn from that? 
</P>
<P>
 Such coaching excesses result from an overemphasis on winning that could be 
curbed by converting the autocrat in charge into an educator. Presumably, 
basketball crowds aren't there to see a coach rave and bluster. They've come to 
see a game, and so at game time the coaches should be out of there. They've 
worked hard. They've earned a good seat in the stands. PLAYERS CAN LEAD 
</P>
<P>
 If a college sport is construed as an educational experience, it follows that 
student-athletes should be involved in game-day leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 They once were. 
</P>
<P>
 Football was developed in the last century by players, not coaches. And for 
many years, players remained in charge. Indeed, coaching by non-students was 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty for hiring a coach, according to an early rule committee member, 
Parke Davis, was game forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
 If today's game-day decisions were made as they once were -- by 
student-athletes instead of coaches -- superior leadership training would be 
afforded two or three basketball captains and half a dozen football captains, 
different sets every season, possibly every month or two. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot for them to do: make substitutions and adjustments, keep each 
player's head in the game, keep everyone's emotions right on, calm down the 
guys who need that, rally the team in adversity, verbalize effectively in 
crisis situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoring and maturing in all that is an educational experience that in some 
respects beats classwork. 
</P>
<P>
 And not long ago, American college students were into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, "The captains are the coaches at Oxford and other (European 
universities)," said Pat Haden, the Rhodes Scholar from USC, who, before his 
days as a downtown Los Angeles lawyer and TV analyst, studied over there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a system that works well too," said Haden, who was on Oxford's blue 
(varsity) teams in several sports. "You elect the captain-coaches. As a player, 
you respect the coach because you voted for him." 
</P>
<P>
 In America, could captains take over? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Seattle SuperSonic Coach George Karl: "The game of basketball wouldn't 
suffer a lot if the coaches were (absent) on game day. If the coach does the 
job right during the week, there isn't much he really has to do in games." 
</P>
<P>
 Karl was speaking of college coaching, but in his view, much the same holds in 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing in a (pro) game is simply recognizing early on who's hot and 
who's not," Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't every captain who can do that. But, then, it isn't every coach, 
either. PLAYERS CAN CALL PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
 Play-calling, offensive and defensive, is the other function of sports 
leadership, and there's good reason to believe that most games would be more 
entertaining if players instead of coaches made the calls -- as they did in the 
days of Sammy Baugh, Sid Luckman, John Unitas, Joe Namath, Terry Bradshaw and, 
among others, Ken Stabler and Jim Plunkett. 
</P>
<P>
 When coaches are out of the signal-calling process, what's lost in formal 
organization is more than made up by player spontaneity and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the difference: 
</P>
<P>
 * Coaches, most of them graying conservatives, call plays from a computer 
list. You see them reading their printouts every Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week they compute the best percentage play for every situation -- on 
every down -- and then at game time, rather than think about what might be 
going on out on the field, they simply check the printout and make the 
highest-percentage call. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus plays sent in by a coach, many of them picked the previous Tuesday, are 
mostly mechanical, conservative, predictable, and not responsive to sudden 
change -- which exactly describes the Raider calls that have angered Jeff 
Hostetler this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the only NFL coaching staffs excelling as signal-callers were 
those organized by Bill Walsh and Jimmy Johnson, both now out of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 * Players, most of them young and adventurous, make calls that tend to be more 
enterprising than a coach's as well as more aggressive and more responsive to 
what happened a moment ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Play-calling quarterbacks focus on the here and now, proceeding on the 
evidence of their own eyes and the input of their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Is an opponent winded or suddenly limping? 
</P>
<P>
 Is a defensive tackle charging too hard -- asking to be trapped? 
</P>
<P>
 Is there an unforeseen opportunity to do something special? 
</P>
<P>
 Players aren't buried in the ritualized history of a computer printout. They 
are caught up in the action on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 They are immersed in today's challenge, not last Tuesday's. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, their quarterback is doubtless a believer in Unitas' golden rule: 
"Take what the defense gives you." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterbacks are more inclined than any coach to pass the ball aggressively on 
first down, when defensive teams, both pro and college, nearly always play the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches -- whose concern is not to lose -- think about interceptions. 
Quarterbacks -- whose concern is not to get killed -- think about getting hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback is acutely aware that there's less chance of a body-shattering 
sack on first-down plays -- when defensive coaches worry more about runs than 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also aware -- if his coach isn't -- that most of the head-snapping sacks 
that make the highlight films are dealt on third and long. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly knows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo quarterback is the single active example of a play-calling player. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an honor he first got four years ago when, disgusted with Buffalo's 
ground-based game plans, he wrested signal-calling away from his coaching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly did this simply by keeping the Bills in their no-huddle two-minute 
offense for most of every game, throwing early and often, and disorienting 
defenses with an up-tempo attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The tempo was so fast that his coaches couldn't send in the plays -- and that 
was obviously Kelly's hidden agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Most pro coaches wouldn't have stood for any such thing. When in 1977 Namath 
tried to do it for the Rams, he was benched and never played again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buffalo's Marv Levy, the NFL's resident Phi Beta Kappa scholar, has been 
called the league's smartest coach. It is a measure of Levy that despite his 
personal conservatism as a football man, he let Kelly have his revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was an unprecedented four consecutive Super Bowl appearances by a 
team that isn't deeply talented -- as it proves year after year. Overwhelmed by 
much better talent, the Bills have lost at the Super Bowl all four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, NFL coaches are still tightening their grip on the controls, still 
calling conservative, unimaginative plays. 
</P>
<P>
 As are college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Game day still belongs to them. And that will continue if the nation's college 
presidents, NFL presidents, and NBA presidents will it. 
</P>
<P>
 But some day, with any luck, in a more perfect world, game day can be more 
democratic -- a players' day. In that era, during the days before and after 
games, coaches would be involved about as they are now. They would organize and 
supervise practices, teach techniques and leadership skills, and develop game 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in a more democratic era, coaches would have to be out recruiting 
a different kind of player -- a thinking player. Size, speed and motor skills 
are enough only in a robot world -- today's football and basketball world. 
</P>
<P>
 The new premium would be on thinking under pressure, and, soon, there would be 
livelier minds on the field and on the basketball floor. The coaches, 
meanwhile, on game day, would be somewhere else. That's one time when sports 
teams can do without coaches.

 FIRST CAME THE CIRCUS, THEN CAME THE GAME 
</P>
<P>
 They were dancing in the streets of Birmingham, Ala. And that was before the 
Crimson Tide's 21-14 victory over Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, both teams went into the annual season-ending matchup undefeated 
for the first time in 23 years. The hype was of historic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours before kickoff, mounted police unsuccessfully tried to shoo fans off 
the street in front of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium's 83,091 seats appeared full an hour before kickoff, and scalpers 
were asking $200 for a pair of 50-yard-line seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street outside the Tide and Tiger bar, dozens of people stood in a 
line that weaved through cars and empty beer cases. At the front, people paid 
$1 to use portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the players were amazed at the circus-like atmosphere that gripped the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably not as intense on the field as it is in some homes this time of 
year when there's a mixed crowd," Alabama quarterback Jay Barker said after the 
game. MAYBE THEIR HEADS JUST WEREN'T IN IT 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan's troubles began long before its game against Ohio State, a game the 
Wolverines lost, 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Michigan helmets were stolen from the visiting locker room at Ohio 
Stadium on Friday night. They belonged to tailback Tyrone Wheatley, quarterback 
Todd Collins, tight end Jay Riemersma, wide receiver Amani Toomer and backup 
quarterback Scott Dreisbach.  
</P>
<P>
 Replacements were issued, but some of the players complained that they didn't 
fit properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan equipment manager Jon Falk said an investigation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will look into who has access to the room. . . . We will also be keeping an 
eye out for five Michigan helmets," he said. SALAAM BUFFALOES WAY INTO CLUB 
2,000 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-yard run by Colorado's Rashaan Salaam, his longest of the year, put him 
past the 2,000-yard rushing mark for the season. Salaam becomes the first 
Division I-A running back to rush for more than 2,000 yards since Barry Sanders 
did it with Oklahoma State in 1988. JO JO JONES PUTS PAYTON IN HIS PLACE 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Jo Jones rushed for 311 yards and four touchdowns, breaking Walter Payton's 
all-time college touchdown record, as Lambuth (Tenn.) beat Evangel (Mo.), 
48-19, in the first round of the NAIA Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has rushed for 64 touchdowns. That tops the 63 Payton scored between 
1971 and 1974 at Jackson State. AIR McNAIR ENDS SEASON WITH ANOTHER WALK IN 
PARK 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McNair, playing in his final regular-season college game, passed for 533 
yards and five touchdowns as Alcorn State defeated Jackson State, 52-34, and 
might have wrapped up a Division I-AA playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair, the NCAA all-divisions career leader in total offense, had 564 total 
yards. It was the fifth game this season he had more than 500 yards, a Division 
I-AA record. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair, who completed 29 of 54 passes on Saturday, has 16,823 career total 
yards. He ended the regular season having completed 303 of 524 passes for 4,899 
yards with 44 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. He also had 936 yards rushing 
and nine touchdowns. MAYBE IT WASN'T HIS TURF, AFTER ALL 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas Coach Jeff Horton was ordered to apologize to a Reno 
television reporter after swearing and kicking the reporter out of practice two 
days before the UNLV-Nevada game. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton reportedly told KOLO-TV sports director Dana Wagner: "Now you're on my 
turf pal. You can take your . . . camera and you can get the . . . out of 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 His tone changed after being reprimanded by the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I apologize to members of the public and university community for my use of 
profanity," he said in a statement, explaining that the incident stemmed from a 
personal dispute with the reporter. QUOTEWORTHY

<P>
 "This chapter has ended. I don't know quite what's around the corner."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Colorado Coach Bill McCartney, who moments after the Buffaloes' 41-20 
victory over Iowa State announced he will resign after this season. AT THIS 
POINT, MAYBE THEY DON'T GIVE A HOOT 
</P>
<P>
 Only 11,873 showed in Philadelphia to watch Temple finish its season. No 
surprise. The Owls, in falling to No. 5 Miami, 38-14, lost their eighth in a 
row and their 25th consecutive Big East Conference game. They are 2-9 overall, 
0-7 in the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
 Owl no-shows did miss history in the making, though. Temple became the only 
Big East team to score two touchdowns in a game against Miami this season. FOR 
SOME, SEASON HAS BEEN TOO MUCH 
</P>
<P>
 While some Oregon fans are already clamoring for Nittany Lion blood, after the 
Ducks advanced to the Rose Bowl for the first time since the 1957 season, 
others said they will use the time between now and Jan. 2 to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ebb and flow (of this season) has been just short of a heart attack," 
said Roberto Lopez, a 20-year Oregon fan. BUT THE TEAM IS SURE TO REMAIN A HOT 
TICKET 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon wasted no time announcing plans for distributing its allotment of 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 39,000 tickets, which sell for $48 apiece, will be offered through 
five support groups, including the students. Anyone else who wants a ticket 
will have to wait until Dec. 14, when the school will announce what it will do 
with any that have not been sold by then. HAS FAUST LOST HIS ZIP? 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Faust has coached his last game for the University of Akron, according 
to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. The newspaper, without identifying sources, said 
the former Notre Dame coach is being reassigned to another position.  
</P>
<P>
 Faust's team was 0-10 and had the nation's longest Division I-A losing streak 
at 12 before the Zips defeated Ohio University, 24-10, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory probably wouldn't have a bearing on the school's decision. Ohio 
(0-11) finished the season as the only Division I-A team without a victory or a 
tie in 1994. THIS THOMAS LEAVES FEW DOUBTERS AT DUKE 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Thomas pulled off another miracle finish against No. 24 Duke, hitting 
Octavus Barnes with a 71-yard touchdown pass with 2:01 to play to lift North 
Carolina past the Blue Devils, 41-40. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, playing for the injured Jason Stanicek, came off the bench in Durham, 
N.C., two years ago to throw for 299 yards and the winning touchdown in a 31-28 
North Carolina victory over Duke. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State broke a school scoring record when Ki-Jana Carter ran for a 23-yard 
touchdown with 19 seconds to play in the first half against Northwestern. The 
Nittany Lions have scored 467 points this year, breaking the record of 454 set 
in 1971. . . . Brown rallied to beat Columbia, 59-27, in an Ivy League game. 
Brown's 59 points tied a conference record set by Princeton against the Bears 
in 1991. . . . Alex Smith of Indiana ran for 245 yards and two touchdowns, 
setting Big Ten freshman rushing records for a game and a season in the 
Hoosiers' 33-29 victory over Purdue. Smith's 1,475 yards broke the freshman 
record of 1,240 set by Minnesota's Darrell Thompson in 1986.

</P>
<P>
 The bowl picture cleared a bit Saturday, but there are still too many key 
games remaining for definitive matchups to be set. The USC-Notre Dame game and 
the Texas Tech-Texas Christian game, for instance, will have a trickle-down 
impact on a handful of bowl games. But following the no-guts, no-glory theory 
of prognosticating, here's a look at one set of possibilities with teams that 
have reportedly settled on games in bold.

AGGRESSIVE BRUIN DEFENSE HAS FIELD DAY AGAINST TROJANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Field, Arkansas defensive back in the late 1960s and longtime defensive 
coordinator under UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, had a plan to beat USC Saturday. It 
was carefully conceived, nicely honed, meticulously crafted. 
</P>
<P>
 You might call it Razorback sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 To stop USC, a recent scoring machine en route to a Rose Bowl or major bowl 
berth, Field decided to go for the Trojan jugular, slice off the USC lifeblood. 
Which, of course, is quarterback Rob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Field knew that would be easier planned than accomplished, since Johnson is 
one of those players mentioned when experts are discussing things like Heisman 
Trophies and All-American teams. A prime example of his skills took place early 
in Saturday's game, when he completed his 22nd consecutive pass over the last 
two games to establish a Pacific 10 Conference record and then completed his 
23rd to establish an NCAA record. The Pac-10 mark had been held by Cal's Rich 
Campbell and the NCAA mark by Iowa's Chuck Long and Brigham Young's Steve 
Young, some pretty lofty company for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Field was facing a player who, in the overused broadcast 
vernacular of the day, would soon be a "Sunday player." 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly, Field was no amateur at this sort of thing. He had taken a look 
at what Arizona had done -- or more specifically what it had failed to do -- in 
its 45-28 loss to USC last Saturday. The failure of the Wildcats' "Desert 
Swarm" defense to storm USC's Johnson enough, Field felt, cost them the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob Johnson is as good as there is in the college game today," Field said, 
pausing a bit before adding the crucial part, "when he is in a groove, in a 
rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona stormed Johnson with three and four defensive players and lost by 17 
points. So, Field reasoned, his Bruins would need to storm with more, sometimes 
five, six or seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was six sacks for losses totaling 43 yards; two interceptions, 
including Teddy Lawrence's game-killer in the end zone with slightly more than 
three minutes left; a fairly anemic 246 passing yards for Johnson, and a 31-19 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to take total credit for this, because other coaches and both 
the offense and defense contributed to what happened out there today," Field 
said. "But yes, it is very nice to have a plan and see it implemented out there 
so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lawrence, one of the heroes of the implementation was a 225-pound 
sophomore outside linebacker named Phillip Ward, who had three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan was good, and I just knew that records meant nothing when we go 
against SC," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior linebacker Tim Waddleton, safety Ted Nwoke and nose guard Travis 
Kirschke also got sacks for the Bruins. "I got a challenge early in the game," 
Waddleton said. "I was lined up against their big All-American (Tony) Boselli, 
and he told me there was no way I was going to get a sack over him all day. So, 
a few plays later, I went inside of him and did just that." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday, this was a Bruin defense famed only for its punter, 
All-American candidate Darren Schager. After USC's 19 points Saturday, the only 
other team to score fewer than 20 points against UCLA was the 10 by Southern 
Methodist early in the season. The Bruins had given up an average of nearly 28 
points a game going into Saturday, and that even included giving up 23 points 
to Oregon State's wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Johnson's pass settled into Lawrence's hands near the end, all that 
was forgotten. Field and the Bruin defenders had had their way with one of the 
best quarterbacks ever to play at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the 12-point victory margin was a hefty one. No close shave here. 
Not even anything to get lathered up about.

IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BRUIN OFFENSE; UCLA: SHAH RUNS FOR 135 YARDS AND 
COOK PASSES FOR 218 AS TEAM SCORES FOUR TOUCHDOWNS IN SECOND HALF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His name resounded from all over the Rose Bowl on Saturday, with his high 
school coach yelling at him from the stands and his former roommate calling to 
him from the sideline -- the wrong sideline. Sharmon Shah, known to his friends 
as "Hollywood," laughed later as he talked about USC wide receiver Keyshawn 
Johnson taunting him before plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was screaming my name -- Hollywood," Shah said, "and I wanted to tell the 
refs over there to get him." 
</P>
<P>
 It would take a lot more than that to get to Shah, who rushed for 135 yards in 
25 carries and scored the go-ahead touchdown in UCLA's 31-19 victory over USC. 
There seemingly wasn't much that could get any of the Bruins down. Even a 
demoralizing series in the second quarter when they were inside the three-yard 
line and failed to score on seven consecutive plays didn't break their spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in with a smile and I am leaving with a Kool-Aid smile," J.J Stokes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah's running, coupled with 218 yards passing by Wayne Cook and six 
receptions and a touchdown by Stokes helped give UCLA its biggest victory in a 
disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look back (at my season), definitely this game will be the highlight," 
Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Stokes and Cook, both seniors, Saturday was an opportunity to showcase for 
the pros, though Stokes doesn't need to show much to anyone. His decision to 
return to UCLA for his senior season rather than make himself available for the 
NFL draft was often criticized after he battled a nagging leg injury that 
sidelined him for most of the season. Still, he set UCLA career records for 
most touchdown catches (28), most receiving yards (2,467) and most receptions 
(154). 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned not to take anything for granted, nothing is for sure, I just have 
to go out and take advantage of every situation, and I did that by staying in 
school," Stokes said. "Unfortunately I got hurt but I have no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel great. I have no control over being injured, so I just have to 
move on." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no coincidence that since Stokes has returned to play full time -- the 
last three games -- Cook has led the Bruins to victory. Stokes is such a 
presence on the field that he distracts the defense whether Cook throws to him 
or not. Since Stokes returned to the starting lineup, the Bruins have scored 
121 points. In the eight games before, they scored 118. 
</P>
<P>
 "J.J. is just J.J.," Cook said. "He just makes teams respect his ability and 
makes everybody else play better. Here's a guy that could be out there and if 
he didn't even have a catch today it wouldn't matter. He makes everybody better 
because they have to worry about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, booed off the field during one game this season, finished his career 
strong. His 34 touchdown passes rank third on the Bruins' all-time list. 
Against USC, he completed 15 of 23 passes, two for touchdowns, and scored on a 
quarterback sneak. He had one interception.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good to have won three in a row and to show people that I wasn't done 
and that I can play," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Stokes caught a 10-yard pass from Cook in the end zone two minutes into 
the third quarter, Shah had a five-yard touchdown run through the right side of 
the line to give the Bruins a 17-12 lead. By then, he had 13 carries for 80 
yards.  
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a turnaround for the Bruins, who went into the locker room at 
halftime trailing, 12-3, and having lost Kevin Jordan, who suffered a sprained 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated but I knew how this game would go," Shah said. "I knew we 
would come back, but I didn't think we would win by a couple of touchdowns. I 
thought it would come down to one touchdown or a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to be a part of a team that went down as the first team in 
(UCLA) history that beat SC four years in a row."

TROJANS DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH HORSEPOWER; USC: WITHOUT A PASS RUSH AND LACKING 
UCLA'S EMOTION, ROBINSON'S PLAYERS CAN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT HOW THEY LOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 USC's mascot, Traveler IV, stood as a silent sentinel, just outside USC's 
locker room. His rider, Tom Nolan, the guy under the Trojan helmet that 
Stanford Coach Bill Walsh likes to call "a red industrial scrub brush," sat 
still, sword raised. 
</P>
<P>
 As USC's disappointed football players filed past, just inside a Rose Bowl 
tunnel, the white horse was as still as a statue, his head drooping slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse was almost lifeless, as was his favorite football team in the second 
half Saturday against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveler didn't show any sign of life beside the quiet, all-heads-down 
procession until someone angrily whacked the wooden entryway to the Trojan 
locker room with a helmet.  
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, when the reality that USC was about to lose a fourth 
consecutive game to UCLA was coming into focus, UCLA partisans sent up a chant 
designed to probe the Trojan wound: "Four more years! Four more years!" 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson said the predictable, congratulating first Oregon for 
its victory over Oregon State, which clinched a Rose Bowl berth for the Ducks, 
then UCLA for gaining momentum in the 64th USC-UCLA game with a third-quarter 
running game and winning, 31-19.  
</P>
<P>
 "They ran on us better than we expected they would, and that was the 
difference," he said. And he seemed to seethe slightly when asked about the 
lack of a strong pass rush on UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook, who completed 15 of 
23 passes for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked it (the pass rush) to have been better, but I'm most 
disappointed at how they ran the ball on us," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 USC quarterback Rob Johnson completed his first eight passes, giving him an 
NCAA-record 23 in a row, but then saw his pass offense fall apart in the second 
half in the face of a ferocious UCLA pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive season, a Johnson end-zone interception in effect 
brought the curtain down on a USC-UCLA game, although not nearly in the 
dramatic fashion of the 1993 game, when USC was in position to win the game.  
</P>
<P>
 This time, after a 21-point third quarter by the Bruins, the Trojans were out 
of it much sooner.  
</P>
<P>
 "We threw the ball well in the first half, but they wouldn't let us do what we 
wanted to in the second half," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just kept shooting ourselves in the foot. It didn't seem like we had the 
ball much, and when we did we didn't play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about UCLA's six sacks, Johnson shrugged.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've traditionally put a lot of pressure on me, so we expected it," he 
said. "We just couldn't stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fair to say they dominated us in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thinking much about anything now. It'll settle in tonight and 
tomorrow. It'll hurt real bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans said UCLA served up nothing they hadn't prepared for. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do anything tricky, not a thing we didn't expect," linebacker 
Erroll Small said. "They beat us with straight-up football -- powers, isos 
(isolations), dives -- and we couldn't stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 "And poor tackling didn't help us, either. They were blowing our defensive 
line off the ball. I'm a firm believer that it all starts up front, and our 
defensive line just didn't get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Matt Keneley didn't quite see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you can blame just the defensive line; the whole defense gave 
up big plays," he said. "The same plays we worked on in practice, we couldn't 
stop today."  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of big plays, Don Lindsey, Trojan defensive coordinator, could only 
shrug about one of them, a 30-yard touchdown pass from Cook to Jim McElroy with 
2:48 left in the third quarter that gave UCLA a 24-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Herpin (USC cornerback) went down the field with that guy stride for 
stride," Lindsey said. "It's not like we didn't cover him. It was a game where 
we made great defensive plays in the first half, but not in the second half.  
</P>
<P>
 "That play hurt us, because they were already running effectively on us and 
then when they started hurting us with the pass too, we had some real problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought their tight ends into their run game in the second half and they 
really went after our weak side.  
</P>
<P>
 "We missed a lot of tackles too. We couldn't make plays. We're not a high-risk 
defense -- maybe we should have been today." 
</P>
<P>
 For senior linebacker Jeff Kopp, whose USC career is encompassed by UCLA's 
four-game winning streak over the Trojans, the pain was settling in.  
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts . . . we get pretty pumped up emotionally for this game," he said. 
"It's a low, empty feeling. But we have Notre Dame next week, and I'm going to 
start thinking about that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 USC center Jeremy Hogue wondered if UCLA had more emotional fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play up to their emotional level," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We felt if we jumped on them early in the game (with touchdowns), they'd 
quit. But all we could get out of those drives were field goals. In the third 
quarter, when they started with that long drive and scored, and then we went 
three and out, it put them at a higher emotional level than where we were." 
</P>
<P>
 For senior offensive tackle Tony Boselli, a dream was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to USC to play in the Rose Bowl, and this is it," he said, softly. 
"It's disappointing."

TABASCO CAT MAKES GRASS DEBUT TODAY; HOLLYWOOD PARK: AFTER 17 STARTS ON DIRT, 
HE NOW FACES 13 RIVALS IN THE $400,000 HOLLYWOOD DERBY.

 The first time John Henry ran on grass, after winning three of 18 starts on 
dirt, he won by 14 lengths. What followed was a mostly grass career that 
produced four Eclipse Awards for turf and a grass record of 30 victories and 
$5.2 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lure struggled on dirt at the start of his career. Introduced to grass at 
Belmont Park, the same track where John Henry had made his turf debut 14 years 
before, Lure won by 10 1/4 lengths and went on to win the Breeders' Cup Mile in 
1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike John Henry and Lure, Prized was already a major winner on dirt when he 
made his first grass start -- in a $2-million race, the Breeders' Cup Turf at 
Gulfstream Park in 1989. Prized's $900,000 victory in that race accounted for 
almost half the money he earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this uncertain realm comes Tabasco Cat, who has already accomplished 
quite a bit on dirt, having won the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes, the last 
two legs of this year's Triple Crown, while earning $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat's grass debut, after 17 starts on dirt, could hardly come in a 
tougher spot: Today's $400,000 Hollywood Derby will be run only two weeks after 
his 11th race of the year, a narrow loss to Concern in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic. And he will be racing 13 rivals in a field that makes racing luck a 
prerequisite. 
</P>
<P>
 For this 1 1/8-mile test, Tabasco Cat worked a half-mile Tuesday in :48 4/5. 
The workout was at Santa Anita and on dirt -- not at the track or over the 
surface he will be competing on in the Hollywood Derby. In fact, Tabasco Cat 
has never worked on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working a horse on grass for a grass race is overrated," trainer Wayne Lukas 
said. "This horse has a nice, round foot that should be perfect for the grass." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat's sire, Storm Cat, had an abbreviated career on dirt, but Storm 
Cat's sire, Storm Bird, was a champion 2-year-old on grass in England and 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat, who will be ridden for the 14th consecutive race by Pat Day, drew 
post position No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the field, in order of post: Marvin's Faith, Yokohama, Powis Castle, 
Signe Divin, Fadeyev, Tabasco Cat, Lahint, Numerous, River Flyer, Pollock's 
Luck, Unfinished Symph, Dare And Go, Torch Rouge and Eagle Eyed. Fadeyev and 
Lahint will be coupled in the betting, with all horses carrying 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be two other grass stakes today, with seven entered in the $250,000 
Citation Handicap at 1 1/4 miles and 12 scheduled to run in the $150,000 
Hollywood Turf Express at 5 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeune Homme, winner of last year's Citation, is back from France for another 
try, carrying 117 pounds. Beneficial is the high weight at 118. Others running 
are Square Cut, Captain Rock, Wharf and the entry of Southern Wish and Shandon 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem, runner-up to Cherokee Run in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, would 
have been favored in the Turf Express, but her owners have chosen to run her in 
a $1.8-million race, the Sprinters Stakes, in Japan on Dec. 18. Cool Air, 
another filly, was second to Soviet Problem in the Laurel Dash and has drawn 
the No. 10 post today. She will carry 122 pounds, spotting her opponents four 
to nine pounds. Ocean Indien drew the rail, and the rest of the lineup consists 
of Sir Hutch, D'Hallevant, Gundaghia, Ke Express, Wild Gold, Rotsaluck, Marina 
Park, Lost Pan, Troyalty and Starolamo. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Post time for today's first race is 12:10 p.m. and the Hollywood Derby, the 
second live race on the card, is scheduled for 12:40. It will be shown on ESPN. 
. . . Exchange and Hollywood Wildcat, who were sixth and seventh, respectively, 
in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, will return to grass next Sunday in the $400,000 
Matriarch. Exchange is being supplemented into the race for $20,000. . . . Slew 
Of Damascus, unraced since his fourth-place finish in the Pacific Classic at 
Del Mar in August, is being supplemented, for $7,500, into the Hollywood Mile 
next Sunday.

TEACHING THE KING TO SWING; GOLF: ARNOLD PALMER GOT SOME FRIENDLY TIPS FROM 
PETER JACOBSEN AT THE SHARK SHOOTOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 How do you give a golf legend tips on improving his game? 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how do you tell a man who once was considered one of the world's best 
golfers that something is amiss with his swing? A golfer who is often referred 
to as "The King" in the sporting world? 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Jacobsen can offer details. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday's first round of the Shark Shootout, Jacobsen spent time on the 
driving range giving his partner, the legendary Arnold Palmer, a few words of 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo tied for last place in the 10-team event by shooting 73 in the first 
round and Jacobsen figured something had to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know his game and I told him what I saw wrong," said Jacobsen, who has won 
four PGA events and earned more than $3 million in prize money. "He's great 
about it. He has a good sense of what's up." 
</P>
<P>
 So did the advice help his partner's game a day later?  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, he hit the ball very well today," Jacobsen said. "Let's not forget he's 
65 years old and he's out there keeping up with young guys. I'm in awe of him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jacobsen-Palmer team shot a much-improved 64 on Saturday and bogeyed only 
once -- on the 186-yard, par-three 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 The team had nine birdies and is tied for seventh with Hale Irwin and Bruce 
Lietzke at 137 after two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's format was best ball, which means every golfer plays through each 
hole using his own ball, and the lowest score is recorded as the team score for 
that hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who celebrated his 40th anniversary as a pro golfer on Friday, was 
more satisfied with his second-round performance in the tournament, which 
concludes today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter was afraid I was screwing myself into the ground and he didn't want to 
lose me," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seriously, we talked about the things I've been doing that caused an adverse 
reaction in my golf. Some of the things I've been aware of for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's performance didn't seem to matter among the spectators at the 
Sherwood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 When he missed a putt on the 17th green, the crowd moaned and sighed loudly, 
as if it was actually painful for them. 
</P>
<P>
 When Palmer had a mediocre drive on the 18th, the response from the gallery 
was loud and boisterous, as if it was a spectacular shot. 
</P>
<P>
 In an elite field that incudes Greg Norman, Fred Couples and Ben Crenshaw, 
"The King" was clearly the crowd favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators called out to him as though they knew him personally. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Palmer was done, a large crowd hung out around the television booth 
where he conducted a post-match interview, waiting anxiously to attack him with 
paper and pen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine getting Arnold Palmer's autograph?" asked one young fan who 
wasn't even born when Palmer turned pro. "Man, oh man!"

STILL PINING; MOORPARK'S GULBRANSON HOLDS DEAR TIME AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gretchen Gulbranson has tried to put the tumultuous summer and early season 
blues behind her. She has made the best of her situation, but it has not been 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thing is, no matter how one looks at it, a starting setter on a Division I 
college volleyball team experiences a letdown when the following season she 
holds the same position at a junior college. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulbranson was the starting setter at Cal State Northridge last year but quit 
the team abruptly in mid-May and enrolled at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Raiders' setter, the 5-foot-6 sophomore finished the regular season 
with a Western State Conference-high 393 assists.  
</P>
<P>
 Gulbranson has led Moorpark (13-5) to the playoffs, which begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really blessed to have her," Moorpark outside hitter Tami Vaillancourt 
said. "She's a team player and she has brought us together." 
</P>
<P>
 Gulbranson, a graduate of Thousand Oaks High, is also one of the Raider's top 
blockers and most versatile players. She has brought the team stability and 
leadership, according to Moorpark Coach Steve Burkhart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting a good setter on a junior college team is the most crucial thing to 
have," Burkhart said. "We've had some experienced setters, but none this 
talented. Gretchen has made a big difference on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 While she is happy to be competing and excited about her new team's success, 
Gulbranson often reminisces about playing with the Matadors. Looking back, she 
says, her decision to quit the team at CSUN might have been a hasty one made 
during an emotional time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I think about it the more I regret it," she said. "It was hard to 
leave. I really didn't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Gulbranson received a scholarship to play at CSUN. As a senior at Thousand 
Oaks in 1992 she had a school-record 819 assists and led the Lancers to a 
Marmonte League championship and the second round of the Southern Section 
Division II playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 Gulbranson also had 187 service points and 130 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 She had 947 assists last season as a freshman for the Matadors, who finished 
with a 12-17 record under interim Coach John Price. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team got a new coach and a new senior setter, Kathleen Shannon, a 
transfer from Illinois. After about one month of drills and scrimmages, Shannon 
was named the starter and Gulbranson the backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulbranson quit the team and hasn't talked about it publicly until now. She 
wants to make clear that she didn't leave the program because she lost her 
starting position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sat on the bench before," Gulbranson said. "If she's the better setter 
and she's going to do the best, then I want her to start. That wasn't the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like I got the chance to compete against Kathleen. I feel like 
he (new CSUN Coach Lian Kang Lu) had his mind made up. He already had the 
starting lineup in his head. I just don't like the way it was handled." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, who was hired in December, 1993, said Shannon simply beat Gulbranson for 
the starting position. Both, he says, had plenty of opportunities to showcase 
their talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both fought hard for the starting position," Lu said. "But Kathleen earned 
it. In the beginning there was a 50-50 chance, but Kathleen turned out to be a 
better setter." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu tried to talk Gulbranson into staying, however. He considers her a solid 
player and a great asset to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Gretchen, 'Don't leave. You will not sit on the bench. You will play a 
lot,' " Lu said. "I feel so sorry she left. I really like her. She works really 
hard and I was very upset that she left." 
</P>
<P>
 So is Gulbranson, though she claims to be happy at Moorpark. She often attends 
CSUN volleyball matches and remains friends with many of her former teammates 
there. "I guess I still consider CSUN my team," Gulbranson said. "Those players 
are my good friends. I still think about playing there, but we're doing really 
good here and I'm happy with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Before enrolling at Moorpark Gulbranson and her father took a trip to San Jose 
State, where she was offered a scholarship under the condition that CSUN 
release her. She didn't like it, however, and chose to remain close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Gulbranson is trying to focus on leading her team through the playoffs. 
She knows performance is crucial in postseason because in junior college 
volleyball that's the only time scouts from four-year schools come out to 
recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll play wherever they need a setter next year," Gulbranson said. "I really 
just want to play my eligibility out . . . anywhere!"

BOYS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995 / GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE; OPPONENTS HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF 
THIS SHOOTER; BASKETBALL: LA QUINTA'S GREENFIELD AVERAGED 15 POINTS AND SHOT 
50% LAST SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After being beaten down and pushed around for three years by bigger players 
and better teams, La Quinta guard Greg Greenfield was beginning to wonder if 
his senior year would ever come. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos Coach Eric Hamamoto said he and some other Garden Grove League 
coaches were wondering the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make sure he's at the graduation this year," Hamamoto joked. 
"We'll hand him his diploma if that's what it takes. He's tough. We've seen 
enough of him." 
</P>
<P>
 By the middle of Greenfield's freshman year, Garden Grove League coaches had 
seen enough of his smooth left-handed release to know he could shoot a little 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such an outstanding shooter," La Quinta Coach Jim Perry said. "As teams 
started realizing his ability, he was forced to become a scorer instead of 
simply a shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hamamoto: "I don't think there's a spot on the court he can't shoot the 
ball from." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenfield, who averaged 15 points and shot 50% from the field last year, said 
he developed his shooter's reputation even before he entered high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My NJB (National Junior Basketball) coach told me in seventh grade that I had 
the best shot he had ever seen," Greenfield said. "Then teams started to 
double-team me as a freshman. I knew over the years, it was just going to get 
worse. So I figured I had to get stronger and more physical if I was going to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 And Greenfield acknowledges he might not have survived without the help of La 
Quinta assistant coach Kevin Loftus. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first two years were tough," he said. "Coach Loftus beat me down mentally, 
but he did it just to make me better. I thank him for that. Without him, I 
wouldn't be the player I am today." 
</P>
<P>
 And without his father, he might not be a player at all. Jim Greenfield, the 
men's basketball coach at Golden West College the last 16 years, was Greg's 
first basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me something to build on," Greenfield said of his father. "He forced 
me to learn fundamentals at an early age." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Greenfield will finally get to see those fundamentals at work this season. 
After seeing only two La Quinta games last year, Jim has taken the year off at 
Golden West to watch his son play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be great," Greg said. "Every night after a game, I'll be able to ask 
him what I did wrong. But the thing is, I'll only get it if I ask for it. If I 
didn't ask, he wouldn't say a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 If Garden Grove League coaches are right, La Quinta's games should be 
exciting. With four starters returning from last year's 15-10 team, La Quinta 
is being picked to win the Garden Grove League, which has been dominated by 
Kennedy and Pacifica the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenfield isn't making any predictions, but he's happy with his team and 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually thought my junior year would be our best team, but this year it 
seems like things might finally work out for us," said Greenfield, who at 6 
feet, 180 pounds is 20 pounds heavier than he was as a freshman. "I'm glad I'll 
get a solid year in before I graduate."

BASEBALL LABOR; PLAYERS WILL STUDY PAYROLL TAX PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball's bargaining talks recessed for a week Saturday to give the players' 
union additional time to study the owners' payroll-tax proposal, but the 
severity of the formula continued to cast doubt on the possibility of a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing but a backdoor salary cap," player agent Tom Reich said."It's 
more oppressive even than the original proposal and is obviously set up for 
implementation purposes, not negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Harrington, chief executive officer of the Boston Red Sox and the 
owners' lead negotiator: "We're not hiding the fact that we're trying to 
inhibit growth, large growth, in players' salaries. But this doesn't stop 
player signings. I mean, a club still might do it in a particular year if it 
thought it was close enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations are expected to resume in Washington on Nov. 28 or 29. The owners 
have said they plan to implement their salary-cap proposal in early to 
mid-December. Union leader Donald Fehr said he couldn't predict whether the 
union would make a counterproposal when the talks resume. ROSS NEWHAN

THE BOND MARKET MONSTER; SOME DEMONIZE IT, BUT IT'S A CREATURE OF OUR OWN 
MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 "I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the 
President, the Pope, or a .400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as 
the bond market. You can intimidate everybody." -- Presidential adviser James 
C. Carville, quoted in the book "The Agenda" by Bob Woodward  
</P>
<P>
 As the governors of the Federal Reserve Board voted their sixth official 
interest rate increase of 1994 last Tuesday, picketers from organized labor and 
consumer groups marched in front of the central bank's fortress-like Washington 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs, Not Rate Hikes," one placard read. "Greenspan, Have You Ever Been Out 
of Work?" asked another. 
</P>
<P>
 But even within the ranks of Americans who oppose the Fed's policy of raising 
interest rates to slow the economy, many believe the protesters' anger is 
misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't blame the Fed, they say. Blame the bond market -- that faceless manic 
multitrillion-dollar monster that swoons at the mere thought of a healthy 
economy that could bring an uptick in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monetary policy in this country is controlled by bond traders who live in 
high-rises and are completely out of touch with reality," argues Jerry 
Jasinowski, head of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, whose members don't 
want to see growth in a chokehold. 
</P>
<P>
 By Jasinowski's reckoning -- and that of more than a few other Fed critics -- 
the central bank has felt compelled to punish the economy with ever-higher 
short-term interest rates this year mostly to appease a seemingly select group 
of investors who own bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond owners, the logic goes, can't stand the idea of meaningful economic 
growth because they're terrified of the possibility of higher inflation, which 
would erode the value of money they've locked up in long-term bonds at fixed 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as Jasinowski and others point out, the economy has advanced this year 
without higher inflation. With 1994 almost over, consumer prices are rising at 
a lower rate even than in 1993 -- an annualized 2.6% through October, versus 
2.7% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many experts argue that with bitterly intense competition in the 
global economy and labor in excess supply worldwide, inflation simply won't be 
a problem in the '90s. Someone will always do things cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market, however, is not impressed. Whereas the Fed controls 
short-term rates, bond investors determine longer-term rates, which are 
considered much more important to the economy's health. And all year long the 
bond market has pushed long-term yields ever higher. The investors' message to 
the Fed, according to those who would demonize the bond market: "Inflation is 
coming! Inflation is coming! Keep tightening credit and stop the economy!" 
</P>
<P>
 Investors today are demanding an annualized yield of 8.12% to take the risk of 
owning a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond, a benchmark for long-term rates. Just a 
year ago, 30-year T-bonds were sold at a yield of 5.8%, the lowest in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in bond yields to three-year highs has blasted other long-term 
interest rates worldwide higher as well this year, boosting the cost of 
mortgages and car loans and the price at which many businesses and governments 
borrow. Indirectly, the stock market has been affected as well, with bond 
traders' counter-intuitive thinking -- that good economic news is a bad omen -- 
now holding sway on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But whereas the bond market's critics paint it as a towering, malicious 
monster, some analysts see an entity more akin to a pitiful, helpless giant -- 
the uncontrollable creation of a decades-long binge of government, corporate 
and consumer borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is powerful, dangerous and often irrational, but "this is not some private 
club," says James Bianco, a bond historian at Arbor Trading Group in 
Barrington, Ill. "Think of who the bond market is," he says. "It's pension 
funds, 401 (k) (retirement) accounts, mutual funds, governments, corporations, 
individuals. When you add it all up, we're all bond holders."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, higher long-term interest rates appear to have had only a minimal 
effect so far on the broad economy, which continues to expand and create jobs. 
But the damage to bond holders themselves has been devastating: Every increase 
in current bond yields devalues older bonds issued in recent years at lower 
yields. 
</P>
<P>
 By Bianco's calculations, interest rates have risen so rapidly over the past 
12 months that bond holders have experienced the most severe devaluation of 
their securities in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest number of victims of higher bond yields have been in the bond 
market itself," agrees Bruce Steinberg, economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The image of the bond market as a bogyman is a relatively new one. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States and abroad, bond markets for most of the 20th Century 
were the staid province of high-quality borrowers, such as sovereign states and 
major corporations, and highly conservative investor/creditors, such as bank 
trust departments. 
</P>
<P>
 With the number of players on both sides relatively limited -- as was their 
ability to trade and track bonds and judge the true extent of inflation -- the 
movement of long-term interest rates occurred at a snail's pace for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Homer and Richard Sylla, in their book "A History of Interest Rates," 
show that yields on high-quality corporate bonds took 20 years (1900 to 1920) 
to rise from 3.5% to 5% and another 20 years (1920 to 1940) to decline from 5% 
to 2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as the early 1970s, the bond market was a sleepy place essentially 
run by arch-conservative Eastern investment bankers and their equally 
conservative bank and life insurance company clients. 
</P>
<P>
 William Gross, the 50-year-old managing director of Newport Beach-based 
Pacific Investment Management Co.'s $55-billion bond portfolio, recalls his 
first job out of college in 1971 at Pacific Mutual Life in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to go into the vault and clip the coupons on the bonds stored there," 
Gross says. Coupons were interest tickets attached to bonds; they had to be 
detached and mailed to the bond issuer twice a year to receive interest owed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those bonds weren't traded," Gross says. "They just sat there -- for five, 
10, 15 years or more." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many other aspects of American life, the bond market began to change 
radically in the mid-1970s, with the Arab oil embargo and soaring energy 
prices. The generally slow upward creep of inflation and interest rates began 
to accelerate. Bond owners, often left behind the curve by accepting yields 
that inflation quickly eroded, began to assert their power as creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the use of debt began to accelerate as America aged and grew 
more affluent, the size of federal and local governments ballooned and 
corporations changed their attitude about borrowing. At the same time, the 
appetite for bonds surged on the part of institutional investors, who were 
flush with pension dollars set aside for future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1981, with the annual inflation rate running at 13%, bond investors were 
demanding the highest interest rates in U.S. history -- yields of more than 14% 
on long-term Treasury bonds, up from 8% just two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the Federal Reserve, under then-Chairman Paul Volcker, 
committed itself to breaking the inflation cycle by inducing a severe recession 
with short-term interest rates in excess of 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 What's worth noting is that the bond market wasn't blamed for that 
then-unprecedented rate surge. Inflation was real, and the image of the bond 
investor was that of victim, not perpetrator. 
</P>
<P>
 What is so different today, a mere 13 years later, that makes the bond market 
so hated and feared? 
</P>
<P>
 If bigness alone makes something intimidating, the bond market is that in 
spades. The debt expansion that began in the 1970s has increased exponentially 
since 1980: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. government-related debt has exploded from $1 trillion outstanding in 
1980 to $5.3 trillion now, the result of years of record federal budget 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outstanding U.S. corporate and foreign bonds have more than quadrupled since 
1980, from $508 billion to $2.2 trillion, and municipal bonds issued now total 
almost $1.3 trillion, up from $365 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * All told, the value of bond debt has reached $8.8 trillion, up 370% from 
1980. To put that in perspective, consider that the Wilshire market value index 
of 5,000 U.S. stocks is up only 194% in the same period, to about $4.6 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do investors own more fixed-rate bond assets than ever before, but 
technology allows them to buy and sell bonds in the blink of an eye, assuring 
that yields can react instantly to investors' perceptions of what is a "fair" 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 But as mammoth as it is, the bond market from 1981 through 1993 did not use 
its power to extort ever-rising yields from the world's myriad borrowers. On 
the contrary, what has been forgotten in the angry rhetoric about interest 
rates this year is that bond yields have mostly been in decline for the past 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 And contrary to what the market's detractors allege, many big bond investors 
say fear of higher inflation in a healthy economy isn't the overriding issue 
driving bond yields this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they see in rates' sudden turnaround the violent backlash to a sea 
change in the global economy -- a backlash worsened by bond investors' own 
gluttony in recent years. Investors had willingly snapped up bonds at 
ever-lower yields, often with funds borrowed at even lower short-term rates. 
They assumed that economic growth would remain anemic -- and, more important, 
that the Federal Reserve would continue to keep short-term interest rates low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many investors believed the U.S. and other major economies were locked in 
a quiet depression," said John Lonski, economist at Moody's Investors Service 
in New York. "That assumption proved to be disastrously wrong for bond 
holders." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the world economy clearly on the upswing again, bond investors have 
many new considerations in determining a logical "price" for money, said 
Pacific Investment Management's Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, he notes, as long as demand for credit is rising, its cost 
can go up -- hardly a new concept. And with the global economy now almost 
entirely capitalist -- for the first time since 1917 -- and recessions in 
Europe and Japan ending, bond investors have begun to weigh the possibility of 
a "capital shortage" in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with low inflation worldwide, Gross said, the price of credit would 
conceivably have to rise if there were greater global demand for money than 
investors had ever witnessed.  
</P>
<P>
 Something else also is at work in molding bond market psychology today: the 
simple desire to get out of the way of bonds' reversal of fortune and to take 
advantage of higher yields on much safer short-term bank CDs and money market 
accounts, courtesy of the Fed's tighter-credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the sudden lack of demand for bonds, as market yields have risen and 
investors' holdings have tumbled in value, has been as significant a force in 
the market as actual selling. 
</P>
<P>
 As have much smaller investors, Gross and his staff of 14 portfolio managers 
have become both cause and effect in the 1994 bond bear market. They have 
helped cause it by becoming increasingly leery of aggressively investing their 
clients' fresh cash in longer-term bonds as yields have continued to rise. That 
has forced bond issuers -- such as Uncle Sam -- to offer higher yields to 
attract buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, PIMCO has suffered the effects of rising yields, as its 
giant portfolio of older government, corporate and other bonds has been 
devalued. "I've lost $5 billion (on paper) as bond prices have gone down this 
year," Gross said, not disguising the pain that loss has caused him 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 With long-term Treasury bond yields now over 8%, the "real," after-inflation 
yield to investors is more than 5% -- an extremely attractive return, if not a 
record high, Gross contends. 
</P>
<P>
 But the momentum of markets -- bull or bear -- has a life of its own, he said. 
After nine months of extraordinary losses, "investors look at this market and 
say, 'I'm not going to invest in it because it only goes down.' " Burned badly, 
the same investors who gorged on bonds in 1993 now shun them. 
</P>
<P>
 That may make the bond market an angry, vengeful monster to some. And 
unquestionably, this monster's actions have consequences for the economy -- on 
the upside and on the downside. 
</P>
<P>
 Worth remembering, though, is that this is a Frankenstein of our own creation 
-- as creditors, as investors, and not least as the most profligate of 
borrowers. What's Fair for Bond Holders? 
</P>
<P>
 What are long-term interest rates supposed to be? 
</P>
<P>
 That question is key in judging whether bond investors have pushed yields up 
exorbitantly this year, as some economists contend. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, bond yields should guarantee investors a fair return above the rate 
of inflation, thereby rewarding them for taking the risk of locking up their 
funds for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is "fair" for a bond holder? Since 1913, yields on long-term 
government bonds (that is, 20- to 30-year issues) have averaged 3 percentage 
points above the inflation rate, according to James Bianco at Arbor Trading 
Group in Barrington, Ill.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if inflation was 1%, bond yields averaged 4%. If inflation was 
7%, bond yields averaged 10%. The after-inflation yield is called the "real" 
yield. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the 1945-to-1981 era, however, inflation accelerated faster than 
interest rates. The result was that bond investors' real returns were 
continually eroded by inflation. In fact, bonds are said to have been in a bear 
market for most of that 36-year period, meaning bond investors generally lost 
money after inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly for that reason, skittish investors have been much warier about 
accepting lower real yields on bonds in recent years, even as inflation has 
declined since 1981. The fear is ever-present that inflation could resurge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Bianco notes that with 30-year Treasury bonds yielding 8.12% 
currently and inflation around 3%, the real yield of 5% or so matches the 
average real return since 1981 -- so investors really aren't demanding much 
more than they were getting in the '80s. The Mechanics of a Bond 
</P>
<P>
 * Why is it that bond owners lose money as market interest rates rise? 
</P>
<P>
 Think of a seesaw, with a bond's price on one end and its yield on the other. 
The two ends always move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the example of a U.S. Treasury 30-year bond issued in 1993. An investor 
who bought it new paid $1,000 for a security that will pay 6.25% interest, or 
$62.50, annually for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That may have seemed like a decent enough return at the time. But since then, 
market interest rates have zoomed. Today, investors are demanding a yield of 
8.1% on new 30-year T-bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the older T-bond still are earning 6.25%, and if they hold the bond 
to maturity they'll get their full $1,000 back, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they try to sell the bond now, buyers naturally will demand that the 
yield match the market. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish that, the bond's price is marked down. Instead of $1,000, the 
market price of the bond today is about $793, a 21% decline from what the 
original investors paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide annual interest earnings of $62.50 by $793 and you get a "current" 
yield of about 7.9% for a new buyer. And by factoring in the added return 
expected by reinvesting the bond's annual interest earnings, the true yield -- 
called "yield to maturity" -- works out to about 8.1%, thereby matching the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if market yields begin to decline again? As the seesaw analogy 
implies, the bond's price will rise accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $1,000 Yield: 6.25% 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $782 Yield: 8.1% An Explosion of Debt 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's power to drive Wall Street, mold federal policy and shape

</P>
<P>
 Bond yields have jumped this year as the Federal Reserve Board has tightened 
credit adn the economy has surged, fueling inflation worries. While yields are 
still far below historical peaks, the magnitude of the rise in rates over the 
past year has been more dramatic than at any time sine the 1920s.

<P>
 Because a bond pays a fixed yield, rising yields on newly issued bonds 
automatically devalue older bonds, pushing their prices down. Over the past 
year, prices have fallen so far that bondholders' total return -- interest 
payments less price decline -- has been negative. 
</P>

JAMES FLANIGAN: KERKORIAN-CHRYSLER SITUATION COULD BE A WIN-WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an echo of the 1980s, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian is threatening Chrysler 
with legal action unless it gives shareholders a higher dividend or buys back 
its own stock to boost the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian, who owns 32 million shares -- or 9% -- of Chrysler stock, won 
support last week from some institutional investors who said the auto company 
should do more for stockholders now that it has strengthened its balance sheet 
and has roughly $7 billion in spare cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are the sober and stingy '90s, not the fast-money '80s, so there are 
no investment bankers hovering around Chrysler's Highland Park, Mich., 
headquarters preparing for a hostile buyout battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler management hasn't responded publicly to Kerkorian, who is a friend of 
the company's retired chairman, Lee Iacocca. But the company's current 
chairman, Robert Eaton, has always said he wanted to build cash, as much as $10 
billion, as a bulwark against the next economic downturn -- an understandable 
policy, since Chrysler almost went under in the 1991-'92 recession. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fascinating dispute, raising questions everybody wonders about: Do 
small shareholders really benefit along with the big boys in these affairs? 
Would paying out half its cash hoard to shareholders be the wisest course for 
Chrysler's long-term future? And -- a throwback to the '80s -- what does all 
this stock market stuff have to do with creating jobs and strengthening a U.S. 
company for competition in world markets? 
</P>
<P>
 The market's reaction thus far provides no clues. Chrysler stock rose and fell 
in recent days -- ending the week at $49 a share -- as much because of the 
Federal Reserve's rise in interest rates as speculation about Kerkorian's true 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But small shareholders in Chrysler could be sitting pretty no matter how 
management answers Kerkorian, because the outlook for sales of Chrysler's cars, 
Jeeps and minivans is stronger for the next couple of years than its current 
stock price suggests. The company this year will earn more than $3 billion on 
more than $48 billion in sales, and it expects a banner 1995, despite rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian only adds sugar to the mix. The company has raised its dividend 66% 
to $1 a share in the past year, but may boost it again with prodding from 
Kerkorian and other large shareholders. Or Chrysler could buy back stock, which 
tends to boost the price of the remaining outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, might cost $2 billion to $4 billion. And although the company 
can afford it as long as the good years continue -- annual cash flow (income 
plus depreciation) now approaches $5 billion -- it does face some heavy 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chrysler has to revitalize its manufacturing plants," says David Cole, head 
of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has achieved great efficiency, Cole acknowledges, "but machinery 
gets old and needs to be renewed. And that takes money." Indeed, aging 
manufacturing systems could explain one of Chrysler's continuing problems: Its 
vehicles, though stylish and popular, score low on quality, according to J.D. 
Power & Associates, the research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, extra money could help Chrysler make a bid for a presence in 
China and India, the two massive auto markets that have world business 
transfixed. 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem odd to talk of a cash-rich Chrysler. This is the company that was 
saved by U.S. taxpayers in 1981 and by fresh capital from private investors, 
including Kerkorian, in 1990 and 1991. But Chrysler has come back to prosperity 
through fierce cost discipline, flamboyant styling and a historic change in the 
U.S. car business. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto manufacturers used to expand plants as sales rose, only to suffer losses 
as demand subsided; the business was all up and down cycles. Now, Chrysler 
refrains from adding new plants but shifts around production of its specialty 
vehicles to meet changing tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 And it can't meet demand for its sport utility vehicles -- glorified Jeeps 
such as the Grand Cherokee models, which sell for as much as $30,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Chrysler is the most efficient car producer in the United States -- 
second in the world only to Toyota, says Doug Kevorkian, an independent auto 
analyst in Ann Arbor, Mich. One reason is that the company gets 70% of its 
parts from outside suppliers, with which it works closely. That creates jobs at 
auto suppliers. And efficiency and growth create jobs at Chrysler, which has 
expanded employment 28% to 128,000 since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, shareholders are restless. There is muttering among big holders about 
Chrysler's top officers -- Eaton, President Robert Lutz, engineering boss 
Francois Castaing and others -- turning a good profit selling optioned stock 
last December and January, before the stock market broke and Chrysler stock 
fell 20% to current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some investors are simply whiners," snorts Tony Kreisel, manager of Putnam 
Growth and Income Fund, which invests in Chrysler. Kreisel's point and that of 
others is that Eaton, Lutz and the other managers pushed creation of the 
stylish vehicles that brought Chrysler success and took its stock from $11 a 
share in early 1992 to $63 in early '94. "This is an entrepreneurial car 
company; why shouldn't they benefit?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Kerkorian, 76, a legendary trader who has just rebuilt Las 
Vegas' MGM Grand, is no '80s-style raider. He invested in Chrysler in 1990 at 
the behest of Iaccoca, who saw the company heading into terrible times. "His 
investment helped save the company," says one analyst. "If he wants to ask for 
a higher payout, he's got a right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot: Chrysler's management will do something to accommodate Kerkorian 
and other large investors among its 202,500 shareholders. But because this is 
the '90s, it won't have to boost payouts foolishly as companies had to do in 
buyout battles of the '80s. Resources can be used to expand the business, for 
the benefit of employees and customers and Chrysler's 92,000 retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 How are the '90s different? We've learned a lot. We see how investors and 
markets are connected to assembly lines and paychecks -- and that success 
results from combined effort.

BUSINESS PULSE / JOHN BRENNAN; VOTERS DON'T BUY EXPERT WISDOM THAT ECONOMY'S 
PERKING ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BRENNAN, JOHN BRENNAN is director of the Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Political pundits look for revolution in each election. Searching through the 
rubble voters leave behind, they desperately seek the harbingers of a future 
that cannot be seen. One election cannot predict the next. 
</P>
<P>
 With that disclaimer given, this reporter will now proceed to add his 
examination of the entrails to the pile. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see this election as a permanent sharp rightward swerve on the public's 
part. But what happened is more complex. Unlike their counterparts in Europe 
and Canada, Americans stay pretty centrist when it comes to economic and social 
policies. Except when pocketbooks really hurt, as in 1992, a host of things 
affect elections, and a relatively small swing of feelings can produce a 
riptide of change. That's why Minnesota, quizzically, puts a right-winger like 
Rod Grams in the Senate alongside a liberal like Paul Wellstone. And 
Californians reelect Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein in the same stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, there is no philosophical consensus in this country about what 
government's role should be. Americans are of two minds on the subject. Even 
during the Ronald Reagan years, they never lost faith in the basic New Deal 
credo that Washington should intervene to help people. The public rejected the 
trickle-down economics that President Reagan espoused, liking him in spite of, 
not because of, those utterances. And even the most conservative Californian 
becomes a fan of federal spending on the morning after an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 This October, as the Republican blowout was brewing, 61% still told The Times 
Poll that spending for domestic programs should be increased . Most, including 
GOP-leaning voters, had never heard of the now-legendary Republican Contract 
with America. When told it was a mix of tax cuts, more defense spending and a 
balanced budget amendment, a majority called it "unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, did the Republicans win? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if voters still think government should help people, they also feel it's 
doing a lousy job in that regard. The public thinks Washington wastes tax money 
and gives it to all the wrong people -- welfare cheats, illegal immigrants and 
convicts watching color TV in prison. These sentiments also wax and wane, but 
when they get strong, things tilt the GOP's way. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a swing against activist government occurred this year. In 1992, 49% of 
voters in the TV network exit poll said the government should generally be 
doing more to help people; 41% felt it was doing too much. This year, the 
proportion calling government's influence excessive climbed to 56%, while the 
share wanting it to see it do more dropped to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons people are angry at Washington is clear: They are terribly 
disappointed with President Clinton. He entered this midterm battle with the 
lowest job ratings of any recent President, below even Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many reasons for Clinton's unpopularity -- misgivings about his 
character and ideology in particular. But scandals and gays in the military are 
not Clinton's top problems. He is dogged by what has plagued troubled 
Presidents since Martin Van Buren: a bad economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters simply don't buy the experts' wisdom that the economy is perking along. 
In 1992, 79% told exit pollsters it was in bad shape, and 62% of them voted 
Democratic for Congress. This year, 57% still felt the economy was in the 
outhouse. Once again, those voters turned on the party in power, casting the 
same 62% for the GOP outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The message of an economic rebound is just not getting through. Some 43% of 
voters said they're working harder and earning less these days, and 
three-quarters said their personal finances are no better than two years ago. 
Prominent among these malcontents are Ross Perot backers -- largely blue-collar 
men who took out their wrath on George Bush in 1992. No happier now, they 
transferred their anger to Clinton this year. But they have no particular 
affection for either party and are driven by sheer disappointment more than 
anything specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Those feelings pose a mighty challenge to whoever is in power. Americans don't 
only want government off their backs, they want it to work better and to make 
them feel better about their own lives. Surprisingly, despite the 
anti-government mood, voters still tell pollsters they want Congress to act on 
health care reform -- yes, health care reform . Not the Clintonian 
mega-program, perhaps, but something. 
</P>
<P>
 So Speaker of the House-to-be Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority 
Leader-in-waiting Bob Dole beware. It will take more than a balanced budget 
amendment to hold these people in your tent.

AFTER A SUCCESSFUL STINT AT DISNEY STORES, PAUL PRESSLER IS BECOMING ...; THE 
NEW MAYOR OF DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The longer Paul Pressler stared at the rendering for a toy Simba (lion cub 
heroof the Disney movie "The Lion King"), the more he realized something wasn't 
quite right. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eyes. They lacked the empathetic spark Pressler wanted. So he had 
them changed. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Disney executive began fiddling with the look of a new Disney 
Store, he went again for the heartstrings, designing displays to evoke great 
moments from "Snow White," "Fantasia" and the studio's other animated classics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our characters are so emotional," said Pressler, the former chief of Disney 
Stores who was named president of Disneyland earlier this month. "They exude 
emotion. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That understanding has built Pressler's reputation within Walt Disney Co. as a 
walking idea machine with an intuitive sense of what makes Disney characters 
and stories sell. Now, however, the 38-year-old executive is taking on one of 
the company's toughest challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland, about to enter its 40th year, had been searching for a 
high-profile manager to reinvigorate Walt Disney's creations and cope with 
lower attendance, friction over cost-cutting changes and deterioration of the 
surrounding neighborhood. Moreover, after tantalizing the local community with 
images of a $3-billion theme park and hotel expansion, Disneyland now is 
scrambling to downsize its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge job," said former Anaheim Councilwoman Miriam Kaywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler, a former toy industry executive, not only will lead Orange County's 
largest private employer (about 12,000 people work at the park in the peak 
summer months), he will also have to contend with its unions when a major labor 
contract comes up for renewal next September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be as rough as they make it," said Angela Keefe, president of 
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 681. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler must also wrestle with the political pressures surrounding Disney's 
expansion plan, which would add a theme park and potentially thousands of hotel 
rooms to Disneyland's already dense environs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I equate it to running a city," said Dennis Speigel, a theme park consultant 
in Cincinnati, Ohio. "The guy who takes on the running of a major theme park 
really becomes the mayor of the property." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler is starting as an unknown within the close-knit world of Disneyland. 
His task is made all the more difficult by the inevitable comparisons to the 
man he is succeeding -- the enormously popular Jack Lindquist, who started at 
Disneyland the year it opened and remains a fixture of political, sports and 
charity circles in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So who is the new mayor of the Magic Kingdom?  
</P>
<P>
 The portrait that emerges from interviews with friends and colleagues is of a 
self-effacing, energetic Disney devotee known for an uncommon blend of business 
acumen and artistic inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler is a "talented, creative business executive . . . (who) nurtures 
great ideas and knows how to see them through," Disney Chairman Michael Eisner 
said in appointing Pressler to his new position. Pressler is capable in the 
roles Eisner holds dearest: diplomat, numbers-cruncher and carnival barker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have a unique talent for drawing the best out of people and 
inspiring them to bigger and better things," Pressler said. "Somehow I just see 
things, and I get sparked by new ideas and take off on new tangents. I never 
accept anything for the way it works." 
</P>
<P>
 And Lindquist predicted: "He'll make everybody forget me." 
</P>
<P>
 Known for an easygoing manner, Pressler prefers staying home on Friday night 
with his wife and children and a stack of videotaped movies to working the 
social circuit. "If you had to rank his priorities, No. 1 would be his family 
and No. 2 would be his business," said friend and colleague Steve Burke, chief 
operating officer of Euro Disney in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler is "a guy who really keeps his ego in check," observed veteran toy 
company executive Bruce Stein, who is now developing interactive entertainment 
possibilities with Hollywood mogul Peter Guber. 
</P>
<P>
 A Long Island native, Pressler attended the State University of New York at 
Oneonta, a small campus outside of Albany, as an economics major. His first job 
out of college was as an urban planner in New York City.  
</P>
<P>
 After six months, Pressler said, he was ready to try something else. Choosing 
among jobs offered by a search firm, he went to work for Remco Toys, a small 
manufacturer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 His big break in the toy industry came in 1982, when he was interviewed at 
Kenner-Parker Toys, then a subsidiary of General Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just incredible!" said Carole MacGillvray Rappeport, who now operates 
a toy consulting company in Santa Barbara. "He not only had some toy 
experience, he was just so personable." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler was hired on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kenner-Parker, where he was vice president of marketing, Pressler exploited 
the licensing possibilities of the Care Bears, a hit teddy bear collection tied 
to a line of greeting cards. He became executive producer of the "The Care 
Bears Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Pressler's unit was dissolved when the company decided its efforts 
duplicated those of the major divisions, Kenner toys and Parker Bros. Pressler 
received several interesting offers, including ones from Mattel Inc. and Walt 
Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Rappeport said she urged Pressler to take the Disney job, suspecting that "a 
whole new world would open up" for her star manager. He joined Disney in 1987 
to oversee product licensing.  
</P>
<P>
 Pressler first distinguished himself at Disney by helping to craft a deal with 
Mattel to design and sell toys for preschoolers featuring Disney characters and 
themes. The new product lines competed well with strong brands such as Fisher 
Price and Playskool. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal caught the eye of Barton K. (Bo) Boyd, president of the consumer 
products division, and he tapped Pressler to run the Disney Store chain, which 
today has 335 locations in eight countries. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pressler, Boyd said, who realized how designers and engineers could be 
brought together with merchandising and construction employees to redesign the 
prototype Disney Store at the Del Amo mall in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler explains that he "wanted to make it more entertaining by utilizing 
more storytelling and segmenting the merchandise by age. We took the Disneyland 
concept of 'separate lands' and applied it creatively" to break the store into 
separate sections for adults, children, collectors and gift buyers, with each 
section centered on a different Disney movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler said the new merchandising design, unveiled a couple of months ago, 
has already proved to be a winner and will be adopted by other stores in the 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler lives in Pacific Palisades with his wife, Mindy, 8-year-old son, 
Sean, and 4-year-old daughter, Jordan. He and television personality Bob Saget, 
who lives nearby, have become friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very good neighbor karma," said Saget, whose 5-year-old daughter is 
Jordan Pressler's best pal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Presslers have been considering a move to Orange County, and Saget says 
the two men are such good friends that the thought of Pressler moving away to 
be closer to his new job is a traumatic one. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler cares for others but is devoted to his job, Saget said, noting: "He 
is a full company man. Whatever haircut you have to have, he has it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had never visited Disneyland before he joined the parent company 
eight years ago, Pressler says "complementary skills" will see him through the 
transition period as he gradually assumes his duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I manage by walking around," and will be "pumping up people with great 
ideas," he explained. He is passionate about courtesy and being helpful to 
customers -- qualities he has drilled into the 6,000 employees of Disney 
Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he doesn't know much about the mechanics of theme park operations, he 
says he can lean on his management team until he learns. "If I had to do it 
alone it would be very scary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be alone, and he already has plenty of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question, they need a strong marketing man down there," said Boyd, himself 
a Disney theme park veteran. "They have got an incredible talent for that 
position."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: CAPITAL LOSSES COULD BE BONUS FOR SOME PORTFOLIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mutual-fund shareholders should never let tax considerations dominate their 
investment decisions. That's like letting the tail wag the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 But for people considering bond funds at today's depressed prices, the capital 
losses with which many portfolios have been stuck could make these products a 
bit more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices have declined across the board in the wake of sharp interest-rate 
hikes in 1994. Losses on individual bonds, once locked in or "realized" by the 
portfolio manager, can be carried forward or used to shelter future capital 
gains from taxation for up to five years. In addition, unrealized or paper 
losses have the potential to shelter gains, assuming these money-losing 
positions are eventually sold. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that the rules are different for capital gains, which must 
be passed along to shareholders in the year realized. Thus despite a 
decade-long bull market that endured through 1993, most bond funds aren't 
sitting on huge gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Morningstar Mutual Funds of Chicago counts about 50 bond portfolios with net 
capital losses equal to 40% or more of assets. If you invest $10,000 in such a 
fund and interest rates decline sharply in future years, boosting the fund's 
price, your investment could appreciate to $14,000 before you would face any 
capital-gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can be a real nice bonus, especially since you're not giving up anything 
for it," says John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this tax-sheltering benefit does not apply to dividends, which 
are normally bigger than capital gains on bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund's semiannual and annual reports to shareholders will list losses, but 
the information can be hard to spot and will already be somewhat dated by the 
time investors receive the reports. Using this information, Morningstar 
calculates a tax analysis that includes both unrealized and realized losses, 
less any gains in the portfolio. The Value Line Mutual Fund Survey, a rival 
publication based in New York, tracks unrealized gains or losses only. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, funds that hold longer-term bonds have gotten whacked the most, as 
interest-rate increases have wreaked greater havoc there. Government, 
corporate, mortgage and foreign income funds all have been hurt. Many stock 
funds also are sitting on significant capital losses, but in general, bond 
products have been hit harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides market fluctuations, another factor that determines the amount of 
capital losses in a fund is the degree of shareholder redemptions; when 
investors pull out their money in droves, managers are forced to sell more 
bonds at losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heavy redemptions make capital-loss carry forwards that much bigger, 
especially if the fund's size is shrinking," says Rekenthaler. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all investors would want to buy a fund based on the size of its 
capital losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be a way to choose among two otherwise equal funds, but it would be 
about the 35th factor I would look at," says Daniel Wiener, editor of the 
Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a Watertown, Mass., newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a capital-loss strategy might not be advisable at all. For the 
approach to make sense, the following circumstances should apply: 
</P>
<P>
 * You should anticipate that interest rates will decline within the next few 
years. Otherwise, the fund's price wouldn't rise significantly, meaning there 
would be little if anything in the way of capital gains to shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 * You should plan to hold the fund in a taxable account. Little sheltering 
benefit would accrue to investors using individual retirement accounts or 
variable annuities, which automatically defer capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Redemptions, if any, shouldn't be so heavy as to seriously erode the fund's 
asset base. That can lead to other problems, such as a ballooning expense 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fund should meet your investment objectives and be a decent performer. 
Among those funds with the largest capital losses, a large percentage are 
commissioned funds, which wouldn't be of interest to no-load buyers. More 
troublesome, many have fundamental problems for which a future capital-loss 
benefit won't compensate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes some work to find decent funds with large capital-loss exposure," 
says Rekenthaler. Among the hardest-hit portfolios, he observes, "most are 
dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a tough investment climate, mutual-fund companies seem willing to work 
harder and spend more money to keep their names and products before investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment industry -- which includes fund companies, brokerages and banks 
-- shelled out $296 million on consumer advertising during the first nine 
months of 1994, reports Competitrack, a New York research firm. That's up 8% 
from the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds alone accounted for nearly 53% of ad spending, or $156 million. 
That represented a 5% increase.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: A WORD TO THE WISE ON BANK CDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I am trying to determine if now is the right time to purchase a certificate 
of deposit at my bank. Rates are higher than they have been in years, and I am 
tempted. If I do succumb, how long a CD term should I go for? I keep thinking I 
should remain fairly liquid in this environment. -- H.L.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Clearly, interest rates offered investors by savings institutions these 
days are the most attractive they have been in several years. Just since the 
beginning of the year, according to one study, the average annual yield offered 
on a six-month certificate of deposit has risen to 3.93% from 2.79%. On a 
one-year certificate, the average percentage yield has jumped to 4.74% from 
3.07%. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, the issue of whether you should bite now remains. The Federal 
Reserve Board's decision last week to again raise the interest rate banks 
charge one another for overnight loans -- the sixth increase this year -- is 
sure to lead to yet higher rates for consumers, both as borrowers and savers. 
Still, are those rates going to be the ones at which you want to lock up your 
money? And if so, for how long?  
</P>
<P>
 The answers depend in large part on the composition of your portfolio. 
Clearly, certificates of deposit should not be your only investment. Of course, 
the funds are covered by federal deposit insurance and are as safe as any 
investment can be, but their returns lag those paid by other investments, so 
you are paying for the security. If CDs are all you hold and you want to 
purchase more of them now, you should stick to short-term notes, such as three- 
or six-month certificates.  
</P>
<P>
 An investor with a broad portfolio and sufficient funds might consider 
"laddering" purchases by buying CDs of various maturities, from three months to 
five years. But to give yourself the maximum flexibility in what is still a 
volatile market, many experts say, the emphasis should be on the short-term 
CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the rates currently offered by banks -- albeit the most attractive 
yields in a year -- are as high as they're going to go will depend on how 
successful the Federal Reserve Board thinks its anti-inflation policy is over 
the next several months. If inflation isn't whipped with this rate increase, 
there are likely to be further increases -- which will give savers 
opportunities to bring home higher yields and more chances to agonize over the 
timing of their CD purchases. If the Fed's effort is successful, the current CD 
rates are likely to remain in effect for a considerable time. 
</P>
<P>
 Our experts urge you follow your instincts. If you are tempted by CD rates, 
stick to those with shorter-term maturities. If you find that rates are 
peaking, you can move to lock up your money at that point. Timing market peaks 
and valleys is difficult for both professional and individual investors alike. 
But you can be wise about your strategy, and it is apparent that you are 
already on the right track. T-Bills and CDs: Tax Rules Are Different 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Please help me compare the yields offered on 26-week U.S. Treasury bills 
and six-month certificates of deposit. Is the annual percentage yield offered 
on a CD comparable to the interest rate paid on a Treasury bill? And if they 
are both, say, 5%, is one better than the other? -- O.E.L . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: From a strictly mathematical perspective, the annual percentage yield on a 
six-month CD is comparable to the interest rate paid on a 26-week Treasury 
bill. If the rates are identical, then the yields are mathematically the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury bill is the better investment, however. Why? Two reasons. The 
simplest one is that interest paid on Treasury securities is not subject to 
state taxes. In California, that means investors, depending on their tax 
bracket, automatically keep from 1% to 11% more of the interest they earn on 
government securities than on bank notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The other reason is that Treasury bills (not Treasury notes of a duration 
greater than one year) are sold at discount and redeemed for full face value at 
maturity. This means that a six-month $1,000 note paying 5% is purchased for 
just $975. Investors tie up less of their money and retain the opportunity to 
invest it elsewhere, perhaps at better rates. Sorting Out Personal Funds in a 
Divorce 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I understand that gifts and inheritances are considered separate property 
in a community property state such as California. But what about compensatory 
and punitive damages received subsequent to the settlement of a personal injury 
lawsuit? And what about the equity in a home whose down payment came from a 
gift to just one of the spouses? -- H.J.F . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Generally speaking, lawsuit settlements are considered community property 
unless the injury was caused by one of the spouses. In that case, the 
settlement is the property of the injured spouse. If the couple is divorced 
after the settlement, the funds are assigned to the injured spouse. The only 
exception to this is when the funds have become so commingled that they cannot 
be sorted out and assigned. Money from a settlement is considered the separate 
property of the spouse receiving it if the cause of action arose after 
separation or divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifts used to make a down payment on a house are far trickier. Much depends on 
how the spouses took possession of the house and whether community property 
funds are used to pay the mortgage. If the home was purchased as community 
property and joint funds are used to pay the mortgage, the gift could be deemed 
to be inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the home is not held as community property and was purchased pursuant 
to an agreement delineating the source of the funds, the source of the mortgage 
payments could cloud any claim to the down payment funds. To help you sort all 
this out, you may well need to consult an attorney or another trusted 
professional adviser.

RENOVATION STUCK IN RED TAPE; SUBWAY PROJECT STALLS PLANS FOR MARIACHI PLAZA, 
SITE OF FESTIVAL TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorful murals have gone up and a new sign proclaims "Mariachi Plaza," but 
little else has changed in the last year at a grimy, litter-strewn asphalt 
trangle in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 With pomp and circumstance, Mayor Richard Riordan and other city officials 
heald a ground-breaking ceremony last November for the plaza where Mariachis in 
Los Angeles have plied theor talents for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation of the doughnut shop parking lot at 1st Street, Boyle and 
Pleasant avenues into Mariachi Plaza was supposed to have been completed by 
June. But the project will be delayed two years by the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority's plans to build a Metro Red Line substation there. 
</P>
<P>
 Redesign of the plaza, starting point for mariachis who comb Boyle Heights 
restaurants and bars to earn a living, is estimated to cost $500,000 to $1 
million. Pleasant Avenue will be closed off, and fake cobblestones and a 
gazebo-like structure from the state of Jalisco -- where the maricachi 
tradition began -- will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaza, the site today of a mariachi festival, will be enlarged to make way 
for the subway station. The doughnut shop that is now the centerpiece of the 
triangle, along with some businesses on Boyle Avenue, will be displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a much greater project which has essentially kept us 
from proceeding . . . but it gives us the drive to go forward," said architect 
Frank Villalobos, who recently traveled to Guadalajara to meet with architects 
designing the centerpiece that will be donated to the city for the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are changing, but what will eventually be there will be one of the 
most positive statements for Latinos in Los Angeles," Villalobos said. "It's 
time to take our place." 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the mariachis who stood in the doughnut shop parking lot last 
week, the redesigned plaza seemed too far off to imagine. They were eager for 
the next job, perhaps a wedding in Whittier or a birthday party in City 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we have to think about working, always working," said Jose 
Galindo, who lives in Boyle Heights and plays the guitar. Sometimes his 
brother-in-law Ramon Chavez joins him for a night of hustling $5 for a string 
of songs at some of the friendlier restaurants on 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 They learned their trade from fathers and uncles who would sit on back porches 
in their hometown of Hermosillo, Sonora, strumming guitars and drinking beer as 
they sang the familiar songs of love, loss and the Revolution over and over 
again.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mariachi is the most beautiful singing in the world," Galindo declared. "You 
can laugh and cry and feel all the emotions when you sing mariachi." 
</P>
<P>
 Other mariachis said the plaza will give honor to them for keeping a Mexican 
tradition alive with littleencouragement and even less pay.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mariachi will never die, but maybe this will make certain that it continues," 
said Miguel Reynoso, dressed in a black charro outfit and holding a trumpet at 
his side while he waited for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos estimates the plaza will be completed by July, 1996, with 
construction beginning in about a year.  
</P>
<P>
 The kiosco from Jalisco will be made of wrought iron and tile surrounding a 
fountain in a colonial-style setting, while the substation will be modern -- a 
deliberate contrast in styles. The Red Line substation is one of six planned 
for the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 For Anita Castellanos, an attorney who owns storefront property on the plaza, 
the plans are an answer to her dreams of cleaning up the area and making it 
more family oriented. She and other merchants helped close down a bar there and 
asked students from the Academia de Arte Yepes, a free youth art academy in 
Boyle Heights, to paint the new murals on surrounding property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming more and more a welcoming area," said Castellanos, who headed 
the Mariachi Plaza  
</P>
<P>
 Committee of residents and business people involved in planning the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got rid of the drug dealers and the winos hanging out, and the market is

ELECTIONS STIR INTEREST AMONG ACTIVIST STUDENTS; POLITICS: PROP. 187 SPURRED 
MANY TEEN-AGERS TO VOTE WITH THEIR FEET IN DEMONSTRATIONS. THEY SAY THEY'LL 
MARCH TO THE BALLOT BOX AS SOON AS THEY ARE ELIGIBLE.

 Julye Castro used to care little for politics. But that was before Proposition 
187.  
</P>
<P>
 Galvanized to oppose the measure out of fear that several classmates could be 
kicked out of school, the Belmont High School sophomore turned student leader, 
helping to organize hundreds of students who marched to City Hall the week 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 But the feeling of empowerment stirred by the boisterous march faded on 
election night. The 15-year-old watched helplessly as ballot counts poured in 
and the measure restricting services for illegal immigrants sailed to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was furious when I saw it was going to pass," Julye said. "And I was even 
more furious because I couldn't vote. I can't wait to turn 18 so I can 
register. I want to be able to vote for what I think is right." 
</P>
<P>
 For Julye, who first learned of Proposition 187 through her 22-year-old sister 
Evelyn, the campaign against the initiative became a political awakening, a 
step in her coming of age. And according to many students, teachers and school 
administrators, she is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that kids are much more informed now than they were before," said 
Carole Stoner, an assistant principal at Garfield High School. "This has been a 
very good time for them, in many ways." 
</P>
<P>
 In high schools throughout the city where anti-187 activism took place, the 
disappointment felt by many students and staff after the initiative's passage 
has been tempered by a new sense of political optimism, as scores of formerly 
apolitical students now say they eagerly look forward to the day when they can 
participate in the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I'll do next year when I turn 18 is register to vote," said 
Celia Acuna, a 17-year-old junior at Huntington Park High School. "That way, 
people like Pete Wilson will listen to people like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the measure say it will save the state millions of dollars and 
will improve the quality of life in California for legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Proposition 187 directly affects children and teens -- hundreds 
of thousands of whom stand to be denied public education if the initiative is 
upheld in court -- is what prompted students to make the connection between 
themselves and the ballot box, said Jose Hernandez, an English teacher at 
Roosevelt High School who has often discussed the initiative with his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hits them close to home," he said. "And when something hits you this close 
to home, there's no way of skirting around the issue. It's been a real impact, 
a trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 John Fernandez, an English teacher at Roosevelt who helped nearly 200 Garfield 
students organize an anti-187 protest with Occidental College students, said he 
is encouraged by the students' newfound desire to become politically active 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing the re-emergence of a very strong student movement in Southern 
California, and Proposition 187 was the catalyst," said Fernandez, who 
co-chairs the Los Angeles Unified School District's Mexican-American Education 
Committee. "There has been a transformation, to an extent. These students are 
now finding their identity, their political conscience. They are now very much 
aware." 
</P>
<P>
 As a student coordinator for the Los Angeles Organizing Committee to Defeat 
Proposition 187, Cristine Soto had the chance to listen to the political 
concerns voiced by thousands of teens she helped place in campaign phone banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to have a positive impact in a few years, when it's their turn 
to vote," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Jeff Combe, a journalism adviser at Garfield, the students most 
affected by the campaign were not the student leaders, who have maintained 
their normally active level of political involvement, but the average students 
who until recently took little interest in political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were the kids who would just go home after school and watch TV," said 
Garfield senior class president Elisabet Hernandez, 17. "Now you see them 
talking about the issues. There's a lot more awareness now. You can feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most kids just used to think 'yeah, whatever,' " added Angela Jara, an 
11th-grader at the school. "Now, they can't wait to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over Proposition 187 has also affected young people of voting 
age who are not U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was already planning to apply for citizenship, but this has reinforced my 
feelings," said Blanca Hernandez, 18, a senior at Garfield who was born in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Echeverria, a 17-year-old Belmont junior, had planned on remaining a 
Guatemalan national, despite several years of legal residence, until he became 
involved in the anti-187 effort on campus. He now plans to apply for 
citizenship as soon as he turns 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think I didn't want to become a citizen, but now I think becoming a 
citizen would be much better for me," he said. "As a citizen, there's a lot 
more you can do that you can't do as a resident. Being able to vote counts for 
a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school district does not keep track of the age of applicants for 
its citizenship classes, three adult schools offering the classes have 
experienced a dramatic increase in enrollment since the election, said Domingo 
Rodriguez, administrative coordinator of the LAUSD's adult, English as a Second 
Language and citizenship programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecuador-born Evelyn Castro, whose own anti-187 student activism on the 
Glendale College campus inspired her American-born younger sister's efforts at 
Belmont High, just became eligible to apply for citizenship this month. She 
hopes to apply soon so that she can one day join her sister at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julye and her friends should be glad they are citizens and will be able to 
vote as soon as they are old enough," said the elder Castro. "You feel helpless 
not being able to make a difference." * A SENSE OF HOPE 
</P>
<P>
 Although the election results did not go as she wished, first-time voter Celia 
Viramontes of East Los Angeles says she'll continue to put her faith in the 
ballot box. Voices, Page 23

LESSONS FROM THE BATTLEGROUND TO THE PLAYGROUND; EDUCATION: STRESS-RELIEF 
TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST FOR THE CHILDREN OF SOLDIERS IN WARTIME 
ARE BEING USED AT RITTER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN WATTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 One child dreams of moving out of the area because the frequent gunfire means 
no chance to play. Another's only wish is that her parents would stop taking 
drugs. Others don't like to walk to school because they fear crime. 
</P>
<P>
 These are stories commonly told by students at Ritter Elementary School in 
Watts. Noted psychologist Dennis Embry hears such fear and apprehension a lot 
too -- but from the children of soldiers coping with war. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the stress relief techniques Embry developed for the children of soldiers 
in wartime are being applied at Ritter, the first Los Angeles Unified School 
District to adopt his PeaceBuilders program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the auspices of state Sen. Teresa Hughes (D-Inglewood), who is 
chairwoman of the Senate Subcommittee on School Safety and an advocate of 
Embry's program, PeaceBuilders is being tested at Ritter with a $2,000 grant 
from Pacific Bell. Hughes is also working on introducing the program, which 
costs $3.52 per student, at 102nd Street Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers' children get anxious imagining themselves on the battlefield with 
their parents -- or envisioning their deaths. For kids in Watts, the violence 
is often closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were standing outside of our apartment with my cousin and his sister and 
gangbangers drove by and shot my cousin in the head," Yvette Morgan, 9, told 
her fourth-grade class during a PeaceBuilders session mediated by Earline 
Henderson, the school counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 When Henderson asked the class of 30 students how many have seen or known 
someone in their family who has been killed or wounded by gunfire, 14 children 
raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just a shooting last night. There's shooting every night," said 
Janice Bright, 10, a fifth-grader at Ritter. "We try to ignore it, but we 
can't. It hurts inside." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even get a chance to play because of the shootings," said Audrey 
Taylor, 10, Janice's classmate and a neighbor at the Imperial Courts housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 With that type of violence -- there have been seven murders this year in the 
neighborhood around the school -- Ritter seemed an ideal proving ground for the 
program, which has been embraced by schools in Texas, Arizona and California. 
</P>
<P>
 Embry is an Arizona psychologist who received national recognition for his 
efforts in helping military children and their families distressed by the 
Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 His program is based on approximately 150 federally and privately funded 
studies on violence prevention that examined behavioral patterns of wartime 
children and their parents from the Vietnam War through the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's chemistry changes during wartime situations," Embry said, offering 
his finding that children around the threat of violence become belligerent and 
overly vigilant and often have difficulty relating with people. "So we began to 
systematically explore how violence affects people in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 200 acts of aggression on an average day at elementary school 
playgrounds," said Embry, president of Heartsprings, a Tuscon company that has 
designed books for parents, teachers and students to help children cope with 
war. "Kids don't grow up and out of it, they grow meaner and nastier." 
</P>
<P>
 PeaceBuilders teaches children and their parents methods to reduce aggression, 
increase positive relationships and improve academic success. The program 
starts by encouraging students to follow four principles: praise people for 
doing something nice, discontinue put-downs because it makes people sad and 
angry, notice and speak up about a hurt you've caused someone else, and find 
adults to help you. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ritter, teachers spend a few minutes out of the regular instruction period 
and explain PeaceBuilder concepts to students. "Teachers are enthusiastic about 
the program and they see it as something they can use (within their lectures)," 
said Ritter Principal Mary Stallings. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence-prevention program, targeting kindergarten through fifth-grade 
students, was first used at a housing project in San Bernardino in August, 
1993. The program eventually spread to 29 schools, after-school programs and 
preschool programs in high-crime urban areas in San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies of 13 schools in San Bernardino County using PeaceBuilders showed 
major drops in vandalism, violence on playgrounds and discipline problems among 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two or three years ago, students walked in a more defensive manner, as if 
threatened," said Principal Judy White of San Bernardino's Emmerton Elementary 
School, which started to use the program in March. "Now we've restored hope to 
the kids. There's an air of peace among the students and they are more 
productive." 
</P>
<P>
 White said that since PeaceBuilders was implemented at Emmerton there has been 
a 62% reduction in suspensions as well as a significant drop in the number of 
children sent to her office for fighting. "Peace has become contagious in our 
school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the program requires teacher and parent participation, an important 
factor in the spreading of peace in the community, Embry said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This will teach the social and emotional skills that we need in this area," 
said Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Building on one of the main concepts of the program, teachers are encouraged 
to send positive notes to parents about their child's behavior rather than the 
more common note describing a child's misbehavior at school. By promoting a 
child's good deeds over the bad, children are more inclined to behave better 
for the recognition, Stallings said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how difficult it seems for kids to say something nice to each 
other, but with PeaceBuilders they've actually learned to give praises and make 
friends," said Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a PeaceBuilders workbook with the basic principles of the program 
given to students encourages parents to work with their children at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have reported that (PeaceBuilders) has become part of their 
vocabulary at home," said White. "It makes them think twice about how to solve 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the program at Ritter will not be determined for at least three 
months, Stallings said, although school officials report fighting on the 
playground already has decreased significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see positive difference in attitudes in the children and the teachers," 
said Stallings. "It doesn't mean there won't be any more fights again, but 
children have become aware of how to avoid them through PeaceBuilders."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; CORPS HELPS WORKERS TO GO ON TO COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of them had dropped out of school, or run away from home, or were 
gangbanging in their 'hoods.  
</P>
<P>
 None ever believed they would hold a high school diploma in their hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Now 37 of these dropouts are headed for or are just starting college with 
$18,000 in scholarships awarded recently by the Los Angeles Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to school I'm in my green LACC uniform. I go there with my nose in 
the air, proud of what I do," said Melissa Hurtado, 20, who is majoring in 
sociology and criminal justice at East Los Angeles Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado is one of 150 Conservation Corps workers from ages 18 to 23 who clear 
brush, remove graffiti and plant trees in South-Central, Downtown and East Los 
Angeles. Help finishing high school and encouragement to continue in college 
are a bonus of the minimum-wage jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989 the 8-year-old nonprofit agency, sponsored by government grants and 
private donations, has awarded 62 college scholarships to corps members 
including Hurtado. Scholarships are awarded to corps workers based on personal 
essays. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hurtado first joined the program she was embarrassed about working on the 
streets. She thought people looked at her as too dumb to work anywhere else. 
But those concerns faded as she completed the corps' required adult education 
classes and began thinking about a future for herself and her son.  
</P>
<P>
 "My friends are in their twenties and are still partying, but I see myself as 
being different from my friends. I pulled away. Now I think they look at me as 
a role model," said Hurtado, who obtained a high school equivalency degree 
after two years with the corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps also helped turn Marissa Chagolla's life around when no one seemed 
to believe in her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was failing most of my classes, I was 35 credits behind my senior year and 
my uncle would tell me to just give up because I was just like everyone else in 
my family who didn't graduate from high school," said Chagolla, who with the 
corps' help is the first in her family to graduate.  
</P>
<P>
 Now 20, Chagolla is living on her own for the first time with the financial 
independence she has gained with her corps job. Her next goal is to graduate 
from college. With her scholarship money, Chagolla will be able to buy her 
schoolbooks, the only thing that has kept her from attending Los Angeles Trade 
Technical College.  
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, with money earned through her Conservation Corps job, Doris Fuentes, 
19, was able to move into her own apartment when she gave birth to her daughter 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fuentes passes her high school equivalency exam, she plans to attend 
East Los Angeles Community College, where she wants to study to be a nurse.  
</P>
<P>
 Before her stint in the Conservation Corps, Fuentes said she smoked, drank and 
moved in with friends because she and her mother did not get along. Now, she 
wants to be a role model for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I started working at (the Conservation Corps), I didn't pay any 
attention to the condition of my community, but now I know how important it is 
for me. I wouldn't like my baby growing (up) in a bad environment, therefore 
myself and the rest of us need to help to keep it clean," Fuentes said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; SPORTS: A 'VACCINE' FOR INNER-CITY WOES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five-time world karate champion Geoff Thompson traveled the world in search of 
a serum that will promote self-esteem, foster teamwork and give inner-city 
youngsters hope for the future. The Englishman says Los Angeles is the place to 
find it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson and a group of 16 youths from Manchester, England, came to 
South-Central to learn how sports programs help inner-city youths stay away 
from drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "What most impressed me in my visit here is that it really did bring home the 
role of sports," Thompson said. By comparison, he said, the inner cities in 
England don't have many youth sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 During a weeklong visit, the British youths toured Muir Middle School's youth 
development program, the Watts Friendship Sports League at Algin Sutton Park, 
and Lanterman High School, where area youngsters from Kids-in-Sports played a 
friendly match of football -- as they call soccer in Britain -- for their 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths were part of a cultural exchange program sponsored by a nonprofit 
organization that Thompson heads in England called Youth Charter for Sport, the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles and First AME Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the sports cultural exchange was to see how sport is making an 
impact in an area afflicted by the riots, and in areas that didn't have sports 
opportunities offered to kids before," said Keith Cruickshank, director of 
grants and programs for the athletic foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural exchange between underprivileged youths of Manchester and Los 
Angeles began last year through the corporate sponsorship of British Airways. 
Considered one of the most volatile cities of Britain, Manchester has suffered 
much in the same way south Los Angeles has in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in Manchester, because the problem is not as great as this, there aren't 
the programs there to steer the kids away from gangs or drugs," said Byron 
Calame, 21, who is part of the British youth sports delegation and who was 
visiting the United States for the first time. "The programs here really work, 
because in Los Angeles there's a need to take the kids off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 "What would they be doing if they didn't have sports?" asked Karen Gribbin, 
18, who is studying to be a paramedic in England.  
</P>
<P>
 Gribbin answered herself with the firsthand knowledge she has of youths 
deprived of sports or other after-school activities: "Drugs," she said. "Kids 
need challenges, and they enjoy sports because they are competing with one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Calame and Gribbin said they were impressed by the number of sports 
organizations that exist in the inner city and how much children enjoy 
participating. "There's a lot of talent in the kids that we saw," Gribbin said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Learning how, exactly, that sports contribute to the socioeconomic improvement 
of urban areas is what prompted Thompson to form his sports group. 
</P>
<P>
 A product of the inner city, Thompson likes to think of himself as a positive 
example of how sports can change a life. "I was a very angry child as I was 
growing up, and I had many opportunities that led to the wrong path," said 
Thompson, who fought his last karate match in 1986. "My sport kept me away from 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports," he says, "is not the answer (to urban blight), it's the vaccine."

 For Jane Meyers, improving her reading and pronunciation skills this year has 
been nothing less than a spiritual experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always running away from reading. . . . But the Lord kept showing it to 
me in dreams, in letters," said the vivacious 60-year-old. "Now my dreams have 
come true. The way I read now, it's a lot, lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers and dozens of semiliterate and illiterate adults like her have found a 
form of salvation through the literacy program at West Angeles Church of God in 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, the program -- officially the West Angeles Literacy Empowerment 
Team, or WALET -- has grown steadily to become one of the largest independent 
literacy programs in the city, aiding about 200 clients in Southwest and 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the program's most remarkable attribute is its ability to flourish 
without a budget; WALET is staffed entirely by volunteers, led by project 
coordinator Gwen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thomas, the program is a personal mission that quickly took shape in the 
aftermath of the 1992 riots. During a meeting with West Angeles pastor Charles 
Blake and other church members who brainstormed ways they could improve the 
community, Thomas was driven to her feet by a sudden inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, ' education ,' and then I thought, ' literacy ,' " said Thomas, a 
former IBM sales representative and now a business instructor at West Los 
Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just stood up and said, 'I want to do this.' I had no experience at running 
any kind of program, but I deeply believe that the economic survival of African 
Americans is based on literacy." 
</P>
<P>
 With information gleaned from about 10 literacy programs she looked up in the 
Yellow Pages, Thomas assembled WALET with a core of about 10 volunteers in 
September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutors are trained and certified through the Los Angeles Public Library Adult 
Reading Project. They spend three hours a week with students -- called 
"readers" -- for a minimum of six months, though Thomas said the amount of time 
varies greatly with skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work with not just reading skills, but living and social skills too," 
Thomas said. "Often readers have to come three times to a session to just get 
comfortable. It takes a long time for somebody to admit that they can't read." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Johnson, 37, was struggling along in his community college studies 
before discovering the West Angeles project and signing up with a tutor. Now, 
he says, he not only reads better but also feels far less constrained in daily 
conversations with friends and people he meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be afraid to say things because my pronunciation and my comprehension 
wasn't good. I felt very limited because I had a third-grade reading ability," 
said Johnson, who suffered from epileptic seizures until corrective surgery 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "So people didn't realize what I had inside of me," he said. "I couldn't let 
it out. Now I can just talk without thinking. I really love that." 
</P>
<P>
 The group of volunteers has mushroomed to nearly 100 in two years, although 
the lack of an office forces tutors to meet students at local libraries, homes, 
restaurants -- anywhere that's mutually convenient, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our headquarters is the Burger King on Crenshaw," she said, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas, who wears an air of confidence as easily as she wears her stylish 
suits, is nothing if not determined. She recently held her second successful 
Celebrity Reading, which featured producer/actress Debbie Allen and other 
entertainers in an event designed to raise literacy awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also scouting around for temporary -- preferably free of charge -- 
WALET headquarters, though West Angeles is refurbishing a building that will 
have space in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years!" exclaimed Thomas, shaking her head. "Illiteracy is right now. 
It's growing. We can't wait that long." ERIN J. AUBRY

<TEXT>
<P>
 People Coordinated Services, a nonprofit community service agency, has opened 
a new center that offers day care for adults suffering from Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>

training; social activities; arts and crafts; independent living skills; 
self-esteem building and grooming skills development, and lunch and 
snacks.Charges for all services are based on a sliding scale.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; FROM CRACK HOUSE TO HOUSING FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For years it has been the scourge of concerned residents and a magnet for 
trouble, but the aging apartment building at the corner of 38th Place and 
Western Avenue is finally getting a new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the area are celebrating," said Los Angeles City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas in the wake of a recent groundbreaking ceremony for the Jane Edna 
Hill Housing Center for Women and Infants, a transitional housing complex that 
will provide needy new mothers and their children with temporary living 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first saw this place two years ago, it was a slum. But we've 
identified the problem and are taking the necessary steps to clean it up," 
Ridley-Thomas said of the apartment building at 1608 W. 38th Place, which will 
be renovated to house the center through $1.2 million in Housing Department 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The city helped facilitate plans with Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church, 
which purchased the building two years ago. The property owner, on the verge of 
being taken to court by the city for violating several housing codes, sold it 
to Mt. Zion Pastor E.V. Hill. Hill then began working with the city to shape 
plans for the building and expedite renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Ridley-Thomas said the 23-unit apartment building had long attracted 
crack dealers, addicts and vagrants, and was a constant complaint among area 
residents. After Mt. Zion acquired the property for $454,000, church officials 
and the city Housing Department agreed to restore its 1929 architecture and 
transform it into something to benefit the community. 
</P>
<P>
 That something is the Jane Edna Hill Housing Center, named for Hill's late 
wife, who was instrumental in establishing and operating Mt. Zion's World 
Christian Training Center, a social and community service organization.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the 25-unit center will not be allowed to stay indefinitely -- 
organizers figure no more than three months -- and will have to sign contracts 
in which they agree to pursue work or education during their time there. 
Residents will have their needs assessed and monitored by on-site social 
workers, doctors and psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a homeless shelter," said project director and consultant Ozie 
Hunt. "We're helping women who want to help themselves. We're not trying to 
create any new programs, just assist people in going where they need to go. The 
center will be a place where mothers can leave their babies while they go to 
school or look for a job." 
</P>
<P>
 The center is scheduled for completion next August. Ridley-Thomas, who once 
lived a few blocks from the building, said he is especially glad to see the 
project get under way. "It's a public-private partnership that's another good 
example of how problems in the community can get solved," he said. ERIN J.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; EXHIBIT SPOTLIGHTS VIBRANT ART SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 N. Van Toan said he can call "Downtown Lives '94" a success if, before it 
closes this evening, at least one person lingers before his oil painting of a 
floating Buddha and ponders inner enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the show, which they called the largest exhibition of Downtown 
art in the history of Los Angeles, defined success by the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred artists participated and attendance was up 20% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a success," said Barbara Mendes, a board member of the Downtown Arts 
Development Assn., the group of artists that organized the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the association have been trying to show that there is still a 
strong heart beating in the Downtown arts community despite a few galleries 
going dark, a few cafes going belly up and the move of the anchor museum, Los 
Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not dead. We are very much alive," Mendes said while standing near her 
eight-foot-high autobiographical "womanist" painting.  
</P>
<P>
 It was apparent that the group's organizers were on a mission. The walls and 
floors of three gigantic warehouses at 1895 Bay St. -- 45,000 square feet of 
exhibition space -- were lavishly covered with the murals, sculptures, 
paintings, photography, multimedia displays and other less easily described 
objets d'art. 
</P>
<P>
 They married this visual cornucopia with live music and performance pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers were not discriminating. They invited anyone and everyone who 
could claim a Downtown address to contribute to the show. So the brushwork of 
an established master could be found hanging next to the doodles of a novice. 
</P>
<P>
 The results had people talking. 
</P>
<P>
 After walking past a large metallic figure with flashing red eyes that 
appeared to be riding a bicycle, Britt Enggrem, a multimedia artist based in 
Hollywood, said: "Looking at some of the work here made me feel like a pretty 
good artist." 
</P>
<P>
 She admitted, however, that she feels the same way when she strolls past some 
of the more abstract pieces in New York's Museum of Modern Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Michelle Anderson, an aspiring writer who recently moved to Los Angeles 
from New York, had a different view.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's accessible," said Anderson while standing in front of Marc Greenblum's 
photo-realist painting of Lee Harvey Oswald, titled "Oswald's Assassination." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendes, whose philosophy is "there are no rules in art -- please yourself," 
said the group's board seized this opportunity to present artists who are often 
ignored by the "elitist" art Establishment, in addition to more well-known 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is proud that the show and the group's extravaganza last year are 
contributing to the revitalization of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of pointing to the businesses that have died, Mendes lists those that 
have been born in the last year: Coffee Strippers, Bloom's General Store, 
Galerie Concrete, Rondeau Fine Arts Gallery and Granados 2 Gallery, to name a 
few. 
</P>
<P>
 But in order to keep the arts scene alive, the group's organizers realize they 
need to attract the foot traffic that more upscale art areas, such as New 
York's SoHo, take for granted.  
</P>
<P>
 They said they hope the show gave people the opportunity to see that Downtown 
isn't a Hades to be avoided at all costs. The Police Department's Central 
Division confirmed that the rate for violent crime is actually low Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 But some "Downtown Lives" guests needed more convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Reinkemeyer, a lawyer-turned-television-and-film-writer, said he doubted 
he would return Downtown just to hang out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is too much urban realism for someone who just wants a beer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many others, however, agreed with Johnathan Libscomb, a student and aspiring 
artist from Riverside, who said: 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go through some ugliness to get here. But it's worth it." BRETT

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; TEENS SPEARHEAD ANTI-TOBACCO DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youths throughout Asian American communities are pushing to halt tobacco sales 
to minors by educating merchants about state laws and health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 teen-agers with Young Asian Pacifics United Against Tobacco (YAPUT), 
a nonprofit health group that serves Asian American areas, fanned out to the 
South Bay, San Gabriel Valley, Chinatown and Koreatown to survey 80 store 
owners on tobacco use and sales. Nearly all, organizers said, were unaware 
state regulations prohibit tobacco sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call upon the merchants to take responsibility," said project coordinator 
Valerie Mih, adding that tobacco use is high in Asian American communities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Department of Health, 80% of 15-year-olds in 
California illegally purchase cigarettes without any problems. And an estimated 
1 billion packs of cigarettes are sold to minors every year, a 1990 study in 
the Journal of the American Medical Assn. found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian/Pacific Islander Tobacco Education Network reports that 37% of Asian 
boys and 29% of Asian girls begin smoking in adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child, I noticed more children using more tobacco," said Mike Qui, 18, a 
YAPUT volunteer who grew up in Koreatown. "I used to play basketball with guys 
from around here, and some would stop playing and grab a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
 YAPUT found that 91% of the merchants surveyed were willing to sell tobacco to 
minors. During a five-month period, YAPUT teen volunteers posed as cigarette 
buyers. Once merchants placed a cigarette pack on the counter, the teens would 
tell them about state tobacco laws and civil fines and encourage them to check 
the identification of young buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers would then leave anti-smoking key chains and posters at the 
stores, which ranged from mom-and-pop liquor stores to gasoline stations to 
supermarkets.  
</P>
<P>
 "At no time during the survey did any of our youth ever buy cigarettes," YAPUT 
staff member Tom Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks later, teen volunteers polled the same stores and found a 38% 
decrease in tobacco sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 YAPUT organizers hope to disseminate this data to anti-tobacco organizations 
and to continue their education program with local merchants and in high school 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I'm doing this," said YAPUT volunteer Christy Lieu, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew kids in my elementary school who were smoking four to five packs a 
day. It's sad to see people selling to youths at such a young age."

<P>
 Combatting the high rate of diabetes in the Latino community, the American 
Diabetes Assn. is offering free screenings for the disease from 11 a.m. to 4 
p.m. today at Olvera Street Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The screenings are part of the seventh annual Unidos Contra la Diabetes 
(United Against Diabetes) health fair.The fair's organizers, the diabetes 
association's Latino programs committee, hope to increase awareness in the 
Latino community, where diabetes strikes one in seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are Latinos three times more likely to have or develop diabetes than 
the general population, they are also more likely to develop severe diabetes 
complications such as blindness, heart attacks, strokes and amputations," said 
Dr. James Peace, chairman of the board of directors of the association. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the organization, 450,000 of the 3.3 million Latinos living in 
Los Angeles County have diabetes, half of them undiagnosed. BRETT MAHONEY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; CHP OFFICERS RESCUE THANKSGIVING FEAST

<P>
 Just as organizers of an annual Thanksgiving dinner for the needy at Ruben 
Salazar Park were paring down their event because of a lack of resources, the 
California Highway Patrol came to the rescue with another dinner that will 
serve more people than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Claus came in the form of the CHP," said Cris Mojica, who has helped 
put the Thanksgiving dinner together for the last five years and is also 
helping out with the CHP dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the Thanksgiving dinner that once served 200 needy people in 
the area had grown to feed 1,000 last year, Mojica said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because they have not been able to collect as many donations this year, 
the organizers planned to treat only about 200 senior citizens to a 
Thanksgiving feast and dance at the park Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to that meal, officers from the Montebello station of the CHP 
raised nearly $4,000 to provide a Thanksgiving dinner to needy families in the 
area. It will be served this afternoon at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, 
3860 E. 3rd St. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight officers, led by Capt. Gary Dominguez, were moved by poor children 
they had seen on a drive to Bajamar, in Baja California, for a golf tournament, 
CHP spokesman Luis Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned three weeks ago, they started soliciting donations from 
fellow officers and support staff and asked the church to find the needy 
families and round up volunteers to cook the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't done it before but times are tough," Gutierrez said, adding that 
officers want to continue the annual event. "It's hard for these families to 
get Thanksgiving dinner for their kids."  
</P>
<P>
 Los Caballeros, a group of Mexican American business people, will do the 
cooking and start serving dinner from 2:30 p.m. until the food runs out.  
</P>
<P>
 About 25 officers will be on hand this afternoon to greet people at the door 
and help serve the meals. Mojica, a retired trucker, and others who volunteer 
at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church have given out 1,500 tickets for the 
meal to needy families and homeless people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not have to go far to find the needy, he said, noting that bread 
lines form at Our Lady of Lourdes three times a week. This afternoon's dinner 
will include families from Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church, Our Lady of 
Guadalupe and surrounding neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really amazing that we had so much luck this year," Mojica said. "In 
years past, we would write letters for donations and we would get some here and 
there. They saved the day because we're concentrating on the really needy."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; DONATIONS SOUGHT FOR TOY GIVEAWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alatorre has kicked off the Feliz Navidad toy giveaway 
project in an effort to ensure that children in the housing projects in his 
district will receive toys this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event, which Alatorre started in 1987, converts recreation centers 
at the six housing projects into festive Christmas celebrations with snow, 
magicians, music, clowns and a visit from Santa Claus.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 16,000 families took part in last year's festivities, organized by 
volunteers and Alatorre's staff. Alatorre hopes to raise $125,000 this year for 
the toys, books, games and entertainment, as well as soliciting donations of 
toys and other items for the events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have what we like to call a 'winter wonderland,' " said attorney Tony 
Zamora, chairman of the board of directors of the nonprofit Feliz Navidad 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have Santa, we have entertainment, we have, typically, a lot of props like 
snow and tin soldiers. It's really almost like a Disneyland ride. The kids come 
in and you can see their faces light up when they're there. Santa's elves are 
handing out toys and they get to talk to Santa." 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to match the children, from toddlers to 13-year-olds, with 
appropriate toys for their ages. Volunteers have been registering children in 
the housing projects to make sure the children receive the right kind of toy on 
the day of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The toy giveaways are held on consecutive weekends in December at the various 
housing developments. Workers get there as early as 5 a.m. to decorate, bring 
in toys and coordinate the event.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kids and the parents feel very special on that day and that's the 
point," Zamora said.

 Alatorre started the events after a Christmas toy giveaway effort in 1986 came 
up short, with lines of children waiting for presents. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, he established Feliz Navidad and set out to sponsor a Christmas 
celebration at one housing project each year, starting with Ramona Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents at other projects soon heard about his program and asked to be 
next on his list. Alatorre responded by expanding the program to every project 
in his district.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; LIBRARY TO CELEBRATE EXPANDED HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 All that Brooklyn Elementary pupil Abraham Fuerte wanted to know on a class 
trip to the East Los Angeles Library last week was whether the library would be 
open on Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to unexpected money from the county, the answer was yes -- as of Dec. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles Library, like all branches in the county library system, 
had to scale back its hours over the past two years, going from 50 hours a week 
to 28 and closing Sundays, Thursdays and Fridays. The austere budget this year 
forced the closure of 10 branches and drastic cuts in operations and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with an unexpected budget increase from the County Board of 
Supervisors, library manager Linda Chavez has hired six new part-time staff 
members and expanded hours to six days a week -- except Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 And Abraham, 10, will be able to visit the library when he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were coming in to look at some books (on a Thursday) and we looked through 
the window and saw nobody," Abraham said, recalling a visit to the branch with 
a friend. "We just left." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said she hopes the new hours will help reverse a slide in library 
usage, which has declined from 12,000 patrons a month to 6,000 in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost a lot of customers and we want people to know that we're open 
now," Chavez said. "It's difficult to build up that base again." 
</P>
<P>
 The library will celebrate the new hours Dec. 5 with mariachis, balloons and 
special guests at 10 a.m. and again, to attract schoolchildren, at 3 p.m. 
Visitors will get tours of the library and learn how to use its resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anthony Quinn and City Terrace branches also recently expanded their 
hours, from two days to five, and the El Camino branch will expand its hours to 
five days a week in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the new hours and staff, the East Los Angeles branch has more money 
now to buy new materials and subscribe to newspapers and magazines it had 
discontinued during the financial drought. The budget for materials, including 
books, audiovisual materials and periodicals, had been cut from $68,600 in the 
1991-92 fiscal year to $15,140 in 1992-93 and $5,079 for this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Chavez has not received word yet on how large the budget increase for 
materials will be, but said she expects it to be near the 1991-92 fiscal year 
allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the financial strain, the library a year ago formed a support 
group, Friends of the East L.A. Library and the Chicano Resource Center. The 
group has hosted book sales, poetry readings, speakers and other events to get 
the community more involved with the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of fear we all just got together and wanted to do something" about the 
budget cuts, said Sofia Chavez (not related to Linda), vice president of the 
group. "We want to continue doing those kinds of things as well as push for the 
Board of Supervisors to find some secure funding source for the library." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Abraham and his classmates, getting their first library card and 
finding out where the scary stories are shelved was a priority last Wednesday. 
Their teacher, Purisima Bing, looked on and kept order among the curious and 
excited children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to come here on their own. There are a lot of bright minds," Bing 
said. "A lot of them don't use their ability to the maximum, and if we can get 
them interested at this age, they will continue to read and learn new things."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; CONCRETE RECYCLER WINS RENEWAL VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of 50 residents complaining about dust and noise, the 
Planning Commission voted to allow a company that recycles concrete into road 
base to continue operating for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners voted 3 to 1 on Nov. 2 to renew Aggregate Recycling Systems' 
conditional-use permit. Residents of Cottage Street, who for months had fought 
to halt operations of the company across the street at 6208 S. Alameda St., 
have appealed the decision to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe they'll just go on making noise like normal," said Esperanza 
Marquez. "It's really making our lives miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the company opened one year ago, residents have complained that their 
lives have been disrupted by high levels of dust and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggregate owner Sam Chew said the company has taken steps to reduce problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew said he has replaced the mufflers on two large loaders, reducing the 
noise they emit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have those sounds anymore," Chew said. "As for the dust, there's no 
problem there either. We keep the dust piles watered down all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also operates a large crusher for recycling used concrete into 
road base, but Chew said that machine is not responsible for the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 After the January earthquake, the company operated into the night crushing 
large amounts of concrete debris, Chew said. But once business from the quake 
tapered off, the company stopped operating at night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew said other companies in the area may have been sources of the dust, and 
that passing trains could contribute to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, any start-up isn't going to be perfect," Chew said. "There may 
have been a dust problem, but it might not have come from my property." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the commission's decision to renew the company's conditional-use 
permit -- which will go before the City Council Dec. 5 -- several residents 
cited a litany of complaints about the company's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Avila said his child's asthma has gotten worse since the company opened. 
Linda Marquez said she has tossed and turned for 12 months, unable to sleep 
properly. Armando Ruiz said he is embarrassed to entertain guests at his home.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with businesses like this coming to the city and giving 
people jobs, just not 15 feet in front of my house," said Ruiz, who rents a 
house across from Aggregate at 6120 Cottage St. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have filed four complaints against Aggregate with the city since 
May. Two alleged that the company did not clean up dirt left in the street by 
trucks hauling concrete material, and two alleged that noise and dust emissions 
were excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Gray, assistant director for community development, handles code 
enforcement for the city. He said the conditional-use permit requires Aggregate 
to maintain 100 feet between material-moving equipment and the company's 
property line between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. to prevent excessive noise at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said the South Coast Air Quality Management Districts will begin 
monitoring emissions by the company if the City Council does not overrule the 
Planning Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 But such requirements have not satisfied residents, environmentalists and a 
neighboring business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're looking at alternatives like filing a public nuisance complaint to 
halt operation. . . . We've also discussed the need for an environmental impact 
report to be done," said Carlos Porras, who helped organize the Cottage Street 
residents on behalf of the Los Angeles-based Citizens for a Better Environment, 
a nonprofit group that targets environmental concerns in minority 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighboring business, Commercial Enameling Inc., is also appealing the 
Planning Commission decision. The company says dust from Aggregate could 
potentially damage recently enameled bathroom fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew said he would like to meet with residents again to discuss their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission's decision was a good signal for businesses in this city," 
Chew said. "On our end, we're constantly improving wherever we need to." SIMON

<P>
 Work began last week on a $5-million renovation of Hancock Park, the green 
space between Wilshire Boulevard and 6th Street that links the George C. Page 
Museum of La Brea Discoveries with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Although construction is not set to begin until next year, workers have begun 
clearing away dead trees and shrubbery, said Mark Rodriguez, assistant director 
of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, which oversees the Page 
Museum and is responsible for the park's upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned enhancements include a new fence around the perimeter of the park, an 
amphitheater, an outdoor cafe, a picnic area, a decorative water fountain, open 
space for public art, improved security and lighting, new vegetation and 
irrigation.  
</P>
<P>
 The funds to refurbish the park come from a $540-million county bond measure 
approved in 1992 for the improvement of county parks and recreational 
facilities. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COVER STORY; WHAT MAKES SIRR PARKER RUN?; THE LOCKE HIGH SENIOR DODGED 
ADVERSITY TO BECOME THE CENTRAL CITY'S MOST COVETED FOOTBALL PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Practice is over, the sun has set and most of the players have already gone 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sirr Parker, the Locke High School football star, does more than run 
ordinary drills. And that may be one reason he is a running back with 
extraordinary skills. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes a football at the goal line and surveys his opposition: two players, 
acting as cornerbacks, stand a first down away at the 10-yard line. Two more 
crouch at the 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The object: Make it to the other end zone without being tagged by any of the 
four defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker digs his right cleat into the lumpy turf, pivots quickly and heads 
left, already near full speed. Drawing the first two players to him, he quickly 
zigzags right and arches away from a hand-tag. The first two defenders are 
through. Parker breaks down the right sideline and reaches midfield before 
cutting back against the grain, sweeping past one would-be tackler. Three down, 
one to go. It's now a footrace, an event that the 100-meter sprint specialist 
rarely loses. 
</P>
<P>
 No contest. . .touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hardly ever catch me," Parker, 17, said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying out of harm's way is second nature to Parker. He is as good at dodging 
adversity as he is at slipping tackles. Good enough to shrug off an unstable 
home life and the dangers of growing up amid gangs and drugs in South-Central 
Los Angeles to become the Central City's most highly prized football recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, despite his team's miserable season (an 0-9 record with two forfeits), 
led the city in rushing with 1,129 yards and 19 touchdowns with 19, scoring 114 
points. Parker scored twice o1847618409 No wonder a score of top Division I 
football colleges have their eyes on Parker and are ready to help him achieve 
the most cherished of rewards for a high school athlete: a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Parker gains a full scholarship from one of his many suitors -- which 
include football powers USC, Notre Dame, Arizona, the University of Nebraska 
and UCLA -- he will have beaten considerable odds to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem there is plenty of scholarship money to go around for star 
athletes in any given year: In 1991, the last year for which figures are 
available, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. reported that 90,000 athletes 
were receiving about $468 million in full and partial scholarships from more 
than 500 Division I and II colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are striking, but the reality is that competition is fierce: It is 
estimated that the available scholarship money is enough for only about 10% of 
the athletes, male and family, w1752113264 Talent is a necessity to draw 
interest from coaches and recruiters, but grades are essential for actually 
landing financial support. Poor grades can sideline the best of athletes. Good 
grades can give a star such as Sirr Parker an open field. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA, at the urging of some college presidents, has toughened its academic 
standards for scholarship eligibility in recent years. A type of sliding scale 
is used -- a student athlete who maintained a C average in high school, a 2.0 
grade-point average, would have to score a 900 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test; 
the better the GPA, the lower the test score can be and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "School is the No. 1 factor why kids don't get scholarships," said Richard 
Estrada, who works for Para-Dies Scouting Service, an Orange County-based 
service that contracts with colleges who want information on high school 
football players.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city of L.A. probably has the best athletes overall in Southern 
California, but a lot of times nobody's pushing these kids to study and to go 
to school. So you get a kid with maybe a high-C average, but then you look at 
his SAT and, sorry, it's 600." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker won't have that problem. He has a 3.78 GPA and is awaiting his reults 
on the SAT test. Parker has helped cut the odds further by being a member of 
his school's student-improvement club, the Men of Locke Delegation, which 
awards students varying amounts of money for good grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond academics, there are other stumbling blocks for the Central City 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids see their parents once a week," Estrada said. "There are gangs and 
drugs. Kids have to separate themselves from that element and it is really 
hard. It takes a lot of willpower to do that in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Parker will tell you the game has always been the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is the least of my concerns," Parker said. "I use it to keep 
everything else together. Once the ball is in the air, I put everything else on 
hold. It helps me keep other things in order, release my frustrations, get away 
from the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the glare of attention is never far away from a blue-chip athlete. It 
follows Parker home to the two-bedroom apartment he shares with his mother in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 A minute into a recent phone conversation, Parker heard the familiar click of 
call waiting. Over the course of the hour-and-a-half conversation, he would 
hear it eight more times -- from assistant coaches of universities that are 
pursuing him or from the news media who want to know if he has made up his mind 
where he will go. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the usual," Parker said. "I get about 30 calls a week." 
</P>
<P>
 The attention literally surrounds Parker at home. In his room, recruitment 
letters adorn all four walls and still more are stapled to the ceiling. 
Hundreds more are stored in his dresser drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 He never throws them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep them for souvenirs," Parker said. "When I wake up in the morning and 
go to sleep at night, all I see are letters everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 As Parker gazes at the letters, he sees a future filled with promise and 
possible stardom. But when he looks into the mirror, he is reminded of a 
difficult past, filled with ups and downs. From the time Parker was 1 until he 
was 11, he lived with his grandmother in South-Central, at 76th and Broadway. 
Gunshots and sirens were heard nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad neighborhood, good times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't the life to live but it was probably the happiest time of my life," 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Parker's mother battling personal problems and his father gone since he 
was 3, his grandmother, Florence Mosley, shouldered the responsibility of 
raising him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother and cousins took the place of my father," Parker said in a 
soft, even voice. "You never miss what you never had." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley took care of Parker and most of his cousins in an average-size home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She raised 10 children and nearly 22 grandchildren over the course of my 
stay," Parker said. "I saw her go through a lot of things and make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker remembers the lessons she taught him: "She would feed family members 
and people off the street if they were hungry. She fed people who stole from 
her before. She taught me to never hold grudges." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she didn't have much, Mosley saw to it that Parker had everything 
he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had food and clothes and we went to school," Parker said. "That was never 
an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Parker's cousins and roommates, Eric Wilson and Akili Mosley, saw 
to it that Parker's football skills would not be wasted on the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all used to play football in the street, and one day we snuck Sirr up to 
Jefferson High and signed him up to play Little League," Wilson said. "He was 
too good not to play somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker didn't disappoint his cousins, winning rookie of the year at the age of 
8 as a member of the Tiny Mites of the King Football Conference -- a Pop 
Warner-like organization. Parker established his star status early: In three 
years in the King Conference, he was twice named most valuable player, player 
of the year and defensive and offensive back of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker felt like he was the fastest person in the world. All that he could see 
in front of him was daylight. Only death could catch him from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothered me a lot when my grandmother died," Parker said of Florence 
Mosley's death in 1988. "I still miss her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parker lived with his aunt, Freda Williams, in Rialto for the next two years, 
before finally moving back to South-Central with his mother in an apartment 
owned by his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker admits that he and his mother do not share a close relationship. He 
says she is rarely at the apartment. He believes, however, that she is past the 
problems that caused her to send him to live with his grandmother. Noticeably 
uncomfortable, Parker sheds the subject, much like a futile arm-tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm usually at my coach's house or my girlfriend's house," Parker said. 
"Sometimes, I don't know where my mom is, but it doesn't bother me. I just do 
what I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Mosley, Parker's grandfather, comes by from time to time to check on his 
grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to see how Sirr is doing," Louis Mosley said. "I just tell him to 
concentrate on the future and not worry about the past or present." 
</P>
<P>
 During Parker's past and present, the one positive has always been football. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he made the Locke varsity football team as a sophomore, picking up 
where he left off in youth football. From the start, Parker drew attention for 
his dazzling natural ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have (scouted) him since he was a sophomore," Estrada said. "I was telling 
people that Parker was going to be a Division I player when I first saw him." 
</P>
<P>
 Locke coach E.C. Robinson tells why. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ranks at the top of the backs in the city because he can run, catch and 
pass," said Robinson, who is in his 14th year at Locke. "Sirr can run inside, 
make a read and then bounce outside with the speed to turn the corner. I have 
seen great backs in the city, but he is the best I have seen in eight or nine 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has produced its share of great backs, including Manual Arts graduate 
Steve Broussard of the Cincinnati Bengals, Crenshaw's Wendell Tyler, formerly 
of the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers, and Roosevelt's Mike Garrett, 
formerly of the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs and the current 
athletic director at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-10, 180-pound Parker also impressed onlookers at the Scouting Evaluation 
Assn. Combine at Warren High School in Downey last spring. A combine is a 
tryout for football players during which they are measured and tested for 
speed, agility and overall ability in a series of running and pass-catching 
drills. Recruiters and scouting services can evaluate several athletes at the 
same time.  
</P>
<P>
 The combine's director, Dick Lascola, was particularly impressed with Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is 'We Test the Best' and Sirr Parker certainly belongs here," 
Lascola said. "Parker is a good football player. He can break tackles and once 
he gets into the open, he is tough to catch. Speed is his obvious strong suit. 
I don't know that he has any weak attributes." 
</P>
<P>
 His size might have been a drawback at one point, but Parker has added 20 
pounds to his chiseled frame since his sophomore year. The added muscle has 
brought him better balance and helped eliminate what used to be a weakness in 
his running style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parker used to go down easily when he was hit but he has since gotten a lot 
stronger," Estrada said. "He runs inside a lot better than he used to. When you 
add power to his quick decision-making abilities and great acceleration, you 
have a great running back." 
</P>
<P>
 And he has the superstar attitude: "I like for the game to be in my hands," 
Parker said. "I like having the ball and feeling the pressure. I have a say-so 
whether or not we win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
 He's a leader, too, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sirr is a remarkable person. He is well-respected by his teammates and 
well-liked by his schoolmates." 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever he goes, Parker's choice in college will not be solely based upon 
athletics, although he does adhere to advice commonly given to prospective 
scholarship athletes: He wants to go somewhere where he will be spotlighted in 
the team's offensive game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many high school seniors who want to remain close to home their first 
year in college, distance and emotional ties will not factor into Parker's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter where in the United States I play," Parker said. "I'm 
taking (my trophies, awards and letters) with me, so home will be wherever I 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker is allowed a limited number of on-campus visits under NCAA guidelines. 
Home could be one of the schools -- Washington, Arizona or Notre Dame -- he has 
planned to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington may be the early front-runner thanks to star tailback Napoleon 
Kaufman, whom Parker reveres. Kaufman's slashing running style and balance of 
speed and power is reminiscent of Parker's. 
</P>
<P>
 At heart, though, Parker's decision will be pragmatic. He sees his future more 
in terms of a next logical step than a once-in-a-lifetime dream. "The first 
thing I look at is the graduation percentage of the football players. I'm using 
football to get an education. If I don't get a pro contract, I'll still have 
school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what would Parker want to do more than play football? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a child psychologist because with all of the problems I went 
through as a child, I think I could relate to other children's problems," 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parker doesn't want a plush office overlooking Wilshire Boulevard. 
Something at Broadway and Manchester is fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids in South-Central have the most problems, so that's where I should 
be," Parker said. "A lot of people make it and act like they were never there. 
I have to remember where I came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Staff Writer Gordon Dillow contributed to this story. On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Sirr Parker with the hundreds of recruiting letters he stores in his room. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with his talent for running with the football, Parker maintains a 3.78 
grade-point average at Locke High School. 
</P>
<P>
 With the NCAA, at the urging of some college presidents, toughening its 
academic standards in recent years, good grades are essential for landing 
financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor grades can sideline the best of athletes. Good grades can give a star 
such as Parker an open field.

 "Take 2" at USC's Fisher Gallery and the California Afro-American Museum 
showcases the multimedia artwork of 13 Los Angeles women. 
</P>
<P>
 Depictions of homelessness, riots, fires, floods and earthquakes are 
juxtaposed with those showing human triumph and peaceful rhythms of life. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 100 works, from Toni Love's in-your-face paintings 
depicting the riots to Phoebe Beasley's cynical collages of Los Angeles 
consumerism to Alysse Stepanian's magical realism in her mixed media 
reflections of ordinary life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take 2" -- the title reflects the museums' first-ever collaboration -- is 
part of the citywide biennial celebration of visual and performing arts, "LAX: 
The Los Angeles Exhibition," which takes place simultaneously at 10 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The other participants are the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena; Cal 
State Los Angeles; Japanese-American Cultural and Community Center in Little 
Tokyo; Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in Hollywood; Los Angeles Municipal 
Art Gallery; Otis Gallery in MacArthur Park; Otis College of Art and Design and 
the Santa Monica Museum of Art.

 The public may participate in a series of joint and individual workshops, and 
artists' talks and guided tours are scheduled throughout the run of the show at 
the California Afro-American Museum in Exposition Park and the Fisher Gallery 
on Exposition Boulevard.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL PREVIEW; A STATE TITLE FOR WASHINGTON?; COACH SAYS HER PLAYER 
DEPTH GIVES THE GENERALS THE EQUIVALENT OF 'TWO STARTING-FIVE TEAMS.' BUT FIRST 
THEY MUST GET PAST CRENSHAW, CARSON AND ROOSEVELT. 
</P>

<P>
 Julie Rousseau learned what it takes to win a City Section girls' basketball 
title as an assistant to former Coach Phil Chase during Washington High's 4-A 
title reign between 1989-92. 
</P>
<P>
 Rousseau, in her third year as head coach at Washington, believes the Generals 
have the potential this season to make a run for the City title -- and a state 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best team I have ever had," Rousseau, 29, said. "I'm sure they 
could give the Washington alumni a run for their money. But my ultimate goal is 
to do something that hasn't been done at this school before. And that's to 
bring home a state championship." 
</P>
<P>
 That's saying a lot. The Generals were 105-17 and won 65 consecutive games 
against City competition during their championship run but never made it past 
the Southern California Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance of power in the City will likely lie in the rugged Southern 
Pacific Conference. Three of last year's 4-A semifinal teams were from the 
conference, which has produced the last six 4-A champion teams as well as 1993 
3-A champion Banning.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Washington has a talented team, the Generals can expect plenty of 
competition from Crenshaw, the two-time defending City 4-A champion, which 
shared the Southern League title with Washington and Carson, all with 8-2 
records.  
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (22-6) returns All-City forward Kristi Lattin, a 6-foot senior, along 
with sophomore center Naila Mosely (6-0), junior Devon King (5-5) and senior 
Bridgette Jemison (5-10). Carson, a 4-A semifinalist, is bolstered by the 
addition of senior Shannon Burton, a 5-7 transfer from Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt (21-2), winner of four of the last six Southeastern Conference 
titles, is also a force. The Roughriders, who are led by the senior trio of 
center Zenobia Tyson Hunt (6-2) and 5-7 guards Jennifer Brambila and Edna 
Alvarez, took Crenshaw to two overtimes in last year's City final. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate has arguably the City's best player in junior Ruby Maciel, who can 
single-handedly carry an inexperienced Rams far into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washington has a lot of new players and has a lot of size for a City team," 
Crenshaw co-coach Greg Cobbs said. "All the competition in our conference tends 
to make us a better team in the long run. But people don't realize we have four 
returning starters and two championship banners. The title is ours until 
someone takes it from us."  
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Crenshaw lost twice to Washington -- its only losses against City 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 All-City guard Tina Greer (5-2), who averaged 12.7 points, four assists and 
5.7 steals, and center Jackie Lauderdale are back from that 18-7 Washington 
team, which reached the 4-A semifinals. Junior guard Shimika Stringer (5-6) and 
sophomore forwards Shawnee Pickney (5-11) and Kanisha Best (5-8) also return. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's newcomers, however, include five transfers who have stirred 
Rousseau's optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Trysta Wilson, a 5-7 junior guard, was a member of the Mohicans' 3-A champion 
last season. Sophomore center Laneishe Williams (6-0) and forward Courtneigh 
Burns (5-11) are from Muir. Guard Erika Martinez (5-7) and center Lareishia 
Finley (6-2), both juniors, are transfers from Serra and Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some really nice talent returning, but this team is so well-rounded 
and deep that we literally have two starting-five teams," Rousseau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington won't have to wait long to test its strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The Generals open the season Saturday against Belmont in the 14-team 
Washington tournament. Crenshaw, Kennedy, Dorsey, Los Alamitos, Venice, South 
Gate, Huntington Park and Marshall are among the teams who will compete. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 7, Washington plays Lynwood, last year's State Division I runner-up, 
which has a 62-2 record over two seasons. The home game will be a rematch of 
this summer's Watts Summer Games final won by Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it's off to the prestigious Tournament of Champions in Santa 
Barbara, which features many of the top teams on the West coast, before 
starting Southern Pacific Conference play in January. Top Players to Watch 
</P>
<P>

She scored 18 points and had four three-point baskets in the City 4-A final to 
help the Cougars to their second consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: A three-year starter, the versatile Lattin is equally 
effective playing at the post or on the wing. Was impressive during summer 
league play.

SOUTH GATE'S RUBY MACIEL IS A GEM ON AND OFF THE COURT; THE VERSATILE JUNIOR, 
WHO CAN PLAY ANY POSITION, HAS TALENT MATCHED ONLY BY HER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruby Maciel isn't afraid of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Gate High junior has conquered most of them in the classroom and the 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Maciel is taking advanced placement courses in calculus, Spanish and 
literature while maintaining a 3.6 grade-point average. She hasn't missed a day 
of basketball practice. Or a day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days I don't want to go to school, but I feel my education is very 
important," said Maciel, 16, an aspiring accountant. "And if you miss a lesson 
in an A.P. class, you fall way behind. I want to learn something and see what I 
am capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 In basketball, her challenges have come from playing in pickup games with 
brother Vito Maciel, 20, and Miguel Villegas, 19, former South Gate players who 
now play at Harbor and Fresno City colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to take me to play against the guys," Maciel said. "I can usually 
drive and move people out of the way, but they never took it easy. They used to 
hit me around and block my shot. I got beat up, but it made me a lot tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 It also served as a foundation for her development into one of the City 
Section's premier players. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the 5-foot-9 forward was named to the All-City 4-A first team. 
Maciel averaged 20 points and 11 rebounds. She scored in double figures in 22 
of 23 games and made nearly 80% of her free throws during Southeastern 
Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Maciel, who began playing in parks and recreation leagues in junior high, has 
started every game since her freshman season, when she averaged 13.2 points, 11 
rebounds and three assists. Coach Sharon Robertson calls Maciel the best player 
at South Gate in her 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruby is an all-around player who can play any position," Robertson said. "She 
doesn't mind; she'll play wherever she is needed. A lot of times we have her 
bring the ball up-court and then have her post up low." 
</P>
<P>
 Maciel faced some of the best 14- to 16-year-old players in the nation this 
summer as a member of City Force, an Amateur Athletic Union traveling team that 
included Kristi Lattin and Naila Moseley of Crenshaw; Jamie Kogan and Corey 
Kobata of Marshall; Aisha Savage and Florastine Hillis of Marshall, and 
Washington's Kanisha Best. 
</P>
<P>
 With Maciel playing at point guard, City Force advanced to the championship of 
the Basketball Congress International tournaments in Tempe, Ariz.; St. Paul, 
Minn.; Norco, and Harbor College. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always build your team around a point guard and a center," said City 
Force Coach Phil Chase. "Ruby was the best point guard around. She's got good 
court vision, makes good decisions and she's a good rebounder. She's gotten to 
the level where she is good enough to play point guard in college. And that's 
not saying anything lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 She has attracted scholarship interest from UCLA, Arizona, Pepperdine, 
Northern Arizona and Nevada.  
</P>
<P>
 "If she doesn't get a scholarship from basketball, she'll probably get one 
from her academics," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, Maciel played in an invitational tournament at Millikan High in 
Long Beach. She was named to the all-star team in the tournament, which 
included many all-league players from the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 "My confidence gets a little higher each year," Maciel said. "Playing against 
the best makes my confidence go a notch higher." 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate (17-6) has qualified for the playoffs in 10 of the last 12 seasons 
and advanced to the 4-A quarterfinals for the past three years. Robertson is 
banking on Maciel, the lone returning starter from last year's Eastern League 
runner-up, to take the Rams a step further this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruby always tries to encourage her teammates and help them out in practice," 
Robertson said. "They look up to her and depend on her as a role model. The 
best thing about her, though, is she always has a good attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 And some high expectations.

AIRPORTS AIM FOR PROFITS WITH BETTER FOOD, SHOPS; RETAIL: POOR MEALS AND 
OVERPRICED SOUVENIRS GRADUALLY ARE GOING THE WAY OF TERMINALS RUN BY A SINGLE 
CONCESSIONAIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With more than 800 flights to and from Sacramento under his belt, Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has encountered more than his share of 
second-rate airport food. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were sure the Sacramento airport was open 24 hours a day because whatever 
it was that they were serving you looked like it was 24 hours old," he said. 
"You slid your tray down the line, they'd give you something, and you'd wonder 
what it was. My advice for (travelers at) most airports is: Don't eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The politician's ruminations will ring true for frequent fliers who have 
braved an airport cafeteria line or paid too much for a paperback novel at an 
airport newsstand. 
</P>
<P>
 But poor food and overpriced souvenir stands gradually are giving way to 
attractively decorated restaurant and retail operations that use competitive 
pricing and solid service to win sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes are being driven by the growing realization that travelers generally 
have both time and money on their hands, a combination that's "the magic 
formula for retailing," according to Monica Nassif, a spokeswoman for 
Miami-based Sun Glass Hut, which operates 11 stores at airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport executives and retailers say that truly competitive pricing is the key 
to success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day at an airport I paid $2.75 for a Whopper that I'd only pay 99 
cents for at a Burger King restaurant," said Mike Epstein, marketing vice 
president for San Diego-based Creative Croissants, which operates a coffee 
stand at John Wayne Airport. "That's why airports are starting to go to street 
pricing. Customers won't stand for (high prices) anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Creative Croissants' John Wayne location, owned by franchisees Lori and Robert 
Park of Orange, charges slightly higher than off-airport prices for some of its 
menu items. But their shop hasn't raised its prices in four years -- not even 
on a 12-ounce cup of coffee, which still sells for $1. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are pleased with our prices," Lori Park said. "They tell us we are 
lower priced than most other airports. I think that's good for our business, 
because we have lots of regular customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's innovative "air mall" is the acknowledged industry leader. The 
2-year-old terminal is home to more than 80 restaurants and retail shops, 
including TGI Fridays, Nature Company, the Body Shop, Upper Deck Authenticated 
and Sun Glass Hut. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh officials offer a simple measure of the mall's success: Sales per 
boarded passenger have soared to nearly $7, up from just $2.40 per visit before 
the new airport terminal opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Another gauge of its popularity is that up to 5% of monthly sales at the air 
mall go to local residents who view the airport as an alternative shopping 
center. "On our second anniversary we had television crews in here interviewing 
shoppers who were here to shop, not catch planes," said Guy Wescott, an 
executive with BAA Pittsburgh Inc., the mall's operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's successful experiment with "street pricing" has prompted the 
Dallas-Fort Worth airport and other big-city airfields to adopt rules that 
require retailers and restaurants to charge prices equivalent to those at 
off-airport sites. But Los Angeles International Airport is instead banking on 
competition rather than mandated pricing to keep prices low when its new 
culinary lineup is completed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 One restaurateur who asked not to be identified suggested that LAX is doing a 
disservice to passengers by not capping prices. "People are not stupid," said 
the restaurateur, who is bidding on space at LAX. "They know what a cup of 
coffee costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, competition for Los Angeles airport's retail slots has been fierce. 
Hundreds of restaurant operators and food companies, including Wolfgang Puck, 
Kentucky Fried Chicken, Creative Croissants, Panda Express and Haagen-Dazs, 
responded last spring when the airport announced that it would revitalize its 
restaurants through competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport operators expect the revamped restaurant operation to dramatically 
increase the amount of revenue that flows to LAX. At present, food and beverage 
operations generate about $50 million in gross revenue, and operators pass 
through about $6 million in payments to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 LAX wants to create a blend of national brand names and local favorites that 
will provide "a real reflection of Los Angeles," said airport contracts manager 
Ramon Olivares. The airport, which earlier revamped its retail operations, will 
start to unveil its new list of restaurant and kiosk operators early next year, 
and travelers should notice a dramatic change by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Dallas-Fort Worth airport is sorting through a short list of 
150 companies that want to operate restaurants and shops at the Texas airport. 
In a hint of what's to come, one concessionaire has opened a retail court 
featuring the best of Sharper Image, Christian Dior and Timberland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some older airports won't easily lend themselves to increased retail 
operations. Pittsburgh's new terminal owes much of its success to its design -- 
passengers are funneled through its centrally located mall, an option that's 
typically not available to older airports. 
</P>
<P>
 And airports must tackle the thorny question of leasing costs before opting 
for street pricing. If lease rates are too high, product prices often follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airport rentals are coming down, but they're still three times what the 
normal mall retailer pays," said Gregg Paradies, vice president and co-owner of 
Atlanta-based the Paradies Shops, which operates the Dallas retail court as 
well as shops at John Wayne Airport and at Burbank airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it's possible to make the change, the mall-like approach can be a 
godsend for cash-strapped airport operators who collect fees from restaurants 
and retailers. "This is all new dollars being spent," said Lowry Davison, 
director of commercial development at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. 
"People have the money and they're willing to spend it, given the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 What is attracting retailers and restaurants to airports is that travelers 
generally have more money to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Host Marriott in Bethesda, Md., which operates in nearly 80 airports, reports 
that the average traveler spends about an hour in airports before and after 
flights. That average traveler's $65,000 annual income translates into more 
wealth than the average mall-goer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a captive audience in the true sense of the word," said Bruce Schroder, 
a vice president at Irvine-based Taco Bell, which operates restaurants and 
snack bars in about 40 airports. "And travelers tend to be higher-income people 
for whom price is not as much of an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 While McDonald's, Taco Bell and Burger King are increasingly common at 
airports, operators now are seasoning the restaurant mix with lesser-known, 
regional favorites. Boston's Logan Airport features Legal Seafoods, and Host 
Marriott has invited Wild Goose Ale House, a popular brew pub in the Northwest, 
to operate restaurants on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative Croissants' Epstein believes that bigger restaurant names will lose 
ground to smaller, more specialized companies that can offer "healthy foods at 
friendly prices." Creative Croissants now is focusing its expansion plans on 
airports; by the end of next year the company could have as many as 15 
storefronts at airports across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest wave in restaurant and retail development has debunked the "old 
theory that (travelers) will buy whatever it was you decided to put on the 
shelves," Paradies said. Travelers will always buy toothbrushes, newspapers, 
cigarettes and souvenirs, Paradies said. But, given the chance, they'll also 
buy much more. Sharper Image's airport shop at DFW in Dallas has sold a handful 
of massage chairs -- hefty pieces of furniture that retail for $2,895. 
</P>
<P>
 Charley Shin, a Columbus, Ohio, businessman who's eaten his fair share of 
really bad airport food, also views airports' retail areas as potentially 
lucrative opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Any initial doubts that Shin had about opening a Charley's Steakery in 
Pittsburgh's air mall disappeared after the restaurant blossomed into one of 
his 30-unit chain's top performers. Shin reports another plus: Airport 
locations are giving his chain "the high visibility and instant credibility" 
needed to expand into highly competitive markets, such as Southern California, 
where he operates just one restaurant, at Westminster Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new approach of multiple, brand-name retailers and local favorites is a 
far cry from the days when airport operators awarded contracts to a single 
large concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days it wasn't a bad idea to have one commissary take care of the 
whole airport," said Tarun Kapoor, a Cal Poly Pomona professor who studies the 
hospitality industry. "Having a single operator made it possible to make sure 
there's a bar in every part of the terminal, but it ignores what the public 
really wants now." 
</P>
<P>
 "Slowly," Kapoor said, "the institutional mind set of airport food service is 
giving way to something that's much more sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 American airports are now taking a page from their European counterparts, 
particularly English airfields "which are something of a department store," 
Lowry said. "They're so successful (in England) that the local populace 
actually goes to the airport to shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport operators in the United States don't expect to steal great numbers of 
shoppers from malls because airports typically aren't located in heavily 
populated neighborhoods and usually charge high fees for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 A good chunk of spending at airports goes for impulse purchases, a fact that's 
not lost on operators of high-priced sports memorabilia. The National Football 
League and the Professional Golf Assn. are opening sports-oriented airport 
shops that will cater to affluent male business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsbad-based Upper Deck Authenticated, the sports souvenir retailer, is 
counting on spontaneous purchases at a shop it opened a year ago in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the perfect place to be," said spokesman Camron Bussard. 
"Airports haven't been a venue for us in the past, but when you look at the 
amount of traffic it's a good opportunity, and we're looking at other 
locations." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the flurry of activity nationwide, croissants, Starbucks coffee and 
designer yogurt are the exception rather than the rule, particularly at smaller 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cafeteria line is still the most common approach," Kapoor said. "And then 
you've got the places . . . where they have the traditional hot dog and potato 
chips . . . what I call the cholesterol diet." Ascending Retail Revenue 
</P>
<P>

from its airport food and beverage service operators. The main vendors and the

BRITISH TOAST OPEN COMMERCE; EUROPE: DRASTICALLY LOWER LIQUOR TAXES IN FRANCE 
ARE DRAWING HORDES FROM ACROSS THE CHANNEL. TEN THOUSAND PUBS COULD CLOSE.

 The ferries sailing from England allow five people to travel with a car, but 
many passengers set their own limit at two to a car. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Any extra bodies would take up valuable space that could be filled on the 
return trip by cheap beer, wine and liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passengers are a liability," Bryan Brown said here as he and his brother 
Steve of Cambridge, England, stacked dozens of cases of Belgian beer into their 
station wagon. "That's the last thing we want is passengers. Next time, we'll 
bring the trailer." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two years after looser European Union rules allowed people to take all 
the goods they want across the borders of member nations, for personal 
consumption anyway, day trips to France have become a booze bonanza for Britons 
escaping higher taxes at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax on a pint of beer of 5% alcohol comes to the equivalent of about 6.4 cents 
in France, compared with 48 cents in Britain. Tax on wine is 50 times as high 
in Britain, at $1.62 a bottle, as in France, at 3.2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 With the winter holidays approaching, thousands of Britons are heading for 
France to stock up, and Britain's wine and beer merchants say they're being 
slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
 "A million pints a day are coming in," said Catherine Chenery, a spokeswoman 
for the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Assn. "If nothing is done, by the end of 
the decade, 10,000 pubs could close." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is technically no limit to the purchases an individual can 
make, the British government has devised guidelines that come to 120 bottles of 
wine, several hundred cans of beer and a few dozen bottles of spirits and 
fortified wine. At that quantity, no questions will be asked. 
</P>
<P>
 So Britain's imbibers often come out of French grocery stores with several 
full shopping carts per person and hoping their axles won't break on the way 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The ferries are full of passengers studying price lists from the wine and beer 
warehouses that have opened around Calais to cater to British shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the Pride of Bruges ferry, Ernest Lesbirel, from Wrexham, Wales, 
figured he would save about $160 buying wine for Christmas. He and his 
brother-in-law left their wives at home to keep plenty of room in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Park a car with British plates on a Calais boulevard, and a brochure will 
appear on the windshield within minutes. It may be about the only advertising 
in France that doesn't contain a word of French. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical handout promises "bargains" and "ample parking" and assures 
"credit cars and English money accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's biggest supermarket chain, Sainsbury PLC, has even gotten in on the 
action. Since customers weren't going to buy their booze at home, Sainsbury 
opened a wine and liquor store in Calais. 
</P>
<P>
 A bottle of Sainsbury's claret wine that costs $4.64 in Britain goes for about 
half that in Calais. Even English ale, brewed in England and exported to 
France, is cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Sainsbury won't discuss sales at the store or compare its markups in the two 
countries, but a spokesman said business is "much better than we imagined." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Britain, retailers say things are getting progressively worse. 
</P>
<P>
 When the European Union opened its borders in January, 1993, British beer 
companies predicted they would lose 6% of their retail sales to the French. Now 
they wish that was all they were losing. The total has grown to 15%, and beer 
dealers fear further losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine merchants are taking a similar hit. 
</P>
<P>
 About 17.6% of the total U.K. wine market is now coming into the country in 
private vehicles returning from continental Europe, according to the Wine and 
Spirit Assn. Each car now brings an average of 37.4 bottles of wine, up from 
26.3 bottles a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people making the journey keeps growing, a trend expected to 
continue as the Channel Tunnel offers even more opportunity for travel. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, as far as the liquor dealers are concerned, is lower taxes. But 
so far they've gotten no relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Treasury has acknowledged that it is losing millions as the 
day-trippers take their toll, but the government is in a Catch-22. Lower taxes 
might slow the one-way flow of wine and beer, but they would also bring in less 
revenue from people who would have bought their alcohol at home anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're on a hook, aren't they?" Lesbirel said. "They can't reduce the taxes 
because they'll have to put it on something else, and now, half the population 
of Britain is on a trip over to stock up."

SAVING GRACE; SALVAGE YARDS TREASURE-TROVES OF ARCHITECTURAL ANTIQUES AND 
ACCESSORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When John Frayer sets foot in a salvage yard, he feels like a kid in a candy 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing those stained glass windows, antique doors and decorative hardware 
makes me want to buy it all," said Frayer, whose passion for architectural 
antiques makes him roam local salvage yards every weekend. "It's like a 
treasure hunt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frayer's richest treasure chest is Scavenger's Paradise, a fancy salvage yard 
in North Hollywood. Stepping into the tile-roofed church turned salvage yard on 
Satsuma Avenue means taking a tour through Los Angeles' architectural past. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of panel doors, a choir loft full of antique lighting fixtures, 
fireplace mantels in brass or wood, claw-foot bathtubs, chandeliers and 
architectural gems such as a majestic pair of walnut columns fill almost 6,000 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Scavenger's Paradise is one of about a dozen salvage yards in the greater Los 
Angeles area that specializes in some form of architectural antiques. Scattered 
from Malibu to downtown Los Angeles to East L.A., they serve a diverse 
clientele ranging from homeowners to interior decorators and restaurant owners. 
While some look for old pieces to keep the style of a renovated building 
intact, others want to add a dose of nostalgia to a new home or commercial 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory of local salvage yards consist of just about everything from 
used sinks and hardware to highly decorative items such as ornate doors and 
antique fountains. The majority of raw materials come from 
about-to-be-demolished commercial and residential buildings such as hotels, 
offices, schools and private homes. Prices range from $2 for plumbing odds and 
ends to $10,000 for a pair of 4-foot-tall Art Deco lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 According to salvage yard owners, the market for architectural remnants has 
skyrocketed over the last 10 years. Rooted in the preservationist movement of 
the 1970s, the demand for those rare reminders of times long gone was boosted 
by the recycling wave that started in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, tight economic times and the trend to individualize homes 
have sent even more people to salvage yards in search for one-of-a-kind 
architectural antiques. "A house is like a mirror of your personality," Frayer 
said. "It reflects your likes and dislikes and gives you a chance to show 
creativity and imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-year-old former dancer has been a regular at salvage yards for many 
years. Among Frayer's most treasured finds are a gracious pair of Art Nouveau 
lamps and a dozen French-made terra-cotta tiles from the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Frayer's love for antique remnants has forced him to add on to his 1918 Laurel 
Canyon home over the years. Just a few months ago he finished a deck as the 
perfect stage for two salvaged turn-of-the-century lamp posts. Frayer's current 
project -- a sleeping house on top of a 28-foot-high waterfall in his back yard 
-- is a charming hodgepodge of Victorian wooden ornaments, cast-iron railings 
and corrugated tin from the 1940s. "Since I gave up dancing, I've made 
architectural salvage my creative outlet," said Frayer. "I'm the choreographer 
who puts castoffs in the spotlight again." 
</P>
<P>
 As a third-generation Hollywood resident, he feels the need to preserve 
history. "Within 15 minutes a wrecking ball can demolish an old building worth 
80 years of beauty," said Frayer, who always keeps tools and pickup truck ready 
for a short-notice rescue mission. "You don't find the same kind of magic in 
new things." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by salvage-decorated nightclubs such as the Magic Castle and Dan 
Akroyd's House of Blues, imaginative buyers like Frayer find news uses for 
recycled architectural items. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frayer's home, parts of a bowling alley came to new life as a kitchen 
countertop, and old-fashioned doors serve as wall paneling. A solid nickel 
curtain rod from murdered lawyer Stanford White's apartment was revived as door 
hardware. "Detailing is what excites me," Frayer said. "But it can take years 
to get the right hardware." Finding the correct hardware for antique doors and 
light fixtures has become less time consuming since Liz's Antique Hardware 
opened on south La Brea Avenue last year. Liz's specializes in mass-produced 
hardware for doors, windows, lightning and plumbing from the 1850s to 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paint and hardware are the most inexpensive ways to change the look of your 
house," said owner Liz Gordon, 37. "People come in here and are inspired just 
by the presentation of the hardware." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the some 350,000 pieces that adorn the store's 50-foot-long wall are 
chronologically organized from Victorian, Eastlake, Art Nouveau to Arts & 
Crafts and Art Deco styles. The counters below hold milk crates overflowing 
with knob spindles, porcelain cabinet knobs, keyhole covers, keys and casters. 
</P>
<P>
 Period bathroom fixtures such as wall sconces, towel bars, faucets, toilets 
and purple or white sinks with or without trimmings have a section of their 
own. Stacked on a shelf in the back, some 100 metal claw feet, once stable 
support for weighty bathtubs, wait for a second, third or even fourth life. 
</P>
<P>
 A set of hardware for an inner door sells for $35, a pedestal sink is priced 
at $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, a lot of time and effort went into making hardware," Gordon 
said. "If you want to buy that quality new today, it's much more expensive than 
an antique piece. And it doesn't have the look and the patina of old metal." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides looks and quality, the recession has sent more people to salvage 
yards. "When the economy gets tight, people start emphasizing do-it-yourself 
renovations," said Gordon, whose customers are equally split between private 
clients and professionals such as architects or set designers. 
</P>
<P>
 To stock her 3,500-square-foot store, Gordon roams flea markets and salvage 
yards from Los Angeles to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to selling fragments of yesterday, Gordon rents architectural 
highlights to studios for movies and commercials. Set designers come to her for 
authentic period bathtubs complete with original fixtures. A cast-iron roll-top 
bathtub with a brass faucet has already made numerous appearances on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon also acts as matchmaker for large quantities or missing pieces. For a 
$10 handling fee and a photograph of the desired item, Gordon can locate almost 
any piece of hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales jumped even higher after the Northridge earthquake. Some customers 
flocked to Liz's in search for lampshades to replace shattered ones. Others 
were on the lookout for stylish latches to prepare old cabinets for the next 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crisis or no crisis, people nowadays have a strong sense of reusing," said 
Gordon. "Recycling is not only a fashionable trend but the way of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 For self-declared salvage junkie Susan Mazer, recycling is only one facet of 
architectural salvage. "Shopping for antique items is a combination of reusing 
building materials, salvaging heritage and, in my case, bargain hunting," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 48-year-old massage therapist started remodeling her Hollywood Hills 
cottage last year, she wanted to keep renovation costs low without sacrificing 
the charm of her 1955 home. Friends recommended a trip to MRM Building 
Materials, a salvage yard in East Los Angeles. For $65 a piece, Mazer bought 
four ash doors from the 1920s. "They would cost about $250 each if you buy them 
new," said Mazer. "And the new ones don't even have the old Craftsman feel, the 
heavy wood and the nice look." 
</P>
<P>
 MRM actually seems to belong in a different time and a different world. With 
old-fashioned grace, owner Gloria Sperry guides customers through the corridors 
between piles of used bricks and old lumber on the one-acre lot. "I like the 
people who come in here," Sperry said. "I help out those who are poor and come 
by bus to get a used toilet for $30. And I consult those with a Rolls-Royce who 
look for an extravagant antique accent for their Beverly Hills villa." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers can find just about everything at MRM. Doors, the most numerous item 
at local salvage yards, occupy half a warehouse. Next to them, hundreds of 
wood-framed windows from an old school in El Monte are stocked by size. Stained 
glass, mostly shipped to California from England in the 1950s and 1960s, is 
carefully stored in dusty corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Used bricks, wrought iron and all kinds of oddball things like a 60-year-old 
iron press on shaky legs await their revival in the fenced-in yard. Parliament 
hinges from the 1920s for $3 each and rusty items that defy immediate 
identification overflow milk crates. Fifty-year-old Spanish Mission tiles, 
MRM's bestsellers for 75 cents a piece, pile up in the back. All of these great 
architectural leftovers are sold as-is to keep costs and prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep track of the almost opaque mass of things, Sperry relies on a 
computer. "Without the machine it would be impossible to know what we have and 
where it is," said Sperry. "It is a godsend for us and for our customers who 
quickly find what they want. They only have to find us first." 
</P>
<P>
 For many architectural antique buyers that has been a problem. Like most 
salvage yard owners, Sperry does little advertising and relies on word of mouth 
and the off-the-street crowd. "Advertisement is expensive and the profit margin 
is slim as it is," said Sperry. "But when people have finally found us, I 
always see happy faces when they carry home their piece of history."

HOT PROPERTY: KARATE CHAMP FALLS FOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME, the karate and kick-boxing champion-turned-star of such 
movies as this fall's "Timecop" sci-fi action-adventure, has purchased a 
Beverly Hills lot for $1.5 million. He plans to build a home there. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Damme is in Pittsburgh filming the movie "Sudden Death," to be released 
next year. His first PG-13 movie, "Street Fighter," based on a video game, is 
due to open in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor owns a house in the San Fernando Valley, a source said. He married 
his fourth wife, model Darcy La Pier, in February, and he has two children by 
his third wife, bodybuilder Gladys Portugues, from whom he was separated in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The lot he bought is on nearly an acre with a view of the city. It had been 
owned by Thomas Pollock, chairman of Universal Pictures, who bought it in 1991 
for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful lot," said an architect who was once asked to do some 
preliminary plans for the site. "It sits on a point, and there are some 
geological problems. So, a house can be built there, though with some 
difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be the first time that Van Damme overcame the odds. When he came 
to Hollywood from Belgium at the age of 22 to become an actor, he didn't speak 
English and he slept in a rented car. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the 33-year-old star, who called himself "The Muscles from Brussels" to 
promote his first, low-budget flicks, has been the lead in nearly a dozen 
movies, including several mainstream features, and he is said to command a 
salary of $8 million a film. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmy Award-winning actress MARIETTE HARTLEY and her husband, PATRICK BOYRIVEN, 
have put their Encino home of 15 years on the market at just under $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who have two nearly grown children, want to move to New York and 
keep a small place here so they can be bicoastal, said their listing agent, 
Cissy Wellman-Guydus of Jon Douglas Co.'s Bel-Air office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley, 54, was born in New York. Known for her film and TV roles as well as 
her stint as a CBS Morning Program host and her Polaroid ads with James Garner, 
Hartley is writing a book that she calls a "continuation" of her best-selling 
autobiography "Breaking the Silence." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyriven, a French producer/director, owns Pacific Wings Flight School in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Their house has four bedrooms plus maid's quarters in 4,800 square feet. Built 
in 1953 but recently updated, the home is on almost an acre with a tennis court 
and black-bottom pool. There are also three fireplaces and a meditation room in 
the home, originally listed at just under $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice condo where accused Hollywood madam HEIDI FLEISS had been living 
after her Beverly Hills home was sold last March has been listed at $399,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, on trial now in Superior Court for pandering and possession of cocaine 
for sale, was arrested in August with her father, Los Feliz pediatrician Paul 
Fleiss, on federal charges of tax evasion and money laundering. She was 
transferred in September from a federal detention center to a drug rehab center 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, who is scheduled to go on trial in January with Fleiss on the 
federal charges, owns the Venice condo. He also owned the Beverly Hills house, 
which was sold for just under its $1.8-million asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought the condo in March, 1992, for $105,000, and put considerable sums 
into renovations, according to public records. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit, a penthouse facing the ocean, has two bedrooms and a loft in about 
1,370 square feet. The condo, which also has two balconies, is in a 
gate-guarded project with a gym and pool. The 66-unit development was built in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Young and Paul Czako of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, have the 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood condo of NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON has been put on the market at 
$795,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The condo, which Nicole Simpson bought last January, was for sale in the 
$800,000 range when she was murdered. It was taken off of the market by her 
family. It is listed now with Pauline Rimp of John Aaroe & Associates, 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1991, the unit, a townhouse, has four bedrooms and three fireplaces 
in 3,400 square feet. It's also for lease at $5,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Film director and actor HENRY JAGLOM has purchased a 9,000-square-foot home on 
three acres in Santa Monica for just under $4 million, sources say. The asking 
price was about $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaglom was an actor on such TV shows as "Gidget" and "The Flying Nun" before 
he edited "Easy Rider" (1969) and became a director of such films as "Eating" 
(1990), which focuses on women's neuroses about food, and "Babyfever," about a 
woman who hears her biological clock ticking. "Babyfever" stars Jaglom's wife, 
actress Victoria Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaglom also distributes and finances his films through his Rainbow Film Co. in 
Hollywood. 10 Years Marked 
</P>
<P>
 The "Hot Property" column marks its 10th anniversary this week. The first 
celebrity lead item in the 1984 column was talk-show host Johnny Carson, with 
his purchase of a Malibu home at just under $9 million, still a record 
single-family home sale for the area.

APARTMENT LIFE: WHAT TO DO WHEN RENT INCREASES BEYOND LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I rent in Los Angeles and the owners of my building just increased 
the rent from $425 to $495, a $70 increase. When I called them to ask about it, 
I was told that there is no longer any rent control. When did rent control end 
in the City of Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Rent control is still in place in Los Angeles. Under the L.A. law, 
owners of rent-controlled buildings in the city are limited to annual rent 
increases of no more than 3%, unless they pay the gas or electric bill for a 
unit, in which case they are entitled to an added 1% for each utility. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3% increases are effective in Los Angeles until at least June 30, 1995, at 
which time they may change. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners also may be entitled to special increases for things such as 
capital improvements, like a new roof, but you would be notified of such 
increases and the reasons for them. 
</P>
<P>
 I would let the owner know that rent control is alive and well in the city of 
Los Angeles and that he is only allowed to increase the rent by 3%, $12.75, 
unless special circumstances prevail. Is Owner Responsible for Outside 
Lighting? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I rent an apartment in a 32-unit building in Glendale and I have a question 
for you. Are the owners responsible for outside lighting at an apartment 
building? I have been burglarized once and at that time there was no outside 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 They did provide lighting after the burglary, but now they refuse to replace 
the burned-out bulbs. They say it's too expensive and they are only responsible 
for inside lighting. I say they're wrong. What does the law say? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think I can shed some light on your problem, if not on the building. 
Although the law does not specifically require outside lighting at apartment 
buildings, many courts have determined that apartment owners can be liable if 
unsafe conditions of which they are aware are not corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Many courts have found that the absence of outside lighting of the building's 
common areas was a contributing factor to crimes committed at the properties. 
The owners who knew of those problems also have been found all or partially 
liable for the damages resulting from them. 
</P>
<P>
 You should inform the owners that it is in their best interest to provide 
outside lighting at the property. If a serious crime occurs there, they could 
be liable for major damages if a court determines that lack of lighting 
contributed to the crime. How to Get Deposit From Bankrupt Owner 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am having a problem getting my security deposit back from the owner of 
the Burbank apartment where I used to live. The owner said he was filing for 
bankruptcy and could not refund my deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 The day I moved out, the manager distributed court papers to all tenants. The 
papers are from the bank that foreclosed on the owner. They say the bank is not 
responsible for the deposits either. 
</P>
<P>
 I spoke with a bank representative who told me that the bank is not the new 
owner. I don't know who to bring to Small Claims Court to get my refund. Can 
you help? 
</P>
<P>
 A: While you could bring the former owner to court, even if a judge awarded 
you anything you may not be able to collect from him since he has filed 
bankruptcy. And, since you got copies of the bankruptcy papers, the security 
deposit debts probably already have been discharged by the bankruptcy court. 
Your best bet is to sue whoever holds title to the property now. That may or 
may not be the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to find out who has the title to the property, if you only have 
an address, is to go to one of the regional Los Angeles County Assessor's 
Offices and request ownership information based upon the address of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 If the assessor cannot find the property based upon the address you provide 
him, because the assessor's address for the property may not be the same as the 
mailing address (especially on corner properties), you will have to find the 
map book page and parcel number of the property in order to find out the 
ownership information. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it takes six to eight weeks after a change of ownership occurs for the 
new ownership information to get into the system. Rent Costs More With 
Additional Child 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I responded to an advertisement for a vacant apartment in Burbank. The rent 
was listed at $1,195 a month. Since I liked the location, I wanted to rent the 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when I expressed my interest in the apartment, the owner said the 
rent would be $1,250 because I have two children instead of one, like she 
thought. Is this legal? What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: According to real estate attorney Duane Hall, "Since there was no contract 
or agreement entered into at a monthly rent of $1,195, the landlord was not 
bound to rent it to you at that level, even though he had listed the rent at 
that level." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall also said that if the landlord's intention in raising the rent were to 
discourage you from renting the apartment because of the additional child, he 
could have had some exposure to liability for child discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, the landlord's motive here appears to be a willingness to 
rent to you regardless of the number of children you have and just to charge 
more for the extra person. The landlord appears to have acted legally. All you 
can do is rent the apartment at $1,250 or look elsewhere.

IN THE GARDEN: KEY TO SPRING WILDFLOWERS IS TO START THEM NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't be misled: Growing wildflowers is work, although many would call it the 
most rewarding kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard work if you're thinking of throwing seed on a vacant lot," 
according to Kevin Connelly, who has fought weeds for several years so 
wildflowers could grow on Wildflower Hill at the Theodore Payne Foundation in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, they're no harder than any other flower you might start 
from seed, if you're gardening in clean soil (weed free) and planting during 
the cool season." 
</P>
<P>
 Too many people wait until spring to plant. The time to plant is now, from 
late fall through early winter, according to Carol Bornstein, who oversees the 
annually planted wildflower meadow at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildflowers germinate with winter's rains, bloom in spring's cool sun, shrivel 
and set seed in summer, then die. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware that there are many wildflower wanna-bes, those annual flowers sold 
as wildflowers but native someplace else. They make up the bulk of the 
"wildflowers" in the mixes seen in many catalogues and even sold by the can at 
some nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Red flax, red European field poppies, blue bachelors buttons, bright yellow 
coreopsis and similar annual flowers are pretty garden plants and they're on 
the same winter-spring cycle, but they're not California wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The real wildflowers are dainty little things. What they lack in size, they 
make up for in numbers of flowers when they blanket our hills and high desert 
in spring. 
</P>
<P>
 With a lot of work, you can grow a meadow of your own, or tuck them here and 
there in the garden -- much less work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in my crowded city garden, I found room last fall for wildflowers, sowing 
some clarkias and nemophilas among the pansies and tall bearded iris. The small 
nemophilas foamed between the fuller Antique Shades pansies and the clarkias 
filled that inevitable empty space between iris clumps. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried two clarkias (from Thompson & Morgan, P.O. Box 1308, Jackson, N.J. 
08527-0308), the truly wild Clarkia amoena and a ruffly "improved" strain 
called Royal Bouquet, the pink and coral blooms softly complementing the blue 
iris. 
</P>
<P>
 The nemophilas weren't the more common baby-blue-eyes, but a subspecies they 
call Pennie Black with small, soot-colored petals surrounded by a crisp white 
edge, and the even tinier Snowstorm that has white flowers speckled like a 
bird's egg. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have bigger plans and want to try growing a miniature meadow, here are 
some nearly sure-fire choices suggested by Bornstein, Connelly and Bart O'Brien 
from Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont, beginning with the first to 
bloom in late winter and ending with the clarkia called "farewell-to-spring:" 
</P>
<P>
 Baby-blue-eyes -- Nemophila menziesii is short and truly blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupinus nanus -- also short and blue and bountiful at the bottom of the 
Grapevine. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadow foam -- Limnanthes douglasii is short and spreading with yellow 
flowers. A vernal pool plant, it needs a little extra irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 California poppy -- 18 inches tall and nearly the definition of orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarkia unguiculata -- two feet tall with spidery orchid flowers. Particularly 
long-lasting and tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Phacelia tanacetifolia -- two to three feet tall with lavender blue flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 California bluebell -- Phacelia campanularia is superb inland, about a foot 
tall, with gentian blue flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Globe gilia -- Gilia capitata grows a foot tall with round blue flower heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Tidytips -- Layia platyglossa is a foot tall with yellow flowers inside a 
white edging. 
</P>
<P>
 Chia -- Salvia columbariae is also a foot tall with deep, deep purple flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo lupin -- L. succulentus is two feet tall, purplish-blue and commonly 
seen on road cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Spider lupin -- L. benthamii is also two feet tall but more delicate and 
bluer. 
</P>
<P>
 Linanthus grandiflora -- grows eight inches tall, white or pale pink. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarkia amoena -- a foot-and-a-half tall, soft lilac or pink. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many more genuine wildflowers that can be grown and most are 
described in Connelly's "Gardener's Guide to California Wildflowers" ($12.95) 
published by, and available at, the Theodore Payne Foundation in Sun Valley. 
For information, call (818) 768-1802. 
</P>
<P>
 The Payne Foundation is also a source of seeds and they sell several 
ready-made mixes for special situations (including shade). They have a 
descriptive seed list, available for $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of true wildflowers, used by the Santa Barbara Botanic garden, 
is Larner Seeds, P.O. Box 407, Bolinas, Calif. 94924, (415) 868-9407. A 
catalogue is available. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, Connelly also suggests mixes that work best in certain locals 
(such as the beach), beginning with the most basic California meadow mix, good 
anywhere, of yellow, orange and blue -- tidytips, poppies and lupin -- that 
will make your garden look like a California plein-air painting. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to learn about the wildflower wanna-bes, "How to Grow the 
Wildflowers," by Eric Johnson and Scott Millard (Ironwood Press, Tucson; 
$14.95) lists and illustrates many true wildflowers that grow from California 
to Texas, plus the pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
 To grow any plant called a wildflower, you must be prepared to battle weeds, 
which can overwhelm most kinds, and birds, which relish the seeds and seedings. 
The easiest place is a relatively weed-free garden bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, wait until weeds sprout after the first rains, gently hoe them out, 
disturbing the soil as little as possible so as not to expose more weed seeds, 
and then sow the wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart O'Brien suggests not preparing the soil too much. Barely cover the seed 
and protect from birds and snails. At Rancho Santa Ana, they surround the 
seeded areas with low chicken wire and cover the top with bird netting. They 
leave it on until seedlings are well established. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, do what Carol Bornstein suggests: "sow more than you think you'll need." 
</P>
<P>
 If we have a rainy fall and winter, that may be all the water the plants 
require to germinate and grow; otherwise keep seeds moist until they sprout, 
then water when soil drys. If you want, you can also start seed in flats and 
transplant when small. The Santa Barbara Botanic Garden will be selling 
sprouted wildflower mixes by the flat this January at their garden shop. That 
should take most of the work out of wildflowers, but also some of the fun. More

YOUR MORTGAGE; HOW TO AVOID PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIAN HYMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How can I avoid private mortgage insurance? 
</P>
<P>
 Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is required by most conventional lenders when 
the borrower makes a cash down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 PMI protects the lender in the event that the borrower stops making payments 
on the loan. PMI is usually paid for by the borrower. A separate approval 
process is required to get a borrower approved for PMI. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of PMI varies depending on the PMI company, the amount of the cash 
down payment and the type of the loan. PMI for an adjustable-rate mortgage 
(ARM) will cost more than it will for a fixed-rate loan. The more cash you put 
down, the lower will be the cost of the PMI premium. Usually lenders require 
that the borrower pay the entire first year's PMI premium in advance at 
closing, which can add significantly to your closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several ways to avoid PMI. One is to ask the seller to carry back a 
second mortgage. Lenders vary on how much they require a seller to carry for 
you to avoid PMI. Some won't require PMI if you put 10% down and the sellers 
carry a second loan for 10% of the purchase price. Other lenders (most Freddie 
Mac and Fannie Mae lenders) require that the seller carry a 15% second if the 
borrower puts 10% down (or the seller can carry a 10% second if the borrower 
puts 15% down). 
</P>
<P>
 If a seller-carry back is not possible, you may be able to find a lender 
who'll loan you a second mortgage, but don't expect to find a competitive 
interest rate on such a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option is to ask your parents give you money to apply toward your down 
payment. Or, your employer, or a relative, may be willing to make you a loan 
(either a loan that's secured against the property or an unsecured, personal 
loan). 
</P>
<P>
 Many portfolio lenders don't require PMI when the borrower puts less than 20% 
down. These lenders self-insure for PMI. Their loans usually have a higher 
interest rate than you'll find on a loan that requires separate PMI. 
</P>
<P>
 There are pros and cons to loans with PMI built into the interest rate. On the 
positive side, a separate PMI approval process is not required which saves time 
and eliminates the risk of being turned done by the PMI underwriter. And since 
the cost of PMI is built into the interest rate, it's tax deductible. But, when 
the cost of PMI is built into the interest rate, there's no possibility for 
canceling PMI in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: Most lenders will allow you to cancel PMI under certain 
conditions. Some lenders require the borrower to have paid on the loan for 2 to 
5 years before they'll agree to cancel PMI. Others have no time requirement, 
but they require that the LTV (loan-to-value ratio) be 80% or less. In this 
case, an appraisal is required to substantiate the current value of the 
property. Lenders also require a good mortgage payment history (that is, no 
late payments) before they'll agree to drop PMI. Find out before you close your 
home purchase what the lender will require for you to cancel PMI. 
</P>
<P>
 When you think you meet those conditions, contact the loan servicing 
department and find out how to make a formal request to drop PMI. Don't contact 
the PMI company. The decision to cancel PMI is made by the lender, not by the 
PMI company.

CASH CRUNCH MEANS TIGERS FACE STARVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventy-three rare Siberian tigers saved from slaughter by Chinese law face 
starvation because the breeders who raised them for their bones can't afford to 
feed them. 
</P>
<P>
 China recently began enforcing a ban on slaughtering the species that has 
saved the 73 tigers from slaughter but not from starvation at the China Feline 
Captive Breeding Center in Mudanjiang in Manchuria in northeastern China. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-funded center was originally established to raise the big cats 
for their bones, used in traditional Chinese medicines. The center by law 
cannot sell the animals, which devour at least three or four cattle a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But without more funds, the center will have to shut down by the end of the 
year, the newspaper said.

 Both sides in the nation's closest House race have asked the state Supreme 
Court to review the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) and Republican challenger Edward W. Munster filed 
separate motions Friday, each maintaining that he had lost votes in a recount, 
which left Gejdenson ahead by four votes out of nearly 160,000 cast in the 2nd 
District. The high court has until Dec. 19 to rule.

CHURCHES THAT FOUGHT 187 NOW SOUL-SEARCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Only days after the passage of Proposition 187, Dr. Samuel Scheibler's tiny 
congregation moved quickly to help children who may one day be affected by the 
controversial initiative that prohibits education, social services and all but 
emergency health care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Albans, a 70-member ethnically mixed Anglican church in Brea, began to 
organize a tutorial program, anticipating that undocumented immigrant children 
may ultimately be kicked out of school under provisions of the sweeping 
initiative overwhelmingly approved by voters Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take the position that the people of California have the right to pass 
ballot initiatives, and we don't dispute the fact that illegal immigrants are, 
after all, illegal," Scheibler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But children brought over the border are victims of their circumstances. . . 
. We wanted to try to alleviate the problems that might result" from the 
proposition's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation may be the first in Orange County to lay the groundwork for 
such a program, but other members of the clergy, many of whom openly criticized 
the initiative, are considering ways to respond to its passage and wondering 
why their words of opposition from the pulpit had so little apparent impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is a troubling one to the priests, ministers, nuns and rabbis who 
fought against 187, convinced that its aim of denying most public benefits to 
illegal immigrants constituted not only a political issue but a moral one. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite opposition from every major religious denomination in California -- 
and grass-roots efforts by the clergy to rally their congregants against it -- 
the statewide ballot measure passed by a margin of 59% to 41%. In Orange 
County, voters favored it by 67% to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with that result, several clergy members said they could not help but 
wonder whether religious leaders are no longer able to sway their flocks on 
such thorny political and ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Friday of Catholic clergy from parishes across Orange County, 
several priests asked whether "we (have) lost our moral power," said Father 
John Lenihan, pastor of St. Boniface Catholic Church in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, answered Msgr. Jaime Soto, vicar for the Hispanic community of the 
Diocese of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some priests say people chose not to listen to us (about Proposition 187), 
but others ask what would have happened if we had said nothing," Soto said. "I 
think we did have an impact, even if it was to make some voters very angry at 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, for many people, we were not successful in helping them 
understand the moral and social consequences of this proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 The election result signaled "an alarming trend," in the Catholic Church, 
which already has "a shepherd-flock gap" between the attitudes of lay Catholics 
and their bishops' strict stands against legalized abortion and the death 
penalty, wrote editor Tod Tamberg in a post-election issue of the Tidings, the 
newspaper of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Times exit polling, 69% of Protestant voters cast ballots for 
Proposition 187, despite public opposition expressed by United Methodist, 
Episcopal, Presbyterian and other mainline church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics, who make up the state's largest denomination, opposed it by a 
narrow 51% to 49%. But non-Latino white Catholics supported the measure 58% to 
42%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Gary Collins, pastor of St. Mark's Presbyterian Church in Newport 
Beach, said members of his church who disagreed with his opposition to 
Proposition 187 often asked him how he could support those who broke the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to explain that the church looks at the law, but also at a second 
level as well," said Collins, whose 300-member church is considered one of 
Orange County's more progressive congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said he finds it difficult to gauge the effect of the clergy's 
opposition to the initiative; no polls, for example, asked voters both their 
views on Proposition 187 and whether they belonged to congregations whose 
pastors actively opposed it. But he said he believed it would have passed by a 
greater majority if the clergy had not spoken out against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, the fact that the measure was approved and by such a large 
margin may be "another sign that the church doesn't have the great moral power" 
over its members that it once did. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenihan, whose 7,000-member Catholic church is predominantly Latino but 
includes a number of white and Vietnamese American families, said churchgoers 
may have felt justified in disregarding their pastors' views because the issue 
was not as clear as other recent political questions on which the clergy has 
taken a stand, including abortion and euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is we didn't have quite the same clear moral imperative in 
this one," Lenihan said. "For many, I think the issue was blurred by the notion 
that these people were here illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Mary's, a Catholic church in Fullerton, Father Richard C. Kennedy said 
many of his parishioners have been silent on the issue of Proposition 187 since 
its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it just reveals that people will vote for what they think and not 
listen to the church for guidance. This is something serious and complex and 
I'm very much saddened by it, but things will go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheibler, whose tiny church borrows the facilities of a Congregational church 
for its weekly services, said his parishioners came up with the idea for a 
tutoring program within days of the election, even though it remains unclear 
how much of the so-called Save Our State initiative will actually be 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the church program, which will be called Innocentia -- a reference to 
the biblical passage in which King Herod put the children of Bethlehem to death 
-- six bilingual volunteers would tutor children in reading, math, science and 
history, Scheibler said. The church is still searching for a facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly hoping we never need the Innocentia program, but we want to 
be ready," he said. "We just want to be active in helping any children who may 
need this at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto said the Catholic Diocese is also studying whether its network of parish 
homework centers might need to be expanded in the wake of the initiative's 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
 More generally, Soto said, the church leadership here is pondering what 
actions to take. For the immediate future, though, "we will continue, 
particularly now as we approach the holiday season, to preach and practice the 
good news that we are all God's children and we are all brothers and sisters of 
one another," he said. "As old as the message of Christmas is, people still 
need to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And maybe now even more than before."

MARSHALL HIGH UPSETS TAFT IN ACADEMIC SUPER QUIZ; EDUCATION: RETURNING CHAMPION 
IS THIRD AFTER EL CAMINO REAL IN 14TH-ANNUAL DISTRICTWIDE CONTEST. OVERALL 
WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT NOV. 29 BANQUET. 
</P>

<P>
 Only a few miles from the Rose Bowl, and down the street from the USC campus, 
another heated school rivalry was roiling Saturday evening at the Los Angeles 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 After 11 hours of brain-wrenching competition, Marshall High School upset 
returning city, state and national champion Taft High in the Super Quiz event 
of the Los Angeles Unified Academic Decathlon, finishing ahead of 54 teams from 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficial results placed Woodland Hills' Taft third, after Marshall High of 
Los Feliz and second-place El Camino Real High, also of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz, a supercharged, high school version of "Jeopardy," was the 
culmination of a daylong battery of tests, essays and speech contests. This 
year, students answered three sets of 15 questions on biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 A Super Quiz victory almost always indicates a strong overall showing, but it 
is an uncertain indicator of who will ultimately take first place in the 
decathlon. In the 13-year history of the L.A. school district decathlon, 11 
Super Quiz winners have gone on to finish in the top three, but only six have 
been named champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the results of the Super Quiz were released immediately, the 1994 
district champions will not be announced until a Nov. 29 awards banquet. In 
March, the team will go on to compete in a statewide decathlon in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Super Quiz, Marshall scored 88 out of 90 possible points, which means 
four of the nine team members had perfect scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students studied hard and it showed," Marshall coach Phil Chase said. 
"Finishing first in the Super Quiz is a good indicator of where you're going to 
end up. I think it's safe to say that we're going to be in the top three." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited, but we'll have to wait until (the banquet) for the results," 
said James Evrard, one of the Marshall team members who got a perfect score. 
"We were prepared for harder questions . . . but winning was still great." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft coach Arthur Berchin said his team, which finished five points behind 
Marshall, would be challenging two of the Super Quiz questions because they 
were poorly worded and may have had two correct answers. Even if their 
challenge prevails, it will have little result on the official outcome of the 
Super Quiz, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall coach Chase said that he too thought that the questions were 
ambiguous, but said they were included in study guides provided by the national 
offices of the academic decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz began with a flourish, the teams marching in buoyantly to the 
"Olympic March," performed by the Roosevelt High School band. Students flashed 
big smiles and threw thumbs-up signs to the wildly cheering audience of about 
1,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Super Quiz began, the crowd hushed to hear KTLA news anchor Larry 
McCormick read the first question, which seemed oddly topical given the 
nation's fixation with the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the techniques of molecular biology in forensic science used to 
exonerate innocent crime suspects. . . ," McCormick asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After a regulated seven-second pause, during which each contestant tried to 
mark the correct answer from a list of five choices, many competitors threw up 
their arms in triumph when McCormick intoned the correct answer: "DNA 
fingerprinting." 
</P>
<P>
 After the first round of 15 questions, El Camino Real held a one-point lead 
over Taft, University and Marshall. But when second round results were 
displayed, Taft and University had fallen farther behind and the scene was set 
for a battle between Marshall and El Camino Real, which then trailed by only 
two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like we're in the fourth quarter trying to run out the clock!" 
shouted Chuck Merman, Marshall's athletic director, to a group of anxious 
parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the quiz score was tallied, indicating a perfect performance in the 
final round, many in the audience -- including two rows of uniformed 
cheerleaders from the Los Feliz school -- broke out in cheers of, "Marshall! 
Marshall! Marshall!" 
</P>
<P>
 And while Marshall, El Camino Real, Taft and other high-ranking schools looked 
forward to the awards banquet, students from less successful schools took pride 
in their individual accomplishments.  
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax High team member Thomas Arnold elatedly ran to a distant bank of 
telephones to call his parents. "I got 14 out of 15 on the Super Quiz," he 
said, smiling broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Kleven came to the Convention Center to watch his son Doug compete for 
Marshall. "It's very satisfying just to know that Doug's a participant," Kleven 
said, as he watched the teams vie for the title. "He participates in 
cross-country and other sports but this is a lot more meaningful. This is 
something that will last him the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County high schools held a separate decathlon competition Saturday 
in which Diamond Bar High School walked off with Super Quiz honors. In second 
place was Nogales High School, from the Rowland Heights Unified School 
District, and in third place was South High School from Torrance.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: FLEISS TRIAL YIELDS COLORFUL CAST, BUT NO BOMBSHELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Just down the hall from the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, the other trial 
began last week -- the pandering trial of accused Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These courtroom proceedings were anticipated for more than a year as the 
steamy legal event that might burst open bedroom doors of Tinseltown 
executives, the men said to be in Fleiss' "black book." It has not gone that 
way; events have unfolded with subdued fanfare and no bombshells.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the week had a distinctly lascivious texture: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In arranging to have four young women come to a lavish Beverly Hills hotel 
suite, where Fleiss and several of her employees were arrested in a police 
sting operation, undercover Detective Sammy Lee told Fleiss he was looking for 
a strictly sexual event to celebrate a deal with business associates, according 
to surveillance tapes played in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically nothing bizarre," he said. "I don't want to see a llama coming 
through the house." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no. Nothing bizarre," Fleiss said. "And you know some guys like two 
girls to be together."  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, can that be arranged?" Lee asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that's a normal man thing," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned by Fleiss' attorney, Anthony Brooklier, Lee explained that to 
convince Fleiss that he was a high-roller, he drove a Ferrari, and casually 
dropped the fact that he flew first-class and stayed in suites at luxurious 
hotels. The guise was crucial because he wanted to be taken seriously as a man 
who could spend thousands of dollars for a prostitute, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't engage in this deception, none of (the entertainment with 
prostitutes) ever happens, correct?" Brooklier asked, hammering on the 
defense's main theme that police unfairly targeted and entrapped Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would not have happened if I was the Maytag repairman," the detective 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to show support for Fleiss, Norma Jean Almodovar, a former Los Angeles 
Police Department civilian traffic controller arrested for pandering a decade 
ago, has attended most of the proceedings. Almodovar readily handed out her 
business card, which shows her in a very revealing dress and notes that she is 
author of the book "Cop to Call Girl."  
</P>
<P>
 When one of the court deputies asked her to autograph his copy of the book, 
she signed her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she kissed the page, leaving a big, red lipstick mark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mayflower Madam Sydney Biddle Barrows appeared on Day 2 of the Fleiss trial, 
and said she intends to stay to the bitter end. Barrows, a member of a socially 
prominent family whose roots hail to Plymouth Rock, was busted a decade ago in 
New York on charges similar to the ones Fleiss faces. At the time of Barrows' 
arrest, newspapers trumpeted headlines such as "A Pilgrim's Progress." She and 
her mother were promptly kicked out of the New York Social Register. 
</P>
<P>
 After her arrest, Barrows told one reporter that she had become a madam 
because she wanted to earn good money and did not have a business degree. 
Barrows speculated that Fleiss, 28, a high school dropout, may have been 
similarly motivated.  
</P>
<P>
 The ex-Mayflower Madam is currently working on a book, something about "how to 
keep your man happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barrows, who recently married: "I'm on the other side now."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Retail Update: In the days since the trial began, business has been brisk at 
Fleiss' Pasadena-based store, Heidi Wear, according to a saleswoman who goes by 
the name Squirrel. "The stuff is moving like hot cakes," she said, adding that 
Fleiss manages to stop by after her days in court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard on the row of courtroom seats occupied by the press: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm with the Daily Express."  
</P>
<P>
 "Is that a daily or a weekly?"

THE PLOT THICKENS; GUMSHOES HELP MYSTERY WRITERS KEEP TRACK OF CRIME'S 
COMPLEXITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that DNA has joined OD and DOA as part of the MO of homicide detectives, 
mystery writers have a whole new set of ABCs to keep track of. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is why 32 of them are huddling this weekend with murder investigators, 
prosecutors and forensic pathologists above a candy store in Universal City in 
hopes of learning the lingo of law enforcement, 1990s-style. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime writers want their future novels and screenplay mysteries to read 
more like coverage of the O.J. Simpson case than Mickey Spillane. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Simpson case could represent something of a turning point in 
crime writing, according to Barry Fisher, director of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department crime lab and organizer of the two-day crime-writing 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal investigative procedures will be on trial along with Simpson. And 
television viewers and newspaper readers will experience it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mystery writers will have a tougher time winging it after this," warned 
Fisher, 50, of Chatsworth. "In the past, a lot of criminal investigative 
procedures have been glossed over by writers." 
</P>
<P>
 For openers, Fisher said, he and others involved in homicide investigations 
should be called "criminalists." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to say 'criminologist.' That's a dead giveaway that you don't 
know the jargon. I saw the word used this morning in the L.A. Times. 
Criminologists deal with the social sciences. I don't want to read any of your 
stuff and catch that." 
</P>
<P>
 The writers paid $145 each to attend the 12-hour seminar, conducted as a UCLA 
extension course. Along with Fisher, lecturers included sheriff's homicide 
Detective Sgt. Stanley White, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marissa Batt and Dr. Eva 
Heuser, a deputy coroner. It will conclude today with an afternoon tour of the 
Sheriff's Department crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants included published novelists as well as fledgling authors and 
screenplay writers -- engineers, legal secretaries and a bank examiner. Two 
editors from a chain of Los Angeles-area weekly newspapers were also there. "We 
report a lot of crime news," explained one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone scribbled furiously as White offered an irreverent, back-room view of 
police work. And they laughed when he related that one well-known mystery 
writer spends so much time hanging out in the sheriff's Homicide Bureau looking 
for material that detectives feel "he's bleeding us dry." 
</P>
<P>
 The writers peppered Fisher with questions about DNA procedures and the 
increasing impact that scientific evidence is playing in murder investigations. 
He explained that a national databank containing some criminals' DNA 
characteristics may be coming soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fisher warned that television watchers will find the Simpson trial filled 
with "some of the most boring, arcane testimony you'll ever come across. It 
isn't going to be highly riveting like 'L.A. Law' -- you'll need a medical book 
at your side." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the writers indicated that such a book might be valuable to have at 
their side when they sit down to start hammering out their next screenplay or 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Simpson case shows there's really a lot of public interest in detail," 
said Debbie Clark, a Los Angeles real estate lawyer who has quit her job to 
write a murder mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Bornstein, a securities company secretary from Santa Monica who is 
also writing a murder mystery, said readers are coming to expect authors to be 
exact when they are describing police procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come with a lot of questions. Like, is there an international computer 
network for fingerprints?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA extension spokesman John Watson said interest has been so high in 
Fisher's "Investigative Techniques for Crime Writers" lectures that a six-night 
version is planned for January.  
</P>
<P>
 As for Fisher, he cautioned the writers not to get too caught up in minutiae. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a lousy story, a crummy plot, what I'm telling you about DNA and 
such won't help." After all, he said, a poorly written murder mystery is a 
crime.

TEMPEST IN A STEWPOT OVER CLAMOR TO FREE SPIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There were police, a small band of indomitable supporters, and of course, 
several news crews. But Spike, the focus of it all, was pulling the usual 
celebrity stunt. Hidden by his handlers, he was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 One could only peer at the wooden barricade in the lobby of Gladstone's 4 Fish 
restaurant and guess at what was going on in his spiny head. Was he yearning 
for the frigid bottom of the North Atlantic, or was he just as happy to have 
calamari-tipped chopsticks slipped into his claws a few hundred feet from the 
Pacific? 
</P>
<P>
 Only Spike knows for sure. But there is no shortage of people willing to speak 
for the 12 1/2-pound New England lobster, whose age is well into the 
doubledigits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Free Spike," demanded the banner Doug Stoll held aloft Saturday afternoon in 
front of the Pacific Palisades restaurant as he and a dozen other lobster 
liberationists protested the venerable crustacean's tank-bound fate as 
Gladstone's new mascot. Saying that an airline has offered to give Spike a free 
return ticket to New England, the group wants him shipped home for release in 
the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Stoll pointed out, if Spike stays at Gladstone's, it will be a 
long, zoo-like existence in a place dedicated to the consumption of Spike's 
brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people are going to salivate over him instead of sympathizing," said 
Stoll, a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a national 
group that has been involved with several other lobster-release efforts. "The 
natural habitat, in our view, has got to be better than the captive habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 Gladstone's managers, who got Spike from one of their lobster suppliers about 
six weeks ago, beg to differ. Originally, they had planned to raffle him off as 
part of their October lobster fest. But enough customers and staff took a 
liking to the hefty Homarus americanus to win him a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of boiling Spike, they called the New England Aquarium in Boston for 
tips on how to keep him alive. They gave him some rocks, a supply of seafood 
and his own dark water tank in the lobby. They also named a drink after him: 
"Spike's Cove," a concoction of vodka, cranberry juice and lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we're treating him very ethically," said Kathryn Koenigsberg, 
Gladstone's assistant general manager. "We're feeding him. We're taking care of 
him as we would a pet." 
</P>
<P>
 As for that ticket home, she said, marine experts have indicated that more 
traveling could be worse for Spike than staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 Spike, meanwhile, was secreted behind a barricade Saturday. The staff did not 
want to take any chances that activists would whisk him away. A few police 
officers also stood in the parking lot, keeping an eye on the protesters -- who 
showed no lobsternaping intentions whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Gladstone's patrons streamed into the 700-seat restaurant, 
oblivious to the notion of Spike rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, b.s.," was David Sears' response as he headed for the entrance. "When are 
they going to cook it?"

SHOCK WAVE RIPS THROUGH COMPTON POLITICS; PROBE: PATRICIA MOORE'S ADMISSION OF 
EXTORTION STIRS SPECULATION THAT SHE WILL BE AIDING THE INVESTIGATION OF A 
FORMER MAYOR AND OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As a rising political star, Patricia Moore never shied away from the camera. 
But there is one incident caught on video that the outspoken former Compton 
city councilwoman never wanted publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 The grainy footage shows Moore receiving a white envelope from a man she 
thought was a financier trying to build a waste-to-energy plant in Compton. 
Instead, he was an undercover FBI agent. And the envelope contained cash Moore 
accepted to back the project, according to sources familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 For months after being shown the video by federal prosecutors in March -- the 
same day that word of a sweeping investigation of alleged political corruption 
in Compton was reported -- Moore never flinched from proclaiming her innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear on the Bible, I never accepted any money from anyone," she said 
recently, during one of the few times she spoke publicly about the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a confession that stunned her political friends and foes alike, the 
woman who gained national prominence as an advocate of African American causes 
admitted last week that she had extorted $9,100 from the company that wanted to 
build the incinerator. Moore, 46, pleaded guilty to a single count of felony 
extortion. She could receive up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
Moore also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to file a federal 
tax return for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Her surprise plea sent shock waves through Compton's close-knit political 
community, already reeling from the indictment in August of Rep. Walter R. 
Tucker III (D-Compton). Tucker is accused of accepting $30,000 in bribes and 
demanding another $250,000 to support the trash project while serving as mayor 
in 1991 and 1992. He has proclaimed his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's admission fueled speculation that she will be a star witness for the 
prosecution when Tucker goes to trial in February and that she also may be 
providing evidence against others in the ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are running scared," one Compton political insider said. "They're 
just waiting for the next shoe to drop." 
</P>
<P>
 Her guilty plea is the low point in a colorful and often turbulent life in 
which the daughter of migrant laborers has risen from picking fruit to elective 
office and endured two failed marriages and four consecutive political losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore had an uncanny ability to command the spotlight during a series of 
racially charged episodes, from the fatal shooting of a black teen-ager by a 
Korean American grocer to the police beating of Rodney G. King, once referring 
to the Los Angeles riots as "pay-back time." 
</P>
<P>
 Now unemployed, Moore has for months been living as a virtual recluse, even 
disguising her voice as that of a little girl to fend off unwanted visitors at 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to live a quiet life," she said last summer, peering from behind 
her door. "I want to be a normal person with a real life without people placing 
me in a glass house." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her problems, Moore had until recently remained outwardly confident 
about her future, insisting that the investigation represented "another chapter 
in my life," and hinting that the public had not seen the last of Patricia 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 But that has all changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made a mistake," said Paul Potter, her attorney. "Lots of people do. I 
just hope that when everything is said and done, people will remember the 
positive things." 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, Moore passed her summers in the dusty Central Valley, picking 
watermelons, plums and grapes with her family. "I couldn't sleep at night 
because we would sleep on those mattresses that were full of bedbugs, and they 
would bite us," she once recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembered wishing she were in the Memorial Day and Fourth of July parades 
that passed by while she and her siblings were in the fields. She finally got 
her chance at Corcoran High, near Fresno, where she became the school's first 
African American majorette. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Moore moved to Los Angeles, went to business school and 
worked at the Bank of America. She married a former Compton police officer, 
raised three children and has two grandchildren. The marriage broke up 15 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a secret -- and disastrous -- second marriage at South Lake Tahoe on 
Halloween, 1991, to a man barely half her age whom she believed owned his own 
entertainment company and an expensive home in the Hollywood Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore annulled the marriage to Leroy Guillory, citing fraud, court documents 
show. He is in prison serving a 12-year sentence for kidnaping a man at 
gunpoint in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Her political career has also had its ups and downs. But one thing has 
remained constant: her outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
 A onetime aide to former congressman Mervyn M. Dymally, Moore made her first 
campaign for public office in 1981 in an unsuccessful bid for Compton mayor. 
Her political fortunes changed in 1989, when she gained attention organizing 
marches for gun control after a 2-year-old was killed in a drive-by shooting. 
The publicity helped get her elected to the City Council that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fiery pronouncements landed her appearances twice on "Nightline" and once 
on the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour," and also made her a lightning rod for 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 After a judge sentenced grocer Soon Ja Du to five years probation in 1991 for 
killing 15-year-old Latasha Harlins, Moore told a phalanx of reporters, 
photographers and television cameras, "There is no justice for African 
Americans in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she was sharply criticized when she spoke at the funeral of a slain 
Compton police officer and denounced the four Los Angeles police officers who 
beat King.  
</P>
<P>
 While attracting attention, such outspokenness did little to propel her 
political career. She lost four consecutive elections, twice failing to become 
Compton's mayor and twice losing bids for the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before she was elected to the City Council in 1989, Moore was a community 
activist. She played a pivotal role in 1984 in successfully leading public 
opposition to a proposal to build a trash-to-energy plant in Compton, saying 
that the project would be built too close to residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 That same project, revived five years later when Moore was on the City 
Council, led to the federal investigation and Moore's trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley businessman John Macardican sparked the investigation in 
late 1989 by complaining to the FBI that he was being solicited for bribes by 
Compton officials as the price for supporting the $200-million project.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that Moore became friends with a key undercover operative in the 
investigation who posed as an executive of Macardican's company. 
</P>
<P>
 These sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the executive, 
who called himself Stan Bailey, made several overtures to Compton officials, 
offering cash in return for their support for Macardican's project. 
</P>
<P>
 By early 1991, Moore and Bailey were frequently seen together in public. He 
showered her with gifts of long-stemmed red roses and boxes of chocolate. They 
took two trips to Mexico together. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the (politicians) were skeptical of (Bailey) at first," one Compton 
activist said. "But after he took up with Pat, they relaxed their guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore has said that her relationship with Bailey was platonic, and that they 
had a falling out after he failed to make good on a promise to secure financial 
help for her unsuccessful 1991 mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 No one suspected Bailey's alleged role in the investigation -- least of all 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did she apparently become suspicious over an incident in December, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 While driving in Long Beach, she noticed two men in a car behind her as she 
drove her green Rolls-Royce -- with its personalized "HEIRESS" license plates. 
</P>
<P>
 They followed her to Compton, where Moore drove to the police station and told 
officers she was being tailed, law enforcement sources said. The men parked 
across the street. Two police officers walked over to the car and confronted 
them. But to the officers' surprise, the men displayed FBI badges. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, sources say, Compton police officials called the FBI, asking why 
Moore was being followed. The FBI explained that the agents, who were 
supposedly staking out drug dealers, had mistakenly followed the wrong 
Rolls-Royce.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Moore had met several times with Macardican and undercover agents 
posing as financiers for the project, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch at a Long Beach restaurant, Macardican pitched the project, 
telling Moore he wanted her "on the team," according to a source familiar with 
the meeting. Unbeknown to her, one of the people at the table was an undercover 
FBI agent. Macardican, the source said, told Moore that he wanted to avoid a 
futile repeat of his 1984 effort that Moore had opposed; he and his backers 
said they lost $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at Macardican's South El Monte office in the spring of 1992 that the 
video of Moore accepting the envelope was taken, sources said. Macardican had 
arranged the meeting between Moore and a man who turned out to be an undercover 
agent, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that Moore had been introduced to the agent earlier at her City 
Council offices by then-Mayor Tucker.  
</P>
<P>
 Tucker is said to have brought the agent to Moore's office, patted him on the 
back and told Moore: "Pat, this is a good man. Listen to what he has to say," 
according to sources familiar with the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators have a secretly recorded audiotape of that meeting, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992 -- eight months after the extortion incident to which Moore has 
pleaded guilty -- the City Council awarded Macardican's company exclusive 
negotiating rights to build the incinerator. The vote was 3 to 2, with Tucker 
and Moore among the majority. After the vote, Macardican never pursued the 
project. He withdrew the proposal earlier this year. Macardican declined 
numerous interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the day before federal authorities showed Moore the video 
recorded at Macardican's office, a reporter asked her to comment on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The query prompted her to call a trusted friend and former Macardican 
associate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't suppose this has something to do with (Macardican's) project, do 
you?," the friend recalled her saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend, who insisted on anonymity, assured Moore that her concern was 
unfounded. But at the councilwoman's insistence, her friend left a message for 
Macardican asking if he knew anything about an FBI probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Macardican never called back.

HOMECOMING DAY WITH THE EMPHASIS ON HOME; EDUCATION: THE RITUAL GIVES THE 
RESIDENCE FACILITY'S YOUTHS -- ALL TAKEN FROM ABUSIVE OR NEGLIGENT PARENTS -- A 
SENSE OF NORMALCY.

 The Bulldogs wore matching navy tank tops pulled over sweat shirts and tees, 
yellow touch-football strips hanging from each hip. And the royal court 
sparkled in rhinestone tiaras worn over backward baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
 The big game, the homemade-float parade and the crowning of student royalty is 
a scene common at virtually every high school this time of year, when the 
ritual of homecoming calls back alumni and invites current students to campuses 
for a day of revelry and reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
 But homecoming day for the Bulldogs of Penny Lane, a North Hills residence 
facility and school for youths from troubled and abusive homes, took on a 
special meaning. These are kids who have never really had a hometown school, 
kids who don't have much in their past that calls for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really amazing, that it's actually coming. Our first Homecoming," 
said Sam, a 16-year-old resident of Penny Lane. "Sometimes I didn't believe it 
would happen. It's really hard to get people's spirits up in here because they 
are always thinking, you know, about their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at Penny Lane, officially named The National Foundation for the 
Treatment of the Emotionally Handicapped, cares for 110 teen-agers who have 
been taken away from abusive or negligent parents by the Los Angeles County 
Department of Children's Services, the Department of Mental Health and an order 
from juvenile court. Their full names are not used because they are minors and 
wards of the state.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got here I was drowning depressed. And some girls have been here 
for four years," said Danielle, co-captain of the drill team and a nine-month 
Penny Lane resident. "We've never had anything like this. It's almost like we 
are at a real school, like we can do things normal kids can do too." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Denise, who will graduate in June from Penny Lane's private high 
school, New Directions, the homecoming festivities represent more than just a 
good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system makes us feel like we must have done something wrong," Denise 
said. "And the way homecoming is so formal -- you've gotta get the hair, the 
nails. You get all dressed up and you feel so good about yourself. It kinda 
gives you hope. Even though it's just for one night and all, you can look in 
the mirror and say, 'I can be somebody just like anybody else.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the girls borrowed dresses from staff members. A Penny Lane alumna now 
in cosmetology school treated each of the girls to a set of acrylic nails. The 
activities director and drill-team coach styled hair. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ive Markovits, executive director of Penny Lane, watching the day unfold 
smoothly was more than she had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal with kids at the end of the continuum," she said. "To see them 
approximate what normal kids would be doing is so exciting for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of a homecoming day for teen-agers who lack what most would consider 
a home has not escaped some of the staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Mark Hennessy, a teacher at New Directions, pointed out: "The reality 
is, for a lot of these kids, Penny Lane is the best home they have ever had. To 
see them smile and laugh . . ., " Hennessy said, pausing and surveying the 
crowd. "If they didn't have this now, they would never have one." 
</P>
<P>
 There is at least one change that Mickey McKinney, Penny Lane alumna, class of 
'84, now a senior at UC Santa Barbara, is glad to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed things like homecoming and prom when I was young," McKinney said. "I 
missed establishing those positive memories. Hopefully, those are not parts of 
growing up that these kids will have to miss."

COUNTY REPORT: A MESSAGE HITS HOME; PROPOSITION 187; FAMILY TORN BY PLANNED 
RETURN TO MEXICO; AFTERMATH: OXNARD MOTHER PREPARES TO LEAVE WITH HER TWO 
CHILDREN BUT WITHOUT HER LIVE-IN FIANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 The land of opportunity has never held much for Silvia Alfaro. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing, not the poverty of farm work or the uncertainty of being an 
illegal immigrant, has ever shaped her life as much as Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican native is packing her bags and returning to her home state of 
Oaxaca. Her two children -- both of whom were born in this country and are 
therefore U.S. citizens -- will go with her, becoming foreigners in a country 
they have never known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walk in fear," said the 20-year-old Oxnard resident, who will catch a plane 
out of Tijuana early next month. "I'm afraid to take my children to the doctor. 
I'm afraid to wait for the bus. I'm afraid to leave my house." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro's live-in fiance -- the father of her youngest child -- will head to 
Minneapolis when she leaves, a place where he hears work is good and where he 
knows for sure there is no Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard, because this is all the family I have. But it's better this way," 
said Felix Rubio, who illegally immigrated to the United States about four 
years ago. "If we didn't have this oppression with 187, then we could stay. But 
we can't." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the measure won landslide approval nearly two weeks ago, 
immigrant-rights advocates warned that it could result in the splitting of 
thousands of families statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 And while there are few reports of illegal immigrants packing up and returning 
home, the advocates fear this is only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what I expected, and I don't know how people could have 
expected anything else," said Eileen McCarthy, a lawyer with California Rural 
Legal Assistance in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all the people who voted for this initiative, and who assuaged their 
consciences by telling themselves this was only sending a message to the 
federal government, this is the grim and tragic reality." 
</P>
<P>
 For Alfaro and Rubio, the reality of the United States has always been 
something short of the promise for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by the deepening poverty of their homeland, the couple immigrated here 
at different times. He is from Veracruz, she from a tiny Oaxacan town by the 
name of Santiago Asuncion. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro first came to the United States about 1990. She was married at the time 
and had a child the same year. She and her son returned to Oaxaca when her 
marriage fell apart, but came back to Oxnard two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Rubio met in a strawberry patch: both poor, farm workers and illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio toils from dawn to dusk, earning minimum wage doing various types of 
farm labor. Alfaro rarely leaves home anymore, an unfurnished room at an Oxnard 
house for which they pay $350 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life has always been very hard for those without (legal) papers," Alfaro 
said. "We don't have much. We can't buy clothes, we barely have enough to put 
food on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 But until the passage of Proposition 187, Alfaro and Rubio had no plans of 
leaving Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They may not have had much, but at least they had each other. They also have 
two children -- Adrian, 3, and Eduardo, 3 months -- both of whom are U.S. 
citizens and both who stood a decent shot at fulfilling the American dream that 
eluded their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, staying put is a luxury the couple no longer can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "My oldest son will soon be 4 years old, and I'm scared to put him in school," 
Alfaro said. "They say they will use the children to find parents who are here 
illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oaxaca, Alfaro said, there is poverty. But there is also family, her 
parents and grandparents, brothers and sisters. She will return there and wait 
for Rubio to send money. 
</P>
<P>
 They will meet again and be married in Mexico, hopefully in six months or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never going to leave her. Never," Rubio vowed. "I consider her my wife. 
She's the mother of my child. We'll meet again soon." 
</P>
<P>
 For Alfaro, the choices at this point are simple. She could continue to live 
in fear, worried that every contact with a doctor or a police officer would 
result in her deportation and perhaps separation from her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Or she can return home voluntarily, her family intact and her mind at rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts me that it has to be this way," Alfaro said. "But if everything here 
was really so good, we wouldn't have to go anywhere."

MOORPARK HIGH WINS ACADEMIC DECATHLON; EDUCATION: THE TEAM, WHICH HAS SUFFERED 
PERSONAL TRAGEDIES, WILL REPRESENT THE COUNTY IN THE STATE COMPETITION IN 
MARCH.

<P>
 The Moorpark High School academic decathlon team has seen more than its share 
of sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Larry Jones can reel off the list of tragedies: 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 17-year-old Shane Umberger, the first student the coach picked for 
the team, died in a car crash on the way home from a Grateful Dead concert. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, another key player, Karissa Lee, had to be rushed to the school 
nurse's office in the middle of practice, her congenitally disabled heart 
racing at more than 300 beats per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student's father was fatally shot several years ago by robbers in 
Mexico. And a fourth student's father was hospitalized recently with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a long day on Saturday, though, the Moorpark High team acted 
like a bunch of trouble-free teen-agers, hugging each other and leaping with 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the team blew away the other 13 high schools competing in Ventura 
County's annual battle of the brains, winning the right to represent the county 
at the state decathlon to be held in March in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids have just overcome a whole lot," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the daylong contest, teams of nine students took oral and written tests 
in economics, fine arts, language and literature, math, science, social science 
and communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, the defending champion, jumped into the lead at the very beginning 
of the competition and never looked back, winning nine of 10 events, including 
the climactic Super Quiz. The team finished with 42,920 points, easily 
outpacing second-place Ventura's Buena High, which earned 38,717 points. 
</P>
<P>
 La Reina High School in Thousand Oaks placed third with 37,282 points, and 
Thousand Oaks High finished fourth with a score of 36,953. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other competitors did not know about the obstacles Moorpark had 
overcome, but said they respected the team for its accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They work really, really hard," said La Reina senior Teresa Murvin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark team turned adversity into advantage.

 Senior Erik Spiller said Umberger's death was "a real emotional setback." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jones: "Losing him really hurt. He was one of those flat-out geniuses." 
</P>
<P>
 But the death served to motivate surviving team members, who said Umberger's 
spirit was with them Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee turned her heart problem into a talk that won first place in the speech 
category. "Life is a race," she told judges in a speech that made her teammates 
cry when they heard it in practice. Because of her heart condition, she said in 
an interview, she couldn't compete in sports so she turned to the academic 
decathlon instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Gonzalez, whose father was fatally shot, fashioned his speech on the 
effect of violent crime on a family. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to crunch time, however, the students left personal problems 
behind. Armed only with pencils and seated at desks on the floor of the 
basketball court at Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard, they answered multiple 
choice questions about biotechnology, a topic that decathletes nationwide had 
prepared for in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the Super Quiz, and the stands were packed with fans waving signs and 
cheering when rounds finished and scores were posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark seemed to be at a disadvantage in this round. The team was seated 
along the baseline and had to crane their necks to see the blurry small print 
of the question projected onto a slide screen about 30 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Moorpark competitors were unfazed. Most of the time, they circled an 
answer before the moderator even finished reading the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Tied 31-31 with Buena in the Super Quiz after two rounds, the Moorpark team 
came through in the clutch, winning 48-46. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, like some other schools, gives class credit and devotes school time 
to academic decathlon practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches say such methods go too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some schools may be going overboard," said Channel Island High School coach 
Dave Curci, objecting to Moorpark's practice of turning academic decathlon into 
a class and allowing students to skip classes to review decathlon material on 
Thursday and Friday before the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones, the Moorpark coach, said giving such emphasis to the competition is 
an investment in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the cream-of-the-crop kids who are going to make a difference in 
society, so why not put the money into them?" Jones asked. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the contest highlights the importance of academic 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, our competitions deal with athletics. This is an opportunity for 
those students who excel in academics to demonstrate their ability," said 
Sandra Shackelford, Ventura County's assistant superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park High School won the award for most improved school, and 
Moorpark's Andrew Philip was the individual high scorer.

COUNTY REPORT: A MESSAGE HITS HOME; PROPOSITION 187; SOME PATIENTS SEE LAW AS 
ISSUE OF LIFE OR DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Obdula Teran stole across the Mexican border into the United States five 
years ago, she willingly surrendered the rights of citizenship for a chance at 
a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, she says, that sacrifice nearly killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months pregnant and violently ill, the 25-year-old Mexico City native 
refused to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 With Proposition 187 on the ballot, Teran feared that a trip to the doctor 
could mean a permanent trip back over the border into Mexico. The measure -- 
now in limbo until court challenges are resolved -- requires that medical 
workers deny non-emergency care to illegal immigrants and report them to 
immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 As Teran's condition worsened, friends and family urged the feverish woman to 
seek help, tending to her as best they could in the tiny two-bedroom Ventura 
apartment she shares with her husband, sister and two young children. 
</P>
<P>
 During her first two pregnancies, Teran had not thought twice about visiting 
her doctor in Ventura. Now, dread gripped her and she would not go. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the day after California voters resoundingly passed Proposition 187, 
Teran lapsed into unconsciousness and her husband rushed her to the emergency 
room at Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors quickly discovered a blood clot in her lungs and labored to stabilize 
her life-threatening condition. After a week in intensive care, Teran learned 
she will probably be spending the rest of her fragile pregnancy in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bundled in a hospital gown, her left arm wrapped in a jumble of plastic ID 
bands, Teran recounted the traumatic experience and the terror she still feels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I came to the hospital was because I was in a state of 
dying," she said, her voice raspy and congested. "I thought I was near death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a very strong person," she added. "There are few things that scare me, 
but Proposition 187 scares me. If I get deported, what would happen to my 
kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Teran's story is one of pediatrician Chris Landon's worst nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, patient visits to a clinic for women and children Landon runs 
in Ventura have dropped by half, a decline he attributes, at least in part, to 
the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole emphasis is on prevention, getting to people before they get sick," 
Landon said. "If this thing goes into effect, it could set us way back." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kiley, a political consultant who worked on the Proposition 187 
campaign, has little sympathy for Teran and other illegal immigrants in need of 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mean to be inhumane, but this woman is a perfect example of why we 
need Prop. 187," Kiley said. "She has already had two children here and now 
she's on her third, and she doesn't even belong here. All I can say is, these 
people are going to have to go back home. We're paying for her care while 
Americans are homeless and starving in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Frank, a supporter of the ballot measure, said doctors have a less than 
noble motive in defending access to health care for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they are concerned about health and welfare," Frank said. "But 
really, their only goal is to have more patients and more money, wherever they 
can get them." 
</P>
<P>
 A week before the election, state health officials reported that Medi-Cal 
costs for illegal immigrants in Ventura County have quadrupled since 1989 to 
$9.3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But county health officials said the numbers could be skewed because of 
changes in the type of benefits provided and because some illegal immigrants 
use false papers to qualify for other types of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Medi-Cal funding went to federally mandated health care for 
illegal immigrants. The state and federal government split the cost evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 About $1 million was paid for prenatal care for illegal immigrants, a cost 
picked up solely by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the election, Gov. Pete Wilson called for an immediate halt to 
state-funded prenatal services for illegal immigrants. The order triggered a 
60-day notification period before cuts can be made in the state-financed Access 
for Infants and Mothers (AIM) program. 
</P>
<P>
 A court order could block the action, but if enforced, basic services 
including blood tests, checkups and ultrasound for undocumented patients would 
be cut off. Last week, county officials agreed to wait for direction from the 
state before trying to implement the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county does eventually comply with the measure, illegal immigrants may 
find themselves turning to clinics that do not rely on government funding to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately funded Free Clinic of Simi Valley is one such place. Founded in 
1971, the clinic provides medical care to about 4,700 clients a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is committed to patient confidentiality and has no plans to check 
the citizenship of its clients, Executive Director Fred Bauermeister said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We respect people's privacy, so much so that there was a time when we 
considered not even asking people their names," Bauermeister said. "Our job is 
to provide health care, not keep tabs on the legal status of our clients." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weeknight, the normally bustling clinic was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why no one is here, but I fear it is because of Prop. 187," 
Bauermeister said. "We have to get the word out that we are still in the 
business of caring for people, not policing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto S. Juarez, executive director of Clinicas del Camino Real, said his 
four clinics will not turn away or report patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the families have been coming here for two or three generations," 
Juarez said of his operation, which runs clinics in Oxnard, Fillmore, Saticoy 
and Ojai. "We are not interested in who is legal or illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Teran, the fear is deep and immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 She is afraid of the doctor who asked of her citizenship status, then 
reassured her that it did not matter. She is afraid of the immigration 
authorities she believes could appear at any time and deport her to Mexico, 
separating her from her two California-born children.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even bear to talk about it, I am sick with worry," Teran said, her 
tired but strong face melting into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 This, from a woman who says that at age 20 she attempted to cross the Mexican 
border into the United States five times within a week before making it 
through. Teran said she again made the dangerous crossing a year ago, children 
in tow, to be at her ailing mother's bedside. But America is where Teran said 
she belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband works hard, we scrimp and save, we don't use welfare or food 
stamps," she said. "Why don't they just give us a chance like everyone else?"

COUNTY REPORT: A MESSAGE HITS HOME; PROPOSITION 187; MEASURE SEEMS TO HAVE 
LITTLE EFFECT ON USE OF ILLEGAL WORKERS; IMMIGRANTS: FOR MANY, THEIR LIVES ARE 
CLOUDED BY CONFUSION AS THEY BRACE FOR THE FALLOUT FROM SUITS CHALLENGING THE 
LAW. 
</P>

<P>
 Jose Martinez watched the public protests against Proposition 187, and held 
out hope that the measure could be defeated. Then the illegal immigrant 
listened to Spanish-language radio the night voters decisively endorsed the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the message: An overwhelming number of people want him, and his kind, 
to go back where they came from. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Martinez the next morning staked out the same Moorpark street 
corner where he has regularly found work since arriving in the United States 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as usual, he got a job, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, nothing has changed," said the 28-year-old day laborer from the 
Mexican state of Guanajuato. "In the future, who knows? But I need work, I need 
to feed my family. What am I supposed to do? Where am I supposed to go?" 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Proposition 187 has had little effect on Martinez, or anyone he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, on street corners and at hiring sites throughout Ventura County, the 
initiative has apparently done little to curb the use of illegal immigrant 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
 But fears stirred up by the measure run much deeper than that. The proposition 
seeks to cut education, health care and other public benefits to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the courts have temporarily frozen implementation of those 
provisions, officials report a sharp decline in the number of illegal 
immigrants visiting public health clinics. At the same time, many of the 
undocumented are talking about keeping their children out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as no surprise to immigrant-rights advocates that there has been a 
decline in the use of public services, while the measure has had little impact 
on the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 They never believed that the proposition was aimed at ridding the state of its 
valuable supply of cheap, immigrant labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the message of Proposition 187 as I see it is to leave the 
exploitable laborers here, but send their women and children back home," said 
Claudia Smith, regional counsel for California Rural Legal Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly it has the potential of making life a lot more miserable for 
undocumented families," Smith added. "But whether it's going to make it 
miserable enough to make some of them go home, or make some of them stop 
coming, is still an open question." 
</P>
<P>
 For many illegal immigrants, there is also the open question on how the 
measure will be enforced, and when enforcement will start. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many are bracing for the fallout from a flurry of lawsuits challenging the 
constitutionality of the measure. Until then, many say their lives are now 
choked by fear and clouded by confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't know what this law means," said Juan Guzman, an illegal 
immigrant competing last week with dozens of other farm workers at an Oxnard 
park for a minimum-wage job cutting vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it means for my family," he said. "I don't know if one day 
a police officer or someone else will choose to turn us in to the Border 
Patrol. I guess we'll just take our chances." 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the controversy over the measure has focused on the severing of 
social services, little has been made about how it will affect those industries 
that heavily rely on illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the extent that the measure sought to drive illegal immigrants out of 
the work force, opening up jobs for U.S. citizens and legal residents, that is 
yet to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two weeks after the measure won overwhelming voter approval, illegal 
immigrants say they continue to find steady employment in the county's 
food-rich agricultural industry and in other jobs such as landscaping and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is going to do this work, if not us?" asked Oxnard farm worker Tomas 
Garza, as he fended off an early morning chill while joining a pool of 
job-seekers last week. "If we were all to leave, this industry would collapse. 
They need us as much as we need work." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason that the initiative has had little impact on the labor force is 
that it is virtually impossible to distinguish between legal and illegal 
immigrants, farm labor representatives say. 
</P>
<P>
 Most illegal immigrants use phony documents to land work in the fields, they 
say. Under federal law, all workers must prove citizenship or legal residency 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert P. Roy, general counsel for the Ventura County Agriculture Assn., said 
growers have long had to obey federal laws that require verification of legal 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that anyone is really suffering any anxiety over it, at least 
not from the employers' sector," Roy said. "I haven't had one phone call from 
an employer asking what the impact of Proposition 187 is going to be on his 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 And by all accounts, the initiative has not spurred an exodus of illegal 
immigrants back to their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's business as usual," said Mike Malloy, agent in charge of the Border 
Patrol office in Ventura County. "We are understaffed, overworked and still 
have a hell of a problem. We can go anywhere we want, catch anyone we want in 
any business we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the question of illegal immigration, the proposition also affects legal 
immigrants whose spouses, children and other family members are here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many, if not most, of those facing deportation today are relatives of 
U.S. citizens and lawful immigrants, stuck on waiting lists to become legal 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of people here have papers, but their families may not," said 
Rafael Rodriguez, a day laborer in Moorpark. "What's going to happen to our 
wives and children? Those are the things we are really worried about with this 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Lawson, an immigrant-rights activist in Oxnard, said the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service legalized more than 16,000 adults in Ventura County 
under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all have U.S.-born children, Lawson said. And about half have spouses 
who now have applications pending for legal residency, but who are caught in 
the achingly slow INS bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 It could take three to 15 years for applicants to be granted legal status, 
Lawson said. In the meantime, under Proposition 187, they are still illegal 
immigrants and subject to deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The simplicity of 187 divides the world into legal and illegal," Lawson said. 
"But the predominant immigrant family in California is what we call a mixed 
one, some legal and some not. Proposition 187 ignores the reality of the mixed 
family and the fact that U.S. citizens will suffer division of families and 
tremendous harm if it is upheld." 
</P>
<P>
 On the street corner in Moorpark, the reality is that few immigrants are 
thinking of packing up and heading home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, illegal immigration is a problem," said day laborer Ramon Rodriguez. 
"But this is not the way to solve it, this is not a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that illegal immigration isn't going to stop because of this law. 
Nothing can stop people who need to find work."

MISSION BELLS TOLL FOR PATRIARCH; FUNERAL: HUNDREDS PAY LAST RESPECTS TO PAUL 
ARBISO, WHO CAME TO SYMBOLIZE SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO DURING MORE THAN 60 YEARS OF 
RINGING IN THE SWALLOWS. 'SAN JUAN'S LOSS IS HEAVEN'S GAIN,' ONE ADMIRER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The mission bells rang Saturday for the man who sounded them for more than 60 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people gathered at the Mission San Juan to say goodby to Paul 
Arbiso, the city's beloved patriarch and the bell ringer who welcomed home the 
swallows each spring. Arbiso died last week at age 99. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourners overflowed the mission's tiny Serra Chapel, pausing after the service 
to listen as the huge iron bells were sounded by Arbiso's grandson, Michael 
Gastelum, the new bell ringer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt empty, very empty," Gastelum said. "But then it also felt like he was 
here with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso received all the pomp and circumstance accorded the passing of the town 
patriarch, a title granted to the resident who most exemplifies San Juan 
Capistrano's frontier spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 His casket was placed on a wagon decorated with flowers and pulled by two 
white horses about half a mile to the mission cemetery. A procession of family 
and friends followed along Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the largest turnout I can ever remember for a funeral in this town," 
said city Historical Society President Tony Forrester, whose rancher family 
moved to San Juan Capistrano in the early 1800s. "San Juan's loss is heaven's 
gain." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 60 years, Arbiso rang the mission bells, sounding the patterns 
that announced deaths, births and the annual return of the city's most famous 
residents, the swallows. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso also was responsible for cultivating the beauty of another one of the 
city's most famous landmarks, the Mission San Juan rose gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Those duties were lifelong labors of love for the Juaneno Indian, who grew up 
playing in the mission stables. Even after retiring from tending the gardens at 
93, Arbiso looked in on his beloved roses every Sunday after attending Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 He never gave up bell ringing. Arbiso welcomed back the swallows last March at 
age 98. 
</P>
<P>
 "His death means the end of an era," said Bob Dunn, a close friend and 
neighbor of Arbiso's. "He was born a few years after the first railroad came 
through San Juan, saw the first motorcar and witnessed the first man on the 
moon." 
</P>
<P>
 "This man was born into a time we can only see in black-and-white Hollywood 
movies," Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso was constantly in demand for his historical knowledge of the mission 
and the city. But he was also renowned for possessing a calm, gentle spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 After retirement, "he had a habit of giving roses to people," Msgr. Paul 
Martin told the assembly during a 90-minute funeral service. "He'd snip a rose 
and give it to someone to make their day a little brighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso remained active, going to church every Sunday. He was also a familiar 
sight downtown, occasionally ending up in the Swallows Inn saloon to indulge in 
an glass of red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso was proud of living a clean life, crediting a life of abstinence -- no 
smoking, swearing or fighting -- for his longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a person who embodied all that is good in San Juan Capistrano," Martin 
said. "He truly made the title of patriarch more than an honorary title." 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, Forrester shook his head as he looked over the crowd. His 
historical society has the sad duty of choosing a new patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential candidates have grown fewer and fewer," Forrester said. "I 
don't think we'll ever have anyone like Paul again."

SANTA ANA MAN IS JAILED AFTER HIS BABY DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested a Santa Ana man on suspicion of killing his 8-month-old 
daughter in the rented room where his family lived after the infant was found 
not breathing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Perez, 34, was arrested after giving police inconsistent accounts of 
what happened to the baby, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Ed Andrade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade said officers went to a house in the 600 block of Borchard Avenue on 
Friday afternoon after receiving a 911 call from someone at the residence that 
a baby had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's child abuse investigators were called when the baby, Kenya 
Perez, died upon arrival at a local hospital, Andrade said. Investigators 
arrested Jorge Perez at the home shortly afterward, he said, adding that he did 
not know the details of the father's statements. 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives and roommates of the Perez family said Saturday that Kenya 
accidentally suffocated while her father slept and that Jorge Perez never could 
have killed the infant daughter he loved. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good person," said his nephew Antonio Perez, 22, as he stood outside 
his home across the street from where Perez lived. "It's an accident. He worked 
every night and came home very morning. He sleeps so hard. He couldn't hear the 
baby cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ortuno, 17, said Perez, his wife, Clarissa, and daughters Marybelle, 8, 
and Kenya had been renting a room in his mother's three-bedroom house for about 
2 1/2-months. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Perez worked the night shift printing advertising circulars at a plant 
in Garden Grove, leaving for work about 9:30 and arriving home about 7 a.m., 
family members said. At 1 p.m., he would take his wife to work at the same 
place and return to watch his daughters in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortuno said he had just arrived home from school about 3:15 p.m. on Friday 
when he heard Jorge Perez calling "Baby doll, my baby doll" in Spanish in the 
bedroom his family lived in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was playing with his daughter," Ortuno said. "But he kept saying 
it over and over, louder and louder." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortuno said Perez came out of the bedroom and asked to speak to the boyfriend 
of Ortuno's mother, who was asleep in another room. Perez woke up the other man 
and said, "My daughter's not breathing, she fell in the bucket when I was 
asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez told the two that he woke up to find his daughter face-first in a 
five-gallon bucket kept by the side of the bed for trash, Ortuno said. The 
baby's feet were sticking in the air and her face was smashed against the 
bucket's bottom, Ortuno said Perez had told them. When he lifted his daughter 
out, she was not breathing, according to Ortuno. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortuno said when he went into the room, Kenya was lying on the bed and her 
lips were blue. He picked her up and carried her into the kitchen to call 911, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was holding the girl and I laid her on the ground and called police," 
Ortuno said, demonstrating how he held the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortuno said he didn't know the family well, but that Perez was always tired, 
usually getting as little as three hours sleep a day. "He was playing with 
those kids all the time," Ortuno said. 
</P>
<P>
 If he needed to sleep in the afternoon, the father usually took Kenya to be 
watched by a relative in the neighborhood, Ortuno said. "This time he fell 
asleep and didn't take her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor, who asked that his name not be used, said Perez had come to ask 
him where to find a good mechanic a few hours before Kenya's death on Friday. 
The neighbor said Perez kept excusing himself during the conversation to check 
on the baby, who was asleep in the family's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, I have a baby in the car and I'm afraid she'll fall down," said the 
neighbor, adding that Perez seemed to genuinely care for his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday afternoon, while neighbors discussed the tragedy, Clarissa Perez and 
other family members were out trying to raise money to bail out her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade said the cause of death won't be known until the results of an autopsy 
performed Saturday are analyzed. Perez was booked into the Santa Ana city jail 
on suspicion of murder and was being held Saturday in lieu of $250,000 bail.

A GOOD TERN FOR NATURE; CAL STATE FULLERTON TEAM SETS OUT TO AID ENDANGERED SEA 
BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were weekly fixtures throughout the summer, during the sea bird mating 
season at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing rubber boots and sporting binoculars, the team of graduate students 
tromped through the marshes, looking for bits of half-eaten fish discarded by 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 She was willing to do it for science and to make a contribution to the local 
ecology, said one of the students, Jacqueline Wilson. She and her colleagues, 
all from Cal State Fullerton, are part of a study funded by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Its purpose: to determine whether the Bolsa Chica wetlands' fragile colony of 
endangered California least terns is further threatened by the recent arrival 
of some rather aggressive feathered cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural invasion," said Michael Horn, the Cal State Fullerton 
professor and biologist who is conducting the study. "Nobody wants to scuttle 
the new birds; what we want to do is find out if they can peacefully coexist 
(with the old ones)." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Horn, the trouble began about 10 years ago when the area's 
long-established least tern colony began being eclipsed by the arrival of 
several more aggressive subspecies, specifically elegant terns, Caspian terns, 
Forster's terns and black skimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 A small bird with a black cap and yellow bill, the California least tern 
numbers about 2,000 mating pairs statewide and is on the state and federal 
endangered species lists. After spending its winters in South America, 
biologists say, the bird migrates north in mid-April to various California 
locations where it nests in the sand and lays eggs that hatch a month or two 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 To aid in that process, state biologists in the mid-1970s constructed two 
nesting islands at Bolsa Chica complete with open stretches of sand and tile 
shelters for older chicks, conveniences that eventually began attracting an 
average of 200 mating pairs -- about 10% of the state's population -- to the 
area each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1991, according to Horn, the endangered birds on one of the islands had 
been completely displaced by the four larger and more aggressive potential 
competitors. "There's only a limited amount of nesting space," Horn said, "and 
the least terns just couldn't hold up under this kind of onslaught. When you 
have an endangered species, every loss of a nesting site hurts. It would be 
better if they were still nesting here." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the competition for nesting space cooled, with the endangered birds 
remaining on the southernmost island and the new arrivals claiming the island 
to the north. Still undetermined, however, is the long-range effect of the 
birds' competition for food -- specifically, biologists say, the question of 
whether their diets are similar enough to allow the larger and more aggressive 
new arrivals to eventually starve out the least terns. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out, Horn initiated his study in 1992. Each week during the nesting 
season, generally from early May to late September, the professor and his 
students don rubber boots, wade or row over to Bolsa Chica's northernmost 
nesting island and spend the day collecting fish fragments that were either 
regurgitated, discarded half-eaten or dropped untouched by the 4,000 to 5,000 
birds believed to be nesting there. 
</P>
<P>
 The students also spend hours using binoculars to watch the birds' activities 
from observation points. And occasionally they board boats to follow the 
foraging animals as far as six miles out to sea to document exactly where their 
prey comes from. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Horn said, the research teams collected about 1,000 bags of fish 
fragments, all of which they are now painstakingly analyzing in a university 
laboratory for eventual comparison to the known diet of the least tern. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more than 50 types of fish identified so far, according to Horn, are 
the northern anchovy, Pacific sardine, California grunion, top smelt, 
jacksmelt, California killifish, long jaw mudsucker, Mozambique tilapia, 
largemouth bass and bluegill. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the fish come from the ocean, he said, others come from the 
estuaries of Bolsa Chica, nearby flood channels or even the San Gabriel River. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birds are very active, very visually exploratory and very likely to 
expand their ranges," he said in explaining the wide variety of fish they 
collect. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is supported by a $9,000 grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, and Horn expects to publish the findings in a paper next June. So far, 
he said, it does not appear that the feathered newcomers of Bolsa Chica are 
competing with the endangered old-timers for food. 
</P>
<P>
 While all the birds share a pronounced taste for anchovies and sardines, the 
biologist said, the least terns appear to go after fish too small to be 
bothered by the more aggressive birds, which also have a much broader diet. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that probably means is that coexistence is possible," Horn said. "We 
don't think there is intense competition for food." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition for nesting space, on the other hand, appears to be fierce, which 
probably will prompt Horn to recommend that new nesting islands be built. 
Whatever the immediate outcome, though, the professor believes his study will 
provide an important reference point by which future observations can be 
judged. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we'd like to do," he said, "is create a resource model for Bolsa Chica. 
Biological maintenance is essential; you have to keep track of what's going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the lab, meanwhile, the graduate students seem imbued with a purpose 
all their own. "It's fascinating," said Wendy Loeffler, 24, looking up from her 
microscope to describe the weekly visits to the island during the nesting 
season. "The noise level is incredible. There's nothing like having 5,000 birds 
divebombing your head." 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested Wilson, apparently speaking from experience: "Just wear a hat and 
don't look up."

VALLEY BRIEFING: OUR OWN MELTING POT; AN ETHNIC BREAKDOWN OF THOSE AROUND US 
</P>

<P>
 It's often been said that America is a melting pot, but how do we and our 
neighbors fit into the picture? There has been much discussion lately about 
ethnicity, with the passage of Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration 
measure. In Los Angeles County, there are 3.6 million whites, 3.3 million 
Latinos and almost a million blacks. Here's a snapshot of our local world. Los

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
LOCAL GOP CONGRESSMEN LINE UP FOR THEIR SHARE OF THE SPOILS OF VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friends of Newt: Republicans who for so long were out of power in Congress are 
now almost beside themselves as they begin wrestling for perks, top committee 
assignments and other symbols of power that will show who's really in. 
</P>
<P>
 Although committee assignments won't be official until the next session begins 
Jan. 4, Republicans are lining up for top spots amid much uncertainty as Newt 
Gingrich, the House Speaker-in-waiting, restructures the committees. Right in 
the middle of the scramble are Orange County's congressmen who, despite having 
low seniority, are making known their own "wish lists": 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach: As the ranking Republican on the 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs of the Committee on 
Government Operations, Cox is likely to become chairman of that panel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove: Because he lost seniority when he 
moved from his former Santa Monica district to Orange County, Dornan now ranks 
10th out of 22 Republicans on the Armed Services Committee. But he's angling to 
chair a subcommittee: either Oversight and Investigations or Military Forces 
and Personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Jay C. Kim of Diamond Bar: As a freshman, he served on the House 
committees on Public Works and Transportation and Small Business. As usual, he 
was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Ron Packard of Carlsbad: Because he has supported Rep. Robert L. 
Livingston (R-La.) as the new acting chairman of the powerful House 
Appropriations Committee, he could cash in his chits for a subcommittee 
chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach: As the second-ranking Republican 
on the District of Columbia committee, Rohrabacher might have become its next 
chairman if a) Gingrich had decided to keep it and b) Rohrabacher had wanted 
it, which he doesn't. As a member of the Science, Space and Technology 
Committee, Rohrabacher would like to chair its space subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Ed Royce of Fullerton: A freshman in the current term, Royce is still 
looking at what will be available as the shake-up continues. He serves on the 
House committees on Foreign Affairs and Science, Space and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Silver linings: It may seem like a thankless job, but Orange County Democratic 
Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia says she's willing, even eager, to do it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted by the party's dismal showing in the election, Garcia says she's 
decided to run again for the two-year post and feels confident of winning it 
when the party's central committee votes on new officers in January. Her first 
goal? "To keep the momentum going that we had going into the last few weeks 
before the election," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Momentum? The Democrats managed to lose the only electoral toehold they had in 
Orange County--the Assembly seat Tom Umberg gave up to run unsuccessfully for 
attorney general--when Democrat Mike Metzler lost in a squeaker to Republican 
Jim Morrissey. Worse yet, in nearly half the local legislative and 
congressional races, Republicans won with at least 70% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind, Garcia says, she's encouraged by the steady trickle of calls 
coming into Democratic headquarters from people shocked by the party's drubbing 
at the polls. "I think a lot of Democrats here are actually waking up at this 
point to see that they need to get involved, not just vote," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here comes the judge: Election Day contests only decided the winners. 
Post-election courtroom battles may decide who lied. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman-elect Jim Morrissey in central Orange County's 69th District is 
the latest candidate to sue his unsuccessful Democratic opponent. In his suit, 
Morrissey claims opponent Mike Metzler and the California Democratic Party 
allegedly lied in a series of 11th-hour "hit pieces" when they claimed that 
Morrissey had a "secret plan" to keep Latinos from voting in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey's fellow Republicans threatened to watch Latino polling places for 
possible voter fraud, but Morrissey tried to distance himself from the effort. 
"The 69th Assembly District has a long history of sleazy campaigns and this 
time they went too far," Morrissey says in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler calls the lawsuit "silly," adding: "I don't think it's coincidental 
that the man who got him to run and helped lead the campaign was the same 
individual who talked about poll guards in the election." Metzler is referring 
to Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), who first raised the voter fraud 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You know you've really made it when . . .: On a visit last week to a 
Washington, D.C., tavern, Rohrabacher, the Huntington Beach congressman, was 
tickled to discover one of his campaign bumper stickers--the one showing a 
surfboard and the slogan "Congressman Dana Rohrabacher: Fighting for Freedom 
and Having Fun"--among a collection adorning the walls. But Hugh Kelly, the 
proprietor of Kelly's Irish Times and a practical man, confesses that he waited 
to see if Rohrabacher actually won reelection before going to the expense of 
framing an accompanying photo of the congressman, complete with surfboard. Now 
he will, Kelly promises. Going to the Polls

8 FAMILIES EARN 'HABITAT' HOMES IN PACOIMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando/Santa Clarita Valleys' Habitat for Humanity gave eight area 
families a home Saturday, at the formal dedication of a condominium building 
that each of its new residents helped build. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight families have all lived in the San Fernando Valley for more than two 
years, a Habitat requirement to demonstrate stability; each also had to give 
500 or more hours of "sweat equity" to the building, called the Don Adams 
Villas. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat is a Christian group that builds homes with donated funds and 
volunteer labor; the idea is to provide housing for low-income people without 
giving handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers with the program, which was founded by former President Jimmy 
Carter, have built more than 25,000 homes since Habitat began 18 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Homes are constructed for about $50,000 each with as much donated land and 
materials as the group can find. They are sold at no profit to the people 
chosen to help build them, and the new residents are given loans with no 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Habitat's San Gabriel Valley chapter began construction on its 
first Glendale project. Working with the city's Housing Authority, the group 
will build four units at 531 Allen St.  
</P>
<P>
 Each 1,100-square-foot townhouse will have three bedrooms and will be sold for 
$50,000 to $75,000.

HUSBAND, SON FIND WOMAN FATALLY SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia Hernandez was alone Friday when she apparently answered a knock at 
the door of her secluded and rambling home high above the brushland of Hansen 
Dam basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, she was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Ray, and 25-year-old son, Adrian, came home at about 8 that 
night. Adrian walked in the front door first and found his mother in the living 
room with a bullet through her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigating the apparent murder of the 62-year-old mother of eight 
added nothing to that brief account Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A terse announcement issued by the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill 
Detective Division said there were no suspects and no known motive. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen members of the Hernandez family gathered Saturday afternoon 
at the rambling home where the family has lived 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Hernandez, 28, of Pasadena spoke guardedly about his mother's killing, 
saying he believes she was "shot in the head answering the door." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no evidence of robbery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was there, money in her purse, stereos, VCRs, all that," the 
younger Ray Hernandez said. "Nothing was taken." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said his father, a retired mechanic, and his brother returned at the 
same time to the house at the north end of Johanna Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was in the guest house. He just pulled in two minutes before," 
Hernandez said. "Adrian found her. He came home, opened the door and there she 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that said detectives had shared no details of their investigation 
with the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need all the help we can get figuring out who would do something like 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As news of the shooting rippled through the semirural neighborhood of 
sprawling horse properties, several residents said they were concerned, but not 
alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, it does cause concern," said Bill Sanders, stopping on his way to 
the grieving family with an offering of bread and potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighbors are concerned because it's a good friend of ours," Sanders said. 
"But we're not pushing the panic button."

UNCLE HELD AFTER GIRL HIT BY RUNAWAY CAR DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter Saturday 
after his 2-year-old niece died of head injuries suffered in an accident in 
Lawndale on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Figueroa was booked by sheriff's deputies after the death of Esmeralda 
Figueroa, who was struck by his car, which had been left idling and unattended 
in a driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Carlos Figueroa had left the car with its engine running while 
he went inside the house. A 2-year-old child climbed behind the steering wheel 
and threw the vehicle into gear. It struck Esmeralda and her 4-year-old sister, 
Dora, who had been playing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Dora was treated at a hospital and released. Esmeralda was hospitalized and 
died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Figueroa was being held on $25,000 bond at the Lennox station and is to 
be arraigned Tuesday in South Bay Municipal Court.

SUSPECT IN DRUNK DRIVING ARREST HAS 6 PREVIOUS DUI CONVICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people just won't learn, and police say 31-year-old David Baum, of 
Woodland Hills, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Baum was pulled over Saturday night for driving 55 m.p.h. in a 35 m.p.h. zone 
and for making unsafe lane changes, police said.His blood-alcohol level was 
also more than twice the legal limit in California, said Lt. Tony Alba, of the 
Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division.  
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't the first time. Or the second time. Alba said Baum has six 
previous DUI convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baum just completed parole after a three-year prison sentence for a felony 
DUI, Alba said. He also, at various times, has served more than 16 months in 
county jails for his previous DUI offenses, Alba added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Baum had his driver's license revoked in February, 1991, Alba said 
the 1982 Ford Mustang he was driving on Saturday was legally registered to him. 
Judges can choose to bar those convicted of a DUI from registering a car as a 
condition of parole, Alba said, but that restriction apparently was not placed 
on Baum. 
</P>
<P>
 When Officer Jim Reid pulled him over, Baum said he was headed to a fast-food 
restaurant for dinner and begged not to be arrested, according to Alba. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we take a DUI off the street, it's like taking a potential 
murderer off the street," Alba said. "It could be your family or my family up 
ahead of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Baum was charged with felony DUI and is being held without bail at Van Nuys 
Jail.

 Two Oxnard firefighters suffered minor injuries while putting out a fire in an 
empty house early Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Sal Velasquez and firefighter Dan Gildea injured their backs after 
portions of the floor collapsed, said Battalion Chief Terry McAnally. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez was treated at the scene and Gildea was taken to St. John's Regional 
Medical Center, where he was treated and released, McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were returning to a downtown fire station after responding to a 
call about a malfunctioning fire alarm, when they smelled smoke shortly before 
3:45 a.m., McAnally, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters then drove around the area and spotted a house engulfed in 
flames in the 400 block of G Street. They called for help and the fire was 
extinguished within 30 minutes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which caused an estimated $30,000 in damage, began near the house's 
water heater, McAnally said. The owner and sole resident died several weeks 
ago, but the utilities were still functioning, McAnally said. CHRISTINA LIMA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; 150 GUESTS EVACUATED DURING FIRE AT HOTEL 
</P>

<P>
 A small fire that erupted in a room at the Country Inn in Ventura sent about 
150 guests into the cold during an evacuation of the hotel Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was reported about 5:45 p.m. when an alarm sounded and guests noticed 
smoke, said Ventura Fire Department Battalion Chief Roger Morgenthal.Sparked by 
an overheated air-conditioning unit, the blaze was quickly doused by sprinklers 
and firefighters, Morgenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took firefighters more than an hour to ventilate the hotel with 
high-powered fans. Guests waited in the parking lot of the hotel in the 200 
block of South Chestnut Street until authorities allowed them to return to 
their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolle and Preston Burrow of Tarzana, who were on a weekend getaway, took the 
fire in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no big deal," said Preston Burrow. "Just a little bit of smoke and a 
long wait. At least the alarms worked." 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported, authorities said. A damage estimate was not 
available late Saturday. SCOTT HADLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Intent on honoring -- or good-naturedly dishonoring -- Thousand Oaks' 
longest-serving politician, friends of outgoing Mayor Alex Fiore have scheduled 
a retirement roast for Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore will step down from his council post next month, after serving three 
full decades.Already, the mayor has received a shower of accolades, including a 
rundown of his accomplishments during the "Fiore Moment" at weekly council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some of his biggest fans, the Fiore Moment isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The community banquet in the Hyatt Westlake Plaza hotel will toast Fiore's 
years of service with live music, a celebrity master of ceremonies and the 
roasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Roasters include City Manager Grant Brimhall, attorney Chuck Cohen and Chamber 
of Commerce President Steve Rubenstein. After his buddies jab him with jokes, 
Fiore will be granted a 15-minute rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the gala are $40 and must be purchased in advance. For more 
information, call Barbara Stein at 498-4005. STEPHANIE SIMON

SCOUTS' FOOD DRIVE YIELDS CLOSE TO 400,000 POUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An army of Boy Scouts took to the streets across Orange County Saturday, 
knocking on doors and collecting nearly 400,000 pounds of food for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 Boy Scouts, Eagle Scouts, parents and volunteers from Orange 
County National Guard units helped out in the annual food drive, part of a 
nationwide effort to fill the cupboards of food banks before the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The canned food, crackers and other non-perishables will be distributed to 280 
agencies throughout the county, said Devon Dougherty, a spokesman for the Boy 
Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had beans, crackers, soups, and pork and beans," Dougherty said. "We even 
had clothes donated. People really opened up their hearts to help those less 
fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 The bright, sunny weather also contributed, making it a pleasant day for the 
Scouts to walk the neighborhoods and ask people for donations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The food collected Saturday will be enough to feed about 150,000 people for 
three to four months, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who missed the collection Saturday, it's not too late. Dougherty 
said anyone still wishing to contribute may drop off donations at any Household 
Bank office or at the Food Distribution Center, at 426 W. Almond Ave., Orange.

HIGH SCHOOLERS MATCH WITS IN ACADEMIC DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Skinner sat on a folding chair Saturday in the hushed gymnasium at 
University High School. The 16-year-old had stayed up until 11:30 the night 
before preparing for this moment, the start of the Super Quiz, but one thought 
kept running through his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where you win it or lose it," said Skinner, a Laguna Hills High 
School student. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz was the last event of the all-day Orange County Grade Academic 
Decathlon, where 48 teams from Orange County high schools competed for 
recognition of academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 The final quiz started off with a sample question: 
</P>
<P>
 'Cytogeneticists use a technique known as banding," the announcer read. "This 
involves . . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 The announcer then listed five choices. Seven seconds passed. The buzzer 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pencils up," the voice blared. "The answer is D. Staining chromosomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the warm-up ended, Skinner and his Laguna Hills High team matched wits 
with the nine-member teams whose members had spent hundreds of hours preparing 
for the day's events. For the Super Quiz, the teams competed on three academic 
levels. Each team answered 10 multiple-choice questions on the topic of 
"Biotechnology: The Next Frontier." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Super Quiz, students competed in speech, essay writing, 
communication and academic areas such as economics, fine arts, language and 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools devoted class time to preparing students for the decathlon. Other 
students studied on their own, but the individual schools make it as 
competitive as they want, said Joel Walton, the decathlon coach at El Dorado 
High School in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition was sponsored by the Orange County Department of Education and 
designed to encourage students to work together in developing knowledge and to 
have fun, said Sharon Nelson, one of the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fun is in the challenge," said Greg Guerrero, 17, of Anaheim High School. 
"It challenges your knowledge of the different areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the day's competition will be disclosed at a Dec. 1 awards banquet 
at the Disneyland Hotel.

VOLUNTEERS PLANT TREES, SEEDS OF HOPE; ENVIRONMENT: RESTORATION OF A CREEK BED 
IN NEWBURY PARK DRAWS 150 FROM AROUND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO WORK AND COMMUNE 
WITH NATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For environmentalists and nature enthusiasts, attempting to restore abused 
land to its natural habitat is a time-honored mission. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday's restoration project at Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa in Newbury 
Park provided a new experience for some of the 150 volunteers who soiled their 
hands planting coyote bush, coast live oak and other native species along a 
meandering dry creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 For 13-year-old Daryle Germany, taking part in the National Park Service's 
Potrero Creek restoration effort was his first trip away from the tumult and 
congestion of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The meadowlike site inside the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area 
proved to be an eye-opening change of venue for Daryle and his 21 Roosevelt 
High School classmates, who made the early morning trip north from Boyle 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "No honking horns, no sirens," Daryle said. "This is clean dirt. You should 
see the dirt back home." 
</P>
<P>
 The students were part of the park service's first attempt to restore riparian 
habitat -- land adjacent to a stream or river -- inside the Santa Monica 
Mountains park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The open space, which is encircled by grassy, rolling hills, has been robbed 
of its natural state after centuries of ranching and farming practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, it is our hope to restore the area to what it was before the 
Europeans arrived here around 1750," said Jim Benedict, the park service's 
chief of resource management for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Centuries ago, Benedict said, the banks of the Potrero Creek were lined with 
tall sycamore and black walnut trees and a rich undergrowth, which included 
wild rose and sage brush, elderberry bushes and wild rye. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, to help the park service meet its restoration goals, volunteers 
began arriving at the site about 8:30 a.m. A crisp breeze had many wearing 
sweat shirts and light jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants got to work quickly, and soon the shape of the dry creek bed was 
made noticeable from a distance as a human chain outlined its banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The small army of volunteers sank saplings and young bushes into pre-made 
holes along a one-third-mile stretch of the creek. Large buckets of water were 
hustled back and forth from a spigot to provide the plants a first drink in 
their new digs. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the participants, Saturday's event was a continuation of their 
desire to help heal the earth. Many of the volunteers were members of the 
Beverly Hills-based TreePeople, which donated 600 plants and provided shovels, 
wheelbarrows and other tools for the day's work. Local nurseries and private 
donors gave about 450 additional plants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Howell, 31, a seven-year TreePeople volunteer, traveled from Hermosa 
Beach to lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always enjoy coming back in a couple years to the sites and seeing the 
growth and the progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were members of the L.A.-based Rhapsody in Green environmental 
organization, a few Boy Scouts and members of the Riordan Leadership 
Development Program, a training group for service organization leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Husband and wife Bob McCoy and LeAnn Walters walked to the site from their 
home nearby to take part in the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 They hauled with them a tiny, 5-year-old oak tree. McCoy said he raised and 
nurtured the tree from a single acorn he had found in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're planting this tree as a memorial to my mother," Walters said. Walters 
said her mother was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. "It will grow as she 
fades," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the renewal of native habitat, park service officials said the Potrero 
Creek restoration efforts will provide valuable information for future 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration plan will serve as a kind of test site, said Rose 
Rumball-Peter, a natural resource specialist with the National Park Service who 
drafted the Potrero Creek Restoration Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Park rangers will study the use of fertilizer and an irrigation drip line for 
about two years. But it will take far longer to determine the ultimate success 
of the project, Rumball-Peter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't know for 50 to 100 years if this was actually a success," she said. 
"But we'll be learning a lot from this project."

ANAHEIM MAN SLAIN IN STORE ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim man working as a clerk in a convenience store was shot to death 
during a robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz Ghabour, 42, was shot shortly after 12:30 p.m. Friday when two young 
men with shaved heads entered the store and demanded money in the cash 
register, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Angie McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 In security camera videotape, Ghabour appeared to be handing over the money 
when one of the men shot him in the chest, McLaughlin said. The two men then 
ran outside and with two other men, also with shaved heads, and drove away in a 
1988 to 1991 gray Pontiac sedan with a metallic blue roof, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin said police do not know what prompted the robber to shoot Ghabour. 
</P>
<P>
 "From looking at the (security) videotape, (Ghabour) looked like he was doing 
what he was supposed to," she said. "The suspect was pointing and reaching for 
something, then the screen clicks and you can't see if he got the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghabour was pronounced dead at Brea Community Hospital just after 1 p.m., 
McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men are also suspected of robbing another convenience store in West 
Covina nine minutes later, she said. No one was injured in that robbery.

VOLUNTEERS HELP SHARE THE THANKSGIVING BOUNTY; CHARITY: AGENCIES IN IRVINE AND 
LOS ALAMITOS BEGIN TO DISTRIBUTE FOOD BASKETS. NEEDY FAMILIES ARE PART OF THE 
FABRIC OF MIDDLE-CLASS COMMUNITIES, ORGANIZERS SAY.

<P>
 Talk about this master planned community and words like "tranquil," "safe," 
and "affluent" immediately come to mind. But for some local families "needy" is 
on the list too. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 Irvine families, victims of the sour economy or just bad luck, 
picked up holiday food baskets Saturday morning from Irvine Temporary Housing 
Inc., which organizes the outreach program each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Donated by local businesses, religious groups and service organizations, the 
food baskets included not only traditional Thanksgiving fare, but also enough 
groceries to last through the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, event organizers worried they wouldn't have enough food 
to meet the community's needs, but last-minute donations helped fill their 
warehouse. In addition to the Thanksgiving program, the charity helps feed 
about 1,200 families annually from its food bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irvine community is really generous," said Margie Wakeham, the 
organization's director. "This is the time of the year people give so much that 
we can stock our food pantry until spring. We really count on this every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 20 volunteers with We Care of Los Alamitos also presented 
about 140 families with Thanksgiving food baskets Saturday morning at St. 
Isidore Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," said Paula Avchen, program director of We Care. "The families 
were very grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, the Trausch family was among the 100 volunteers who pitched in to 
distribute an estimated two tons of potatoes, 160 turkeys, aluminum cooking 
trays and other holiday staples. This is the second year in a row the Irvine 
family has participated in the charitable program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people, you'll never forget their sincerity and their true 
acknowledgment that what you've done has helped," said Tom Trausch, 47, who 
volunteered Saturday even though he was recovering from shoulder surgery and 
still had his arm in a sling. "It's so rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 His 12-year-old daughter, Stacy, who handed out baby clothes to families, said 
she believes "it's real important to do this and to help your community, and 
help people get back on their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers are instructed to safeguard the privacy of food recipients. For 
most families in this middle-class community, accepting food donations carries 
a severe stigma, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are families out there who need the help and won't ask for it 
because they are too embarrassed," Wakeham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Temporary Housing itself suffered a loss two years ago when at least 
$80,000 disappeared. The group's former executive director, Clyde E. Weinman, 
was convicted of diverting the money for his personal use. In March, Weinman 
was sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before Thanksgiving, the organization expects to hand out another 
40 or 50 food baskets to families who couldn't make it into the center 
Saturday. The entire holiday production requires about six weeks of planning, 
but it's worth the effort, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project is just plain hard work," Wakeham said. "It's a lot of lifting 
and sorting. It's not a lot of fun. But there is so much seasonal goodwill 
here. It's just tremendous."

TRAPPED BY BLAZE AT HOME, FAMILY LEAPS TO SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A husband and wife held their 4-year-old son and jumped out a second-story 
window early Saturday when they were awakened by a fire that whipped through 
their home and trapped them upstairs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three family members, who fire officials would not identify, were treated 
for minor injuries and smoke inhalation and released from Kaiser Foundation 
Hospital, said Assistant Chief Jim Young of the Los Angeles Fire 
Department.There were no other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were called about 2:40 a.m. by a neighbor on the 20000 block of 
Gorgonia Street, a wooded mountain road just south of the Woodland Hills 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor heard screams and turned a garden hose on the blaze, Young 
said, "but the fire was so intense he couldn't make any progress on it." 
</P>
<P>
 It took about 55 firefighters and three water-dropping helicopters more than 
40 minutes to extinguish the blaze and keep it from spreading to the area's 
heavy brush or other homes, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said authorities suspect the fire was a result of electrical problems; 
the family told investigators they had problems Friday night with an upstairs 
circuit breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire burned completely through the second and third floors of the home, 
Young said. A portion of the roof collapsed under an air-conditioning system, 
which then fell into the house, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 City Fire Spokesman Bob Collis said the blaze caused about $325,000 damage.

 A controversial proposal to construct an innovative, "space-saver" school here 
has been dealt another blow with a finding by state officials that the site 
chosen for the project was not properly appraised. 
</P>
<P>
 A report prepared by state real estate officials concludes that the appraisals 
of the selected site, which is in a section of the Bristol MarketPlace shopping 
center, are not valid, one of its authors said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Harding, a state real estate expert who works for the Office of Local 
Assistance, said appraisals submitted to the state by the Santa Ana Unified 
School District were improper because they did not include price comparisons 
from other, similar properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said a major unanswered question for state officials involved the 
extent of ground water contamination at the shopping center site.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the problems," he said. "We review the appraisals for the 
acquisition of sites for school property, but in this case, we did not have any 
information of similarly contaminated property to compare them with." 
</P>
<P>
 The appraisal issue was the latest setback for the novel project, which has 
been mired in controversy, in part because of residents and officials who said 
the district did not give adequate consideration to cheaper sites. The State 
Allocation Board has set aside $23 million to purchase the shopping center site 
at Bristol and 17th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald G. Champlin, the district's interim superintendent, said Saturday he 
feared the new questions would further delay construction of the school, which 
is needed to ease serious overcrowding in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not aware of this problem at all," Champlin said. "The Allocation Board 
has already taken action on this, and I hope they will go forward with their 
earlier decision. We need the site and a school there as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Space-saver schools are built vertically, instead of horizontally, so they 
take up less space in crowded urban neighborhoods. Such schools are designed to 
avoid the need to condemn property to create new campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said his report, which will be considered at a Nov. 30 meeting of the 
Allocation Board, recommended that the board ask for another appraisal of the 
site, which would be the fourth.

NIGHT SHIFT WORKERS HAVE CHILD CARE NEEDS TOO; PARENTS: EVENING PROGRAMS SUCH 
AS ONE AT THE TORRANCE Y SEEK TO CREATE A FEELING OF FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It looks like dinner hour in any big family. Christopher, 8, passes out the 
paper dinner plates, Briana, 7, and Kaylee, 3, organize the plastic silverware. 
Altogether, six children sit down together to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's family style, but the children aren't at home.  
</P>
<P>
 During their meal of fish sticks, scalloped potatoes and salad, Cathryn 
Steven, 27, gently reminds them to stop kicking each other under the table and 
to try a bite of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 They are at the new YWCA Home Away From Home Evening Care program, where 
Steven and the staff have created the first nighttime child care available in 
the South Bay outside private homes.  
</P>
<P>
 As more families depend on a single parent or need both parents to work 
non-traditional hours, the need for flexible child care has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who work at night in refineries, restaurants, hospitals, police 
departments or the post office are just a few examples of those who need help 
with their children at night. Experts agree that the best place for a child to 
sleep is probably in his or her own bed, but not all parents can be at home. 
The next-best thing seems to be care-givers who create the feeling of family -- 
albeit a big family. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, grandparents or older siblings have cared for children while 
parents work. Sometimes parents could also find child care in someone's home.  
</P>
<P>
 But often tenuous arrangements for evening child care fail, leaving parents 
desperate. A study by Mobil Oil Corp. found that night-shift employees at its 
Torrance refinery had their share of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One divorced father has primary custody of his 7- and 8-year-old sons. Once, 
when his baby-sitter didn't show up, he brought his children to sleep in his 
car in the parking lot during his 12-hour graveyard shift. Another time he 
decided to leave the children home alone, but panicked when he called them 
about 7 p.m. and got no answer. He rushed home to find them fast asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 One mom arranged for her son's preschool teacher to drop him off at the Mobil 
parking lot, leaving him in her pickup truck. When she got out to the lot, the 
5-year-old wasn't there. Because another mother was late picking up her child, 
the teacher couldn't get away for more than half an hour. The Mobil worker said 
it was the most horrible feeling, not knowing where her child was. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 400 employees at its Torrance refinery on rotating schedules 
that include nights and weekends, Mobil found that the company was suffering 
because of child-care complications like these. A study sponsored by the 
company found that it could save an average of $6,000 a month if it could curb 
absenteeism caused by child-care problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil approached the Torrance YWCA to create a way to help parents cope with 
child care. The first step, a traditional preschool, opened in September, 1993. 
Mobil spent about $50,000 in labor and materials to construct the portable 
building that houses the daytime and evening care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened Sept. 14, the evening care program has registered more than 20 
children. Parents can bring little ones to the Carson Street building from 3 
p.m. to midnight Monday through Friday. The program accepts children 2 to 14.  
</P>
<P>
 The staff strives to create an orderly but relaxed mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not pizza in front of the TV," says YWCA child care director Rebecca 
Jessop. "It's more structured, with a home atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Each week the group's activities follow a theme. One week the subject was 
fall, so one day the children made leaf collages, the next they studied the 
changes in the trees on the playground, and on the third day they painted with 
fall colors -- yellow, brown and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Children bring pajamas, a towel, a toothbrush and bedding. Bedtime depends on 
the child's age. YWCA staff say the most important thing is to keep the 
children stimulated but provide a comfortable environment. 
</P>
<P>
 For evening care the YWCA charges $4.50 to $5.50 an hour for one or two 
children and $2.50 an hour for each additional child. Dinner costs $3 per 
child.  
</P>
<P>
 Because nurses work around the clock, much of the experience with evening 
child-care centers has been at hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
 One company that used to offer its employees evening child care was Children's 
Hospital of Los Angeles. For 10 years, the nurses on night shift could bring 
their youngsters to a conference room at the hospital for overnight care. When 
the furniture was shifted out of the way, children from 3 months to 16 years 
would camp out between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice part about it was that your child was here," said Ellen Zaman, 
director of patient family services for the hospital. "But there are a lot of 
people who see a down side to night care, because the child has to be 
(awakened) very early in the morning."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides having to move their beds and toys out of the way each day, the 
children washed, had breakfast and got ready for school at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a developmental standpoint, you don't have much of a family life if you 
are on site with your parent," Zaman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When costs forced the hospital to charge for the sleep-over care, participants 
dropped from 40 to 20. Last fall, the hospital discontinued the program and put 
all of its resources into daytime care, Zaman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents feel that the best possible solution when they have to work 
evening hours is to find another home where their children can stay.  
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bay, parents can find home-based evening child care through 
state-funded referral lines and private associations of home-care providers. 
These groups offer referrals to their members, but relatively few of the 
home-care providers offer evening hours. Of the 80 members of the South Bay 
Child Care Assn., for example, only five offer evening care. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kathi Darling started tending bar and taking paralegal classes at night, 
finding someone to trust with her baby presented a problem. Darling is 
separated from the boy's father, and the rest of her family lives in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Where could she take the cherubic 15-month-old? 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're looking for someone who'll let you show up at 3 in the morning to 
pick him up, they're hard to find," Darling said. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer turned out to be Kathy Harrison-Imel, another single mom who has 
her own toddler and does evening care in her home. Harrison-Imel is listed with 
several of the South Bay referral lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the same problem, Harrison-Imel had decided that if she couldn't 
find evening care for her daughter, Brittany, others might need help too. So 
about six months ago, she got a state license to care for children in her home. 
Now she specializes in evening and weekend care. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Holmstedt is another home-based evening care provider. She estimates that 
hundreds of children have spent time at her home preschool and evening care 
center in the 15 years she has been open. Their smiling pictures hang all over 
her house. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge castle, complete with turret and slide, dominates the main room, making 
Holmstedt's house look a bit like a Little Tikes distributorship. The toy 
manufacturer's play stations -- a workbench with plastic tools, an easel, 
stove, sink and cupboard and a beauty parlor set -- take up every inch of space 
along the walls in the room where the children play. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all the activity, the house has a sense of order and calm, with 
Holmstedt smoothing the way. She instructs the children to put back one play 
set before getting out another, and helps them resolve fights over toys with 
apologies and good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmstedt has cared for children in her Torrance home day and night since 
1979, when her own daughter needed someone to watch her twins as she worked 
rotating shifts for the Los Angeles Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 About five nights a week Holmstedt has children in the evening, and her 
daytime preschool almost always has a waiting list for one of the 12 spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley, a vivacious 22-month-old-with tiny dimples and pigtails, has a mom who 
drives a bus on a split shift. Ashley stays with the Holmstedts several days a 
week, sometimes starting as early as 4 a.m., and at other times remaining until 
late evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Holmstedt's daughter, many of the parents who need evening care come from 
law enforcement. Her current roster includes the children of Torrance and Los 
Angeles police officers and sheriff's deputies.  
</P>
<P>
 California law requires in-home day-care providers to get a license. Their 
homes are inspected for safety, and they must take 15 hours of instruction each 
year in CPR, first aid and infectious diseases. Each provider can care for up 
to six children alone, or 12 with an aide, and the care cannot last more than 
24 hours. For evening care the rules are the same, although the inspector will 
also look for comfortable places for the children to sleep, said Sallee Kraics 
of the state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the YWCA and home providers stress that the tone of evening care has to 
be different. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Holmstedt and her husband encourage the children to call them Nana and 
Papa. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we're trying to show them, that we're an extension of their 
family. They're a part of it, so they can relax," Holmstedt says. 
</P>
<P>
 The affectionate names reveal another reason home care is popular. Many 
families live far away from the traditional supports of grandparents and other 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Most evening-care providers try to create the feeling of family and community 
while winding down the day. Many of the children have been in preschools 
earlier in the day, and need a change of pace, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that you could create that would be as homelike as possible would 
give the children a sense of comfort," says Cynthia Whitham, a staff therapist 
in UCLA's parent training program. What children need, Whitham says, is a 
comforting atmosphere and a sense of structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Escobedo, associate director of the Child Care Resource Center in North 
Hollywood, agrees. Her agency gets more than 40 calls a month for referrals to 
evening child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents feel home care is like taking their children to a relative's 
house rather than an institution, Escobedo says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what makes it feel the most comfortable. Besides being a safe 
place, the child isn't missing out on the intimacies of settling down for the 
night," Escobedo says. "It kind of gives closure to the day."

HUMANE GROUP SEEKS TIGHTER RULES ON OFFICERS; LEGISLATION: A NEW REGULATION 
THAT GOES INTO EFFECT JAN. 1 WILL REQUIRE MORE TRAINING, BUT ANIMAL ADVOCATES 
CONTEND THAT IT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As crisply dressed officers bustle in and out of the sprawling Marin Humane 
Society headquarters, Rick Johnson makes his way through kennels filled with 
yapping dogs and into the main auditorium where the lectures are given. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here, in this cavernous room, where California's humane officers can 
choose to go for advanced training in such subjects as peace officer ethics, 
evidence collection and preservation, crime scene photography and the 
preparation and execution of search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a place, in effect, where humane officers charged with protecting 
animals from abuse and neglect learn how to be the sworn peace officers they 
already are. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a spacious library, exhibits depicting the history of humane officers 
and the animals they safeguard and a visitors center so the public can learn 
about these little-known agents of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to know what we are out there doing: trying to make it a 
better world for animals," said Johnson, who is president of the State Humane 
Assn. of California as well as a top official in the Marin Humane Society. 
"That ethic underlies everything we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, attendance at the modern center is not mandatory under the state 
laws that give humane officers their broad range of powers. Many officers, 
Johnson complained, never come here or to a similar site in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Although humane officers can conduct criminal investigations and make arrests 
where animals are concerned, many do not have the most rudimentary training in 
law and police procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 To be a humane officer is a complicated task; humane laws cross a huge 
spectrum of criminal and civil codes, and it takes a 343-page book to explain 
all the applicable state statutes, not to mention all the laws of each county. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Jan. 1, California's humane officers will be required to take 20 hours 
of training in animal care and at least 40 hours of training in state laws at 
accredited post-secondary institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson wishes more could be done to regulate humane officers. "Training 
is imperative if you are to use weapons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the state association, a private organization that led the effort last 
year to move the Legislature to strengthen the requirements, is considering 
proposing a measure to require monitoring boards in each county. Now, the 
presiding judge of the Superior Court in each county is charged with reviewing 
all applicants for humane officers within their jurisdiction before approving 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 That system is outdated, said Johnson, contending that the judges usually 
rubber-stamp the applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case in Los Angeles County, where officials say they simply send 
the forms to the state Department of Justice in Sacramento so fingerprints can 
be checked to see if the applicant has a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no indication that judges conduct any investigation beyond the 
fingerprint check, nothing to equal the exhaustive background and psychological 
examinations to which applicants for most police and sheriff's departments are 
subjected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their calendars are jampacked," Johnson said. "Their priorities are 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Sakach, a Sacramento-based investigator with the Humane Society of the 
United States, also said improvements are needed. But like Johnson, he said 
most humane officers are well-trained and well-behaved in upholding the laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one keeps statistics on the number of humane officers in the 
state, Sakach estimated that half of those in California carry firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 A slender man with the calm demeanor of a country doctor, Johnson, 46, 
grimaces when he hears tales of wayward humane officers overstepping the bounds 
of their authority.  
</P>
<P>
 Most problems, Johnson said, occur in large urban areas where police 
departments are too large to notice a few renegade humane officers running 
around in their uniforms. Most places, he said, "really don't have a problem 
with these Scud missiles like L.A. does." 
</P>
<P>
 And most humane officers, he said, not only do their job well and diligently, 
but serve an invaluable function at a time when their counterparts in state and 
local police departments are too busy with murders and rapes to keep a watchful 
eye on animals.

ACLU FAULTS AGENCIES' 'SEGREGATION'; DIVERSITY: STUDY SAYS SEVERAL 
PUBLIC-SAFETY DEPARTMENTS IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DON'T REFLECT THE ETHNIC 
MIX OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to diversity among police officers and firefighters, a new 
American Civil Liberties Union study finds that the San Gabriel Valley is 
decidedly lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 More public safety departments in the valley than in any other region of 
Southern California fail to reflect the race and gender of their communities, 
remaining largely white male domains, according to the study of agencies in 
eight counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the valley's biggest city, Pasadena, was rated at the top for 
diversity, the report released in late October rated eight local agencies as 
among Southern California's "most segregated" by gender and ethnicity. Several 
of those departments have no women and few, if any, employees of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The San Gabriel Valley is simply the worst place for this problem," said 
Allan Parachini, ACLU director of public affairs, who oversaw the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials downplayed the significance of the study, saying that progress 
is being made but because of low turnover and tight budgets they have had 
little opportunity to hire at all. 
</P>
<P>
 They also faulted the report for paying no attention to recent efforts to hire 
minorities and complained that the study used the terms segregated and 
integrated as though minorities and women were kept separate from others in the 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU officials countered that the departments have not made enough of an 
effort to keep up with changing times. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel was one of four cities in Southern California and the only one in 
the San Gabriel Valley to have both its Police Department and Fire Department 
appear on the ACLU's "most severely segregated" list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alhambra, Covina and Irwindale police departments made the list of the 20 
"most segregated" law enforcement agencies, and Monterey Park, San Marino and 
West Covina fire departments were among the 15 most segregated fire 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park, which is 57.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, has no Asian or Pacific 
Islander firefighters. Nor does San Gabriel, which is 38% Asian/Pacific 
Islander. The 72-member West Covina Fire Department has no women or people of 
Asian descent in a city in which 50% of residents are female and 17.2% 
Asian/Pacific Islander. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwindale made the list because its Police Department has no female, African 
American or Asian American officers. However, the city is only 0.1% Asian and 
2.3% black. A majority of its Police Department is Latino, the figures show, as 
is the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 31 public safety departments in the valley, nine do not have any 
African Americans and nine are without a single Asian American. Seven of the 
valley's 12 fire departments do not have a female firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Pasadena's Fire Department and Police Department were rated the 
"best integrated." 
</P>
<P>
 "With the passage of time, Pasadena has developed a uniquely successful 
minority and female recruiting program that appears to have no equal in the 
region," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a 1983 legal settlement, the city has been required to meet minority 
hiring levels in those departments. "We have made a concerted effort to support 
diversity," Councilman Rick Cole said. "Our surveys show these are the 
departments that citizens have contact with the most."  
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU, which surveyed 107 police departments and 80 fire departments in 
eight counties and compared the figures to the 1990 U.S. Census, ranked 
departments on how closely their composition reflected that of their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU officials said they have asked federal agencies "to investigate race and 
gender segregation" among departments in general and called for local 
politicians to hold top commanders accountable for improving the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But local officials said many of the white males whose numbers dominate 
several departments were hired when the communities resembled them. "Obviously, 
you can't just get rid of employees," said David Lawton, chief of the San 
Gabriel Police Department, which has seen its Asian American community grow to 
around a third of the population in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire chiefs across the region say the problem is exacerbated by 
declining budgets as cities see their revenues trimmed by the recession and 
state government. That has put hiring at a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawton said the ACLU study does not show the progress that has been made 
because it never asked about recent efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've personally stood outside a department store used by Asian Americans 
handing out recruitment leaflets," Lawton said, adding that in the past year 
the department has gone from zero Asian American officers to four, plus a 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Lawton said his department has changed rules to increase the 
recruitment pool, advertised in Asian-language newspapers as well as in Latino 
publications, and even had feature stories in Asian-language papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight of the last 10 police officers hired by the Police Department were 
minorities," said Julio J. Fuentes, Alhambra city manager. "To call it a 
segregated department is simply not fair. It makes it sound like we are doing 
it intentionally."  
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra in 1991 settled suits by the federal government for alleged racial 
discrimination in hiring public-safety employees by agreeing to revise hiring, 
set up a fund to settle discrimination claims and file hiring reports with the 
U.S. Justice Department twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu said too many recruiters for local public safety 
agencies believe the stereotype about people of Asian descent not wanting those 
positions and so do not aggressively recruit them. "You need specialized 
outreach programs. Our Police Department was one of the first to go onto 
college campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Chu said there are no excuses for her majority-Asian city not having a single 
Asian American firefighter. But she is optimistic that new leadership in the 
Fire Department will turn things around. She added, "We only recently got our 
first woman."

BIAS LAWSUIT AGAINST EL MONTE ENDS; JOBS: U.S. HAD ORIGINALLY ALLEGED 64 
VICTIMS. JUDGE RULES THAT TWO INDIVIDUALS HAD BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government's 4-year discrimination lawsuit against El Monte has 
ended after a federal court judge ruled that two individuals had been 
discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Department of Justice had alleged that the city denied blacks and 
Asian Americans entry-level jobs as police officers and firefighters. The two 
individuals, who were the only ones left in the suit after a long wrangle 
between the city and Justice Department, will receive $20,000 in compensation 
each, for a total city payout of $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That reduced number contrasts dramatically with the 64 possible victims 
originally brought forward by the federal Department of Justice, the $330,000 
the city was required to set aside for all those victims and the $550,000 the 
city ultimately spent on legal fees fighting the federal case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like it was kind of a witch hunt," said El Monte Mayor Patricia 
Wallach. "It's just ludicrous that the Department of Justice came in with a 
case this thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach's complaints were echoed by lawyers representing three other cities, 
Alhambra and Pomona in the San Gabriel Valley and Torrance in the South Bay. 
All three cities have been accused of discrimination in hiring police officer 
and firefighters and were likewise sued by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials say they prosecuted the cities only after 
receiving discrimination complaints against them and after investigating to 
find sufficient legal grounds to file the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The department began legal action against El Monte in 1990. According to 
federal officials, the city's 107-member police force had only one black member 
and its 66-member fire department only one Asian American firefighter. Federal 
officials argued that the low numbers were the result of discriminatory hiring 
policies from 1985 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the city agreed to set aside $330,000 in compensation for alleged 
victims. The Justice Department put ads in local newspapers asking people who 
thought they were victims of discrimination to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 After sifting through 64 claims, the city agreed to pay 14 individuals, said 
Mary Dollarhide, the attorney who represented El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the city discovered that the first person on the list was a white 
male and the second person had a criminal record that would have disqualified 
him for a job as a police officer, El Monte officials decided to contest the 
payment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other alleged victims were disqualified for compensation because they 
would have been too old at the time of application to have been hired as police 
or fire cadets, Dollarhide said. Others were eliminated for other, similar 
kinds of reasons that the Department of Justice could have easily checked, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were coming out and doing what I perceive to be sloppy work," Dollarhide 
said. "If we hadn't challenged them, we would have forked out money to Mr. 
White Guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The city believes that the final two candidates also do not qualify. One lacks 
the educational background claimed on her application and another failed a 
number of qualifying tests for other police departments, Dollarhide said. But 
after Los Angeles U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real ruled against the city 
on Nov. 7, the City Council decided to end the costly legal battle and pay the 
remaining two, Dollarhide said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating from the city's point of view," Wallach said. She added 
that city officials kept battling the federal government instead of simply 
paying the money because city officials did not believe the city was guilty of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials still deny that they discriminated against anyone. According to 
statistics in a recent ACLU study of police and fire departments, El Monte now 
has three blacks and four Asian Americans on its 126-member police force. Among 
the city's 57 firefighters, one is black and one is Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say the low numbers do not reflect patterns of 
discrimination, but simply the difficulty of attracting minority candidates to 
work in small cities where pay is usually lower than in larger urban agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the three other cities sued by the Justice Department are also 
crying foul. The number of victims will ultimately amount to a few handfuls and 
not the scores initially claimed by the government, the attorneys contend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sellers' market for minority public safety workers," said Drew 
Bridges, Alhambra's attorney. Alhambra recently lost to the city of San Jose 
its black police chief, Raymond Brooks, who was hired by Alhambra after a 
nationwide recruitment, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government claimed that nearly 100 individuals were discriminated 
against in Alhambra. But by checking each claim, many applicants were 
eliminated and the final number might actually be closer to 10, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are ludicrous," agreed Torrance City Atty. John Fellows, whose 
city is sifting through 76 claims. "It's the closest thing to extortion that 
you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Pomona, which was accused of discriminating against black police 
officers, may reach a resolution with the federal government by the end of the 
year, said Pomona City Atty. Arnold Alvarez-Glasman. The city, which set aside 
$160,000 for compensation and $40,000 for a recruitment program, has nearly 
finished sifting through the claims of 44 people, Alvarez-Glasman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite nearly four years of negotiations and a consent decree issued two 
years ago, Pomona still maintains it did not discriminate, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials say their cases are not undermined by the small 
number of individuals entitled to compensation. Claimants are hard to find 
because city records are often destroyed, job candidates move away and not all 
those entitled to benefits submit claims, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials also said compensation is not the sole result of lawsuits. 
Cities also are required to improve their hiring and promotional practices as 
part of the agreements reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, they denied allegations of sloppy research in the El Monte case. They 
pointed out that backgrounds and other factors that disqualified minority 
candidates did not pose an obstacle to white candidates who were hired and are 
now working for the city.

PACIFIC PALISADES PARKLAND DEAL SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a five-year stalemate, a church group has tentatively agreed to sell 
its historic Pacific Palisades conference grounds to the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy for use as parkland, a conservancy official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said the agency has 
agreed to pay $4 million to acquire the 140-acre Presbyterian Conference Center 
from the Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and Hawaii by the end of 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is extremely significant, and we're elated that it's finally happening," 
said Edmiston, adding that "minor details" were to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the synod, which represents about 300 churches, had no 
comment on the sale agreement. She referred questions to Rafael Aragon, the 
synod's executive director, who was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the negotiations, however, said that church officials 
decided to sell the property at Sunset Boulevard and Temescal Canyon Road 
rather than proceed with a costly lawsuit to try to force the state to build a 
roadway onto parkland next door to its property. 
</P>
<P>
 The church group has long contended that the state is obligated to build the 
road, considered vital to the synod's long-stated intention to develop its 
property. During the 1980s, the synod had expressed interest in building a new 
meeting and lodging facility to hold 1,000 people. Faced with community 
opposition, it had scaled back its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have long coveted the rugged property -- bordered by 
parkland on three sides -- as the last remaining link in the effort to connect 
Temescal Gateway Park with Topanga State Park and the extensive Santa Monica 
Mountains trail system beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference center began in the 1920s as a place where Methodists held 
summer religious gatherings. The Presbyterians, who bought the property in 
1943, have used it as a retreat center and church youth camp. 
</P>
<P>
 To buy the property, the conservancy will use Proposition A funds administered 
by Los Angeles County, including $3 million earmarked for an outdoor camp 
program for at-risk youths. County supervisors approved the use of the funds 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The church group filed its lawsuit against the state and the Los Angeles 
Unified School District in 1989. The district had acquired the property from 
the synod by condemnation in 1968 to build a school, but sold it to the 
conservancy in 1992 after plans for the school were scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 The synod contends that it was assured by the school district that the road 
would be built on the property and that the synod could share it. The synod 
insisted that the conservancy inherited the obligation to build the road as a 
condition of its purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to sell the property comes as the synod faces a Nov. 30 deadline 
imposed by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to either proceed with the 
lawsuit or have it dismissed.

COMMITTEE WORKS TO SAVE CHURCH; TEMPLE-BEAUDRY AREA: OUR LADY OF THE HOLY 
ROSARY MISSION HAS HISTORIC TIES TO THE ONCE-VIBRANT L.A. NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside a little faded-yellow church surrounded by dirt lots in Temple-Beaudry, 
symmetrical lines on the brown tile floor mark where pews once stood. Spiders 
are now the only visitors to the confessional booths, leaving behind cobwebs in 
place of sins. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Sunday Mass was celebrated at Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Mission on 
Aug. 29, 1993, shortly after the Archdiocese of Los Angeles agreed to sell the 
property on the northwest corner of Colton Street and Beaudry Avenue to the Los 
Angeles Unified School District for the construction of a new middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is slated to begin in a year. But several former members of the 
congregation are still unwilling to let go of the church they considered the 
cornerstone of their once-vibrant neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee to Save Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Mission, a fledgling group 
of 10 current and former area residents, has leased the one-acre property from 
the school district, using the vacated church building as a community center 
while trying to raise funds to move the structure to an unspecified site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first intention is to preserve our heritage," said Luisa Vela, a 
paralegal who raised her children in the neighborhood during the late 1960s and 
early 1970s. "We want to preserve the sense of family unity this church gave to 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation of the former church into El Rosario Community Center has 
begun. Vela and the rest of the committee are planning to polish the floor and 
paint the walls, removing the grayish outlines that mark where stations of the 
cross hung undisturbed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Luisa Padilla, who spent her teen-age years down the street from the 
church and now directs the nonprofit Concerned Citizens of Echo Park Youth 
Empowerment Council, they have brought to the community center free evening 
classes in English for adults, and arts and crafts classes for neighborhood 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is in the process of looking for a van to take local youngsters 
on field trips to plays and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has also invited other community groups to use the space for 
meetings. Several fund-raisers are planned for next month -- including a 
hair-cutting party, rummage sales and a children's Christmas play -- to 
continue to expand activities and help buttress the donations and members' own 
money that pay the $800 monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to build the place up," said Padilla, whose teen-age home was 
demolished long ago for a new development that was never built. "If it becomes 
well-known as a community center, hopefully we'll able to attract more help." 
</P>
<P>
 Vela, the group's secretary, is looking into grants to pay the cost of moving 
and preserving the church building, which dates back to the 1920s. So far, the 
least expensive estimate she has heard for moving the structure is $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the church to bulldozers, which are scheduled to begin rolling through 
in late 1995, would be too much to bear for a neighborhood that, over the 
years, has lost much of its sense of community to demolition in the name of 
development, little of which has actually taken place, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these streets that are now empty were filled with rows of houses," she 
said. "Everyone was like family around here. The people who lived here were 
longtime residents. And this church was the heart of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The site on which Our Lady of the Holy Rosary sits is its third, Vela said. 
Originally constructed by Mexican Catholics who were unable to attend white 
churches, its first site was near the intersection of Grand Avenue and Temple 
Street, an area now taken up by the Hollywood Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 The church was relocated to a site across Beaudry in 1942 and moved to its 
present location in 1975 when Bank of America bought its previous site, Vela 
said. The current land was donated by a parishioner, and relocation costs were 
covered by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school district offered relocation money to the archdiocese when 
it first offered to buy the property for about $2.6 million, the archdiocese 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't make sense," said Neal Blaney, the archdiocese's director of real 
estate. "First, we didn't have any place to move it to, and it would have been 
an inefficient use of space and resources. The number of parishioners attending 
that church was very small." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who used to attend church services disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it was a religious holiday, it was so crowded you couldn't even enter," 
said Emma Palma, a former neighbor who lived near the church for 32 years 
before relocating to Echo Park after her home was demolished for development in 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Vela, who moved to Santa Monica around the same time, remembers coming to the 
church even after her family left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people who had relocated would come to Sunday Mass here," she said. 
"It was always crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Although priests no longer visit Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, a handful of 
former congregation members still gather occasionally for informal prayer 
meetings. Older members of the community, who Padilla said still consider the 
building their church, sometimes drop by to meditate. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's lease expires in August, 1995. District officials said they 
hope that by that time the group will have found a way to relocate the church 
before the onset of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the committee will keep trying to come up with a new site and 
the funds it needs, one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still believe in miracles," Palma said wistfully. "We're hoping for one."

MAN HELD OVER BOMB IN TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who left a pickup truck parked in an alley with a homemade bomb in its 
bed was arrested Friday night, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Palmasano, 34, a Utah resident, is expected to be arraigned Monday or 
Tuesday on charges of possessing an explosive device and an illegal firearm, 
said Sheriff's Deputy Benita Hinojos of the department's Headquarters 
bureau.Palmasano is being held at the sheriff's Antelope Valley substation in 
lieu of $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found the bomb, and an illegal sawed-off shotgun, while investigating 
a truck parked illegally in an alley near 3rd Street and Avenue H-13, Hinojos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmasano, who was arrested when he returned to the truck, told officers he 
was visiting a friend. It has not been determined why he had the bomb, Hinojos 
said.

PALMDALE DISTRICT NEEDS DONATIONS TO FINISH PLANETARIUM; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS 
SAY THEY ARE HALFWAY TO THE $500,000 THAT WOULD CONVERT THE DOMED THEATER AT 
CACTUS ELEMENTARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the real world the fiery Halley's Comet is not slated to make another 
appearance for about 66 years. In the Palmdale School District, officials hope 
the famed comet -- or virtually any other celestial object -- will soon be able 
to appear in command performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17,000-student district plans to open a planetarium, where man-made star 
shows will give students a glimpse of the universe more memorable than what 
they can garner from a book. 
</P>
<P>
 The K-8 district has been working toward the opening of the planetarium for 
several years and lacks just one basic element to make it come alive: money. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3,400-square-foot planetarium theater building was built at Cactus 
Elementary School two years ago when the 39-year-old campus underwent a 
state-funded modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state would not build a planetarium per se," said Fred Thompson, 
president of the district's board of trustees. "They would build a classroom 
that ultimately through private funds or other funds not allocated to support 
the curriculum (could be converted into a planetarium)." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has so far raised about half of the nearly $500,000 needed to 
equip the 40-foot interior dome with a projection system, tilt-back chairs and 
other items that will transform the theater into an operating planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has received about $29,000 in donations and has saved nearly 
$192,000 in state furnishings and equipment money. Redevelopment funds from the 
city of Palmdale added another $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the planetarium was born several years ago when officials and 
board members from the rapidly growing district visited Texas to look at school 
design. Thompson said one campus housed a planetarium that educators used to 
enhance learning in a number of fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty excited about it," he said. "I thought it would be a good idea 
if we incorporated something like that in our district." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the planetarium can be used not only for the study of astronomy 
but also for such fields as mathematics and biology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has other applications, limited only by a teacher's imagination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the 105-seat planetarium is a reality, Thompson said, school districts 
throughout the Antelope Valley as well as people in the community will be able 
to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Balogh, a physical science professor at Antelope Valley College who 
used to teach astronomy and has provided technical assistance to the Palmdale 
School District, said the planetarium offers significant benefits to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can teach (astronomy) indoors, but a planetarium allows it to be 
exciting, interesting for the kids," Balogh said. "A planetarium will leave 
them with a good memory of that part of science." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only substitute for a planetarium, he said, is a dark sky. "We don't have 
that in the Antelope Valley. You have to go farther and farther out to get a 
dark sky." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Balogh said, you do not have to wait up half the night in cold weather 
in hopes of catching a glimpse of a meteor with a planetarium, where you can 
make the night sky host a meteor shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an effective teaching tool," he said, noting that it is the high 
cost that makes planetariums something of a rarity in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Smedley, a science and math consultant for the Los Angeles County 
Office of Education, said the planetarium will be the first in the county on an 
elementary school campus. Beverly Hills School District has a planetarium at 
its high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of schools own portable, inflatable planetariums," said Smedley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice way of teaching . . . helping them understand where we are in the 
universe, our place in the universe," he added. "It's important that kids know 
what's out there beyond our atmosphere and where we fit in the scheme of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Fish, assistant superintendent of educational services, said she hopes 
the planetarium will be operational in a year. The district is considering 
whether to solicit bids to complete the planetarium and begin work with the 
money already in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enough to get the project started," she said. "We would have to do an 
all-out fund-raiser to get the whole project going." 
</P>
<P>
 For a donation of $300,000, the district is willing to name the planetarium in 
the donor's honor, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those with less to give, there are other ways to have their names 
included in the theater building. Wall plaques will be mounted on a donor wall. 
For a $250 gift a person can buy a chair or have a degree of the dome named 
after him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The projection system, slide shows . . . should have an interest for the 
whole Antelope Valley," she said. "We hope it will be a cultural attraction and 
a learning center for students, a resource center for the study of astronomy."

DESPITE THE PROTESTS, THE DOO DAH PARADE IS BACK; PASADENA: MERCHANTS SAY IT'S 
BAD FOR BUSINESS. LAST YEAR'S CHANGE OF FORMAT WAS A FLOP. BUT THE EVENT IS 
RETURNING FOR '94, LOVE IT OR HATE IT.

 The Doo Dah Parade is a type of ritual activity called a "rite of reversal," 
which anthropologists have found to occur in many societies. . . . Through 
caricature and parody, standing the world on its head, participants playfully 
convey serious messages at which observers may not legitimately take offense."  
</P>
<P>
 -- 1982 study by Denise Lawrence, director 
</P>
<P>
 Center for Visual Anthropology, USC 
</P>
<P>
 The Doo-Dah Disaster is a pathetically unimaginative hodgepodge of thrift-shop 
assemblages providing a background, and excuse, for a mawkish exhibition of 
public cavorting by welfare beneficiaries who should be seeking employment. -- 
Letter to the Pasadena Star-News, 1979 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody loves an anti-parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1978, Doo Dah Parade founder Peter Apanel has single-handedly put 
together an annual spoof of the Rose Parade that refuses to die, even though 
some people wished it would and thought it had (may its Lost Sock Brigade find 
its way to that great dryer in the sky). 
</P>
<P>
 Not even its Church of the Ornamental Lawn Decorations entry -- dedicated to 
pink flamingos -- was thought to have a prayer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the bugler's taps -- there's a funky drum roll on the horizon. Or is it 
the faint heartbeat of a wounded animal, tired of being shot at and ready to 
strike again? 
</P>
<P>
 Doo Dah -- by the seat of its too-loud pants -- is ready to march forward, 
even though it makes no money, a group of Old Pasadena merchants circulated a 
petition against it and last year's switch to a smaller, ticketed event near 
City Hall was a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 All this led to premature speculation about its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the biggest issue we have is getting people to know we're back," 
said Apanel, a 43-year-old South Pasadena resident. "A lot of people thought 
last year was the end . . . Clearly, it didn't work (last year)." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event is Doo Dah redux, part II, starting at 11:30 a.m. next 
Sunday. The parade will move in a new, faster format, free-of-charge and back 
in the streets of Old Pasadena, with a post-event festival from 1:30 to 4:30 
p.m. in Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Light-Bringer Project, a Pasadena nonprofit arts organization, is 
co-sponsoring the parade and festival as part of an effort to recruit more 
local entries and bolster Doo Dah's community spirit, Apanel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Old favorites will be back, such as the Torment of Roses and in-drag West 
Hollywood Cheerleaders. New community entries will come from several sources, 
including Caltech, the Art Center College of Design and King's Village housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Apanel shakes his head at the absurdity of it all -- the 
divisiveness over an event that was conceived on a bar stool and then grew into 
a monstrous undertaking, with 40,000 spectators and live TV coverage in its 
heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a parade," he says in those moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it is -- and for whatever anthropological reasons -- Doo Dah evokes a 
love-it-or-hate-it reaction at the drop of a rose petal. 
</P>

 Some merchants say it's bad for business and provokes antics such as 
spectators throwing tortillas at paraders, a Doo Dah tradition gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's been pushed down our throats," said Mark Matrese, manager of 
Cityscapes furniture store on Colorado Boulevard. "We feel it has absolutely no 
redeeming value whatsoever. . . . This parade has not generated any money for 
local businesses. It litters. It (creates) traffic problems. It's out of hand. 
. . . I've seen flying tortillas slam off the (store) windows." 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants say they do business like gangbusters on Doo Dah days. 
</P>
<P>
 At Market City Caffe on South Fair Oaks Avenue, co-owner Chipper Pastron said 
Doo Dah is his biggest day of the year, busier even than during the World Cup, 
Rose Bowl or Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Spectators) get done with the parade, and they patronize the local 
businesses because they know them," Pastron said. "In my opinion, the Doo Dah 
Parade is everything we want in this area. It's a Pasadena event. It was 
created here. It's a family event. . . . The most important thing about this is 
just the idea of a parade, something fun and funky and home grown." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, along the way, the parade -- which Apanel describes as Little Rascals 
meets Fellini -- turned political. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the worst year ever in terms of politics and financial 
hassles," groaned Apanel, who runs the parade as his full-time job and 
occasionally takes on part-time work to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 After last year's bust at City Hall, many thought Doo Dah was done and 
overdone -- stick a fork in it. That was fine with some merchants in Old 
Pasadena, who said it killed not only business but the area's tony image as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction was swift and vehement among anti-Doo Dah forces when word got around 
that the parade was back. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel didn't get his parade permit until last week -- only two weeks before 
show time -- as he and city officials wrangled over details such as 
requirements and fees for security, cleanup and street closures. City officials 
tried to keep the merchants' objections in mind, said Robert Baderian, 
recreation and parks director. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 members of the Old Pasadena Business and Professional Assn. -- 
one-third of the group -- had signed a petition asking the city to deny Apanel 
a parade permit, said Ray Leier, association president. 
</P>
<P>
 But Apanel contends that only a few conservative merchants are against him and 
that many told him they were pressured to sign the petition or misunderstood 
what they were signing. 
</P>
<P>
 The association and Apanel accuse each other of refusing to compromise and 
work together. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the objections, for instance, is the parade's timing, on the Sunday 
after Thanksgiving, the busiest shopping weekend of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel denies that Doo Dah is bad for business and that the post-Thanksgiving 
weekend is as big a shopping weekend as merchants say it is. Doo Dah, he said, 
is traditionally held on that Sunday, and regulars anticipate that date every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In an April meeting, Apanel said he offered to negotiate the date with 
association officials, but they refused to listen. But Jack Smith, a past 
association president, said it was Apanel who refused to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have made plans and worked with merchants a long time ago," said 
Smith, owner of California Basket Co. on Raymond Avenue. "Peter's here one day 
a year. I'm here 365 days a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Apanel: "What they really want is a segregated, high-end theme park 
in Old Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the parade is going forward, Leier said, the association wants to 
make peace and forge a working relationship before plans for a 1995 Doo Dah get 
under way. In fact, the association's radio ads for Old Pasadena's Holiday Open 
House even plug Doo Dah as part of the area's Thanksgiving weekend event 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't fight 'em, join 'em," said Leier, a former Doo Dah Parade 
participant himself. "Now I say, do we continue to fight? Or do we say, 'Let's 
make it a good parade and let's try to deal with (concerns) next year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel says he has tinkered with Doo Dah's format in response to the 
merchants' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the parade's free-wheeling spirit had prompted a few 
spectators to get out of hand. Some have thrown marshmallows and mucked up the 
streets with stringy aerosol spray foam. In 1992, the City Council passed the 
"Silly String ordinance," aimed at banning such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in an effort to gain more control, Apanel decided to charge 
admission, limit attendance to 5,000 and cut the number of parade entries in 
half to 50, having them march in a loop around City Hall Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But his plan backfired. The parade drew a disappointing 2,500 spectators and 
30 entries. Admission was $7 in advance and $10 on Doo Dah day, but revenue was 
barely enough to cover expenses, let alone make up for the loss of KCOP-TV's 
contract fee to broadcast the parade. (The TV station had opted not to televise 
the parade in its new format; Apanel declines to say how much money was 
involved in that contract.) 
</P>
<P>
 This year, to push the event along faster, Doo Dah will be more of a 
Renaissance Faire-style procession, with the entries moving together as a group 
rather than as a consecutive parade. 
</P>
<P>
 It will end at a party in Memorial Park, with performance artists and 
musicians, including Dread Zeppelin, a reggae band with a lead singer dressed 
as Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers are expected to join in the revelry. Streets will close only when 
the entourage passes, rather than for the duration of the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, the theory goes, crowds will leave less of a mess and block 
storefronts for only a short time. At the same time, Apanel's expenses will be 
reduced because fewer police officers and portable toilets will be required. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, with more local entries, Apanel said, the event is less likely to get 
out of control. In the past, he said, a few outsiders with no regard for the 
community have misinterpreted the parade as an excuse for mindless partying. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel contends, however, that Doo Dah's wild reputation is unfounded. In 17 
parades, there has not been a single arrest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Police Lt. Rick Law said records are unavailable on whether police 
have made any arrests during Doo Dah's entire history, although he said he does 
not recall any arrests in the parade's last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Law said, police have kept with the parade's generally good-natured 
spirit. This year, however, police will no longer tolerate illegal activities 
such as drinking in public and throwing tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to curtail and quell some of those activities," Law said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of this year's 75 entries come from community groups, including a 
children's entry from King's Village, a federally funded, low-income housing 
project in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's entry includes a stuffed dragon -- made of tin cans, old 
material and pasteboard -- and a drill team, said Ralph Poole, the project's 
program coordinator. The children are so excited that they are rehearsing on 
Saturdays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Poole said, he was wary of Doo Dah's raunchy reputation, but he was 
happy to be included once he heard about the community emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 "For my children who live in King's Village, there's a sort of alienation, of 
always being left out," he said. "If you think about it, the chances of any of 
these kids ever participating in a Rose Parade is a long shot at best. . . . We 
don't have to be involved in the raunchiness, but we can still be part of the 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Doo Dah is a chance to meet neighbors and be goofy at the same time, a Main 
Street-of-the-'90s vibe, said Thomas Coston, director of the Light-Bringer 
Project, the event's co-sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to cast spears at the Rose Parade, but (Doo Dah) is participatory. . . . 
People want to feel part of something. It's a connecting force," said Coston, 
who was an urban cowboy in the first Doo Dah, playing Jimi Hendrix tunes on an 
accordion. 
</P>
<P>
 Doo Dah started out as a simple little venture that Apanel dreamed up with 
friends in a bar in 1977 as a Rose Parade alternative -- no theme, no judging, 
no prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel, who has a degree in political science from Cal State Los Angeles, 
decided to do just that, organizing the first event in his spare time after 
working nights as a hospital orderly. After a few years, the parade started 
taking up so much time that Apanel quit his job to work on Doo Dah full time. 
Soon, Doo Dah-style parades sprung up nationwide in such places as Washington, 
D.C.; Columbus, Ohio, and Ocean City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Apanel, who is single and lives in a studio apartment, said he 
barely broke even the past couple of years and never made more than $20,000 for 
a year's work on the parade. This year, he expects to lose money.

MYSTERY SURROUNDS SUIT AGAINST O.C. CONSULTANTS; COURTS: SEALED DOCUMENTS 
ALLEGE DECEPTIVE FUND-RAISING TACTICS. LAWYERS FOR THE PAIR DISMISS THE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For four years, hundreds of pleadings, motions and depositions taken in a 
politically sensitive civil suit -- enough to fill a pair of three-drawer 
filing cabinets -- have been hidden away in an off-limits room in the basement 
of the Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems to know who ordered the suit concealed from public view, or why. 
No one can find the court order declaring it secret. Even the attorneys cannot 
-- or will not -- say how it became sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 But documents that have surfaced elsewhere reveal that the sealed records 
contain accusations that millions of dollars collected from civic-minded 
Californians by political action committees were transferred to another 
organization that has never publicly disclosed how the money was spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sealed from public scrutiny are charges that two controversial and 
powerful Newport Beach political consultants arranged to be paid nearly half 
the donated millions as their fees. And the files allude to criminal 
investigations of certain unnamed defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The adversary of these well-connected political consultants is a shy, 
45-year-old accountant from Sherman Oaks, determined in his fight to bring 
certain matters to light, while his legal battle to do so is inexplicably kept 
in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret case has been reassigned to at least five different judges, and at 
least once to a special litigation panel of Superior Court judges when the case 
became overwhelmingly complex. 
</P>
<P>
 And decisions in the lawsuit have bounced up to the Court of Appeal so 
frequently -- at least five times -- that when the case was sent back to 
Superior Court last year, the justices wrote, "If we could issue frequent flyer 
miles, these (lawsuit) parties would qualify for a free trip somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated attempts by the two principal defendants, William Butcher and 
Arnold Forde, to get the lawsuit thrown out, the long-secret suit is scheduled 
to go to trial in Orange County Superior Court on Monday before a judge without 
a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Two judges who have presided over the case acknowledge that all documents 
relating to the lawsuit have been sealed, even though the California Supreme 
Court has long held "there can be no doubt that court records are public 
records, available to the public in general." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extraordinary," said Gary Phillips, the plaintiff's attorney, whose 
partner accidentally discovered 2 1/2 years ago that the entire case file had 
been sealed in 1990. "I have no explanation for it. . . . Somebody doesn't want 
public scrutiny and I don't know who or how this happened." 
</P>
<P>
 David Elson, the attorney for Butcher and Forde, said he does not "recall that 
I filed a motion to seal it." He speculated that the suit might have been 
sealed because the plaintiff would be gaining access to "all sorts of 
information not generally available to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 But local legal experts say they've never heard of a case involving these 
types of allegations being totally sealed from the public. Sealed records, they 
say, are much more routine in civil cases involving such things as children and 
family disputes, trade secrets and defective products. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Superior Court records remain secret, some details of the 6-year-old 
suit can be gleaned from a nearly three-foot thick appeal file taken in 1992 to 
the Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, which declined to seal its files. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court records provide a glimpse into the lucrative world of 
direct-mail fund raising, where campaign consultants like Butcher and Forde, 
the architects of Howard Jarvis' Proposition 13 campaign, can charge up to 25 
cents for each of the hundreds of thousands of solicitation letters mailed to 
potential donors during a typical campaign. Other fees can net them millions 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The files also tell the story of Paul McCauley, the Sherman Oaks accountant 
who took on Butcher and Forde after he discovered that the California Tax 
Reduction Movement, the organization they co-founded with Jarvis in the wake of 
Proposition 13, was not registered with California's secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor had the group publicly disclosed how it had spent the millions it took in 
from the political action committees it had spawned -- committees such as the 
one to dump former state Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird, or the committee to 
Save Prop. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more than a little shocked to find, here they were, the largest 
political fund-raiser in the state, and they had not filed a campaign 
statement," McCauley said in an interview. "I certainly think the public would 
like to know where the money went." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Political Reform Act of 1974, the "receipts and expenditures in 
election campaigns should be fully and truthfully disclosed in order that the 
voters may be fully informed and improper practices may be inhibited." 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley sent two letters requesting an investigation to the Fair Political 
Practices Commission, and a third letter to the Los Angeles County district 
attorney. When he received no replies, he made use of a little-known section in 
the Political Reform Act that allows an individual to serve as a "private 
attorney general" to sue Butcher-Forde Consulting, CTRM -- now known as the 
Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn. -- and Blanche Kelly, who served as CTRM's 
treasurer, for alleged violations of the act. 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley said he does not believe that Jarvis, who died in 1986, was in any 
way responsible for the allegedly deceptive fund-raising practices. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the group was a political action committee that should 
have been making regular public disclosures of where it was getting its money, 
and how it was being spent. Its attorneys have argued that it wasn't subject to 
the political reform act's reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "CTRM was a membership organization, just like a labor union. It established 
political action committees, which raised money in their own names and reported 
it," Lawrence Straw, an attorney for the group, said. "McCauley's got all these 
crazy theories. . . . Next he's going to be saying Butcher and Forde were on 
the grassy knoll when (President) Kennedy was shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Another contested issue is whether Butcher-Forde Consulting was the "de facto" 
treasurer of CTRM, and therefore financially liable for what McCauley maintains 
are violations of the Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents, McCauley contends that Butcher-Forde Consulting used CTRM 
to set up various political action committees that traded on the Jarvis name 
and prevailing anti-tax sentiments. The committees would raise money through 
mass mailings, then transfer much of the proceeds back to CTRM, according to 
court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The money from these "deceptive fund-raising campaigns" in behalf of CTRM, 
could then be donated to CTRM and used "to pay BFC's exorbitant invoices," say 
the court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1985 income tax return McCauley obtained from the Internal 
Revenue Service, $3.6 million of the $6.9 million the California Tax Reduction 
Movement spent that year went to fund raising, and nearly $2.5 million was paid 
to Butcher-Forde as fees. The following year, Butcher-Forde's fees accounted 
for 47% of the the group's expenditures, or $1.8 million, court records state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had they reported all this, then fine," said Phillips, McCauley's attorney. 
"And if the public still wanted to continue sending them money, then P. T. 
Barnum was right." 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley contends that Butcher-Forde Consulting helped found CTRM in 1978 to 
"enable (Butcher-Forde Consulting) to acquire a nonprofit bulk rate mailing 
permit which could be used to obtain cheaper rates on postage, thereby enabling 
mailings in the name of CTRM to be more profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 CTRM then "lent" its mailing permit to a series of political action committees 
it formed and controlled -- though a federal lawsuit prohibited them from doing 
so, court documents show. In 1979, Butcher-Forde and CTRM signed their first 
written contract giving Butcher-Forde five cents for every piece of mail sent 
out in behalf of CTRM and all of its committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent contracts described in court records bumped that take up to 25 
cents per letter, and also paid Butcher-Forde Consulting 17.65% of CTRM's gross 
expenditures as a management fee. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Butcher-Forde's mailers in 1986 was a black-bordered fund-raising 
appeal sent out to 350,000 Jarvis supporters two weeks after Jarvis' death. The 
mailing, which also included a photograph of Jarvis and a note from his widow, 
asked for donations of $10, $15 or $20 to the Howard Jarvis Memorial Fund to 
campaign for a proposition to overturn a state Supreme Court decision that 
could weaken Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fund-raiser in late 1984 sought to raise money to pay off a purported 
$349,000 debt left over from an unsuccessful attempt to amend the state 
Constitution. McCauley contends in court documents that little or no debt 
existed. Bank statements for the fund-raising committee show that $858,083 was 
"grossed" from two mass mailings for that fund-raiser. The $530,404 netted by 
the fund-raiser was "contributed" to CTRM, court records say. 
</P>
<P>
 Such allegations have been dismissed by Butcher-Forde's attorney as "blatant 
distortions (that) do not raise a single triable issue of fact as to whether 
the (Butcher-Forde Consulting) defendants intentionally or negligently violated 
any provision of the Political Reform Act." 
</P>
<P>
 Elson also said McCauley's claims that his clients are somehow responsible for 
CTRM are "groundless" and "hypertechnical" and that his clients were simply 
hired hands who neither controlled nor served as treasurers of the CTRM during 
the mid-1980s. "Howard Jarvis was in charge. I don't think anyone would dispute 
that Howard Jarvis is captain of his own ship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appellate brief, Elson labeled McCauley a "bounty hunter" out to drive 
Butcher and Forde from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Should McCauley win the case, he would be entitled to half of everything 
Butcher and Forde and CTRM should have reported to the state, including both 
contributions and expenditures. The remaining half would be put in the state's 
general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Phillips and Elson promised that the truth of the secret suit would 
become clear when the full case is tried in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never intended this to be a six-year-long lawsuit," McCauley said. "It's 
just when we got into it, the mountain got bigger."

A VOICE FOR COMPROMISE TO REBUILD AILING VIETNAM; TRADE: O.C. CHAMBER HEAD, IN 
FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE TRIP TO HIS HOMELAND, SAYS KINDNESS AND PATIENCE ARE THE 
KEYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On the morning after Saigon fell in 1975, Dr. Co Pham fastened his 4-month-old 
son to his shoulder with a piece of cloth and boarded a fishing boat with his 
family, not knowing whether his decision to leave his war-torn country would 
ultimately keep them alive or kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and I had one future," Pham said. "At that time, all I thought about was 
that we were going to die out in the middle of the ocean. I had chosen death 
rather than to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that in mind, how can anyone accuse me of being a Communist? Or for that 
matter, a Communist sympathizer?" 
</P>
<P>
 In his first interview since he led a controversial trade mission to his 
homeland that earned him those epithets and worse in the Vietnamese community, 
Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, called on U.S. opponents 
of normalized relations with Vietnam to compromise with him and aid the 70 
million people living in one of the world's poorest nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The political tide is rolling in the direction of normalization, with or 
without the acceptance of Vietnamese American opponents of the current 
Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to face the fact that South Vietnam lost the war, and we lost 
because of our own corruption, of our own weakness," Pham said. "There's no 
going back. We can't change what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can change the future by accepting compromise as a token to solving 
the problems of Vietnam. The country is not moving forward, and that means it's 
moving backward." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham's 27-member delegation hoped to lay the groundwork for U.S. business 
ventures in Vietnam by meeting with top Vietnamese government officials and 
business leaders to investigate current economic policies and practices in the 
Communist-ruled country. The mission was spurred by President Clinton's 
decision in February to lift the embargo on trade with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day trade mission that began Oct. 1 sparked angry protests from 
anti-normalization activists, who demonstrated for months before to the trip 
and for several weeks afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Death threats against Pham were common, and some of the obstetrician's 
patients were shouted at and spat upon, he said. Pham had to enter his clinic 
through a back door to avoid demonstrators. At home, he feared for the safety 
of his wife, Thuy Bui, who is also a physician, and their four children, ages 3 
to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 24, nearly a thousand demonstrators picketed Pham's medical practice 
in the heart of Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uproar, members of the trade delegation said the trip was 
worthwhile because they made new contacts that could yield lucrative business 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics said the delegation came back empty-handed and prompted resentment 
from Vietnamese Americans who fled their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't have cared if he went over there on his own," said Cau Tran, a 
pharmacist and member of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California, which 
is opposed to normalization. "But to pretend to represent the overseas 
Vietnamese is a slap in the face for all the refugees whose fathers, mothers 
and children died under the hands of the Communists," Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately funded trip further strained relationships between the two sides 
of the normalization issue within the Vietnamese community here. 
</P>
<P>
 "What have you seen so far?" asked Anthony Dang, one of the chamber's 
founders, who resigned in 1989 and disagrees with the direction in which Pham 
is taking the organization. "The only thing I've seen are the people who 
protested his trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Dieu Le, editor of Nguoi Viet Daily, the largest Vietnamese-language newspaper 
in California, also believes there is no tangible evidence that the Vietnamese 
community benefited from the trade mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said he has not answered the charges since returning from the trade 
mission because he hoped his silence would placate the anti-normalization 
forces. Now that the protests have died down, he wants to offer his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham contends that the trip resulted in 10 "preliminary deals" potentially 
worth as much as $300 million, although he acknowledged that many negotiations 
did not involve Orange County business people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have people going back to Vietnam to do business, you will have 
people bringing money back to the United States," Pham said. "And because 
Orange County is such a major link between Vietnam and the United States, 
Orange County will benefit. How can it not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwin-Williams, an Ohio-based paint manufacturer that Pham said considered 
the trip a success, is in the process of inviting several Vietnamese contacts 
to visit the United States, said Richard Elliott, the company's Asia-Pacific 
regional director. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott said the trip allowed delegates a chance to gauge Vietnam's economic 
climate, but "nothing is for sure" beyond that. Elliott had planned to visit 
Vietnam with or without Pham, but said his goals were realized more quickly 
because of the chamber-sponsored trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Huynh Nguyen, who represented Technical Industries Corp., an Apple Valley, 
Calif., manufacturer of livestock feed, said his company is investigating the 
possibility of opening a food processing plant in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're asking for $25 million (for the joint venture) up front. That's a 
little too much," Nguyen said. "Right now, we don't feel like the deal is all 
that genuine, but we're still working on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham counseled patience on the business ventures. It took years of effort just 
to break down obstacles to the trade mission itself, he said, and stumbling 
blocks were encountered up to the night before the group left Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the protesters from Orange County who did not want him to go, 
some in Vietnam didn't want him back, Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to let them scare me," Pham said. "I helped to lose the 
(Vietnam) War because I was afraid to speak out. I am not going to do that 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe the United States my freedom, but I also owe Vietnam 30 years of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said he led the trade mission in part because he felt an obligation to 
improve the plight of the Vietnamese people, whose annual income averages a few 
hundred dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend of mine who visited Vietnam a few years ago told me, 'Hey Co, you 
know that Mercedes that you drive around? It's probably enough to feed the 
entire country (of Vietnam),' " Pham said. "That hits you." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham still drives a Mercedes. But the remark launched his efforts to improve 
the lives of the Vietnamese by giving them a taste of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kindness is a better tool than oppression when you're trying to change 
something," Pham said. "In that kindness, you have to be able to compromise. It 
doesn't mean that you're giving in, it just means that you're willing to extend 
a hand to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "And who are these people you're extending a hand to? They are you and I." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Hanoi, Pham and his family left everything they owned behind in 1954 
to start a new life in South Vietnam, where Pham said he witnessed firsthand 
the atrocities of war as a military doctor for the Army of the Republic of 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 When he fled Saigon in 1975, Pham said he vowed to return and help bring peace 
and democracy to a country that for decades has rarely known life without war. 
Skirmishes continued with China and Cambodia after the United States pulled out 
of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam has had peace only in the last four years," Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
 After settling in Huntington Beach, Pham served as an officer of several 
Vietnamese organizations, including the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, where 
he has been president since 1987. He plans to step down from the post when his 
fourth term ends in May, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said he has no political ambitions of his own "in the near future." But 
he would not rule out public office completely, he said, because there is 
"political blood" in him. His long-term goal, he said, is to help change 
Vietnam by altering its political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 If that means leaving his comfortable life in the United States to start all 
over again in Vietnam, "so be it," Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's symbol is a dragon, from which, according to myth, all Vietnamese 
are descended. 
</P>
<P>
 "My name means 'the head of a dragon,' " Pham said.

CONFLICT MARKS ENDANGERED SPECIES TREATY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting at opposite ends of a cavernous auditorium, under a canopy of flags 
from around the world, Brazil and the Netherlands waged a polite but 
emotionally strained debate over a tree that grows thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief delegate from the Netherlands -- whose Dutch people are fierce rain 
forest defenders -- argued that mahogany trees are disappearing from the 
tropics so rapidly that trade in the wood must be restricted. Brazil's delegate 
fervently protested, saying his people should control the Amazon forests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 118 nations that gathered in Florida for two weeks of high-level talks 
on the environment, which ended Friday, both arguments were persuasive. 
Ultimately, the government ministers voted, by a slim margin, to leave trade in 
mahogany unrestricted. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict over mahogany -- a rich, highly prized tropical wood that graces 
the living rooms of many American homes -- symbolizes a new direction for the 
world's largest and most powerful conservation treaty, the 21-year-old 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Should its decisions 
on wildlife be based on science, politics, economics or emotion? Is it firstly 
a conservation treaty, or a trade treaty? For the 124 nations that signed the 
pact, the answer is increasingly all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the debate is one of the most wrenching environmental 
questions: Which of the world's creatures warrant protection? Already, 
international trade is prohibited for more than 600 species from leopard skins 
and tiger bone to whale meat and rhino teeth. Trade is restricted for 25,000 
other species. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's talks, it was evident that more nations are prepared to accept 
the concept of "sustainable use," which maintains that if governments are 
allowed to trade threatened natural resources, such as elephants or wild 
orchids, or the plant used to manufacture the anti-cancer drug taxol, in 
limited amounts, then they will have more economic incentive to manage such 
resources in ways that will not drive them to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a critical time for (the treaty)," said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director 
Mollie Beattie, the chief U.S. delegate. "I see it moving into a much more 
thoughtful mode than it has been in. . . . People have realized that 
(sustainable use) is really the keystone of this treaty. It is a means of 
having countries help other countries and help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Sustainable use adds a new twist to the classic battle between the 
international haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any global treaty, the environmental pact known as CITES must navigate 
the murky and sometimes treacherous waters of international conflicts. 
Wealthier, pro-preservationist nations, especially in Europe, are often pitted 
against cash-poor but resource-rich nations such as Malaysia and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
 When the treaty was drafted 21 years ago, trade bans were rapidly enacted as 
tigers, crocodiles, chimpanzees and leopards slipped toward extinction. But now 
nations such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, Japan, Norway and Malaysia that are 
vocal supporters of allowing more trade in protected species increasingly are 
being heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a softening of extremes: Nations that used to demand to be 
left alone have agreed that they have to manage their natural resources well 
today to ensure their future existence. And those that used to support 
inflexible bans on trade now realize that if countries have healthy economies, 
they will have more money to spend on improving the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinus S. Hoogmoed of the National Museum of Natural History in the 
Netherlands said that when he was a delegate in 1979, many of the nations that 
gathered were too rigidly preservationist. He heard the first rumblings of a 
shift in 1992, and this year in Ft. Lauderdale, many nations voted to ease 
restrictions that had seemed unthinkable a few years earlier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain animals are still such a hot emotional item, such as elephants, that 
it is nearly impossible to even have any conversation about it," Hoogmoed said. 
"But as far as I can see in the European Union, there certainly is an 
understanding that CITES is a mixture of trade and nature conservation, and you 
have to have both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the credit -- or blame -- for the easing of restrictions goes to South 
Africa, which has won a lot of converts with its strong efforts to protect 
wildlife. Johan Neethling, who directs a South African conservation program, 
said the right to sustainable use is "vital to the long-term health of this 
whole organization" and "a principle of paramount importance for conservation 
in all of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa last week sought support for weakening the global ban on elephant 
trade, enacted after ivory poaching in the 1980s decimated much of Africa's 
herds. Since its elephants have flourished, South Africa asked for permission 
to sell the hides of 350 elephants per year culled from its overpopulated 
national parks, earning about $1 million per year it vowed to put into its 
conservation budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort was rejected. But for the first time, many nations, including the 
United States and the entire European delegation, were sympathetic to South 
Africa's request. Their representatives said they would have supported South 
Africa if other African nations weren't vehemently opposed because they thought 
it would increase ivory poaching. However, South Africa was successful in 
easing the ban on trade in white rhinos, a critically endangered species 
everywhere but in South Africa. Other new rules allow ranching of sea turtles 
and ease restrictions on trade of crocodile skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in Africa, some less restrictive regime has to be found," Beattie 
said. "What South Africa has done is break through what resistance there used 
to be and bring people around to thinking that Africa can come up with a 
long-term sustainable program for its wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some nations remain skeptical that countries without scientific 
expertise or adequate law enforcement can successfully protect their 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some countries, it is very possible. For others, it's been a disaster," 
Hoogmoed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Countries with a bad reputation for failing to protect their wildlife from 
illegal trade are Indonesia, Nepal and Colombia. An estimated $5 billion worth 
of wildlife products per year are legally and illegally traded worldwide, and 
the profits of the illegal side are thought to be eclipsed only by those of 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Simon, director of the French Ministry of Environment's Department of 
Conservation, said the theory of sustainable use works only when a species, 
such as crocodiles, is not very endangered and does not attract high prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, of course, agree on the principle of sustainable development. Everyone 
agrees," he said. "But for this century, real sustainable development means 
strong and strict preservation because it's impossible to control poaching. It 
will not work with elephants or rhino because people can sell tusks for 10 
times the salary of the average African. It's like drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 A Canadian biologist and attorney, Ron Orenstein of the International Whaling 
Commission, said he "watched with horror the collapse of the world's greatest 
fishery" -- off the Atlantic coast of Canada -- because harvesting that 
scientists had deemed sustainable depleted cod populations beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over tropical mahogany marked one of the first times that a product 
so vital to a nation's economy had been considered under the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is by far the largest exporter of mahogany and the United States by far 
is its largest consumer. A smooth, durable wood in a deep, reddish-brown hue 
popular for fine furniture, mahogany export is worth about $72 million per year 
to Brazil alone, making it one of the biggest commodities in the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands had proposed listing mahogany on the treaty's appendix 2 -- 
which does not ban sales but requires exporting countries to keep track of 
harvests and set quotas that are sustainable in perpetuity. Many exporting 
nations, including Venezuela, Costa Rica, Colombia and Honduras, supported the 
listing as a way of helping to conserve their forests. 
</P>
<P>
 But after failed attempts to strike a compromise with the opposing nations of 
Brazil, Bolivia and Peru, 50 nations -- including the United States -- voted in 
favor of the listing, with 33 against. Because a two-thirds majority is 
required, the proposal failed by six votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilde Lago Pinheiro, president of the Brazilian Institute for Environment, 
said it was premature to list mahogany because "we are implementing our own 
legislation, which is even more rigorous." She said Brazil has voluntarily 
reduced exports of mahogany from 174,000 cubic meters in 1989 to 90,000 in 
1994. She adds, though, that the Brazilian government has been unable to stem 
widespread illegal harvesting by timber companies in remote rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
 While many mainstream environmental groups, including the World Wildlife Fund, 
support the pact's new emphasis on sustainable use, some animal rights 
activists believe that it is headed in the wrong direction. "We're not opposed 
to it in theory," said John Grandy of the Humane Society of the United States. 
"It's just that they don't cut it in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Humane Society is concerned mostly about a decision to allow trophy 
hunting of some species such as rhinos. "If you feel strongly about supporting 
conservation programs, give them your money. Don't kill their animals," Grandy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Professor Marshall Murphree of the University of Zimbabwe contends, though, 
that the international community has a choice of either allowing limited trade 
or letting it happen anyway, uncontrolled and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all users of wildlife," he said. "It's not an issue of whether it will 
be use or non-use. The real issue is whether that use can be sustainable or we 
abandon that and let it become unsustainable." 
</P>
<P>
 While scientific data on the status of a species is supposed to rule 
conservation decisions, other factors -- politics, emotions and economics -- 
play key roles. Many nations were so disturbed by the lack of scientific basis 
for some decisions that they waged a two-year effort to craft new criteria, 
which were adopted unanimously last week.

NATO GETS OK TO HIT BACK AT SERBS IN CROATIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two days of cross-border attacks by Serbian militias on an isolated U.N. 
"safe area" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. Security Council authorized NATO 
warplanes Saturday to attack targets in Serb-occupied sections of Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 By a unanimous 15-0 vote at a rare weekend emergency session, the Security 
Council decided that North Atlantic Treaty Organization aircraft may pursue 
Serbian attackers across the border to Croatia in response to bombing raids on 
the predominantly Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on the resolution, ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations meeting in 
emergency session in Brussels early today agreed to extend the possible use of 
air power. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours earlier, Serbian warplanes based in Croatia attacked the Bihac pocket 
for the second consecutive day, dropping bombs around Cazin, 15 miles north of 
the town of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 The raiders appeared to be aiming at an ammunition factory, but they instead 
strafed a residential area, a U.N. spokesman said. At least 15 people were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the attacking planes was shot down by groundfire and its pilot killed, 
the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council action closes a loophole that had, in effect, given 
Serbian forces a sanctuary in the occupied Krajina region of Croatia from which 
to launch attacks on the nearby Bihac area. 
</P>
<P>
 Planes based in Krajina need only spend a few minutes over Bosnia to attack 
targets around Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had earlier authorized NATO to enforce a "no fly" zone over 
Bosnia, but diplomats said that authority to attack violators did not stretch 
into Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council decision was not retroactive, so no NATO action is 
expected unless the Serbs strike again. Even then, the procedures for launching 
attacks are cumbersome, requiring approval by both NATO and U.N. military 
commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, NATO planes have shot down four Serbian light attack 
aircraft violating the "no fly" zone in February and hit Serbian ground targets 
in Bosnia in August and September. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Hunter, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said in Brussels that the 
alliance showed its resolve today to act promptly if attacks resume on Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned the key and are ready to go," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's U.N. ambassador, Muhamed Sacirbey, complained that Saturday's U.N. 
resolution was inadequate and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 He said NATO and the United Nations already have authority to protect Bosnian 
civilians in all designated safe areas, including Bihac, and argued that the 
Security Council vote only delayed needed action. 
</P>
<P>
 But other diplomats said the resolution was required to eliminate any doubt 
about NATO's mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council action permits NATO to target Udbina airfield, which was 
used to launch the attacks Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and this month's 
Security Council president, said Udbina is an "ongoing threat" to stability in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has not committed ground troops to the U.N. peacekeeping 
force in the former Yugoslav federation, but U.S. planes participate in NATO 
air operations. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has used the existing authority sparingly, but Secretary General Willy 
Claes said Friday that the alliance is ready to act more forcefully if the 
Serbian attacks on Bihac continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks on the Bihac area, apparently by a combined force of Bosnian Serbs 
and Croatian Serbs, is considered especially dangerous because it could touch 
off another wave of refugees into already overcrowded areas under the control 
of the Croatian government. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Serbs succeed in taking most of the Bihac pocket, they will have 
effectively united all of the territory they have conquered in Bosnia and 
Croatia. Serbian forces now control about 70% of Bosnia and about one-third of 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Western European nations have warned the Croatian 
government to stay out of the fight for Bihac to avoid reigniting war in 
Croatia, where a U.N. truce has held since January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, in a letter to the Security Council on 
Friday, gave his consent to NATO action over his country. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,200 poorly equipped Bangladeshi U.N. peacekeepers are trapped in the 
Bihac region, unable to get food and other supplies. The U.N. command is trying 
to get Dutch peacekeepers into the region, but the surrounding Serbs refuse to 
permit them to pass.

 The symptoms have swept through Edgewood Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 many mornings there is a long line outside the nurse's door at the West 
Covina school. Some children clutch their stomachs. Others grasp their heads. 
In this mostly middle-class bedroom community, these children share a common 
ailment. They are hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 One boy came into Assistant Principal Amelia Esposito's office last year and 
confessed to stealing food from a 7-Eleven store. "Every night I go to bed 
hungry," the 13-year-old told her, bowing his head. "There isn't enough food." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary how many kids here are hungry," says Esposito, who believes one in 
four children comes to class undernourished. 
</P>
<P>
 America's hunger is not the starvation of Somalia or Rwanda that galvanizes 
global attention: bloated bellies, emaciated arms, failing bodies along 
roadsides. Hunger here saps people in more subtle ways; families eat only once 
a day or skip meals for several days, causing chronic malnutrition. It is a 
problem that many researchers say eased markedly in the 1960s and '70s, but 
resurfaced with a vengeance in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunger, they say, afflicts up to 30 million Americans. Twelve million of them 
are children, many in recession-ravaged Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Their plight has emerged most publicly in the schools, where teachers delve 
into their own pockets to feed children whose ability to learn is being 
crippled by hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet half of California's schools -- including all 11 in the West Covina 
Unified School District -- do not offer one ready remedy: breakfast, a 
federally funded entitlement. Nationally, 37% of the 13.6 million low-income 
children who get a subsidized lunch also eat a morning meal at school. In some 
districts, breakfast has been barred or eliminated by school officials who 
oppose it on philosophical grounds. Many in West Covina, where Christian 
conservatives dominate the school board, oppose feeding children breakfast at 
school, calling it anti-family and a usurpation of what should be a parent's 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want kids to eat at home with their families," said school board President 
Mike Spence. "Breakfast at school is just one more thing school districts do 
rather than allowing parents to take care of their children." 
</P>
<P>
 A suburb that blossomed from orange groves in the San Gabriel Valley after 
World War II, West Covina, the "City of Beautiful Homes," is an unlikely haven 
for hunger. In the 1980s, however, teachers watched as lost jobs, an influx of 
newcomers from the inner city and an increase in single mothers left many 
students living hand-to-mouth. Although the median family income in West Covina 
is $51,000, there are pockets of poverty: one in four single mothers lives on 
less than $14,800 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shifts in West Covina are hardly unique, the town's emerging 
economic stratification has made hunger highly visible in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches at 
Edgewood, the district's only middle school, has surged to nearly two-thirds 
from one-third a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Cristina Yepez, a soft-spoken 12-year-old with freckles and 
wide-set blue eyes, who spends some mornings at the school health office 
complaining of stomachaches. Last year, she says, she got dizzy on the 
playground, crumpling onto the blacktop at Merced Elementary. She had had no 
breakfast that day. Dinner the night before was a potato. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, we have just bread," says Cristina, gently combing the silky 
red hair on her Little Mermaid doll as her family prepares for an evening's 
meal. "Sometimes, I get really hungry. But there's nothing more to eat. I go to 
my friend's house and pretend to play and say: 'Oh, can I have something to 
drink?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cristina sits down with her mother, Darlene, and sister, Jesseca, 13, for 
dinner. It is their only meal today. One hot dog each, and water. Darlene 
Yepez, 38, who is divorced, was sidelined from a forklift job by a back injury 
but is searching for work. Meanwhile, the family survives on $607 in welfare 
and $130 in food stamps, which run out halfway through the month. Swallowing 
her pride, the mother has gone to West Covina's food pantry -- but has used her 
five allowed visits. A few times, the girls have gone up to three days without 
food, she says, quietly beginning to sob. The last two weeks, she says, they 
have had one meal a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that hungry students are fatigued. They cannot concentrate. They 
do worse than their peers on standardized tests. Because they are ill twice as 
often, they miss class more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are dazed. You can see it in their eyes. Sometimes, their hands 
tremble," says Edgewood teacher Kim Breen, who estimates that three-quarters of 
her students arrive without eating breakfast. Some do not have the energy to 
raise their heads from their desks. One girl broke down last year in class, her 
hands shaking, describing how she had gone all weekend without eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathi Jennings sees hunger's toll daily at Edgewood, which has about 1,800 
students. Knowing many of them are undernourished, she keeps a choice of 
rewards for daily tasks on her desk: a baseball card, a small toy or a cup of 
applesauce. Many kids choose food. 
</P>
<P>
 Two guards who patrol Edgewood's playground say one 13-year-old girl chases 
their green security cart, asking for food. Physical education teacher Barbara 
Davids says she sometimes fed a 12-year-old boy who volunteered to help 
custodians pick up after lunch so he could salvage garbage scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student got in trouble regularly so he could be sent to the assistant 
principal's office, where a jar of diabetic candies is perched on her desk. 
"I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry," sobbed the 12-year-old boy, dipping his hand 
into the jar and stuffing six candies into his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunger plagues many U.S. schools. More than a quarter of elementary 
schoolchildren come to class without breakfast, said Doris Derelian, president 
of the American Dietetic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, like many urban areas, has long 
served breakfasts so the problem on those campuses is less pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural and suburban districts are less likely to serve a morning meal. In the 
Baldwin Park Unified District, nearly half of 16,000 visits to the school nurse 
last year were tied to hunger. Since then, the district has started offering 
breakfast at many of its schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting toll in schools mirrors a resurgence in hunger, which studies 
show was brought under control in the '70s but grew by 50% between 1985 and 
1991. Even for Americans with jobs, a growing percentage -- now nearly one in 
five -- work full time but earn less than the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
 Divorce and out-of-wedlock births left children, along with their mothers, the 
nation's biggest losers. More than one in five children live in poverty, and 
almost a quarter of low-income children in the United States are anemic -- a 
condition linked to inadequate or poor nutrition. Government cuts have not 
helped: median Aid to Families With Dependent Children benefits for a family of 
three have dropped 47% since 1970. California food stamp payments average 70 
cents a meal, slightly more than half of what the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture says it takes to get an adequate diet. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to assess the extent of hunger in America, the federal government 
has launched its first tally on malnutrition. Results from the survey of 60,000 
households are expected to be released in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent academic research already has focused on the effects of hunger in the 
classroom. A 1993 Tufts University study said hunger is stunting cognitive 
development as lethargic children disengage from learning, and warned that "our 
country may be heading for a crisis of enormous proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Health and nutrition are powerful determinants of educational competence," 
says Ernesto Pollitt, a UC Davis human development professor. His 1993 study 
found that anemic and iron-deficient toddlers lag behind their peers in mental 
development by up to 25%. Nonetheless, Pollitt said he is surprised to find 
that many schools do not serve breakfast and ignore the effects of hunger on 
the ability to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of 1,023 public schoolchildren in Lawrence, Mass., found that when 
schools started to serve breakfast, students' standardized test scores rose, 
and absenteeism and tardiness declined. Math, another study shows, is hardest 
hit when children are not given a morning meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scientific evidence shows that if you don't do this, you are undermining the 
very reason for your existence, which is to educate children," says J. Larry 
Brown, director of the Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition 
Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 At Edgewood school, mid-morning is the worst, said science teacher Breen. "How 
many eat three meals a day? Two? One?" Breen asks her class. Most say they eat 
twice, some only once. It is her annual informal body count on hunger, and the 
results are more grim each year. Breen estimates a sixth of her students are 
hungry regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to repeat instructions two or three times," she says. "I try to teach 
them physics, but I can't." By second period, a boy in the third row drops his 
head to his desk. "I just leave them alone. They aren't going to get it," Breen 
says, her voice full of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before lunch, a 14-year-old girl rises from her desk and slowly 
approaches her teacher. She says she has not eaten in two days. Earlier, on the 
playground, she nearly fainted, dizzy from lack of food. "Could I have 50 
cents?" she says quietly so the other children can't overhear. "I'm hungry." 
Breen -- who often gets requests for food -- fishes out four quarters. The 
girl, who has not yet been issued a card that will allow her to get a free 
lunch, still lacks enough money to buy one. She eats what she can: a bag of 
Doritos from the school vending machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep my own stuff," says the school health clerk, Deborah Paschal, swinging 
open the office cabinet. Sandwiched between the Band-Aids and medicines are 
peanut butter, crackers and boxes of juice, all purchased with her own money. 
Counselor Pamela Clausen sometimes gives away her sack lunch. Physical 
education teacher Barbara Davids occasionally brings in grocery bags of food. 
When she runs out, or does not have money, she sends children to the cafeteria 
with a note: "Feed this kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, teachers like Ernie Sanchez are picking up the 
slack. When he was a second-grade teacher at Vejar Elementary School in Pomona, 
Sanchez spent the first period each morning making cheese sandwiches for every 
student. If he had no cheese, he scooped a cup of cereal into a napkin on each 
child's desk. Once, he brought apples to the school, where 99% of the children 
qualify for free or reduced-price meals. "All these little hands reached out 
toward me," says Sanchez, who -- faced with the crush of children -- struggled 
to regain control of his class. "I'll take that image to my grave. I didn't 
think I would ever see that in America." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has gotten worse," says Debbie Norman, a fourth-grade teacher at East 
Whittier's Evergreen Elementary. She worries that math and English, taught 
first thing in the morning, are most jeopardized. "I have parents tell me: 'I 
just don't have enough to feed them.' The kids say: 'There is nothing in the 
house.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her colleague, kindergarten teacher Linda Palmer, could no longer endure the 
procession of hungry 5-year-olds to her desk. Palmer now passes out crackers 
and popcorn to children who come to class without snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hungry children come from neglectful or drug-plagued homes. At Edgewood, 
Assistant Principal Esposito puts the number at one in 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have food sometimes," says one 13-year-old Edgewood student, 
nervously adjusting her glasses. Asked what her mother does, the girl said, 
"She stays in the house and watches TV every day." Her father? "He takes drugs. 
That's why my mom threw him out." 
</P>
<P>
 But most, Esposito says, suffer because their parents have been laid off, work 
long hours and leave their children to fend for themselves in the mornings, or 
work at jobs that barely cover the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Drynan, 32, was recently laid off from her administrative job at an 
engineering firm, the second position she's lost to "downsizing" in three 
years. She is again searching for work. Drynan has gone up to two days at a 
time without food. Her three boys, Kevin, 3, Kenny, 9 and Keith, 11, who 
attends Edgewood, often eat once or twice a day. The night before, says Drynan, 
staring inside her bare refrigerator, her three sons split two hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many days I don't have anything for them for breakfast," she says 
in her tidy apartment, where the toys are lined up outside the front door. Even 
though she buys generic brand foods, her $102 in food stamps each month run out 
after 2 1/2 weeks. Drynan, who is divorced, has used up her five trips to the 
West Covina food bank. "I know food is important. But I know we need a roof 
over our heads more," she says, adding that most of her income goes to the 
$690-a-month rent, bills and collection agencies to pay off thousands of 
dollars in medical costs owed from one son's head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hungry," says Kevin, tugging at his mother's white T-shirt. Drynan has 
heard that her 3-year-old ventures to neighbors' homes, asking for food. She 
pulls out a Popsicle -- the last bit of food in her freezer -- and gives it to 
Kevin, who consumes the treat in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny, a skinny boy with big brown eyes, laments not having had his favorite 
food, pork chops, since his birthday in March. At school, he says, "in the 
mornings, I get real hungry." By 10:30, he begins a daily lunchtime countdown, 
eyes focused on the classroom clock. Other children sit down after morning 
recess for snack time -- a treat from home. "They read us a story, or we do our 
work. I just have to work. I don't have a snack," Kenny says quietly. "I get 
hungry when I look at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Drynan knows hunger afflicts other families in her neighborhood, even those in 
which the parents have jobs. When Drynan sent her children for a sleep-over to 
Susie Ballard's house across the street, they were told to eat supper at their 
own home, then come over. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard, 38, whose daughter Kristin attends Edgewood, explains that although 
she works, she cannot put three meals on the table for her own three children, 
much less visitors. Ballard, whose marriage broke up two years ago, lost her 
longtime job as a pizza company training manager. Work as a cleaning lady 
barely covers the rent. Half the month, there is no breakfast. Ballard 
stretches a pack of spaghetti into three meals, thinning down the red sauce 
with cans of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are nights I tell the kids: 'I'm not hungry. You eat,' " says Ballard, 
nervously smoothing the lace doily on the apartment's living room table. She 
gives the kids Kool-Aid to fill their bellies. Fresh fruit, vegetables and 
coffee are luxuries of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them: 'If someone offers you a free meal, take it, take it.' I used to 
go to bed crying every night. I feel a failure to them. I ask: How can they 
look up to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin, 13, is curled up in a chair in the corner of the sparsely furnished 
but immaculate apartment. "If the food was there, I would eat more," she says 
shyly. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-hunger advocates are waging a coordinated, nationwide campaign in a 
school-to-school battle to get the tens of thousands of schools without 
breakfast programs to sign up. Without breakfast in schools, the $16 billion 
California spends on elementary and high school education may be wasted money, 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore warned in a January letter to colleagues, prodding 
them to push the program in their districts. Twenty-one states -- including New 
York and Texas -- now mandate that all or some of their schools serve 
breakfast. Bills to make breakfast mandatory in California schools have failed, 
partly because they are viewed by some legislators as coddling immigrant 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Habra, a recently implemented breakfast program has made teaching more 
productive. Morning stomachaches used to afflict half her students daily, said 
Maria Vigil, a Las Lomas Elementary kindergarten teacher. "They were all 
nauseous" and lethargic, she said. Her office brimming with more than a dozen 
hungry children by midmorning, Las Lomas Principal Mary Jo Anderson found that 
for 10% of the students, school lunch was their only solid meal. "If their 
tummies hurt, their brains can't work," Anderson says. School breakfast, she 
adds, resulted in a 95% drop in disciplinary problems. "They are calm, happy. 
They aren't angry. They aren't hurting. It's like a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Teacher! I am going to eat!" children yell at Vigil as they spill out of 
yellow school buses. Sandra Andrade, 5, races from the parking lot, grabs her 
green meal ticket, then rushes to the wire screen window, waiting impatiently 
for her tray of milk, juice, cereal and string cheese. Unemployed father 
Roberto Andrade -- who some days can't scrounge up the gas money to search for 
work -- hovers over the school breakfast tables, where four of his children who 
attend Las Lomas share their food with his other three younger children. 
"Without this, they might not eat some days," says the handyman. Three-year-old 
Eduardo devours a packet of graham crackers with his sister Sandra. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on food is everywhere. As soon as class starts in Vigil's Room 6, 
she notices that 6-year-old Jonathan Quintana is irritable and crying. Vigil's 
hand dives into a desk drawer and pulls out a bag of crackers: "Let's get you a 
little cereal, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan is ushered to a table, seated next to his teddy bear, and given 
cereal, juice, milk and more crackers. The lesson quickly continues. Jonathan's 
sobs become more infrequent. He sniffles. By 9, he is seated with the other 
students, at work on lessons about the calendar and the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 As Vigil offers each child an animal cracker from a large jar, Jonathan 
cheerfully plays with Legos. Even as lunchtime approaches, children attentively 
listen to Vigil's rendition of "The Three Bears," jostling to see the book's 
pictures. Later, Alberto Cueva, 5, savors his lunch -- a burrito, followed by 
corn and milk -- before his half day of school ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, we eat at night," says the boy, urgently shoveling the burrito 
into his tiny mouth. "Sometimes we don't." About This Series 
</P>
<P>
 In this series, The Times examines four battlegrounds in the war on hunger in 
Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 * Today: Hungry children, caught in the battles over school breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monday: The growing salvage food industry -- spawned by hard times -- takes 
a bite out of charitable food banks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tuesday: U.S. Department of Agriculture changes course and launches a 
crusade to attract more people to food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wednesday: A one-woman crusade to ease neighborhood hunger, one family at a 
time. What's for Breakfast? 
</P>
<P>
 School breakfasts can be hot or cold, and vary from the favorite -- cereal, 
milk and juice -- to breakfast burritos or breakfast pizzas. Some schools serve 
breakfast before class, others as a nutrition break, or even on the school bus. 
In California, almost 5,000 schools offer breakfasts to more than 600,000 
students every school day. Here's a look at some typical costs and numbers: 
</P>
<P>
 Typical School Menu 
</P>
<P>
 8 oz. of milk 
</P>
<P>
 4 oz. of juice 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh or canned fruit 
</P>
<P>
 Hash-brown potato wedge 
</P>
<P>
 Cinnamon roll or bagel with cream cheese, apple turnover, fruit-filled 
pancake, sausage biscuits, burritos. 
</P>
<P>
 What Does It Cost? 
</P>
<P>
 Because of reimbursements from federal and state governments, school breakfast 
programs typically don't cost a school anything. In fiscal 1993, those 
reimbursements included $835 million from the federal government to the states. 
Here are some of the federal reimbursement rates per meal for 1994-95: 
04,22,10,10,28 Severe Need Other Amount Schools Schools Child Pays Free lunch 
$1.16 98 cents 0 Reduced-priced lunch 86 cents 68 cents 30 cents (maximum) 
Full-price lunch 19 cents 19 cents 54 cents (average in U.S.) Who Is Eligible? 
</P>
<P>
 For a free breakfast: Children from a family of four with annual income of 
$19,240 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 For a reduced-priced breakfast: Children from a family of four with annual 
income of $27,380 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Gets Breakfast? 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of eligible children receiving subsidized breakfast and lunch 
at school is higher in Los Angeles County than the nationwide average, but it 
is lower in other Southern California counties: 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.: 37% 
</P>
<P>
 California: 36.5% 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County: 41% 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County: 20.2% 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County: 15% 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino County: 15.7% 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County: 20.8% 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County: 24.4% 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing Hunger 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, researchers and the federal government measure hunger by asking 
people questions about how often they skip meals, cut the size of meals, or 
send their children to bed hungry due to lack of resources. 
</P>
<P>
 30 million Americans -- including 12 million children -- fit this category. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA looks at what percentage of children eat the government's recommended 
dietary allowance, which measures calories as well as a range of vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, 63.7% of children living below the poverty level consumed an 
inadequate amount of calories. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunger can occur without manifesting itself in clinical symptoms, but in the 
worst cases it can be measured by testing for anemia or growth stunting in 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 18.6% of low-income children were anemic; 8.4% had stunted growth. 
</P>

Research and Action Center; California county data from California Department 
of Education, 1992-93 data; Child Nutrition Division, USDA The Effects of 
Hunger 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey on health and school absenteeism, children's hunger affected these 
characterists: 03,49,08,12 Hungry Non-hungry Unwanted weight loss 14% 4.6%

CLINTON READIES CENTRIST STRATEGY; LEGISLATION: A RIGHTWARD SHIFT IS PLANNED TO 
RECLAIM LOST VOTERS, STAVE OFF HOSTILE CONGRESS. HEALTH REFORM WILL BE CUT TO 
THE BONE, ANTI-CRIME SOCIAL SPENDING REDIRECTED. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration will jettison, soften or delay a number of its more 
controversial proposals in an effort to respond to the election results and 
present a more conservative public image, officials throughout the 
Administration said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials insist that the changes are a shift in emphasis and a 
return to longstanding Clinton policies, rather than a fire sale on Clinton's 
principles. But it is evident that the Clinton of the next two years will be 
much more centrist in his language and legislative goals than that of the first 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the changes: 
</P>
<P>
 * A sweeping immigration reform proposal, which was to have been delivered to 
Congress in January, is now being reworked and will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials are willing to see some of the $6.9 billion for social programs in 
the recently passed anti-crime legislation redirected to fund more prisons and 
police or to give block grants to cities to spend as they wish. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whatever health care reform plan is eventually presented to the new 
Republican Congress will be vastly narrower in scope than Clinton's initial 
proposal and much more incremental in its approach. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bill to ban the replacement of striking workers, once a high priority of 
the White House and Labor Department, will be abandoned as a sure loser in the 
new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 These moves appear to mark a sharp veer to the right as Clinton tries to 
reclaim conservative and independent voters who have abandoned the Democrats in 
overwhelming numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official said a big emphasis for the remainder of 
Clinton's term would be the devolution of federal authority to local 
governments, whether in crime prevention, job, education or public health 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election was really about the role of government and the voters' feeling 
that Washington had gotten too big and too powerful," the official said. 
"You'll hear the President speaking a lot about federal partnerships with 
localities, getting money and power right into local hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The revised agenda alarms many Democratic liberals, who say they fear that the 
President will try to "out-Republican the Republicans" on a variety of social 
and fiscal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with wanting to broaden the debate and wanting to 
reassess where you go as an Administration," said Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), 
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and an outspoken advocate of liberal 
social policies. "But I fear that in their effort to gain the world, they will 
lose their soul. The last thing we need in this country is two Republican 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Top White House officials, under the direction of Chief of Staff Leon E. 
Panetta, are carrying out an emergency all-hands drill to right the listing 
Clinton ship, a project some have dubbed "reinventing Clinton," although it 
doesn't have an official title. 
</P>
<P>
 One top aide involved in the effort said the recommendations of the group 
don't add up to a sharp rightward tilt -- though some unpopular initiatives, 
such as the initial health care proposal, have already been tossed overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what we've done is centrist," the official said, citing the 
deficit-reduction plan, efforts to streamline the federal government and a 
redesigned school-aid program. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few high-profile items have been perceived as big government, like the 
health care plan, even though the portrayals are not accurate. I don't deny 
that there have been some issues that allow our critics to paint with a broader 
brush the nature of this Administration," the aide said. "Shame on us." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Clinton, he said, would put added emphasis on already-passed programs 
that reduce the size and reach of the federal government, as well as on 
initiatives with which he could reach some compromise with Republican leaders, 
such as welfare and political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second half of the Clinton Administration will be defined as much by 
what it doesn't do as by what it does. 
</P>
<P>
 White House and Justice Department officials have shelved a broad proposal to 
deal with illegal immigration, which was to have been introduced in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan, while taking steps to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants 
and scale back the public benefits provided them, would not have gone as far as 
California's Proposition 187, which would deny to illegal immigrants all 
benefits except emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Administration officials are rethinking their plan but have not decided 
whether to make the legislation more punitive or to wait and see what the 
Republicans propose. 
</P>
<P>
 The likely House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), 
has already said he plans to introduce a national version of Proposition 187, 
and there is already a bill, written by Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), to make 
it easier to deport criminal immigrants, toughen employer sanctions and provide 
for a nationwide system of verification of immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of moving forward with a new immigration plan, the Administration 
expects to be in a defensive position in January, a top Justice Department 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've shifted our thinking and planning to what's in the 'contract with 
America,' " the official said, referring to the Republican agenda to cut taxes, 
reform government and boost defense spending. "We've put immigration off." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials also say they are willing to consider shifting some 
of the anti-crime measure's $6.9 billion in crime prevention money -- the most 
contentious element of the legislation approved in September -- to build more 
prisons, hire more police officers and extend federal grants to cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials are concerned that if they do not yield on the crime prevention 
money -- which Republicans said amounted to wasteful social spending in some 
instances and pure congressional pork in others -- the new GOP leadership might 
respond by reopening the entire crime measure, including its ban on 
assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Comprehensive health care coverage has also evaporated in the hot wind of 
Republican ascendancy. Responsibility for drafting a new Administration plan 
has been taken away from First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ira Magaziner, 
the Administration's senior adviser for policy development, and given to White 
House domestic policy adviser Carol Rasco and National Economic Council 
Chairman Robert E. Rubin, both considered market-oriented moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most White House officials expect that health care reform '95 will be, at 
most, a modest package of health insurance industry reforms -- which have 
already been endorsed by Senate Majority Leader-to-be Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 On welfare reform, after spending the better part of two years painstakingly 
crafting a plan that would require welfare recipients to work after two years 
yet keep as many of the strands of the safety net intact, Administration 
officials indicated that they are unwilling to start again and write a new 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Administration plans to reintroduce a bill very similar to the 
one it put forward earlier this year, said Bruce Reed, the presidential adviser 
who has shepherded the Administration's welfare reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the bill won't survive as written, given the new GOP 
majorities, but he said Administration officials decided not to change their 
proposal preemptively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll wait and see what Republicans . . . put on table," he said. "Some on 
the far right have philosophical reasons to want the Republican Party to be the 
party of orphanages. I don't think that's the mainstream Republican view. . . . 
There will be considerable resistance to broadly unpopular and unworkable 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich conceded that many of his legislative 
priorities -- such as the provision to ban the replacement of striking workers 
-- will not be worth pushing forward given the leanings of the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his emphasis will be on implementing initiatives passed during the 
last two years and to consolidate existing worker-training programs. He also 
said his agency would strive to return money and autonomy to local governments 
to craft their own job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said they are not 
planning any controversial new initiatives, but sources said that in some areas 
-- such as AIDS education and family planning programs -- "the tone may change" 
to make them more palatable to conservative lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS education has always been a hot-button issue in Congress, where 
conservatives have long opposed spending federal money on programs that they 
view as promoting sexual activity outside marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 This may mean that the Administration will have to go along with less graphic 
approaches that stress sexual abstinence rather than the use of condoms to 
reduce the risk of HIV transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to find approaches that are acceptable to a wide array of people," 
said Patricia (Patsy) Fleming, the Administration's director of AIDS policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Food and Drug Administration sources indicated that they would push ahead with 
efforts to label nicotine as a drug, while admitting that new tobacco 
regulations will almost certainly be more difficult to achieve under the new 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The likely new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. 
Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), has vowed to shut down Congress' investigations 
of the tobacco industry, the chief economic force in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development described the 
mood there as near despair, with the Administration unable to get major 
programs for cities and the homeless through even a Democratic Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior HUD official joked that the political appointees in the agency, 
Democratic activists who came into government hoping to make a difference, are 
considering "mass suicide."

CAB CALLOWAY, LEGENDARY HI DE HO MAN OF JAZZ, DIES; MUSIC: BANDLEADER WHO WAS 
FAMED FOR HIS FLAMBOYANT STAGE ROUTINES SUFFERED A STROKE IN JUNE. HE WAS 86.

<P>
 Cab Calloway, who dressed like the Taj Mahal, spoke like a hip Tower of Babel, 
and fathered the internationally beloved heroine of the song "Minnie the 
Moocher," is dead, it was learned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Calloway, who was 86, had suffered a severe stroke June 12 at his home in 
White Plains, N.Y., and died late Friday in the hospital unit of Cokesbury 
Retirement Village near Wilmington, Del. His family was at his side, said his 
wife, Nuffie. 
</P>
<P>
 A bandleader, singer, author and dancer, he had performed for more than six 
decades in the nation's gaudiest nightspots, on Broadway and in films. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many modern critics found his musical machinations of marginal worth 
in an era of "cool," erudite jazz, no one could dispute his entertainment value 
and the affection showered on him over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the essential "Mr. Maestro" from the day he first stepped on the stage 
at Harlem's famed Cotton Club during the Roaring '20s to his dazzling 
performance in the 1980 film "The Blues Brothers." By that time he had come to 
epitomize the flamboyant Jazz Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a slight 5 feet, 8 inches tall, he appeared half a foot taller and 
pounds heavier in the white tuxedos with flowing tails that became his 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
 And he had a vocabulary to match his grandiloquent attire. Even if it did not 
make any sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Calloway was considered the father of "jive language," even publishing a 
"Hepster's Dictionary," which became necessary if one were to translate spoken 
Calloway into understandable English. 
</P>
<P>
 He also came to be known as "King of the Hi De Ho," a sobriquet that had its 
origins in his rendition of "Minnie the Moocher, the Lowdown Hootchie 
Kootcher." As Calloway would complete each verse of the song he would chant, 
"Hi De Hi De Hi De Hi," and the audience would respond, "Ho De Ho De Ho De Ho." 
In performance, it became a much-anticipated ritual between entertainer and 
audience that became the favored point of almost all his concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cabell Calloway III was not supposed to have spent his life singing the 
praises and phrases of loose women. He was supposed to have been an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the second of six children born to a Rochester, N.Y., attorney and his 
wife, and his parents had hoped he would follow his father into law. But an 
older sister, Blanche, had become a bandleader and singer in Chicago and in 
1924, after graduating from high school, Calloway followed his sister to that 
jazz capital. 
</P>
<P>
 He did enroll briefly as a pre-law student at Crane College but that lasted 
less than a year. He had taught himself to play the drums and soon landed a job 
at the Sunset Cafe, where his flamboyant ways began to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Within six months he was standing at the front of the stage rather than seated 
at the rear of the band. He was leading his first group, Cab Calloway and His 
Alabamians. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's first booking, at the Savoy Ballroom in New York City, proved a 
flop and Calloway dissolved the group. He remained in New York however, taking 
a role in "Connie's Hot Chocolates," one of the all-black revues popular with 
white audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 His rendition of Fats Waller's "Ain't Misbehavin"' was a high point of the 
show and Irving Mills, a well-known Broadway manager, took him under his wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Calloway also learned to play the saxophone and formed an orchestra that over 
the years came to feature such stellar jazz artists as Jonah Jones, Dizzy 
Gillespie, Leon (Chu) Berry, Cozy Cole and Ben Webster. Calloway's talented and 
young ensemble became so popular it was given billing over Duke Ellington at 
the Cotton Club. 
</P>
<P>
 That celebrated den of iniquity was considered New York's hottest 
entertainment spot. Opened in 1926 at 142nd Street and Lenox Avenue by former 
heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson (who sold it to a syndicate of 
mobsters), the club was the antebellum South in miniature. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandstand was a replica of a Confederate plantation home. It featured 
white columns and a backdrop on which were painted slave quarters set amid 
weeping willows. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiters wore red tuxedos like the butlers of the Old South and the tables were 
covered with red and white checked gingham tablecloths. And, of course, only 
whites were permitted in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeter Jones recalled those years and that setting in 1981, three years 
before the film "Cotton Club" was released with Calloway in a featured role. 
Jones told an interviewer that despite Calloway's propensity for gambling away 
box office receipts, he never missed a payroll and also insisted on renting 
separate sleeping and dining cars for his touring musicians so they would not 
be subjected to the prejudice of white-dominated railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Calloway did well at the Cotton Club and quickly moved from saloons to movie 
sets, appearing in such popular films as the first of the "Big Broadcast" 
pictures in 1932, "Stormy Weather," "International House" and "The Singing 
Kid." 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1930s he was a millionaire earning $200,000 a year with band 
concerts and nightclub appearances, but that all ended after World War II when 
television began to keep people home in the evening. He made a few appearances 
on that infant medium, but in 1952 he returned to Broadway, where he had gotten 
his first big break. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was a revival of George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" and Calloway was 
Sportin' Life, the unctuous drug dealer. He moved back and forth between 
nightclub and legitimate theater stages, starring in 1961 with Pearl Bailey in 
an all-black production of "Hello Dolly" while appearing in "The Cincinnati 
Kid" and "The Blues Brothers" on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, he toured the country with "Cotton Club Revisited," a paean to his 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 He married twice, had five daughters and seldom gave interviews, preferring to 
let his performing speak for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he aged, the years never seemed to slow him down. He jumped about the 
stage, his hair flying wildly in a self-generated wind, charming crowds with 
his infectious smile. 
</P>
<P>
 After his marriage to Nuffie, his outside activities slowed considerably and 
they stayed together until his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The man considered the first of the scat jazz singers also wrote a rambling 
autobiography, "Of Minnie the Moocher and Me," in which he counted up his gains 
and losses. Because of his gambling -- particularly on the horses -- there were 
a lot of the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say I've had and lost millions of dollars. Buddy, they haven't stopped 
counting yet," he wrote in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women, horses, cars and clothes, I did it all. And do you know what that's 
called, ladies and gentlemen? It's called living." Too Hep

ISRAELI ARMY KILLS 3 AFTER PALESTINIANS REDIRECT ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Stepping back from the internecine violence that erupted Friday in Gaza and 
raised the specter of a Palestinian civil war, Palestinian protesters trained 
their fury on a safer target Saturday -- the Israeli army. 
</P>
<P>
 In East Jerusalem and across the West Bank, Israeli police and soldiers 
clashed with Palestinian demonstrators, shooting two dead and wounding at least 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers withdrew from a checkpoint near Netzarim, 
an isolated Jewish settlement, after hundreds of Palestinians began throwing 
stones at them. As the soldiers withdrew, demonstrators pursued them. The 
soldiers opened fire, killing one 17-year-old Palestinian, according to an 
Israeli army statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians raised a flag at the post before Palestinian police managed to 
restore order, and three Israeli border policemen were slightly injured, the 
army said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another soldier was fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting at the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat -- who helped broker 
a truce with his Islamic fundamentalist foes -- may have found slight comfort 
in the fact that it was Israelis clashing with Palestinians on Saturday and not 
the Arab-on-Arab violence that killed at least 13 people Friday. But there was 
little else to encourage him. 
</P>
<P>
 In demonstrations from the West Bank town of Hebron to Gaza City, thousands of 
Palestinians cursed Arafat as a traitor, burned his picture and mourned the 
Palestinians who were killed in clashes with Arafat's security forces Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 General strikes were observed in the territories -- even in Gaza and the West 
Bank town of Jericho, where the self-governing authority that Arafat heads is 
in charge. Authorities in both places unsuccessfully urged merchants to keep 
their shops open. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northern West Bank town of Tulkarm, a fierce demonstration ended with 
two Palestinians killed and at least seven wounded by army gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Few seemed mollified by the Palestinian Authority's decision, issued Saturday, 
to form a judicial commission of inquiry and a fact-finding commission to look 
into the events leading up to the clash that erupted Friday between Palestinian 
police and followers of the militant Islamic movements Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
outside a Gaza mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian intellectuals issued dire predictions that civil war may still 
erupt. They blamed the strife on Arafat, along with Israel, the United States 
and nations that have promised to contribute financial aid to the Palestinians 
but have not delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 "These incidents that occurred on Friday broke a taboo," said Ziad abu Amr, a 
professor of political science at Birzeit University in the West Bank. "It 
reminds me of how things first started in Algeria," where the government's war 
with Islamic militants has claimed thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blame lies with the Palestinian Authority, which should have foreseen 
this moment and prepared for it," Amr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One has to take serious steps that will deal with the causes, not just the 
symptoms," said Hanan Mikhail-Ashrawi, a former peace negotiator for the 
Palestinians. Mikhail-Ashrawi now heads an independent Palestinian human rights 
organization formed to act as a watchdog over the Palestinian self-governing 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things could have degenerated into a civil war yesterday," Mikhail-Ashrawi 
said in an interview Saturday. "I'm glad that now there is no immediate 
violence (between the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian militants). But 
that doesn't mean that there has been a miraculous solution found for the 
problems. The detonator was there yesterday, and we haven't completely removed 
the explosives." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail-Ashrawi blamed Israel for pressuring Arafat to crack down on Islamic 
militants after both Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out a series of bloody 
attacks on Israelis in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole attitude of Israel is patronizing," Mikhail-Ashrawi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, who is involved in negotiations with 
Arafat, rejected any blame for Israel in Friday's events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to see them in a state of civil war," Sarid said Saturday. "We 
wish them peace and tranquillity. We put pressure on Yasser Arafat to fight 
terror and terrorists, and this is the only target we ask him to fight. We are 
not pleased with the unfortunate and tragic event that occurred yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said Saturday 
that the international community understands now that a state of emergency 
exists in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing feeling of a need for an emergency effort toward Gaza," 
Savir said. He said that Gaza's myriad economic problems will be discussed at 
the end of the month in Brussels, when donor countries meet to study ways of 
funneling money to the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the eyes of many, Gaza has turned into a test for the whole peace process, 
because there the harshest battle takes place between the forces of compromise 
and the fundamentalists," Savir said. "We must make an effort to strengthen 
Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed that 13 Palestinians were killed 
Friday and more than 200 were injured in skirmishes that began outside Gaza's 
largest mosque and spread to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Health Ministry issued a statement Saturday saying that 13 
people were killed and 129 were injured. By Saturday night, however, unofficial 
Palestinian sources were putting the number of dead at 18, saying five died 
overnight of wounds sustained Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A hastily formed reconciliation committee, which included leaders of the 
Israeli Arab community, managed to work out a truce between the Palestinian 
Authority and Hamas late Friday night that held throughout the day Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority honored a commitment to keep police away from the 
eight funerals in Gaza to bury some of those killed Friday. Police also stayed 
away when an estimated 2,000 Hamas supporters marched through Gaza City, 
protesting what they called a "massacre" and denouncing Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Palestinian Authority made no apologies for the conduct of its 
security services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamas and Jihad deliberately crossed the red line today," said a leaflet 
issued by Arafat's Fatah faction, the largest Palestinian group represented in 
the self-governing authority. "We in Fatah affirm that enough is enough. We 
declare unequivocally that we won't stand and watch but will know how to 
confront all forms of political rowdiness and external agents." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas leaders, however, placed the blame squarely on Arafat's shoulders and 
said it is up to him to make amends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole event (of Palestinian police opening fire on demonstrators) was 
planned in advance," Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahhar insisted in an interview 
Saturday night on Israel Television. "Arafat bears personal responsibility 
until he identifies the real killers and puts them on trial, so that we can 
understand how . . . Palestinians could kill other Palestinians in such a 
barbaric manner."

REPAIRS IN DOWNTOWN SUBWAY NEARLY DONE; TRANSIT: MTA BELIEVES IT HAS CORRECTED 
PROBLEM OF THIN TUNNEL WALLS. BUT QUESTIONS LINGER ABOUT THE WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 2,000 tons of concrete material has been pumped to repair defective 
subway tunnels already open to passengers in Downtown Los Angeles, and 
engineering specialists say the work is nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs began in March after tests verified that numerous areas of the 
tunnels were built with concrete walls thinner than designed, were cracked or 
were leaking water. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the work that's been under way, I think we will come out with what we 
intended to purchase" when the tunnels were constructed, Franklin E. White, 
chief executive officer of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said in 
an interview. "The bottom line is, if we paid for it, we want it." 
</P>
<P>
 But questions have emerged regarding the tunnel construction and the scope of 
the recent tests and repairs performed for the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Some areas of the tunnels were not examined for concrete thickness, records 
show. And water entering the tunnels near Union Station was not sampled -- 
although previous tests had found the area to contain the highest 
concentrations of corrosive, hydrogen sulfide along the subway route. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials hoped that the recent repairs would put to rest what White 
has called a "painful chapter" for the subway, which opened to passengers in 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in August, 1993, that sections of the concrete tunnels 
between Union Station and Pershing Square were built as thin as 4.87 inches -- 
compared to the minimum designed thickness of 12 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 White appointed a panel of outside specialists in the fall of 1993 to examine 
the structures. The panel concluded in February that despite the deficiencies 
the tunnels would remain safe if the filling of voids in the concrete and other 
recommended repairs were performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next eight months, the nation's newest subway was converted into a 
construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 During the late night and early morning, crews of seven men mixed thousands of 
bags of cement with water and other materials, then pumped it into the tunnel 
crowns to fill the air voids. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, the compressors went silent, but chalky grout that streamed from the 
tunnel walls onto the tracks can still be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 While the tunnel repairs were under way, other problems confronted transit 
officials: Sinkages occurred along Hollywood Boulevard, several miles away, 
damaging buildings and forcing a halt to the excavation. Citing displeasure 
with the project's construction quality, the Clinton Administration took the 
extraordinary step Oct. 5 of suspending $1.6 billion in future funding. The 
funding was restored Nov. 10 after the MTA dissolved its construction 
subsidiary, ousted the subsidiary's president and made other organizational 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the FBI and the inspector general of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation pressed their investigations of the project. "The efforts we 
have ongoing with the subway will continue," said Lawrence H. Weintrob, deputy 
assistant inspector general for auditing. 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with the inquiries say investigators are examining, among 
other things, the construction of the tunnels, including the installation of a 
protective plastic liner that has failed to shield the subway Downtown from 
water and potentially toxic and explosive gases. 
</P>
<P>
 The subway project's chief inspector has told a review panel that the liner 
was at times installed negligently, records show. The Times also reported in 
May that gas intrusions throughout the subway have forced the use of 
ventilation fans on hundreds of occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 White negotiated an agreement earlier this year requiring one tunnel builder, 
Tutor-Saliba Corp., to perform the repairs on 1.8 miles of the subway at no 
expense to taxpayers. But now, eight months after the work began, Tutor-Saliba 
is threatening to seek payment for some of its costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that our commitment to be a good corporate citizen has been taken 
advantage of," said company President Ronald N. Tutor in a letter this month to 
White. Tutor criticized the MTA for forcing his company to fill air voids at 
scores of locations, many of which had not been identified before the work 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that this has been a research project at our expense," Tutor wrote. 
"This MUST stop!" Tutor told White he would inform him of the amount he is 
seeking from the MTA when the repair costs are totaled. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor declined in an interview to estimate how much his company has spent on 
the repairs. Based on the price of the grout material and typical labor costs, 
experts estimated that the work to date has cost up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor-Saliba and a joint venture partner built the twin tunnels between Union 
Station and Pershing Square and excavated the site for the Civic Center station 
for $89 million, or 45% over the competitive bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the concrete-based grout material used for the recent repairs was 
pumped into large cavities between the outside of the tunnel shell and the 
surrounding soil. If left unfilled, engineers say, the cavities could 
contribute to water-intrusion problems or settlement of ground surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The grout also has filled extensive air voids, of up to 3 3/4 inches deep, 
within the crowns of the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 The voids, running many feet along the tunnel, apparently have served as 
"channels" for water coursing through the structures, according to Edward J. 
Cording, the chief engineering specialist retained by the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything done to control the water is going to enhance the long-term 
structural capacity" of the tunnels, said Cording, a professor at the 
University of Illinois. "We're trying to minimize the deleterious effects of 
ground water, both on the concrete lining and on its (rods of steel) 
reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 The voids were supposed to have been filled with grout during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems have arisen at the cross passages, which link the twin tunnels 
and house pumping and electrical equipment. The passages have cracks and have 
experienced water leakage. Records show that concrete grout has been pumped to 
fill air voids, of up to 15 inches, found above the roofs of the cross 
passages. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 5, workers performing the repairs at a cross passage near Civic Center 
"discovered that the roof concrete was only 5 1/2 inches thick," according to 
an inspection report. Specifications called for the roof to be built at least 
12 inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,033 tons of concrete-based grout used thus far to repair the subway is 
the equivalent of 104 loaded, full-sized cement trucks. That is enough grout to 
add a 1-inch coating to 1.1 miles of the entire 18-foot, inner diameter of the 
tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've certainly done a lot of work out there," Cording said. 
</P>
<P>
 A parallel independent review undertaken for the MTA concluded early this year 
that the supervision of the original construction -- provided by 
Parsons-Dillingham, the transit agency's inspection management firm -- fell 
short of "acceptable industry practice." Parsons-Dillingham has helped inspect 
the recent repairs at no cost to the MTA and has agreed to pay the $1.4 million 
cost of the outside reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultrasound tests conducted for Cording's panel found that along one point of 
the tunnel wall, 460 feet, or 9% of the length of that tunnel, was thinner than 
the design-specified 12 inches of thickness, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews and thousands of pages of public records also show that: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Cording panel did not test water coming into the tunnels within 600 feet 
-- or the length of two football fields -- of Union Station. It is in this area 
that past studies have found the highest concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, 
which can eat away concrete and its reinforcing steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet officials have emphasized that the water collected for the Cording panel's 
review was not highly corrosive. "The level of hydrogen sulfide is very low, in 
terms of affecting the structure," John M. Hanson, an engineer and one of 
Cording's co-panelists, said in February. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to inquiries from The Times, Cording said last week that he had 
been unaware that water samples were not taken from areas where the highest 
concentrations of hydrogen sulfide would be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent is not to omit that first 600 feet (of tunnels leading south from 
Union Station), as far as I'm concerned," Cording said, adding that he still 
hopes to collect samples from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentrations of hydrogen sulfide are important because the subway 
tunnels were designed and built with a type of concrete that is more vulnerable 
to corrosion than the more costly material originally envisioned by transit 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Also eliminated from the design for cost reasons were water stops, devices 
intended to confine water that intrudes. Officials had altered the type of 
concrete and deleted the water stops based on their hope that the 
1/8-inch-thick plastic liner would provide a barrier to both gas and water. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Cording panel did not study the potential performance of the tunnels at 
a Downtown location where other engineers have said it is more vulnerable to 
damage from a major earthquake. In the area, about 860 feet southwest of Union 
Station, the tunnels pass from firm soil into water-saturated, loose ground 
near Spring Street. The Cording panel also did not measure with ultrasound the 
tunnel concrete thickness through this area. 
</P>
<P>
 An engineering report prepared for Los Angeles transit officials in 1984 
warned of the danger posed at this location and noted that the tunnel design 
did not address the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some settlement of the soil is likely to occur (and) differential dynamic 
motions of soil and rock will develop during the earthquake," said the report 
by Lindvall, Richter & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Hall, a professor at Caltech who specializes in earthquake 
engineering, said recently that he agreed with the Lindvall Richter analysis. 
The Cording panel, he said, should examine the tunnels' crossing of the 
contrasting soils. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that should have been looked at," said Hall, who reviewed 
the earthquake projections compiled by the Cording panel. "I don't think 
there's any question of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cording said he believes the added work is unnecessary because the panel's 
consultants examined how the tunnels would perform under a range of other 
earthquake scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no explicit analysis of the contact between the two (soil) 
materials," Cording said, but he added: "I think they looked at it (the 
tunnel's overall seismic performance) on the conservative side." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the consultants responsible for the recent examinations said that about 
60% of the total length of the tunnels was tested for thickness with 
ultrasound. Cording said his intention had been to test with ultrasound any 
area of the tunnels where thin concrete or other anomalies were suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials have not decided how to address cracks observed at the connections 
between the tunnels and the electrical rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, Cording and his colleagues noted the potential for danger in 
the event of an earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 "Under larger ground motions, it is possible that a several-inch-thick, 
possibly unreinforced part of the wall formed by the cracking at the connection 
between the cross passage and the tunnel could separate. It is recommended that 
procedures for limiting such a separation or other local damage at these 
junctions be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last month, Cording said the MTA's design engineers, headed by 
the firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff, had advised him that repairs were not 
necessary. But when asked more recently whether repairs are needed and if so, 
who would pay for them, Cording said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ready to really discuss that. I think it's really a separate item as 
to whether (Tutor-Saliba) does that, or whether (the MTA) pays for that, or 
whether it's not done." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor, when asked about the matter, said Friday: "We're not doing any more 
work." Repairing the Subway 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous areas of the Downtown Los Angeles subway between Union Station and 
Pershing Square were built with concrete thinner than the design called for. 
Also, extensive air voids in the crowns of the tunnels have acted as channels 
for ground water that has penetrated the structures. After the problems with 
the thin concrete were disclosed in The Times last year, repairs were ordered. 
Here is a look at how the work has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Tests showed that much of the concrete is thinner than the specified 18 
inches in the crown and 12 inches in the walls.

 2) To fill the gaps in the crown, grout was pumped through hoses and steel 
tubes from inside the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Cavities were also found between the outside of the tunnel and the 
surrounding soil. They have been filled from within the tunnels, using longer 
pipes to pump the grout. More than 2,000 tons of grout has been used in the 
repairs.

COMPLEX FAMILY TIES TANGLE SIMPLE PREMISE OF PROP. 187; IMMIGRANTS: IMPACT 
INCLUDES PROBLEMS OF SPLITTING UP PARENTS, CHILDREN AND SPOUSES OF MIXED LEGAL 
STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For sponsors of Proposition 187, the issue is simple: Illegal immigrants, by 
definition lawbreakers, should be denied public services and promptly turned in 
to authorities. Those who do not volunteer to leave should be swiftly deported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal aliens have no right to be here," said Ron Prince, chairman of the 
Proposition 187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Dora Figueroa and many of the other estimated 1.7 million unlawful 
immigrants in California, the situation is much more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Most undocumented people are closely related to U.S. citizens or lawful 
permanent residents, often wives, husbands, parents, siblings or children. Many 
are in the process of seeking papers, usually via spouses or other relatives 
who are legal residents entitled to petition for loved ones under the principle 
of family reunification, long a cornerstone of U.S. immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass deportation would inevitably mean the splitting of hundreds of thousands 
of families, including many whose members are on official waiting lists for 
green cards. Immigration today is very much a family affair, assisted and 
encouraged by networks of relatives well-established in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Figueroa, she is the wife of a lawful permanent resident and 
the mother of a 2-year-old boy, Michael Scott, a U.S. citizen. She is 8 months 
pregnant with another child. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life is here now," said Figueroa, who slipped across the U.S.-Mexico 
border four years ago, completing what has become a rite of passage for 
millions of extended families, an exodus that redefined California's 
demographics -- and has triggered an angry backlash among the voting majority. 
"What scares people most is the idea of being separated from their families, 
from their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Proposition 187's fate in the courts, the essentially familial nature 
of immigration -- combined with the limited capabilities of an overtaxed 
immigration bureaucracy -- weigh against any large-scale repatriations, such as 
the mass return of Mexican nationals during the anti-immigrant campaigns of the 
1930s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I leave? My children are American," said Tammy (she asked that her 
surname not be used). Tammy, her husband, Haim, and three young children 
arrived from Israel seven years ago and opted to overstay their visitors' 
visas, never going back. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who overstay their visas, who make up at least half of the illegal 
immigrants nationwide, face the same problem as those who jump the border. The 
families of undocumented Europeans, Canadians, Asians and others who violated 
their entry visas include many U.S.-born children or relatives awaiting legal 
status via relatives or through other applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "My little girls wouldn't know what the Philippines is like," said one 
undocumented Los Angeles mother of six children, of whom only the two youngest 
are U.S. citizens. Neither of the two speaks Tagalog, the language of their 
ancestral homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 If the courts uphold Proposition 187, she and others could be turned in as 
suspected illegal immigrants by educators at their children's schools, by 
health workers and social service providers, and by police officers who may 
stop them for a traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the woman, like most illegal immigrants interviewed, said she had no 
intention of returning to her homeland voluntarily -- the "self-deportation" 
process that Proposition 187 advocates hope will unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event she is reported to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
arrested and forced to return, Dora Figueroa, for one, vows to be back quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go down and bring her back myself," said her husband, Daniel Gomez, as 
he and his wife relaxed on a recent evening in their apartment on Los Angeles' 
Eastside, one of the nation's most populous new-immigrant enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 15 years or so, scholars say, immigration from Mexico and Central 
America -- by far the principal homelands of California's undocumented 
multitudes -- has become more of a deeply rooted, family-driven phenomenon. 
Long gone is the era when most were migrant men following the harvests and 
returning annually to their families in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here, I thought I would work for a while, save some money, 
and then go back to Mexico," Gomez said. "But as time goes on, that is more and 
more of an illusion." 
</P>
<P>
 A onetime illegal immigrant, Gomez obtained U.S. residency via the amnesty 
program of 1987-88, a sweeping law that conferred legal status on 3 million 
formerly undocumented residents, almost three-quarters of them Mexican 
nationals. It was the world's largest immigration amnesty, and its consequences 
were far-reaching, particularly for California, home of more than half of all 
amnesty beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Gomez and other newly legalized residents began sending for others, 
beckoning them to the land of opportunity. The U.S.-Mexico border proved to be 
a porous barrier. A great unintended consequence of the amnesty program, 
experts agree, was to open the gates to a new influx of unlawful immigration by 
loved ones and acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, presiding over the amnesty process were two Californians -- Alan 
C. Nelson, former national commissioner of the INS, and Harold W. Ezell, ex-INS 
western chief -- who were later among the authors of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Gomez's brothers eventually came north, successfully making the dash 
across the border, as did his future wife, Dora Figueroa, whom he had known 
since boyhood in their hometown of Colima, Mexico. More often than not, 
according to immigrants and scholars, established relatives such as Gomez 
served as the newcomers' anchors and social safety nets, providing friends and 
family with a place to stay, a hot meal, someone to talk to and, as often as 
not, a crucial job contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said he has never sought public benefits, though the family might 
qualify for welfare or food stamps for their U.S. citizen child, considering 
the father's average weekly income of $250 to $300 as a construction worker. 
Unaccustomed to such government largess in his native Mexico, Gomez said he 
would rather not apply and draw official attention upon his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a widespread perception to the contrary, various studies -- including 
an extensive 1992 INS report on amnesty recipients -- concluded that illegal 
immigrants have been comparatively small users of health and social services. 
In fact, illegal immigrants are excluded by statute from most big-ticket 
entitlement programs, such as food stamps, welfare and unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 One service widely used is prenatal care provided under the state-funded 
Medi-Cal program. Proposition 187 bans such aid to illegal immigrants. Gov. 
Pete Wilson has acted to cut off prenatal assistance, although that directive 
is on hold because of a temporary restraining order issued after the election 
against all major provisions of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting pregnancy aid would surely make life more difficult for many illegal 
immigrants -- "I don't know where I'd go for my checkups," said Figueroa, a 
Medi-Cal recipient -- but it would also affect a future generation of U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Undocumented mothers will continue to give birth at California hospitals and 
clinics -- delivery is an emergency service, still to be available even if 
Proposition 187 passes legal muster. And if complications arise after birth 
because of an absence of prenatal care, these newborn citizens will be eligible 
for the full range of public benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Another principal provision of Proposition 187 -- prohibiting illegal 
immigrants from attending public schools and colleges -- also tugs at family 
bonds. Take the case of the Ericka Tejeda and her six children, all residents 
of Los Angeles' Westlake district, a run-down barrio west of Downtown that is 
home to many Central Americans who fled the warfare and grinding poverty of 
their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Tejeda, a 30-year-old native of Guatemala City, braved the border crossing on 
a rainy winter evening a decade ago while cradling her then-infant daughter, 
Claudia, now 12. Mother and daughter remain without papers, but Claudia's 
younger siblings -- Jose, 10, Ericka, 8, Olemi, 7, Deborah, 5, and Andrea, 4 -- 
were all born in Los Angeles and are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Proposition 187, Claudia would have to leave public school while her 
siblings could remain in the classroom. The school district would be required 
to report Claudia and her mother to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like school," said Claudia, a sixth-grader, the other day in the family's 
two-bedroom apartment, decorated with photographs of Claudia and her classmates 
and woven tapestries of sylvan scenes -- an oxcart carrying wood, women washing 
clothing in a rushing stream against a backdrop of majestic volcanoes -- 
depicting a native land that the girl does not remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what she would like to be when she is older, Claudia replied: "A lawyer. 
I'd like to help Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. citizens, Claudia's five brothers and sisters qualify the family for a 
range of public services, including federal welfare payments of $824 a month 
and food stamps totaling $290 monthly, according to the mother. The family's 
eligibility would not change under Proposition 187, though Ericka Tejeda would 
risk being reported to the INS by going to the county social service office. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 proponents argue that the availability of such benefits lures 
unlawful immigrants. But Tejeda said she was unaware of such programs until she 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tejeda family also receives a federal rent subsidy, something that 
advocates have waged a lengthy legal battle to preserve for the many families, 
such as the Tejedas, who include legal and undocumented members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a misnomer to think of an undocumented population that can be easily 
identified and removed," said Charles Wheeler, directing attorney of the Los 
Angeles-based National Immigration Law Center, which has filed one of eight 
lawsuits challenging Proposition 187. "These people, by and large, have been 
here for several years and established family connections." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Bolanos has been in the United States since 1983, when he fled his 
rural coastal homeland in El Salvador's war-ravaged Sonsonate province and made 
the odyssey through Central America to Tijuana, where he jumped the border en 
route to the home of relatives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, part owner (along with an in-law) of a home in the San Fernando Valley, 
Bolanos remains undocumented, as do his three eldest children -- though his 
wife, Teolinda Alvarado, has temporary legal status and his 10-month-old 
daughter, Gabriela, was born in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very difficult for us to return now to El Salvador," Bolanos said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a campesino, Bolanos has been making a living rebuilding alternators and 
other automotive parts at a San Fernando Valley shop for $5.80 an hour. He long 
ago sold his ancestral plot of land back home, he said, in order to help raise 
money for a house down payment here. He has never received public assistance, 
he says, and has always paid his taxes, just as he regularly sent a chunk of 
his paycheck back home each month to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 His eldest three children -- Oscar Arturo, 16, Elsa, 14, and Marvin, 10 -- 
arrived in the United States in May, finally uniting a family that had been 
divided for more than a decade. Now, with Proposition 187 on the books and a 
growing hostility toward illegal immigrants, Bolanos dreads the prospect of a 
family forced to split anew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a great blow if my (eldest) could not go to school," he said. 
"Our idea is that we would all have a life together, and my children would have 
better opportunities in this country. Now they say we have to go back. Go back 
to what?"

QUESTION OF AID; DOES A MAN WHO WAS PARALYZED DURING L.A. RIOTS DESERVE CRIME 
VICTIM FUNDS IF HE WAS ON PAROLE AT THE TIME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Tony Rigor was shot in the back two years ago, the bullet not only left 
him a quadriplegic but touched off a controversy over whether a felon can 
receive victim compensation funds from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to use a wheelchair, Rigor, 28, applied for assistance from 
California's Victims of Crime Program. The agency pays out tens of millions of 
dollars to victims annually -- $86 million to 100,000 people last year. But 
Rigor's application was rejected by the State Board of Control, the 
little-known administrator of the victims aid program. The reason: At the time 
he was shot in Los Angeles during the riots, Rigor was on parole for selling 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigor appealed to Superior Court and won benefits earlier this year. In a 
stinging opinion, Judge Diane Wayne found that the Board of Control had denied 
benefits to Rigor using an "underground" regulation that had not been properly 
enacted. She added that the board's interpretation of relevant California law 
was "nonsensical." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the board enacted a formal emergency regulation declaring that 
felons who are victimized by crime while in prison, on parole or on probation 
are prohibited from receiving aid from the victims program. The board is to 
seek public comment on the regulation at a hearing in Sacramento on Tuesday, a 
required step before making the rule permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Board of Control staff members say the new regulation follows state 
law, one board member said the rule may be inequitable, but is needed because 
money is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say that it is fair," said Ruth Lockhart, who was appointed by Gov. 
Pete Wilson in 1992 to represent the public on the three-member board. "It's 
never fair when a person is a victim under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens," said Lockhart, who is a sales associate with Coldwell Banker 
Residential Real Estate Services in Oakland, "is you have a limited amount of 
resources and it seems like an unlimited amount of people calling on it. The 
good thing would be to provide those services for everyone, but it's not an 
unlimited pool. You just have to say who is the most deserving victim." 
</P>
<P>
 The other two members of the board -- Controller Gray Davis and John Lockwood, 
director of the state Department of General Services -- could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides administering the crime victims program, duties of the Board of 
Control include consideration of claims for damages against the state, 
formulation of travel allowance rules for state employees, and consideration of 
state purchase protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the victims program come from fines and penalties levied by state 
and federal authorities. Last year only 15 felons applied for aid. They were 
all refused assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal Aid Foundation attorney Ronald Kaye, who won the appeal for Rigor, 
maintains that felons are a politically safe target for cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current political climate dictates prejudice against felons," he said, 
"because they're not going to receive the kind of public support that other 
groups in society would receive." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the Board of Control, Kaye said parolees and probationers are 
frequently poor, live in high-crime neighborhoods and are especially vulnerable 
to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If such people were eligible for treatment and rehabilitation under the 
victims aid program, he argued, they would be more likely to lead productive 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has its roots in a public furor that erupted in 1987 when 
convicted child molester Alex Cabarga, serving a 208-year prison sentence, was 
declared eligible by the Board of Control to receive up to $10,000 in crime 
victims aid to pay for psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bizarre case, Cabarga and Luis (Treefrog) Johnson were convicted of 
kidnaping two children and sexually abusing them over a period of 10 months. 
Johnson was sentenced to 527 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabarga's eligibility for victim benefits was based on findings that when 
Cabarga was 9 years old his parents "gave" him to Johnson, who beat him and 
sexually molested him over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the outcry over Cabarga's grant, the Legislature passed a law 
aimed at preventing such awards, but it was not a model of clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statute is a bit murky," said Francis Coats, staff attorney for the Board 
of Control. "People don't agree on what the statute said." 
</P>
<P>
 There is general agreement that the Legislature meant to bar benefits to 
felons while they are in prison, on parole or on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about after the sentence is completed? 
</P>
<P>
 May a prisoner, probationer or parolee who is criminally assaulted be granted 
victims benefits after the sentence is served? 
</P>
<P>
 No, says the Board of Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Tony Sy Rigor, who in the spring of 1992 was a robust 25-year-old on 
parole from prison in Los Angeles after serving two years for selling 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigor's parole agent reported later that the man, who had been trying to learn 
building contracting, made an "excellent adjustment to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But on April 30, two months after Rigor got out of prison, rioting spread 
through the streets of Los Angeles. On that afternoon, Rigor hurriedly walked 
toward the safety of his Central City home. A car screeched around the corner, 
someone yelled a slur against Mexicans and a large caliber handgun roared. 
Rigor was slammed to the pavement, his spinal cord severed. 
</P>
<P>
 After months in the hospital, he turned to the crime victims program, asking 
for $40,000 to buy a special bed and mattress, a portable wheelchair ramp, a 
lift to get him into vehicles and a van to take him to rehabilitation and his 
college classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Control routinely denied the application. But Judge Wayne later 
saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne ruled that state law prevents a felon from receiving victims aid until 
completion of a prison sentence, parole or probation. Rigor was discharged from 
parole March 9, 1993, and the Board of Control denied his claim two weeks 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Significantly," Wayne wrote, "the statute does not state that a person is not 
considered a 'victim' of crimes committed during the period of confinement or 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only limitation," she continued, "is that a felon is not entitled to 
receive assistance while in confinement (or on parole). . . . Hence it is 
appropriate for an applicant to receive benefits after parole for an injury 
sustained while under criminal status." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling does not set a legal precedent and, pending finalization of the 
emergency regulations, the Board of Control continues to deny benefits to other 
claimants who were victimized while in prison, on parole or on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree with the judge," said Curt Soderlund, deputy executive officer of 
the board. "We were here when that law was passed. It was clear that felons 
can't get benefits from the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigor was granted $9,800 for the special bed and mattress, the portable ramp 
and the lift. The van was denied as not necessary and Rigor is appealing the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutbacks of county van services for the handicapped, he said, have made it 
nearly impossible for him to get rehabilitation without his own van. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me the lift," he said. "But what good is the lift without the van?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rigor would like to study counseling in order to help troubled youths. He 
believes that rehabilitation could someday allow him to move his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always hope, you know."

AT THIS ROADSIDE ATTRACTION, NATURE'S CUP RUNNETH OVER; WATER: PEOPLE COME FROM 
MILES AROUND TO FILL CONTAINERS AT BAY TREE SPRINGS SPIGOT. FREE-FLOWING 
UNDERGROUND STREAM IS ONE OF SEVERAL TAPPED BY FOREST SERVICE FOR PUBLIC USE. 
</P>

<P>
 They come from miles around, their vans, pickup trucks and sedans filled with 
five-gallon jugs, pilgrims in search of the water of Bay Tree Springs, an 
unpretentious spigot alongside a mountain highway between here and Idyllwild. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is better, aficionados and old-timers say, than you'll find on any 
grocery store shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 And so they make the pilgrimage to the small rock grotto alongside California 
243, 12 miles up the grade from Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 A man from Palm Desert drives up every two weeks and says the water has 
medicinal qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Hamilton of Pasadena says it's the best water she can find too. "It's a 
cleaner, fresher taste than any other water," she announces, like a saleswoman 
for Mother Nature. She heard of Bay Tree Springs from a friend in Palm Springs 
who makes the trek here too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water is sweet," said Siamee Siong, who comes up monthly with enough 
containers to cart away 40 gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Soda Boutchaleune and his wife, Sond, showed up last week with their Nissan 
sports coupe filled to the headliner with 35 empty plastic bottles and jugs. He 
was relieved to find that he wouldn't have to wait more than an hour, like he 
did last time. 
</P>
<P>
 And Vang Chor has the routine down so well that he simply uncurls a 50-foot 
length of hose to get the water from the tap to the containers in his van. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret of the water? 
</P>
<P>
 There is none. It's simply one of only four artesian springs in Southern 
California that the U.S. Forest Service has literally tapped for domestic use. 
</P>
<P>
 Another one is a few miles away, in a remote campground. And two others are 
north of Ojai in Ventura County, alongside California 33 in the Los Padres 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The water of Bay Tree Springs filters down through a forest of Jeffrey pines 
at 7,000 feet, seeping into various cracks, seams and crevices of fractured 
granite and porous sandstone that bank the moisture for months. The water 
migrates down, beneath California black oaks, low mountain live oaks and 
manzanita and scrub oaks, staying always cool, always clean. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,200 feet elevation, the water seeps out the side of the mountain. It 
is channeled by a small pipe to the roadside pullout, where it pours out of a 
rock fountain 24 hours a day. If no one is there to catch it, it splashes 
through a grate and flows beneath the highway to the forest lands below. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is tested regularly by the Riverside County Health Department, and 
it passes with flying clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I drive by there, no matter what time it is, there's always at 
least three cars lined up, with people and containers, waiting to fill up," 
said Kathy Valenzuela, the natural resources officer for the Forest Service's 
San Jacinto District. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past 11 years, I can only think of one time when it didn't pass the 
water quality test -- and that's because the pipe got dirty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, travelers had an easier time finding mountain spring water for 
the tapping, thanks in large part to spigots maintained by Caltrans. Among the 
most popular was a watering hole known as Mormon Springs, along California 18 
near Crestline. 
</P>
<P>
 But that spring and others like it were sealed off, either because of the cost 
of continued maintenance of vandalized pipes or because the water quality 
worsened and became a public liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service lands are peppered with wells, primarily for use at 
campgrounds, and residents on forest land maintain their own private wells for 
domestic water use. 
</P>
<P>
 But foresters discourage campers, hikers and other visitors from simply 
dipping their canteens into streams. Despite outward appearances, the water may 
be full of microbes that will cause a host of intestinal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The best water, then, is from free-flowing underground springs. Most of those 
sources are well off the beaten path, and improved only enough by rangers to 
make them functionally useful for deer, mountain lions, bobcats and other 
forest wildlife, Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bay Tree Springs, the biggest problem is created by people who monopolize 
the spigot to tap hundreds of gallons of water at a time, while someone with 
one container waits for a turn, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard of people who come up with trucks, and there's some suspicion that 
they're selling the water later, but that's something we can't regulate," 
Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one company -- Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water Co. -- does pump water 
out of wells in Waterman Canyon in the San Bernardino National Forest to bottle 
for commercial customers. Although it pays fees for access to forest land and 
to operate the attendant machinery, it does not pay for the water thanks to a 
longstanding federal policy that well water on federal land is free for the 
taking. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Forest Service officials are now reconsidering that policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a great dichotomy in how we manage our commodities," said 
Bernice Bigelow, a Forest Service resource officer assigned to Angeles National 
Forest. "We have leases and require royalties for the extraction of federal oil 
and gas, and I don't understand why there's not the same for water. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There have been long, heated discussions among my peers and counterparts on 
that, and the decision will be made at a political level," Bigelow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Forest Service said it does not want to consider itself to be in 
the domestic water business, it will always have water available for personal 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Campers are always coming up to our spigot," said Robin Butler, a wildlife 
biologist at the Forest Service station at Big Bear. "They may not realize it, 
but it's tapped to city plumbing."

UKRAINE PRESIDENT TO PRESS U.S. ON DISARMAMENT AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Having calmed Western concerns about its nuclear arsenal by agreeing to join 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Ukraine took its own atomic anxieties to 
the United States on Saturday as President Leonid D. Kuchma left for a state 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Speeding up U.S. aid to pay for the dismantling of nuclear warheads and to 
support Kuchma's market reforms will top the agenda of the two-day summit with 
President Clinton starting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine has taken on the enormous burdens of nuclear disarmament," Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said after Parliament accepted the treaty 
Wednesday. "And we need financial help." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States has been promising that help since the George Bush 
Administration, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Shmarov, in Washington last 
week to prepare for Kuchma's visit, said the U.S. disarmament funds are being 
blocked by "bureaucratic barriers and inertia." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $350 million promised by Washington last year, Ukraine has received no 
more than $5 million in equipment, Shmarov complained. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first big U.S. aid package promised to Ukraine, the assistance program 
has assumed a symbolic importance that goes beyond physically disposing of the 
third-largest nuclear arsenal in the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is indicative of all Western aid," said Kuchma adviser Bohdan Havrylyshyn, 
reflecting a widely held view here. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliamentary adviser Ian Brzezinski said it is "ironic that the Clinton 
Administration's highest-priority assistance program -- for denuclearizing 
Ukraine -- has become a principal source of disillusionment with America's 
commitment to Ukraine's future." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials concede that spending has lagged. But their efforts to persuade 
Ukrainian leaders that aid is in the pipeline have not worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come here with picture books showing they've ordered electric drills 
which you can buy in any hardware store," Havrylyshyn said of the thick, 
illustrated briefing books U.S. officials tote to Kiev. "It's discouraging, 
especially when Ukraine is ahead of schedule on delivering warheads." 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement signed with the United States and Russia last January, 
Ukraine has delivered 400 of its 1,800 warheads to Russia in exchange for 
nuclear fuel, Shmarov said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 176 missiles housing those warheads become militarily useless, so do 
the 2,500 military officers who service them. Ukraine is trying to spend $50 
million of the promised U.S. funds to build civilian housing for the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 A cap of $20 million on such housing projects in fiscal 1995, sponsored by 
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, stands in the way. 
Nevertheless, most analysts believe that the Republican sweep of the U.S. 
legislative landscape bodes well for Ukraine, even if it results in an overall 
decline of American foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more Republican senators committed to Ukraine than Democrats," said 
Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who advises Kuchma. "So it's likely to get a 
larger share of a smaller cake." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, however, the amount of aid promised is less important to 
Ukraine than its delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking office last summer, Kuchma has embarked on an ambitious program 
of market reform that has earned him the International Monetary Fund's seal of 
approval. Now he needs Western financial aid to maintain momentum in the face 
of opposition in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Ukraine needs $1.5 billion to pay for energy imports from 
Russia and Turkmenistan, plus a stabilization fund for replacing the 
inflation-ravaged karbovanets, now worth 150,000 to the dollar, with a new 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Communists and Socialists make up the largest faction of the 
Parliament elected last spring, their power is declining. They have been unable 
to block Kuchma's reform decrees, including one privatizing farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 An indication of leftist strength in the Parliament came last month as a bill 
lifting a 1991 ban on the Soviet-era Communist Party first passed by three 
votes. But after an investigation turned up irregularities in the voting, a 
second vote was taken. The same bill failed by nine. 
</P>
<P>
 But that small margin could quickly swing the other way, Kuchma's advisers 
warn, when the most painful shocks of market reforms set in. 
</P>
<P>
 An infusion of U.S. aid "would strengthen Kuchma's hand internally," said 
adviser Havrylyshyn, a Geneva-based economist. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from government aid, Kuchma will also seek private investment -- first 
in New York, where he flew Saturday, and then in Washington.

IRISH MINISTER WILL TRY TO FORM NEW GOVERNMENT; POLITICS: BERTIE AHERN IS NAMED 
TO REPLACE TOPPLED PREMIER AS PARTY LEADER. HE CALLS PEACE A 'PRIORITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Finance Minister Bertie Ahern was picked Saturday by Ireland's largest party 
to try to form a new government, and he immediately put peace in Northern 
Ireland at the top of his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace is still the most important issue and priority for us," said Ahern, who 
could become prime minister if he can build a coalition for his Fianna Fail 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahern must lure back the Labor Party, which brought down the government of 
former Fianna Fail leader Albert Reynolds last week when it left the coalition 
over the appointment of a religious conservative to Ireland's High Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as one of the strongest negotiators in Reynolds' coalition, the 
43-year-old Ahern said he would "like to bring any talent I have for 
conciliation to bridge the political divisions in the north." 
</P>
<P>
 He must heal the rift with the Labor Party by Tuesday, when Parliament is 
scheduled to vote on forming a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, 60, resigned as prime minister and party chief Thursday after Labor 
pulled out of his coalition government over the appointment of his attorney 
general to the High Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor said Harry Whelehan was unfit for promotion because as attorney general 
he had failed to extradite to Northern Ireland a priest facing child 
molestation charges there. Whelehan also resigned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds argued that allowing his government to fall would jeopardize a chance 
for peace in Northern Ireland, where the Irish Republican Army has declared a 
cease-fire in its 25-year-old campaign against British rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the cease-fire, Reynolds met with Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein 
-- the IRA's political ally -- and had prodded Britain to speed up 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahern said he will not be rushed into coalition talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to be forced into either government or opposition," he said. 
"We will do what is right for Fianna Fail, and then we will make our 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fianna Fail is expected to hold talks soon with Labor, which is too small 
to lead but too substantial not to be accommodated as a junior partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Its leader, Dick Spring, was the highly regarded deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister under Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Dublin, Ahern was elected to the Dail, the lower house of Ireland's 
Parliament, in 1977. He joined the Cabinet as labor minister in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahern was considered a contender for the Fianna Fail leadership in 1991 when 
his mentor, Charles Haughey, resigned as prime minister. But Ahern stood aside 
in favor of Reynolds and was rewarded with the finance minister's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahern's sole involvement in recent peace moves has been participating in 
sessions of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, Reynolds' project for 
giving Sinn Fein a forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyish and famously unstylish, Ahern is known as a pragmatist in economic 
policy but a conservative on social issues. A profile in the Irish Times this 
week said he had reservations about legislation that made contraceptives more 
widely available, and he might oppose any moves to legalize divorce in this 
overwhelming Roman Catholic country.

REPUBLICANS UNLIKELY TO GIVE CLINTON FREE REIN TO MAKE FOREIGN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS and NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Bill Clinton had any thought of spending the next two years as a foreign 
policy President, some of Congress' new Republican leaders are warning that 
he'd better think again. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the incoming majority leader, who says he wants 
U.S. troops in Haiti home by Thanksgiving -- not next March, as Clinton plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the next chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, who calls foreign aid a "rat hole" and says the U.S. 
effort to broker peace between Israel and Syria is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Sen. Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, probable chairman of the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, who wants to block funds to carry out Clinton's 
nuclear deal with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans who are set to take over Capitol Hill in January have a 
foreign policy agenda that clashes with Clinton's in almost every particular: 
less money for foreign aid, more reluctance to use U.S. troops in peacekeeping 
operations and deep skepticism about the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 And those policy differences are fueled by the imperatives of partisan 
politics. The Republicans, looking ahead to the 1996 presidential election, are 
determined to deny Clinton the high ground of foreign policy leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't get any kind of free ride," warned Margaret Tutwiler, a political 
aide to then-Secretary of State James A. Baker III during the George Bush 
Administration. "Republicans are going to be asking all kinds of hard questions 
about foreign policy, just as Democrats used to when there was a Republican in 
the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Nov. 8 GOP landslide, some White House aides said 
Clinton might spend more time on international affairs, where he would have 
more leeway to act independently of Congress than on domestic issues. But Dole, 
Helms and other Republicans have warned that they won't let Clinton get away so 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we ought to take a look at foreign policy," Dole said in a television 
interview five days after the election. "We ought to get the troops out of 
Haiti by Thanksgiving. . . . We ought to lift the arms embargo in Bosnia. We 
ought to investigate whether or not we got a good deal in North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledges that conflict is inevitable between a President from one 
party and a Congress controlled by the other. But he told a news conference 
during his post-election trip to Asia, "I do think on the really pivotal 
matters we'll be able to achieve the kind of bipartisan . . . consensus to do 
what's right for the country."  
</P>
<P>
 But since Nov. 8, Republican foreign policy aides say they have spent most of 
their time charting ways to press their bosses' disagreements with Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
 HAITI: Most Republicans opposed Clinton's decision to send U.S. troops to 
reinstall Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president of Haiti. Now that the GOP 
controls Congress, they plan to make the continued deployment as painful as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission's complete," Dole said. "We are going to bring back 6,000 troops. 
My view is we ought to hurry up and bring back the other 9,000 troops. It 
doesn't serve any purpose if there's no problem there." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials say that withdrawing all U.S. troops too early could 
lead to a collapse of civil order in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) has asserted that the Haiti operation will cost as 
much as $3 billion over the first six months, far more than the 
Administration's initial estimate of about $500 million. GOP aides have 
suggested holding a major debate over a supplemental appropriation for the 
larger amount to bring home to voters how much the operation is costing. 
</P>
<P>
 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA: Dole and others have demanded that the United States break 
openly with its European allies and abandon the U.N. arms embargo on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We're finally putting a little pressure on our allies in 
Bosnia, but my view is we ought to lift the arms embargo, give the Bosnians a 
chance to defend themselves," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who initially favored lifting the arms embargo, has shied away from 
taking the step unilaterally because it would violate a U.N. Security Council 
resolution and touch off a crisis with the allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has finessed the point through a series of awkward 
compromises, drawing up plans for arms sales to Bosnia, formally conferring 
with Congress and submitting doomed resolutions to the Security Council. But 
Dole appears bent on using the Republican majority to try to force 
Administration action. 
</P>
<P>
 NORTH KOREA: Last month, Republican leaders denounced Clinton's deal with 
North Korea to halt the Communist regime's nuclear weapons program in exchange 
for energy aid from the United States, Japan and South Korea. Now they plan to 
make sure no substantial U.S. money goes to carry out the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at every angle we can to stop any funds and call them to 
account," an aide to Murkowski said. GOP aides concede that they probably 
cannot stop the Administration from paying about $5 million for short-term fuel 
shipments to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say Murkowski and others will act to block any significant spending. 
As a result, the Administration is seeking agreement from Japan, South Korea 
and other countries to pick up those costs. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MIDDLE EAST: Helms alarmed both sides of the Arab-Israeli negotiations 
last week by saying he wasn't sure the talks, which have enjoyed wide 
bipartisan support, are such a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Syria doesn't want peace with Israel," he said. "What Syria wants is the 
Golan Heights -- plus, of course, access to the American taxpayers' money. 
Congress needs to get off the dime and demand a reassessment of the entire 
Middle East peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Helms' aides say the senator's main concern is that a peace agreement may 
include a large new commitment of U.S. aid for Syria -- and a large new 
commitment of American peacekeeping troops to patrol the Syrian-Israeli 
frontier. Administration officials acknowledge that both of those may be part 
of a settlement -- and that both could be difficult to get through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 One official said of the proposed U.S. peacekeeping force on the Golan: "It 
will be substantial and it will be controversial. We will be making a mistake 
if we think this one will be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 THE UNITED NATIONS: Helms has called the United Nations the "nemesis of 
millions of Americans . . . costing the taxpayer billions of dollars." Most 
other GOP leaders are not this hostile, but they resist spending more on U.N. 
peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has already paid $1.2 billion to the United Nations for 
peacekeeping this year but owes $400 million more to cover its pledge to pay 
for 30% of total costs. 
</P>
<P>
 FOREIGN AID: U.S. military and economic aid budgeted for this year totals 
$12.3 billion; that's down 20% from the previous year and is about 0.1% of the 
U.S. economy, a smaller share than any other rich country spends. Still, many 
Republicans like the idea of cutting foreign aid because most taxpayers don't 
see much benefit from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the probable chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign aid, says he wants to subject 
the entire foreign aid system to a searching new review. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the areas McConnell wants to cut is one close to Clinton's heart: the 
roughly $60 million being spent in Northern Ireland in hopes that economic 
development will bring about peace. "A slush fund for a country that's part of 
the European Union," an aide said dismissively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's response has been diplomatic. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher made a conciliatory telephone call to Helms, saying he would try to 
be cooperative. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott made a point of 
praising McConnell for his work on aid to the former Soviet Union -- even 
though McConnell has been strongly critical of Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the Agency for International Development, 
says he has already cut the foreign aid budget 20% from its level during the 
Bush Administration, and 70% of what is left pays U.S. companies to provide 
goods and services overseas. AID officials are combing their contracts to 
determine how many workers in Helms' North Carolina owe their jobs to U.S. 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a small percentage of Congress who will believe we should have 
no foreign aid program at all," Atwood said. He said he hoped to convince the 
rest that the program is necessary for "our own well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 And he noted that foreign aid's Republican supporters include the probable new 
chairmen of both the Senate and House appropriations committees, Sen. Mark O. 
Hatfield of Oregon and Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Helms had to pull in his horns last week. After newspapers in Israel 
reported that the senator was thinking about cutting U.S. aid, he telephoned 
the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Itamar Rabinovich, to assure him 
that he would not touch the $3 billion Israel receives annually in military and 
economic assistance.

MOZAMBIQUE REELECTS LEADER

<P>
 The ruling party won last month's presidential elections but will have to 
share power in Parliament with rebels it fought for 19 years, according to 
final results released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the Oct. 27-29 ballot confirmed what election officials had 
said for days: President Joaquim Chissano was reelected and his Mozambique 
Liberation Front, or Frelimo, edged past the former rebels in the parliamentary 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The close finish in Parliament was a shock for the ruling party, which 
embarked on democratic reforms in the late 1980s. Chissano was seen as the 
instigator of the reforms and was clearly more popular than his party. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first multi-party vote since independence from Portugal in 1975, 
and it came two years after the government and rebels signed a U.N.-mediated 
treaty ending 15 years of civil war. The war killed 600,000 people and 
devastated this southeast African nation.

WOUNDED MOTHER UNAWARE SNIPER KILLED HER CHILD

 One day after 7-year-old Nermin Divovic was shot dead on a Sarajevo street, 
his body lies in the city morgue awaiting the return of his soldier-father 
before it can be buried. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 yards from the morgue, his mother, Dzenana Sokolovic, lies in the 
hospital, unaware her son is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nermin was shot in the head Friday by a Bosnian Serb sniper as he sprinted 
across Sarajevo's notorious "Sniper Alley." More than 1,500 children have been 
slain in the city during the 2 1/2-year war. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother was wounded by the same bullet that killed her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't know about her child," said Mediha Smajli, a nurse at Kosevo 
Hospital, where the mother was recovering Saturday. "Everybody's coming here, 
but nobody's telling her anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Nermin's father, Pasa Divovic, was told of the death and was 
rushing back to Sarajevo from the front in central Bosnia.

SOLDIER SHOT AS BRAZIL ARMY ENCIRCLES SLUMS

<P>
 The army tightened its noose around Rio shantytowns Saturday in an attempt to 
choke the drug trade that has corrupted police and turned hillside slums into 
armed fortresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Mangueira slum on Rio's poor north side woke up to see 500 
soldiers had taken over the ghetto with tanks, armored cars and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 One soldier was injured when drug traffickers opened fire, an army spokesman 
said. The army did not shoot back, the Globo TV network reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Some soldiers, many of whom live in Rio's estimated 400 shantytowns, wore ski 
masks to avoid possible reprisals from cocaine and marijuana dealers and 
weapons smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
 The army seized four pistols, one grenade and three kilos of marijuana in 
Mangueira and arrested more than 52 people, most for not carrying 
identification, Globo reported. 
</P>

 Army helicopters covered several hundred troops that surrounded the Dende slum 
on Governor's Island, a middle-class district in Guanabara Bay near Rio's 
international airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers, equipped with assault rifles and grenades, arrested 15 people in 
the raid on the island, believed to be a main gateway for weapons smuggled in 
through the airport.

<P>
 Gen. Zenildo Lucena, the army minister, has said the objective of Operation 
Rio is to "starve" the drug trade and clean up Rio's corrupt police forces. 
</P>
<P>
 President Itamar Franco sent the military into Rio three weeks ago after a 
series of drug-related killings, kidnapings and armored car robberies prompted 
a public outcry. Troops moved on Friday to surround five hilltop slums. 
</P>
<P>
 Police statistics show that 20 people are murdered daily in this city of 6 
million. Some city morgue officials estimate the homicide rate could be twice 
as high. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the crackdown, army intelligence agents infiltrated the state 
police to root out corruption. About 30 officers, including eight top 
officials, have quit in the last two weeks.

 Three rafts with 36 people aboard were found in the Baltic Sea off the 
southern tip of Sweden, a news agency reported.Most of the people on the rafts 
were from Afghanistan, police said. Larger boats in the area were being checked 
to see if smugglers had put the rafts in the water outside Sweden. Refugees 
from the Middle East, Asia and the Indian subcontinent frequently travel 
through the republics of the former Soviet Union and pay smugglers to transport 
them across the Baltic Sea to Scandinavia.

JOINT CHIEFS HEAD SAYS CLINTON ABLE IN MILITARY AFFAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff voiced strong confidence in 
President Clinton as commander in chief, taking issue Friday with a statement 
by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
 In an unsolicited telephone interview, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili said he was 
compelled by Helms' critical remarks to speak out and avoid any impression that 
the military leadership endorses the senator's assertion that Clinton has not 
demonstrated an ability to command the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not share that view," he said. "I have been with the President in 
difficult deliberations and have always found him able to understand the 
issues, ask the tough questions and make the hard decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Helms, who is in line to head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was 
asked on CNN's "Evans and Novak" whether he thought Clinton was "up to the job" 
of commander in chief. He replied: "Well, you know, you ask an honest question. 
I'll give you an honest answer. No I do not. And neither do the people in the 
armed forces."

HOPE DIMS FOR ENDING U.S. MILITARY'S TURF WARS; DEFENSE: SERVICE BRANCHES FEUD 
OVER FUNCTIONS AND ARMS. CONGRESS HAD SET UP COMMISSION TO REDUCE DUPLICATION 
AND WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Navy wants to stop the Air Force from controlling all "deep-strike" 
bombing missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army wants to edge the Marines out of the action in fighting major land 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines are looking for a few good tanks -- most of which are now owned by 
the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force is angling for its own warplanes -- and not the Navy's 
carrier-borne aircraft -- to be the first to respond to trouble anywhere around 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the world of "roles and missions" -- the armed services' lengthy 
and heated effort to redefine which functions each should perform and what 
kinds of weapons each should have in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of Defense Department refusals to tackle the issue -- and a couple 
of false starts by the military itself -- Congress last year finally set up an 
independent Commission on Roles and Missions to referee the fracas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the exercise, only a few months old, has already degenerated into a 
military food fight, dimming hopes that any serious sorting-out actually will 
be achieved: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Air Force, in what some complain was a last hurrah by its outgoing chief 
of staff, Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, put down some markers that outraged leaders 
of the three other services. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Clinton Administration has yet to provide any real leadership in the 
effort. Insiders say top Pentagon officials, seeking only to protect the 
existing military structure, have discouraged any further discussion on how to 
reshape the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Roles and Missions Commission itself has hinted that it is unlikely to 
recommend sweeping changes. John P. White, the chairman, says the panel will 
hew mainly to ideas that seem "implementable" and avoid any "dramatic . . . 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is important because duplication in the military has reached such 
proportions that some analysts say it is impeding effectiveness and siphoning 
off badly needed defense dollars that could be better used for modernization 
and preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert H. Gaskin, a former Pentagon strategist, argues that with the defense 
budget under pressure -- and new technology altering the way America goes to 
war -- streamlining the military "is one of the critical defense issues we 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to consolidate our military 
Establishment and improve the way the individual services work together," 
Gaskin said. "What is being done now could have a serious impact for decades to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over roles and missions has been going on virtually since the 
invention of the airplane. Before that, the division of labor was simple: The 
Army fought the nation's land wars and the Navy fought its sea battles. Few 
conflicts arose. 
</P>
<P>
 Military aviation changed all that. Former Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) has 
observed that the United States is the only major power in the world that 
maintains four distinct air forces. (The Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force all 
have warplanes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Overlaps mushroomed during the Cold War, as planners found that some 
redundancy was necessary insurance in case part of the U.S. force was wiped 
out. Interservice rivalry fueled the competition. Sophisticated new technology 
blurred the lines even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, repetition is rampant. Army helicopters and Air Force and Marine Corps 
fighters can provide cover for U.S. ground troops. The Navy, Air Force and Army 
are equipped to send bombs or missiles far into enemy territory. And all defend 
against enemy planes and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the major force 
behind the current effort, has suggested that the military might be able to 
save billions of dollars by sorting out such functions more carefully and 
eliminating some of the duplication. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn also has pinpointed a spate of redundant institutions, including separate 
medical, legal and chaplains' corps for each service, that he says might be run 
more efficiently if they were combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson Murray, a military historian at Ohio State University, argues that 
the roles-and-missions exercise should aim for more than mere budget-cutting. 
The goal, he says, should be reshaping the military to adapt to the new 
post-Cold War threats and to exploit today's technology. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cold War over, he says, the military must eliminate the redundancies 
that were permitted when the United States and Soviet Union were at odds. "My 
guess is that we can't fix them all," he said. "But we have to do a better 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Goure, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 
wishes that the debate would spur fundamental decisions on using ground forces 
and air power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, this discussion should be helping to resolve the whole question of 
the military's role in carrying out U.S. foreign policy," he said. "It's a real 
opportunity -- not just to redivide the pie but to redefine the entire menu." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts argue that not all duplications are wastes. The Marines' way of 
conducting ground combat operations, for example, is far different from the 
Army's. Its pilots are trained specially to provide air cover that fits that 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
 And in some cases, merging two or more seemingly duplicate entities might not 
save much money at all. The military still would need the same number of 
physicians, lawyers and chaplains as it has now, for example, even if they were 
combined under a single service. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew F. Krepinevich, director of the Defense Budget Project, a 
defense-monitoring group, argues that saving money is not the only reason for 
the roles-and-missions exercise. Even the most radical proposals would not 
fully relieve the military's budget problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has begun some modest efforts. The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
recommended last year that the services combine all basic flight training under 
one roof. And the four may consolidate at least some of their supply depots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nunn and other critics argue that the reform should go far beyond such 
peripheral issues to broader questions -- such as which service should be 
charged with projecting U.S. air power, which should fight the major land wars 
and which should provide close air support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental question is not what is best for the Navy or the Air Force," 
Nunn said. "The question is, what is best for America." 
</P>
<P>
 To Gaskin, now with Business Executives for National Security, a defense 
monitoring group, that means dividing the battlefield into segments -- from 
outer space to the rear areas behind the battlefield -- and "looking at what 
each service brings to the table." 
</P>
<P>
 By those standards, at least, McPeak's controversial proposals go furthest. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Air Force chief of staff wants the Pentagon to give his service -- 
rather than the Navy -- the primary job in projecting U.S. military power to 
potential global trouble spots, arguing that it would be faster and cheaper 
than maintaining 12 aircraft carriers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his proposal, the Air Force would also control all strategic bombing and 
missile strikes, and it would take over complete responsibility for defense 
against air and missile attacks. Providing close air support for ground troops 
would be left to the Army and Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 The other services are battling to protect their turf. The Marines, resisting 
McPeak's proposal to bar them from anything beyond providing close air support 
for troops, want to maintain their tactical air wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials argue that the United States might not always be able to win 
permission to use other countries' airfields for bombing missions, as the 
former Air Force chief's plan would require. They also counter that launching 
ship-based Tomahawk missiles for deep-strike operations is often faster and 
more effective than sending squadrons of bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, in a rare move, the chiefs of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps 
angrily signed a joint memo opposing a related McPeak move to have the Air 
Force assume control of all military operations in space. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Wilkerson, the Marine Corps' point man on the 
roles-and-missions debate, says he finds it "ironic" that the Air Force is 
trying to segment the battlefield at a time when the services have begun to 
perfect their ability to operate jointly, as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gen. McPeak is assuming that the enemy will 'get the lecture' and go along 
with what he proposes," Wilkerson said. "Actually, the enemy will draw his own 
lines, and we need to have the flexibility to meet that threat." 
</P>
<P>
 McPeak's proposal is not the only roles-and-missions battleground. The Army 
and Marine Corps, for example, are fighting over which should get more of the 
ground action in post-Cold War military operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army wants recognition as the primary service for fighting "sustained" 
land wars, leaving the Marines to play a limited role in more modest, 
short-term operations, such as peacekeeping duty in Haiti. It also is moving 
deeper into the area of amphibious operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines, seeking to widen their own role, want more Army tanks and V-22 
Osprey troop-carrying aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming free-for-all is not expected to be tidy. The services have begun 
campaigning, not only among members of the Roles and Missions Commission, but 
also among their longtime supporters in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the 11-member Roles and Missions Commission has taken a step 
toward some reform. The panel's ambitious, 26-issue agenda includes such topics 
as improving joint war fighting, streamlining the current command structure and 
sorting out military air operations. It plans to issue final recommendations 
within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission has only a small staff, and many of its members are retired 
military officers long identified with preserving the status quo. The panel 
itself has been meeting only once a month, and not everyone shows up. Skeptics 
question whether it is up to the job. Military Overlap

GORE STEPS UP CAMPAIGN FOR TRADE PACT; TREATY: VICE PRESIDENT SAYS ACCORD WOULD 
SPAWN TAX CUTS, REDUCE PRICES, CREATE JOBS. IT IS BELIEVED TO BE SHORT BY THREE 
TO FIVE VOTES IN THE SENATE.

<P>
 Vice President Al Gore renewed the stateside sales pitch for passage of a new 
world trade agreement Saturday, calling it a massive tax cut that will bring 
down prices for consumers and create lucrative jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration says it is three to five votes short in the Senate 
and in good shape in the House as it prepares to take the 123-country trade 
agreement to Congress for a vote at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement to lower duties and other trade barriers worldwide will be the 
first test of how the rising Republicans and diminishing Democrats can get 
along after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, stepping in for the traveling President Clinton in his weekly radio 
address, said congressional critics who want to put off voting on the accord 
until the Republicans take control of Congress in January are actually out to 
kill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, returning to Washington today, talked up the accord negotiated under 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade when he was at a trade summit in 
Indonesia last week. He said its passage will be his priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore went on the offensive from Washington, using some of the same arguments 
employed in his campaign for the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "GATT contains the biggest tax cut in history -- a record $744-billion 
reduction in tariffs, which will lower prices for consumers and spark economic 
growth around the globe, and, most importantly, here at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like NAFTA, ratified in November, 1993, with heavy Republican support, the 
world treaty cuts across party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said both Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the incoming House Speaker, and 
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the outgoing House majority leader and a 
frequent critic of liberalized trade, "agree that we need GATT this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush urged rapid Senate approval of GATT, saying at a 
forum Saturday in San Diego that it will increase employment in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think approval is absolutely essential if the U.S. is going to continue to 
lead, and if we want to continue to increase the job base in this country," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate prospects will depend in part on whether the Administration can 
satisfy incoming Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said last week he'd rather "fix it and do it this year" if his concerns 
can be dealt with. He's seeking some method of escape if the agreement turns 
out to be bad for American interests or impinges on U.S. sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 GATT critics in both parties say cheaper imports would put Americans out of 
work. They also say multinational regulation of the agreement by the proposed 
World Trade Organization would put food safety rules and other U.S. regulations 
at risk because they might be judged an unfair trade barrier.

'I WALK IN FEAR'; A FAMILY OF IMMIGRANTS IN OXNARD WILL SPLIT UP RATHER THAN 
DEAL WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The land of opportunity has never held much for Silvia Alfaro. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing, not the poverty of farm work or the uncertainty of being an 
illegal immigrant, has ever shaped her life as much as Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican native is packing her bags and returning to her home state of 
Oaxaca. Her two children -- both of whom were born in this country and are 
therefore U.S. citizens -- will go with her, becoming foreigners in a country 
they have never known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walk in fear," said the 20-year-old Oxnard resident, who will catch a plane 
out of Tijuana early next month. "I'm afraid to take my children to the doctor. 
I'm afraid to wait for the bus. I'm afraid to leave my house." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro's live-in fiance -- the father of her youngest child -- will head to 
Minneapolis when she leaves, a place where he hears work is good and where he 
knows for sure there is no Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard, because this is all the family I have. But it's better this way," 
said Felix Rubio, who illegally immigrated to the United States about four 
years ago. "If we didn't have this oppression with 187, then we could stay. But 
we can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the measure won overwhelming approval nearly two weeks ago, immigrant 
rights advocates warned that it could result in the splitting of thousands of 
families statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are few reports of illegal immigrants packing up and returning 
home, the advocates fear that this is only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what I expected, and I don't know how people could have 
expected anything else," said Eileen McCarthy, a lawyer with California Rural 
Legal Assistance in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all the people who voted for this initiative, and who assuaged their 
consciences by telling themselves this was only sending a message to the 
federal government, this is the grim and tragic reality." 
</P>
<P>
 For Silvia Alfaro and Felix Rubio, the reality of the United States has always 
been something short of the promise for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by the deepening poverty of their homeland, the couple immigrated here 
at different times. He is from Veracruz, she from a tiny Oaxacan town by the 
name of Santiago Asuncion. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro came to the United States in 1990. She was married at the time, and had 
a child the same year. She and her son returned to Oaxaca when her marriage 
fell apart, but came back to Oxnard two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Rubio met in a strawberry patch: both poor, farm workers and illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio toils from dawn to dusk, earning minimum wage doing various types of 
farm labor. Alfaro rarely leaves home anymore, an unfurnished room at an Oxnard 
house for which they pay $350 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life has always been very hard for those without (legal) papers," Alfaro 
said. "We don't have much. We can't buy clothes, we barely have enough to put 
food on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 But until the passage of Proposition 187, Alfaro and Rubio had no plans of 
leaving Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 They may not have had much, but at least they had each other. And Silvia's two 
children -- Adrian, 3, and Eduardo, 3 months -- both are U.S. citizens, and 
both stood a decent shot at fulfilling the American dream that eluded their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, staying put is a luxury the couple no longer can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "My oldest son will soon be 4 years old, and I'm scared to put him in school," 
Alfaro said. "They say they will use the children to find parents who are here 
illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oaxaca, Alfaro said, there is poverty. But there is also family, her 
parents and grandparents, brothers and sisters. She will return there and wait 
for Rubio to send money. 
</P>
<P>
 They will meet again and be married in Mexico, hopefully in six months or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never going to leave her. Never," Rubio vowed. "I consider her my wife. 
She's the mother of my child. We'll meet again soon." 
</P>
<P>
 For Alfaro, the choices at this point are simple. She could continue to live 
in fear, worried that every contact with a doctor or a police officer would 
result in her deportation, and perhaps her separation from her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Or she can return home voluntarily, her family intact and her mind at rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts me that it has to be this way," Alfaro said. "But if everything here 
was really so good, we wouldn't have to go anywhere."

AGAIN FLORIDA-BOUND, STORM IS FADING; WEATHER: AFTER A DESTRUCTIVE ZIGZAG TRAIL 
IN THE CARIBBEAN AND ATLANTIC, FORECASTERS SAY IT COULD SOON BE DOWNGRADED TO A 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION.

 Tropical Storm Gordon rolled back toward Florida on Saturday, a shadow of its 
former hurricane self, and will probably die out before it hits the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's continuing to weaken," said Max Mayfield, a meteorologist for the 
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables. "It could be downgraded soon to a 
tropical depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, born Nov. 8 off the tip of Nicaragua, zigzagged as a tropical storm 
through the Caribbean, killing more than 500 people in Haiti, before snaking 
across Florida, where it battered homes and crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon next slid into the Atlantic, where it strengthened into a hurricane and 
brushed the coastal Outer Banks of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Four beach houses were toppled by high surf on the Outer Banks, but three had 
already been condemned because of damage from previous storms. Part of the 
highway that links the chain of islands was undercut by erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach-goers were out with sail boards Saturday as the storm trailed away to 
the south. "The wind's howling. It's great out there," said Edward Yerkovich of 
Buffalo, N.Y., as he hauled his board out of Roanoke Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 p.m. EST, Gordon was about 335 miles east of Daytona Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was moving south at 8 m.p.h. and a gradual turn toward Florida was expected 
in the next 24 hours. Forecasters said it should be a depression by today. 
</P>
<P>
 Its sustained wind speed had dropped from 70 m.p.h. early Friday to near 40 
m.p.h. Once its wind drops below 39 m.p.h., it will be reclassified as a 
tropical depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong northwesterly wind weakened its drenching thunderstorms, and its 
barometric pressure had increased, easing the threat of more rain, 
meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon may have cost Florida's agriculture industry $336 million, the state 
Department of Agriculture said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The state grows about half of the nation's winter vegetables, including 
squash, sweet corn, tomatoes and potatoes. As a result of Gordon, some producer 
and retail vegetable prices could rise as much as 20% on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon also damaged homes in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Lawton Chiles on Saturday asked President Clinton to designate the 
counties hardest hit by Gordon as disaster areas. If granted, federal grants or 
low-interest loans would be available to help people recoup their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage estimates are still coming in, so Chiles did not specify which counties 
he wanted declared disaster areas.

PARENTS BURY SIX CHILDREN KILLED IN EERIE FREEWAY FIRE; EULOGY: 'THEIR CHILDREN

 A Baptist pastor and his wife buried their six youngest children Saturday in 
white coffins, 11 days after the five boys and a girl were killed in a fiery 
freeway wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of mourners joined the Rev. Duane (Scott) Willis and his wife, Janet, 
to bid the children farewell at the family's small brick church with a wooden 
steeple on the city's South Side. The Willises were still badly scarred with 
burns on their faces and hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Five coffins -- the two youngest children were buried together -- lay in the 
sanctuary. Blue and white carnations lay on top of the four largest; pink and 
blue topped the smallest. 
</P>
<P>
 A pianist played "Amazing Grace" and "Jesus Loves the Little Children." 
Mourners received a program decorated with a drawing by one of the children, 
3-year-old Elizabeth Willis: a stick-figure picture of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 The prayers and the eulogy at the Parkwood Baptist Church focused not on the 
tragedy, but on the family's faith. Not on what the children lost, but what 
they didn't have to endure. And the memories of children who were schooled by 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This family with their high, godly standards would be in more pain right now 
if these children . . . had gone off into a life of sin and debauchery," said 
the Rev. Don Voegtlin, who delivered the eulogy. "They would be in more pain 
now with them alive than they are with them passed on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their children died good kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was driving on a Milwaukee freeway when their minivan hit a piece 
of metal that had fallen off a truck and exploded in flames. Killed were 
Elizabeth and Peter, 6 weeks; Hank, 7; Sam, 9, and Joe, 11. Ben, 13, died a day 
later. The Willises have three older children. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee County sheriff's deputies are still investigating the accident. The 
29-year-old Chicago man who drove the truck has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Voegtlin recalled meeting the Willises in the Milwaukee hospital the day after 
the Nov. 8 accident. The couple greeted him by reciting a verse from Job, the 
Old Testament story of a man who loses everything -- including his children -- 
but never his faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad thing about all this is so many people do not want to believe their 
faith is real," Voegtlin said. "They want to believe it is some sort of 
trumped-up thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters were kept out of the church, which was filled to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 To the strains of "Amazing Grace" played inside the church, pallbearers, 
including the two oldest Willis boys, carried each white casket to separate 
charcoal-gray hearses. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Willis hugged a boy who listened to the service from outside; Janet 
Willis wept as she made her way to a waiting car. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cloudy skies, the children were buried at Chapel Hill Gardens cemetery 
in suburban Worth. At the end of the burial service, Duane Willis asked 
photographers not to use the photographs they took of the family in front of 
the coffins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's private time for us," he said.

SANTA ANA MAN ARRESTED IN INFANT DAUGHTER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested a Santa Ana man on suspicion of killing his 8-month-old 
daughter in the rented room where his family lived, after the infant was found 
not breathing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Perez, 34, was arrested after giving police inconsistent accounts of 
what happened to the baby, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Ed Andrade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade said officers went to the Santa Ana home Friday afternoon after 
receiving a 911 call from someone at the residence saying that a baby had 
stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's child abuse investigators were called when the baby, Kenya 
Perez, died upon arrival at a hospital, Andrade said. Investigators arrested 
Jorge Perez at the home shortly afterward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives and roommates of the Perez family said Saturday that Kenya 
accidentally suffocated while her father slept and that Jorge Perez could not 
have killed his infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good person," said his nephew Antonio Perez, 22. "It's an accident. He 
worked every night. . . . He sleeps so hard. He couldn't hear the baby cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ortuno, 17, said Perez, his wife, Clarissa, and daughters Marybelle, 8, 
and Kenya had been renting a room in his mother's house for about 2 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, Ortuno said he heard Jorge Perez calling out "Baby doll, 
my baby doll." When he came out of the room, he told Ortuno he had awakened to 
find Kenya face-down in a bucket kept near the bed for trash, Ortuno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortuno said when he went into the room, Kenya was lying on the bed and her 
lips were blue. He picked her up and carried her into the kitchen and called 
911, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade said coroners were performing an autopsy Saturday to determine the 
cause of death. Perez was booked on suspicion of murder and was being held in 
the Santa Ana city jail.

SCHOOLS DEFEND DECISION AGAINST OFFERING BREAKFAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although school breakfast programs could help many children, there are many 
reasons why schools do not offer a morning meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Logistic barriers can be a nightmare, said Wanda Grant, food services director 
for El Monte City School District. Her district, which serves breakfast at its 
18 schools, had to shuffle bus schedules, buy trucks to haul more food supplies 
and deal with water heaters that could not handle bigger dishwashing loads. 
Food service directors, principals and custodians usually do not jump at the 
chance to do more work for the same pay. 
</P>
<P>
 However, schools that want to offer breakfast find a way. When the Riverside 
Unified School District could not juggle bus schedules, it offered breakfast 
pizza and pancakes on the school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, philosophical objections are the bigger obstacle. Many people believe 
parents, not taxpayers, should provide something as basic as breakfast for 
their children. If schools take on more duties -- offering sex and drug 
education, for example -- won't that encourage parents to abdicate more 
responsibilities? 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that attracted widespread attention, the Meriden, Conn., school 
board, arguing that children should eat at home with their families, repeatedly 
voted down school breakfast programs from 1990 to 1993 -- flouting a 1992 
school breakfast state mandate until they were sued by the state attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey this year by the California Department of Education, which allocated 
only a third of the $3 million in breakfast start-up grants last year because 
of a dearth of applicants, found that many principals and superintendents 
voiced philosophical objections to breakfast programs. "The parents have some 
responsibility for these kids. It's not the schools' job to be all things to 
all people," one principal wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1980s, Shyrl L. Dougherty, the nutrition services director for 
Montebello Unified, has prodded four of 26 schools balking at serving 
breakfast. In one school, 98% of the children would qualify for free or 
reduced-cost morning meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much are we supposed to do for families?" one principal protested to 
Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about a tenth of students in Orange County's second-largest district, 
Garden Grove Unified, get free or reduced-price breakfasts, although half 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's next? Are we going to provide housing for these people too?" one 
principal asked the district's food services director, Karen Papilli. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Covina Unified School District, many administrators and teachers 
believe the decision to not offer breakfast is rooted in conservative 
attitudes. The school board begins its meetings with Christian prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a conservative school board. They are very concerned about the role 
of the school," said Mary J. Herbener, the district's child welfare and 
attendance supervisor. Merced Elementary Principal Janet Swanson said: 
"Breakfast is a hot potato. It's a political issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Edgewood Middle School Assistant Principal Amelia Esposito said she has pushed 
for breakfast for three years. "This board is stuck in the '60s. Lunch is OK, 
but breakfast is controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Reymann, who calls himself the board's lone liberal, sizes up his 
colleagues' reaction to a breakfast program: "They will say: 'Ultimately God 
put parents on this earth to take care of their children. By God, that is what 
they should be doing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The board's conservative president, Mike Spence, said: "The government is 
trying to usurp the responsibilities of the parent. There is a trend to take 
over aspects of what the family does." 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools need to educate," said Susan Langley, the West Covina School District 
Council-PTA president. She says parents should turn elsewhere for food 
assistance. "We are really big on self-help." 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers are skeptical as well. One told Esposito: "If they (parents) 
weren't on drugs, their kids wouldn't be hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 Since bringing in breakfast last year at Santa Ana's Pio Pico Elementary 
School, the droves of hungry children who arrived at Principal Judy Magsaysay's 
office sick with hunger in the morning have disappeared. Teachers are astounded 
at the difference in the classroom: 10 to 11:30 a.m., once dead time, has 
become a fertile learning period. 
</P>
<P>
 Magsaysay said she knows the difference the meals make when she watches 
students return from monthlong vacations visibly thinner. Twenty-five children 
line up against the cafeteria's outer wall by 6:45 a.m. for breakfast. 
Sometimes, the cafeteria lady runs late. When she finally swings open the door, 
the children clap and cheer.

POST SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Karl Schoenberger ("In Search of Mr. Kato," Oct. 9), regarding the 
enigmatic landscape architect credited with designing the Japanese garden in 
Sierra Madre in 1916:  
</P>
<P>
 An intriguing clue about Kato's existence surfaced in early October, just 
after the article had gone to press. Kuniko Brown, wife and research assistant 
to USC art history scholar Kendall Brown, was browsing through the collection 
at the Japanese Community Pioneer Center Library in Little Tokyo when she 
picked up an old book in Japanese titled "Zoengaku Hanron" ("Introduction to 
Landscape Architecture"). To her surprise, she came across a reference to a 
certain Tokutaro Kato, named as one of two prominent Japanese landscapers 
active in the "southern Pacific coast" of the United States in the 1920s.  
</P>
<P>
 The book, written by essayist Keiji Uehara and published in Japan in 1924, 
also mentions several private Japanese gardens built in "Shiera Madure" (Sierra 
Madre) and elsewhere in the Pasadena area but does not link any of these 
specifically to Kato. The Browns followed up on this lead by consulting old 
city directories in English and Japanese to see if they could find any further 
trace of the gardener. Nothing has surfaced so far, and the identity of Sierra 
Madre's Kato, even if his first name was Tokutaro, remains a mystery.

WHOSE RIVER IS IT, ANYWAY?; MORE CONCRETE VERSUS MORE NATURE: THE BATTLE OVER 
FLOOD CONTROL ON THE LOS ANGELES RIVER IS REALLY A FIGHT FOR ITS SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH COBURN, Berkeley writer Judith Coburn grew up on the Mississippi, 
lived on a houseboat on Virginia's Anacostia and passed time on the Mekong, but 
she never knew there was a Los Angeles River when she lived in L.A. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The five questions about the Los Angeles River most people ask: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Is it a real river? 
</P>
<P>
 2. Is there any water in it? 
</P>
<P>
 3. Who owns it? 
</P>
<P>
 4. Can I drive in it? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Ever find a dead body in it? 
</P>
<P>
 Three of them are as easy to answer as paddling in a pond. Yes, the river has 
water in it (sometimes). No, you're not supposed to drive in it. And yes, the 
occasional dead body shows up. But the questions of whether the Los Angeles 
River is a real river and who owns it launch you onto a mounting flood tide of 
riverine politics, especially these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a natural river of mercurial, Mediterranean temper, it flooded in winter, 
dried up in summer and changed its course entirely every century or so. A 
natural force that fickle threatened people, and so the river, beginning in the 
'30s, was strait-jacketed into a concrete channel by the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers. On some maps, it was reduced to a dotted line -- a 58-mile-long, 
man-made watershed of dams, reservoirs, debris basins and storm drains, 
landlocked by chain-link fences, padlocked gates and signs warning off 
trespassers. To city folk, it was that spookily empty sunken freeway snaking 
through the San Fernando Valley along the back of Griffith Park, trimming the 
east edge of Downtown, then arrowing for the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature still had a claim on the river, of course, as anyone who has watched 
its waters plumbed by red-winged blackbirds or its winter flood tide hurtle 
hellbent for the sea already knows. 
</P>
<P>
 But now a countywide battle with national implications about how to run the 
river, a battle percolating below ground for years, has burst to the surface. 
By next summer, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Los Angeles County 
Department of Public Works are determined to begin construction of a massive 
flood-control project on the river, the first in decades, which the corps says 
could cost at least $500 million by its end. Environmentalists bent on blocking 
it insist that the county should resist the call for more concrete because such 
attempts to conquer nature really don't work. They envision restoring the river 
with more natural flood-control methods, river-bank parks, a greenbelt and a 
bike path from the mountains to the sea. Questions raised in the wake of last 
year's disastrous Mississippi flood -- about the cost and effectiveness of huge 
dam and levee systems and a growing, nationwide movement to restore "trashed" 
urban rivers -- may tip the balance in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Los Angeles River is back on the map, what will it become? Can 
people live with nature without trying to conquer it? Can a city unlock its 
gates to the wilderness? Is the L.A. River finally just a flood-control 
project, or is it a real river? Who owns it and who will finally run it? Points 
of Embarkation 
</P>
<P>
 Resolving to run the Los Angeles River beginning at its source is a quick way 
to run aground. Its ancient origin is in the rainfall on four mountain ranges 
that frame the city's sprawl. In winter, snow and rain lash the mountaintops, 
roaring down their slopes into a lacework of arroyos and canyons, washes and 
rivulets that unite to become the river. But the Corps of Engineers has planted 
its flag in Canoga Park, insisting that the river springs from a concrete 
"merge" where two creeks converge there. 
</P>
<P>
 How can I get a grip on a river with no clear beginning? If there are many 
rivers -- at least in people's minds -- I'll need many guides. Randi Spivak, 
who works for the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, a public 
agency that protects parks and open spaces, suggests one way out of this 
reality swamp: She'll lead a daylong trip to both the river's sources. 
</P>
<P>
 We begin high above Santa Anita Dam in the San Gabriels, hiking the canyons 
where the Forest Service fights floods and fires and avalanches of mud. "It's a 
natural cycle," observes Terry Ellis, a Forest Service district ranger. These 
mountains and the river's headwaters have left him more humble than flatland 
hydrologists. "Man can't do a better job than Mother Nature. She's in command 
of these natural resources." 
</P>
<P>
 What effect humans can have stretches out before us as we ply our way north 
toward Canoga Park. Spivak, a transplanted New Yorker, marvels at the sheer 
audacity and scope of the basin's never-ending development. A detour takes us 
back into the mountains, to the Park at Porter Ranch, a gated city of 1,200 
ersatz Spanish haciendas and four-lane asphalt roads that engulf a whole canyon 
in the Santa Susanas. It's the paving-over of more and more watershed like this 
that has hydrologists worried about increased flooding on the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freeways and developments like this also create biological islands of 
habitat," Spivak says as we press on. "We're trying to buy land that would 
connect them back up." The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and other 
environmentalists envision the river as a major artery of a system of parks, 
trails and open land nourishing wildlife, animals and people, much as the river 
once connected remote outposts of settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day wanes, Spivak maneuvers through rush-hour traffic to a mean, gritty 
little Canoga Park bridge distinguished mostly by its proximity to a Hughes 
Aircraft employees credit union. She parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got it?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The beginning of the river," she says, amused at my shock. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just two concrete walls curving together in a point, one side stamped 
"Bell Creek." Calabasas Creek, the other half, is unnamed. The concrete 
riverbed is paved with Fritos bags. No sign marks this inauspicious rendition 
of the headwaters of the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 The poet Gary Snyder writes that he can heat the L.A. River laughing under all 
that concrete on its way to the ocean. But I couldn't hear anything above the 
roar of the traffic. A Way In 
</P>
<P>
 Canoeist Danis Schure has a postcard of himself on the Los Angeles River that 
makes people guess he's running wild water in the Sierra. Given that he leads 
white-water trips on some of California's most heart-stopping wilderness 
rivers, you'd think he'd prefer the kind of nature that starts somewhere 
several hours' worth of traffic jams from the city. But Schure, a board member 
of a group called Friends of the Los Angeles River, is no purist. He believes 
city dwellers need nature at home as well as on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 We push out in Schure's battered red canoe onto the river in Sepulveda Basin, 
in one of only three places where the river bottom hasn't been completely paved 
over. Schure is as ebullient as if we had just embarked on the south fork of 
the American River. "On a clear day, you can see the Santa Susanas, the San 
Gabriels and the Santa Monica Mountains -- that's the watershed, and 10 million 
people live in it," he says in his best tour guidese. (Schure has taken scores 
of political luminaries canoeing on these waters, courting support for FOLAR's 
drive to restore the river.) 
</P>
<P>
 A breeze cools the sizzling city air, rippling across the water through a 
canopy of overhanging willows. A mallard family sizes us up and glides into our 
eddy. Tiny white butterflies drift by like cherry blossom snow in spring.  
</P>
<P>
 Just upstream, busy Balboa Boulevard roars overhead. From the bushes, someone 
lost in a wilderness of the mind raves biblically. The "riparian" (riverbank) 
habitat here includes Coke cans, plastic bags and a shredded beach chair. It is 
not a clear day, and I notice that we are paddling in circles. That's because 
we're confined to one of three tiny man-made ponds, blocked off by piles of 
rocks, that push the river around in ersatz contrived whirlpools, as in a high 
school physics ripple tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps built these ponds in the '40s, Schure points out, then nature took 
over. He wishes more of the river looked like this. But Schure admits that 
greening the river has to enhance, not undermine, flood control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the river's man-made, I look on it as a clean slate," Schure says, as 
we lift the canoe out of this odd oasis. Spoken like a true Army Engineer 
corpsman? Schure chuckles. "But the corps thinks only about getting rid of the 
water as fast as possible. Their attitude is, 'It's going to the ocean, end of 
discussion."' No Way Out 
</P>
<P>
 Running the river south from Downtown to Long Beach in my white rent-a-Honda 
was Diego Cadena's idea. Cadena, a 12-year veteran of Los Angeles County's 
Department of Public Works and its L.A. River project manager for the past 
three years, didn't want to use his car because he'd just had it washed. It 
being summer, the riverbed should've been bone dry. But Cadena points out that 
the city releases water year round from its treatment plants into the concrete 
ditch that is "the river we built," as Army Corps engineers call it. Sure 
enough, there are puddles to be splashed through after we speed off a levee and 
shoot down onto the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving around in the riverbed is strictly forbidden, no matter what you've 
seen in the movies. Cadena says, grinning and reciting a list of chase scenes 
from films like "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" that have been shot on this 
riverine speedway. City bus drivers get to practice in the riverbed, which 
conjures up mahouts maneuvering their elephants in the Ganges. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six people, most of them kids, drown in floods every winter, Cadena 
announces. When Cadena first talked to me, by phone from Public Works' Alhambra 
headquarters, he urged me to watch the county's video "No Way Out," made to 
warn school kids about how dangerous the river is. The footage is shocking. 
Here is the "flood control channel" at winter's full flood-tide fury, sweeping 
its young victims along in a 30- to 45-mile-an-hour death grip. Frantic rescue 
workers los their footing on the slippery canted concrete banks and are swept 
away themselves. (There are no wild river oases here: no rocks, no shoals, no 
sandbars, no lulls between rapids.) Firemen dangle from choppers or bridges in 
harnesses, grabbing at drowning people as they shoot by. A rescuer snags one 
victim, who's torn from his grasp by a churning riptide of an armchair, 
shopping carts, tree limbs and ripped-up bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the river was a gift. Kumi vit natives who settled along its banks 1,500 
years ago called the land pwinukipar -- "it is full of water." The Spanish and 
Mexicans who followed echoed them, calling their ranchos la cienega ("swamp") 
and las salinas ("salt pools"). Because of the river, a great city could rise 
from the desert: Until 1913, the Los Angeles River was L.A.'s sole source of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city was growing too fast. In the early years of this century, its 
population doubled every four years. At first, city engineer and water god 
William Mulholland favored conservation: replenishing the city's water supply 
by slowing the winter rains' rush to the sea through reforestation and small 
check dams and by leaving open spaces where water could filter underground. 
But, given the boom-town thirst of real estate speculators, dam-happy engineers 
and big farmers, that ecological approach couldn't hold water. Droughts 
compounded the pressure. So did the river's vagrant nature. Once emptying into 
the sea at Ballona Creek in Playa del Rey, the river radically changed its 
course to flow through Long Beach after a huge storm cut a new channel in 1863. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Public Works Deputy Director Carl Blum: "A city needs a river that's 
predictable and reliable." Beginning in the 1930s, after a series of 
catastrophic floods, the Corps of Engineers vowed to tame the river's cycle of 
winter floods and summer droughts. The remaking of the L.A. River was a 
confluence of the Depression's national romance with flood-control projects, 
the era's faith in Big Government, a desperate need for jobs and New DEal 
pork-barrel politics. Seventeen thousand men were given jobs paving the river. 
By 1960, the city had built itself a concrete watershed. 
</P>
<P>
 As we speed south on the levees, Cadena at the wheel, the Century Freeway 
dominates the horizon, raising the flag of the Age of Engineering, like some 
Iwo Jima Memorial. The whole contraption lifts off from pilings akin to flying 
buttresses rooted in the man-made riverbed. Concrete sheathes the landscape in 
every direction. Even the sky--blasted, grainy, gray -- looks paved over. For a 
wild moment, Assemblyman Richard Katz's (D-Panorama City) 1989 folly of turning 
the L.A. River into a freeway has an outre grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cadena is more down to earth. Not a visionary or a master builder, he's an 
engineer who still believes in public service. And now he's pointing down at 
the roofs of the bungalows, trailer parks and warehouses snuggled cheek-by-jowl 
against the river. In many places, the levee we're hurtling along towers over 
them. Should a flood breach these banks, miles of real estate would be sleeping 
with the proverbial fishes. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cadena and his corps counterparts could stop the river, they would. The 
best they can do is shove back hard. It's a constant scramble to stay on top of 
the natural cycle of flood, mudslides, fire and earthquake, and they have the 
kind of respect for nature's savagery that soldiers have for a formidable foe. 
On our trip downriver, Cadena points out where Carl Blum once worked, the 
trailer so close to the levee that in flood season he kept his car parked right 
outside the door, key in the ignition, ready at a moment's notice to high-tail 
it for drier ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Humans have their own cycles, and one of them is an ever-permutating notion of 
safety. Less than a decade after the corps finished constructing its L.A. 
River, it began planning to fight an even bigger flood. Increased urban runoff 
from development plus more sophisticated calculations by corps-county 
hydrologists led to that conclusion. While most city dwellers assume that the 
billions spent for flood control guarantee protection, the question of how big 
a flood is actually on the horizon is largely theoretical. The corps and Public 
Works now believe a significant flood on the L.A. River could inundate as much 
as 82 square miles and do $2.3 billion in damage, Cadena tells me as we barrel 
on. "That's 11 towns flooded between South Gate and Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 To meet this apocalypse, corps and county flood controllers propose to 
reinforce the levees and heighten them with four- to eight-feet walls on an 
11-mile stretch of the lower Los Angeles River and on nine miles of the Rio 
Hondo, a main tributary south of Downtown. Adding the walls will also mean 
raising or modifying 11 bridges along that same stretch. Estimates of the final 
cost of the project are all over the map. As controversy has grown, county 
engineers keep revising figures down, a practice that amuses long-time 
observers, who know how budgets for big corps projects can mushroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Corps and county engineers operate as if the Los Angeles County Drainage Area 
Flood Control Project -- LACDA as it's known to friends and foes -- is a done 
deal. But since 1986, when Friends of the Los Angeles River was founded, 
beating LACDA has come to symbolize what environmental writer Marc Reisner 
calls "undoing the wrongs done by earlier generations doing what they thought 
was right." Last summer, the L.A. River became a national environmental cause 
when American Rivers Inc., a national river conservation organization, adopted 
it as an endangered river and the National Resources Defense Council began 
meeting with FOLAR about initiating a lawsuit to stop LACDA. 
</P>
<P>
 For the corps, at least in L.A., there's a whiff of the Alamo in the air. 
"There's absolutely no environmental impact to LACDA," fumes corps project 
manager Stuart H. Brehm III, when I first ask him about the project. "It's just 
a bunch of walls." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just environmentalists who have LACDA engineers circling their 
wagons. In the wake of the catastrophic 1993 Mississippi flood, questions are 
being raised about the government's ability to protect people from natural 
disasters. An interagency task force, chaired by the Army Corps' own Brig. Gen. 
Gerald E. Galloway, raised serious questions about rebuilding the Mississippi's 
network of dams and levees and called for a new, multi-agency approach to 
manage that river's entire watershed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like analogies," says Army engineer Brehm. "Our work on the L.A. River was 
finished in the 1960s, just like Interstate 10. They're both about 500 miles 
long. Suppose somebody wanted to put a guard rail on the 10 to 20 miles between 
Downtown and Covina. But instead, people come back and say, 'Let's rip out the 
freeway and have a whole new transportation system.' It's like reinventing the 
wheel." Paddling Upstream 
</P>
<P>
 Reinventing the river, if not the wheel, is just what scientists working with 
L.A. environmentalists have in mind. Peter Goodwin, an engineer with Philip 
Williams & Associates Ltd., a San Francisco environmental hydrology consulting 
firm, likes to tell the story of an Indian engineer who explained at an 
international conference how his country couldn't afford the huge dam and levee 
systems of the West. So farmers in the Ganges flood plain plant crops that can 
withstand floods and build huts that can be moved at a moment's notice. An Army 
Corps engineer there was stunned: "Great idea!" 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin grins: Perhaps the wheel doesn't have to be reinvented, only 
rediscovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The L.A. River was the high-tech engineering solution of the '40s," Goodwin 
says. "It was a control model. But we've learned some things since then. We 
like to talk now about managing a river, and that includes its whole watershed, 
not just the single channel most people think of when they say river." Goodwin 
and likeminded hydrologists believe that many of the corps' traditional methods 
may actually make flooding worse. The Army engineers' approach of speeding the 
river to the sea as fast as possible by pouring a narrow, perfectly smooth 
concrete channel creates a ferocious force of water that would do a tidal wave 
of damage if levees were ever topped. It's safer, Goodwin and others insist, to 
slow a flood by diverting water and allowing it to be absorbed naturally into 
the water table. A variety of methods could be tried, from widening the river 
to adding new reservoirs and "spreading grounds" (where water sits until it 
"percolates" underground) to reforestation and the use of porous materials in 
driveways and parking lots to decrease urban runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Running a piece of the river in north Long Beach with Jim Danza, head of 
FOLAR's technical advisory board, is a grand way to scope out the 
possibilities. "It's good you got here today," he says as we boost selves over 
the chain-link fence that is supposed to keep people out of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county'll clear-cut most of this soon, so the water'll run faster." Danza 
grew up whiling away afternoons on the river. "The corps thinks I'm still just 
playing around down here," Danza jokes as he leads me into a riverbank jungle 
of wild sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstream at Del Amo Boulevard, Danza points to where the river was made 
narrower when the concrete channel was poured. Widening the river is one of the 
most hotly contested issues in L.A. County flood-control politics. Deputy 
Director Blum insists that if FOLAR has its way, the river would have to be 
made six times as wide as it is now to handle floodwaters. "Besides the 
expense, the land isn't available," Blum says. "L.A. is overbuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Danza and others scoff at this. "There's much more to it than widening the 
river. There's the question of the steepness of the banks and the rate of the 
water. There are all the ways we'd divert water before it even reaches here," 
argues Danza. But he also believes there may be more land available than Blum 
and Cadena claim, pointing out as we walk how many public-utility easements 
there are along this stretch of riverbank. No one has done a complete study of 
land use along the river, Peter Goodwin says, although a report done to support 
state Sen. Art Torres' idea for a riverside light rail system found more 
easements than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Danza and other environmentalists are cynical about what they see as the 
contingent nature of corps-county safety estimates. They point to the fact that 
the corps originally calculated that the new walls need to be six to eight feet 
high, but when the cost came in at more than $700 million, the corps cut the 
walls down. Goodwin asks a critical question: "If LACDA goes through, is it 
really going to give us flood protection? Or will we, in another 30 years, have 
to go back yet again to the drawing boards and pay for raising the walls 
higher?" 
</P>
<P>
 At least one downstreamer living in the flood path doubts there's any danger 
at all. William Pearl, an attorney and president of the East Long Beach 
Homeowners' Assn., armed with the fruits of countless Freedom of Information 
requests, challenges the corps-county's entire rationale for the LACDA project. 
What set off the alarm about whether the current levees could be topped in the 
next huge flood were the readings on stream-flow gauges and the discovery of 
river debris on a levee near Long Beach after a big flood in February, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 No one actually witnessed this. The next day, the Long Beach Independent Press 
Telegram reported that the L.A. River had risen only to "within nine feet of 
its banks in Long Beach." But Pearl found county records showing that the rain 
gauges weren't working accurately that day. The same day's computer printouts 
of riverflow measurements are missing. Pearl discovered that county 
flood-control experts later--it's unclear when--penciled in estimated levels. 
In a brief challenging LACDA, Pearl argues that the debris on top of the levee, 
if it even existed, could well have been deposited there by unusual currents 
rather than the whole river overtopping the levee. Pearl also wonders why it 
took the corps until 1987 to determine there was a new flood threat when the 
alleged incident happened seven years earlier. He points out that in 1983, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency did a flood-insurance study that found that 
the current flood-control system could withstand a significant flood. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA then backpaddled and decided there is a flood threat. As Pearl notes in 
his brief, the agency wields a heavy club on behalf of LACDA. The corps has led 
FEMA, which administers the National Flood Insurance Program, "to commence a 
process that could rezone the area for purposes of onerous and crippling 'flood 
zone' building restrictions. Many property owners would also face the mandatory 
purchase of FEMA's flood insurance." County public relations handouts quote a 
USC study that found that the FEMA requirements would eventually cause a loss 
of more than $30 billion in economic activity, a loss of more than 177,000 jobs 
and would cost property owners in southeastern L.A. County $122 million in 
annual flood insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the system works, according to the corps' Stuart Brehm: "FEMA uses 
our hydrology and our flood maps. Our report triggered FEMA coming out (to 
redraw their flood maps)." Not surprisingly, most downriver politicians support 
LACDA, but Long Beach is a weak link. A mounting battle to block FEMA from 
putting new flood maps into effect in Long Beach, led by Pearl, homeowners' 
associations and at least two city councilmen, is brewing. In response, in late 
October, FEMA postponed putting the maps into effect until next summer -- 
conveniently after LACDA's startup. FOLAR still hopes Long Beach will pull out 
of LACDA, which would sink the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But except in Long Beach, this is a closed, rarely scrutinized system. So far, 
the Board of Supervisors, which funds Public Works be setting property-tax 
assessments for flood control, and Congress, which holds the corps' purse 
strings, have simply rubberstamped corps projects. Government engineers have 
the money to do feasibility studies while environmentalists do not. When the 
corps' own environmental impact study on LACDA failed to adequately consider 
alternatives, as required by law, FOLAR lawyers threatened to sue. But the 
supervisors didn't let the contract to redo the report out to independent 
hydrologists. It went to Woodward-Clyde Consultants, a big L.A. engineering 
firm that does a lot of work for the corps. (Woodward and Clyde's project 
manager for the study says the firm's contract with the county prohibits him 
from talking to the media.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the corps doesn't always prevail. In Vicksburg, Miss, the corps has a 
multi-million-dollar, full-scale partial model of the Los Angeles River to test 
its engineers' calculations. Peter Goodwin reports that the Vicksburg model 
itself was flooded in the 1993 Mississippi disaster. This Is a River 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis MacAdams, FOLAR co-founder, journalist and two-time world heavyweight 
poet, suggests we commence our river trip at the jaunty cafe Eatz, the group's 
international headquarters, near Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 MacAdams says his romance with the river began on a bus ride he used to take 
in the early '80s from Venice to Downtown, where he worked near the 1st Street 
Bridge. "That's when I first saw the river. What a metaphor of how humans can 
screw up! And not only a metaphor, but the river was so bad, I knew it had to 
turn." Later, he reports, he went down to the river for a private ritual. He 
asked the river if it minded being saved. "The river didn't say no," MacAdams 
says, "so I decided to go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Before FOLAR could convince people the river could be restored, MacAdams 
explained to the first annual Trashed Rivers conference a year ago in San 
Francisco, "we had to create the very idea that the river existed." FOLAR's 
first act was a performance art piece of civil disobedience that began when 
MacAdams and fellow artists cut out a section of chain-link fence to get to the 
water. "It was all about how rivers hate to be in a straight line, and freeing 
this river," says MacAdams, grinning because he knows how this sounds to the 
engineers Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, FOLAR has a mailing list of several thousand names, annual 
river cleanups netting tons of garbage, a seat on the countywide task force on 
the Los Angeles River, the ear of local, state and national pols and a national 
reputation for political savvy. Nothing happens on or near the river without 
FOLAR sticking an oar in, most recently to negotiate with CBS Studio Center 
over its plan to pave over the confluence of Tujunga Wash and the river for a 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to hand it to Lewis," says Diego Cadena. "He put the river on the 
map." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go down to the river," MacAdams says, scooping up his 3-year-old 
daughter, a frequent companion on his rounds, and settling her on one hip. 
Bunches of grass that have split through the concrete wave purple beards at us 
as we shimmy down the bank. This is the longest stretch of the river, nine 
miles, with an unpaved riverbed. Common yellowthroats weave among stands of 
cattails and reeds sprout from two sandbars in the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what many LACDA supporters believe, when MacAdams and friends talk 
about restoring the river, they don't mean unpaving it. "We can't let the river 
run free or bring back the lush cottonwood groves," MacAdams concedes. "But we 
could follow cities like Paris and San Antonio, who've made their urban rivers 
places where people can enjoy themselves." The romantic Seine, FOLAR activists 
remind people, is sheathed in concrete in Paris. But there isn't a single bench 
on the L.A. River, and this is the river's only footbridge, MacAdams points out 
as he leads me across it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The corps sees only a degraded river they want to keep people away from. So 
they don't see what difference higher walls make," says MacAdams. "But it's a 
step back." Peter Goodwin has worked on designs that would set the levees back 
farther, allow banks to naturalize and disguise spreading grounds in parks. 
FOLAR is working with the city, the mountains conservancy and others on plans 
for a bikeway along the river from the mountains to the sea. The conservancy 
wants to connect Griffith Park and Elysian Park with a necklace of pocket parks 
and wildlife viewing spots to brighten the bikeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, people come up with new ideas for the river," MacAdams says. 
</P>
<P>
 We linger over a patch of wild grapes embellishing the chain-link fence as we 
exit the river. Not ripe yet. A man is pulling up something that looks like 
wild yarrow and piling it neatly on a page of newspaper. MacAdams asks him in 
Spanish what it is. They chat. "I don't know what it is in English, but he says 
it's a good tea when you're sick," translates MacAdams, charmed to learn of yet 
another of the river's gifts. Bridge Over Homelessness

<P>
 Cruising over the river via the classic Art Deco 4th Street Bridge, I've got 
one eye on my "Guide to Architecture in L.A. and Southern California" and one 
on the bridge. People are honking, so I park to examine this engineering marvel 
on foot. Built in 1930 by Louis L. Huet and Merrill Butler, the guide tells me, 
it has classic Moderne zigzag pylons, piers and railings, a medley of styles of 
Frank Lloyd Wright, Bertram B. Goodhue and Eliel Saarinen.

 Downriver at City Hall, mayoral aide Tom LaBonge waxes eloquent about the 
Downtown bridges, "one of the city's most unappreciated sights." A real river 
rat who grew up on the river and still bikes there with his wife, Brigid, 
LaBonge got the few signs naming the river attached to bridges Downtown. "We've 
got to get people back on the river, like FOLAR says," enthuses LaBonge as he 
rushes out to meet with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, I see the 4th Street Bridge through other eyes. Alice 
Callaghan, an activist for the homeless and director of Las Familias del Pueblo 
on 7th Street, leads me under the bridge, where we meet Lisa Smith, a young 
woman who says she's been living on the river for two years. "I can't 
complain," she says, breakfasting alfresco on an avocado-and-jalapeno omelet 
she's cooked up over an open fire from food scrounged from local markets' 
discards. "We got bathing suits. There ain't enough water in the river to swim, 
but we get in and play," Smith tells me as Callaghan frowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worry about infections because of toxic and treated sewage runoff," 
Callaghan says on our way up to the bridge, "But poor people, especially 
immigrants, insist on using it like a real river, washing clothes, drinking and 
swimming in it." The Whole River, Part One 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the frogs split when the river was paved over, but this place is still 
called Frogtown. It feels more like a village than an urban neighborhood 
because it's so self-contained: a slice between two bends of the river and the 
Golden State Freeway southeast of Griffith Park and across from Taylor Yard, 
the defunct Southern Pacific railyard. The meeting, at St. Ann's Church on the 
corner of Riverdale and Blake, is packed with the kind of people 
environmentalists rarely attract to meetings: working-class Vietnamese, 
Chinese, Filipino, Latino and Anglo homeowners, many of whom have lived in 
Frogtown for decades. But the neighborhood is also the yearly scene of FOLAR's 
most festive and well-attended river cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles River isn't Yosemite," says FOLAR board member Martin 
Schlageter. It was Schlageter who made the phone calls, wrote, ran off and 
posted the leaflets announcing the meeting. "It runs through the rust belt of 
L.A., and these are the park-poor neighborhoods that really need some nature." 
</P>
<P>
 They also need some say about what happens to the river, FOLAR believes, and 
so the meeting has been organized to get reaction to a FOLAR study, financed by 
the California Department of Water Resources, on how to turn the abandoned 
Taylor Yard into a park and flood-control project. It calls for terraces up 
from the river, playing fields that could divert water at flood time and 
re-creating wetlands. The study supposedly has the support of Public Works, but 
Schlageter got a letter early in the week from Carl Blum asking the group to 
cancel the meeting. "Because of other urgently needed flood control projects," 
Blum wrote, "we do not expect funding to be available . . . at this time." 
Schlageter interpreted this as "LACDA preempts everything," sent Blum a 
thank-you-for-your-input letter and went ahead with the meeting. (There may be 
other reasons Public Works has cut away from the plan. Taylor Yard is the 
biggest parcel of undeveloped land left near Downtown.) 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting begins affably enough, as Schlageter and MacAdams, this time with 
both his kids in tow, chat up neighborhood people they know, munch cookies and 
inspect maps and drawings of the proposals. But when the two activists begin 
the presentation of their ideas for Taylor Yard, accompanied by a backup 
harmony of translation into Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese, the whole 
fragmented, paranoid nature of postmodern politics threatens to drown them out. 
No sooner does MacAdams explain that the drawings are only ideas, not a firm 
plan, than people begin to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want a park here, it'll attract gangs!" 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we afford it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That railroad land is poisoned!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want a bridge over the river! The gangs will come!" (There's no 
bridge in the proposal.) 
</P>
<P>
 MacAdams and Schlageter take the heat calmly. "What's your dream for this 
place?" MacAdams keeps asking. "Jobs? Parks? Flood Control? Improved property 
values? How can we make the plan better?" 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd turns on the two organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What developer do you represent?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of secret deals?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Who paid you off?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to push us out of here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Schlageter speaks up: "I've been meeting with many of you for over two years. 
I'm not from Sacramento! Someone's going to take over the railroad yard. Why 
shouldn't it be the community?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no power!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Bull----!" says MacAdams, amiably but forcefully. "I started FOLAR with 
nothing because I saw not a concrete ditch but a live river that connected 
everyone in this city." He repeats the challenge: "What is your dream for this 
land?" 
</P>
<P>
 An old man in the second row pipes up: "A merry-go-round!" 
</P>
<P>
 This brings down the house. People applaud. There is a flood of ideas, and 
Schlageter is hard put to scribble them down: "Trees!" "A museum!" "Nature 
lessons for the kids!" "Soccer!" "A pool!" 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting ends on a high note, with Schlageter and MacAdams agreeing to go 
back to the drawing board and report back at another meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are philosophical about the meeting's bitterness. "Of course, they're 
worried," MacAdams says quietly. "They remember Dodger Stadium." The Whole 
River, Part Two 
</P>
<P>
 Things are considerably quieter the following week over at the Los Angeles 
River Master Plan advisory committee meeting at Public Works headquarters. The 
committee came out of an effort in 1990 by Mayor Tom Bradley to reverse the 
"neglect and disregard" of the river and now coordinates the activities of 27 
local, state and national agencies that have some piece of the L.A. River, from 
mosquito abatement to water treatment, and works with the public and the cities 
along the river to come up with a master plan for the whole river. Diego Cadena 
and the county are firmly in charge. Cadena greets Schlageter affably enough 
but asks him to remove FOLAR leaflets from the table where everyone is signing 
in. "You're welcome to hand them out yourself, after the meeting," he 
instructs. Schlageter complies and, introduced to Cadena's new assistant, gives 
him the "it's-so-great-we're-all-sitting-down-together" speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps, however, is low-profile at the meeting. "We don't play politics," 
Brehm snaps, "we're engineers." Corps engineers indiscreetly bad-mouth FOLAR; 
in fact, corps officials in L.A. take such a jaundiced view of greening the 
river that they refused three years ago to spend $1 million appropriated by 
Congress to study such improvements. Does their hard-line approach complicate 
river politics? I ask one committee member at the meeting. He laughs nervously, 
goes off the record and opines, "the corps is like a 10-ten elephant. They 
don't have to be good at politics." 
</P>
<P>
 The suave Cadena, on the other hand, has cultivated his grass roots, 
especially the city managers and politicians of the downriver cities in LACDA's 
shadow. He opens the meeting with a description of various committee 
demonstration projects and then introduces Randi Spivak to report on the 
conservancy's community meetings about their greenbelt along the river from 
Griffith Park to Elysian Park. Cadena sums up: "This is a good example of a 
project that can be included in the master plan." (The conservancy, although 
one of the state's most enterprising environmental groups, has so far stayed 
out of the battle against LACDA). Cadena then splits the committee into 
regional groups to come up with riverbank projects in their own back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the meeting drones on, what seems most remarkable is what is not being 
discussed. LACDA is never mentioned. Committee members admit that Public Works' 
modus operandi -- that the project is a done deal -- has never been challenged 
in their meetings. The master plan, expected to be issue next year, won't 
reflect local river politics, let alone volatile national flood-control 
politics. In an L.A. where William Mulholland's Department of Water and Power 
has been taken over by environmentalists who are busy shipping water back to 
the Owens Valley and studying the use of treated sewage water to replenish the 
city's water table, the committee's deliberations are especially gutless. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the real L.A. flood-control politics aren't going on in this room 
but in the trench warfare FOLAR and its friends are waging in every political, 
administrative and regulatory arena from Sacramento to Washington. The next six 
months will be critical. Will the Board of Supervisors finally enter the fray? 
Will the feds ruberstamp the corps' request, as usual? Will the City of Long 
Beach pull out of LACDA? Will the walls really start going up next summer? Will 
the river ever be allowed to come back? 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there is some rumbling among pols about a compromise: The corps gets 
the lower river and LACDA, with the upper river ceded to the environmentalists 
for alternative flood-control experiments, parks and recreation. Cadena doesn't 
like this scenario: "We don't compromise on safety," he says. And FOLAR is 
poised to file suit to block LACDA. Lewis MacAdams is out front: "We want the 
whole river." Nature's River 
</P>
<P>
 For my last run down the Los Angeles River, my guide is Kimball Garrett, from 
the L.A. County Museum of Natural History's Exposition Park office. Garrett is 
also author of a weighty tome for the California Department of Fish and Game on 
the river's wildlife. The report is a historical record as well as a brief for 
respecting what natural beauty the river still has. If the river were restored, 
some wildlife that was forced out could be brought back and a new natural 
balance struck. Garrett suggests we retrace the route MacAdams and I took 
because the river near Frogtown is the richest in wildlife. More than 125 
species of birds have been sighted here, Garrett tells me. 
</P>
<P>
 As Amtrak roars by on the far bank, we shuffle down the canted concrete bank 
close to some starlings bathing by a Bud Lite crate. "Is this a river or a 
garbage dump?" Garrett grumbles. Turning away, he points out kids fishing for 
crayfish downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett asks me if I notice anything odd about the birds here. "Great blue 
heron," I reply, "mallard duck, those poking in the reeds--" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cinnamon teals," Garrett supplies, pedagogically. A bird lover but not a 
birder, I fail the test, but he doesn't seem to mind much. "They're all marsh 
birds, not normally native to rivers or the urban neighborhoods around here." 
Normally, the river would dry up completely in summer, but now the county 
releases treated water year round, creating a pseudo marsh. Nature has 
responded by inhabiting it with wetland instead of riverine birds and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Makes you wonder what's really natural," I muse. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett chuckles. "Well, it's as natural as L.A., anyway."

 A short, shy woman of 25 with dark hair, Aminah will not tell me her last name 
or where she is from. She will only say that she is from West Africa. 
Initially, she cancels several interviews with me, telling her lawyer she's 
sick. The attorney suspects a case of nerves. When we finally do talk by phone, 
the young African woman speaks softly, hesitatingly. When Aminah (her name and 
others in her account have been changed) was a child, her father arranged for 
her to marry Abdul, a man 11 years her senior. Aminah's mother is from an 
Islamic tribe that practices arranged marriages. Families promise their 
daughters to men frequently in exchange for money or property.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Aminah's father died when she was 9, her family felt honor bound to 
uphold his agreement. Aminah knew nothing about it until, at 14, she was told 
she couldn't enter high school because she was to marry. She was shocked -- 
Abdul had stayed at Amihan's home when he was attending school in her village. 
She considered him a brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Becoming his wife felt wrong. I didn't love him," says the young woman. "I 
felt and still feel that a marriage should be based on love." Aminah had seen 
her sisters enter arranged marriages to men who later physically abused them. 
Determined to become a lawyer like her uncle, she persuaded her family to delay 
the marriage so that she could continue school. In 1986, when she was 16, she 
began seeing a young man named Omar. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Aminah still refused to marry Abdul, and her mother and sisters 
began to beat her. "They slapped me with their hands, and when I fought back, 
they hit met with sticks or shoes," she says. "Every time they beat me I would 
miss the next day of school because my body hurt so badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Aminah went on seeing Omar. "We fell in love and decided we wanted to get 
married, but we knew my family would never agree," she says. "While his family 
would have supported our marriage, within my culture, one family cannot accept 
a woman into their home without the permission of her family." 
</P>
<P>
 Aminah's mother took her to the police, who informed Aminah that she must 
marry Abdul or be incarcerated. But Abdul looked less appealing than ever: he 
had married. (Polygamy is common in Aminah's country.) "His wife said he went 
out at night and drank. He would come back changed and beat her. She said he 
was an alcoholic," Aminah says. Horrified, the young woman continued to resist 
the marriage despite pressure from both her family and the police. 
</P>
<P>
 The family grew more outraged when Aminah gave birth to Omar's daughter in 
1989. Aminah gave her to Omar's family to raise after her mother rejected the 
baby. "It hurt very badly, but I knew I had to for her own sake," she says. 
Aminah's mother continued to press the marriage to Abdul, finally turning her 
over to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was put in a large cell with other women. Many were prostitutes," recalls 
Aminah. "During the day, we were taken in a big truck to the main police 
station where we were made to clean the toilets." 
</P>
<P>
 Ill and frightened, she gave in to her mother's wishes. Her family set a 
wedding date and Abdul delivered money for the dowry. Then, in the summer of 
1992, when Aminah's sister was about to take her to buy a wedding dress, Aminah 
slipped out of the house with the money intended for the dress. She reached a 
cousin who helped her get a U.S. visa and bought her a plane ticket to New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the Immigration and Naturalization Service discovered that Aminah's 
visa had expired when she went to pick up a package at the airport. The agency 
began deportation proceedings. With no children, parents or spouse who are U.S. 
citizens, Aminah cannot legally stay in the country. But in a hearing this 
February, Aminah's lawyer, Nancy Kelly, will ask an immigration judge to grant 
her client political asylum. Kelly, who works with Harvard Law School's Women 
Refugees Project, points out that the African woman's family abused her with 
the help of the police and says there is no way Aminah can return to the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go back, my mother would make me marry that man. That life would be very 
hard because he's abusive," says Aminah, her voice shaking. "And because I 
refused him, I know he will take it out on me by hitting me." 
</P>
<P>
 She now lives with her sister in Massachusetts and is looking for a job. She 
would like to join Omar in Europe but can't get legal status there because the 
two never married. If she gets asylum, Aminah can retrieve her daughter from 
Omar's family and avoid her family's demands. "There is no way I can return to 
the country without my family knowing, and there is no place for me to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Aminah's story is incredible, difficult for a westerner to fully comprehend. 
But does it warrant political asylum? That's the new question for refugee 
advocates and immigration officials. Moved by abuses such as the systematic 
rape of women in Bosnia, and by the fact that more and more women like Aminah 
are seeking sanctuary because of gender-related problems, authorities have been 
re-evaluating the experiences women suffer. In 1991, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees advised countries to recognize gender-based 
persecution when it issued guidelines to protect refugee women. The European 
Parliament has called upon member countries to grant asylum to women persecuted 
for violating the moral or ethical rules of their societies. Last year, Canada 
became the first, and thus far the only, country to adopt guidelines that 
specifically address the claims of female refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Canadian guidelines, women who fear persecution for failing to obey 
gender-biased laws and those persecuted for opposing discrimination against 
women are eligible for asylum. But the new definition of political oppression 
doesn't stop there. Women who flee domestic violence after authorities fail to 
help are also eligible, as well as those who refuse to participate in certain 
traditions, such as arranged marriages and veiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Canadian guidelines are groundbreaking because they recognize the role 
gender plays in women's lives around the world, and their experience of 
persecution," says Regan Ralph of the Women's Rights Project, a watchdog group 
started by New York-based Human Rights Watch in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the United States is grappling with the issue. Under existing 
international law, refugees seeking asylum must show a well-founded fear of 
persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or 
membership in a social group. In an unprecedented ruling last December, a U.S. 
appellate court in Philadelphia recognized gender as a social group and 
feminism as a political opinion under immigration rules. Last spring, the INS 
agreed to review how its policies affect women after it received a proposal 
from Harvard's Women Refugees Project, backed by 36 refugee and human-rights 
groups. After extensive consultations with such groups and legal experts, the 
agency plans to issue guidelines covering women's claims next month. "The idea 
is to increase sensitivity to women as applicants," says Gregg Beyer, INS 
director of asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Asylum as it's known now developed after World War II in response to the fact 
that thousands of Jews and others persecuted under the Nazi regime had been 
denied entry by officials enforcing immigration restrictions. Under the United 
Nations 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and a later protcol 
in 1967, countries agreed to protect refugees who could prove persecution. 
Those applying for asylum in the United States must show that they have 
suffered persecution, not merely random violence, and that the persecution was 
by government officials or that those authorities were unwilling to intercede, 
among other criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most asylum applicants are male, persecution has been defined almost 
solely by men's experiences, which tend to involve public activities such as 
organizing and demonstrating against the government. While women participate in 
such activities, they also suffer abuses that men do not, often at the hands of 
people with no official government connection. Their husbands abuse them and 
authorities deny help. They are raped or beaten by soldiers who want to 
terrorize communities or intimidate the women's politically active husbands. 
They are incarcerated or beaten in the streets for refusing to follow official 
mandates they consider sexist, such as veiling. Or, as Aminah's case, they are 
abused in the name of custom -- arranged marriages, genital mutilation, bride 
burnings. However, unlike the traditional public acts of oppression, many of 
these practices are performed not by the state, or an invading army, but by the 
girls' own family -- mothers, aunts, sisters. They have thus been viewed as 
personal or cultural, rather than as political matters warranting asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Sofia Campos-Guardado was visiting her uncle, who worked in a 
cooperative formed under El Salvador's controversial land reform program, when 
two men and a woman attacked his family. The three killed the men and raped the 
women while shouting political slogans. When Sofia applied for asylum, a U.S. 
appellate court in New Orleans denied her request. It ruled that because the 
attack resulted from her uncle's political views and not hers, her rape was not 
political. The rapist's threats were deemed personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kinds of things that happen to women, such as rape, genital mutilation 
and battering, are often not committed by state (officials) and so they're not 
considered human-rights issues," says Pamela Goldberg of the City University of 
New York Law School at Queens College. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds attorney Kelly: "In the past, you'd take a strong women's case and turn 
it into a weak man's case because that fit the way the law was interpreted. 
Now, we're trying to show that what happens to women is different but 
qualifies." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, scores of refugee women in the United States are waiting for 
officials to decide their fates. They are hiding, evading deportation, 
frightened for their lives. Will they tell their stories to the judge? Perhaps. 
When they do speak, the stories that emerge are portraits of pain steeped in 
centuries-old discrimination and tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first gender cases to command attention in the west came as Canada 
was developing its guidelines. Its immigration board had denied asylum to Nada 
(a pseudonym), who fled Saudi Arabia in 1991 after being beaten by religious 
police for refusing to veil. Lawyer Marie-Louise Cote appealed her case on 
humanitarian grounds, launching a massive publicity campaign supported by 
refugee and women's groups worldwide. However, Amnesty International's Canadian 
branch and the U.N. refugee group in Ottawa refused to back her. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. group says intervention didn't appear warranted in Nada's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amnesty has a very specific and focused human-rights mandate," Alex Neve of 
Amnesty in Canada explains, "and that mandate focuses on detention and 
detention-related human-rights concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The response is not surprising. Human-rights organizations have only recently 
begun to focus on women's issues. Domestic abuse, forced prostitution and bride 
burning have "been seen as family problems, private problems, accepted as the 
norm and not challenged," says Ralph of the Women's Rights Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration Minister Bernard Valcourt rejected Nada's petition, stating that 
imposing Canadian values on other countries would be "imperialist" and would 
open immigration floodgates. But last year, responding to public pressure, he 
reversed his decision. Two months later, the Immigration and Refugee Board, an 
independent tribunal, issued the gender guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Consideration of similar guidelines for the United States comes amid debate 
over abuses in the asylum program. With nearly 400,000 cases pending, the 
asylum backlog has skyrocketed, partly because asylum provides a way for people 
with no other claim for residency to stay in the country. Applicants are 
generally given a work authorization and allowed to remain until their cases 
are heard. Appeals can take years. Those denied asylum often stay illegally. 
Some observers say that gender guidelines will only exacerbate such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expanding the definition throws kerosene on an already blazing administrative 
mess," says Dan Stein of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a 
Washington, D.C. based group that advocates a moratorium on most immigration 
and has been consulted about the INS guidelines. "When you have 100 million 
people who tomorrow would love to live in this country, you cannot set up an 
asylum system with such broad-based criteria without opening (the system) to 
massive abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, George High, executive director of the Center for 
Immigration Studies in Washington, D.C., wrote to INS asylum director Beyer 
arguing against U.S. development of gender guidelines. "Recognizing that 
mistreatment of women is a worldwide phenomenon -- something by no means 
limited to the Third World -- one can only question whether the advocates of 
gender-based asylum claims realize the massive claims they are inviting upon 
the United States," he protested. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, asylum is a small piece of the immigration pie -- 145,000 people 
filed such claims last year, while about 900,000 immigrated legally under other 
programs. And in its first year with the guidelines, Canada recognized 3509 
gender claims. Of these, it decided 150 cases, with 105 granted asylum, 
including women fleeing arranged marriages, forced sterilizations and sexual 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Canada's immigration board have also ruled for domestic abuse 
victims in cases where officials failed to protect these women. Advocates 
discount critics' fears that U.S. guidelines in this area would open asylum to 
every abuse victim, noting that women need to clearly demonstrate that 
authorities failed to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 That critical and difficult-to-prove link was evident in the case of an 
Ecuadorean woman whose husband repeatedly attacked her. The police had laughed 
when the woman pleaded for help, saying she must have done something wrong. 
"There is a vast difference between a matrimonial home and a torture chamber," 
the Canadian panel stands in no different situation than a person who has been 
arrested, detained and beaten because of his political opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials say they don't know if their guidelines will include domestic 
violence, although Beyer says they "have to address government inability or 
unwillingness to protect women making certain claims." 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult for many people to view domestic abuse as a basis for asylum, 
Kelly acknowledges. "It happens so much here that people think it's not 
persecution," she says. "But here, at least theoretically, women have 
recourse." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of domestic violence is at the tip of a larger controversy: When do 
cultural mores become political oppression and who decides?  
</P>
<P>
 Nurjehan Mawani, chairwoman of the Canadian tribunal and an immigrant from 
Kenya with long experience in refugee work, rejects the notion that the 
Canadian guidelines reflect a form of cultural imperialism. "This is not simply 
a matter of imposing Western standards on other countries," she stated in 
issuing the guidelines. "It is a matter of respecting internationally accepted 
human-rights standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Female genital mutilation graphically underscores Mawani's point. The World 
Health Organization estimates that more than 80 million women and girls, mainly 
in Africa and Asia, have been genitally mutilated. Though scholars say Islam 
doesn't mandate female genital mutilation, adherents of the practice often view 
it as a moral or religious requirement. It is used to reduce women's sexuality, 
to create an appearance of virginity and as a rite of passage for girls. 
Performed by people with no medical knowledge and with no anesthesia, the 
mutilation can cause hemorrhaging, infertility and death. 
</P>
<P>
 One who survived is Khadra Farah. She applied for political asylum in Canada, 
fearing that she would lose her two children to her ex-husband if forced to 
return to her native Somalia, where men automatically retain custody rights. 
She wants to protect her daughter from the trauma she experienced when she was 
8. 
</P>
<P>
 "One afternoon," she attests in her affidavit, "a group of women, including my 
mother and aunts, gathered at our house so that they could circumcise me and my 
cousin... I was told that it is a common thing and that it would enhance my 
chances of getting married to a good man... Two pairs of women grabbed my legs 
and spread them wide open... Then, another lady started to get a new blade and 
took the cover off it... I felt the pain and started to scream. She cut off my 
clitoris with the blade and I screamed more... She continued slicing away my 
labia minor, at which point I lost consciousness. Subsequently, she scraped raw 
the walls of my vulva and bound them together with thorns. She placed a stick 
between the raw walls of my vulva so that I would have barely sufficient means 
to expel my bodily waste... My legs were left tied together for 10 days... 
though this event took place over 20 years ago, I can still easily visualize 
the scene and feel the pain and trauma all over again when I start to talk 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Canada granted Farah's family asylum. Farah is believed to be the 
first woman to receive asylum in the West with a claim of genital mutilation, 
but she is not likely to be the last. Three years ago, the French Commission 
for Refugee Appeals ruled that the threat of female circumcision could 
constitute persecution. Beyer says it is "certainly possible" that the INS 
considerations will address it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Portland, Ore., Immigration Judge Kendall WArren in March suspended the 
deportation of Lydia Oluloro to Nigeria, where she had suffered the same 
mutilation at age 4, ruling that a threat of mutilation existed for her two 
U.S. citizen daughters. "Although it attempts to respect the traditions and 
cultures of other societies, as to this practice the court concludes that it is 
cruel and serves no known medical purpose," stated the judge, allowing Oluloro 
to stay in the country permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren's decision broke new ground but didn't set a precedent for asylum 
cases, as another Nigerian named Eunice Deshields recently learned when she 
asked Warren to reopen her case so she could seek asylum are different, and 
Warren rejected Deshields' motion, noting that in asylum cases, one must fear 
for one's self, not another. Deshields has appealed, arguing that the threat of 
mutilation to the daughter can constitute persecution for the mother, a 
position the U.N. group recently recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 Is genital mutilation truly persecution? Oluloro's attorney says his client 
initially accepted female genital mutilation as part of her culture, but her 
views changed as the case developed. Are lawyers discovering fears or 
developing them? David V. Beebee, district director of the INS Portland office, 
points out that Deshields made her claim for asylum after her daughter was born 
-- and also after other appeals to stay here failed. He fears her case could 
encourage women living here illegally to have children so as to shield them 
from deportation. "I think it's reasonable to assume to assume that we will see 
a pattern of behavior develop over time as the genital mutilation argument 
becomes more widely known. Any illegal alien female from any country that 
practices genital mutilation (could use it) as a method for staying in the U.S. 
permanently," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein and other critics of the pending guidelines consider these women and 
their stories perfect examples of the pitfalls of redefining political 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we see here is somewhat quixotic and utopian effort to employ our asylum 
process to register political objections to broad-based cultural norms and 
standards with which we disagree," says Stein. "If the basis of a claim rests 
on habit, custom and convention in another society, that is not the basis for 
asylum. There's no way to limit those kinds of claims. We are not going to 
change Nigerian cultural norms and standards by letting every woman who fears 
clitoridectomy not go back to Nigeria. We can't use immigration to change the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who work with refugees seeking asylum consider such fears of widespread 
abuse of the system unfounded. Even with new INS guidelines, women refugees 
will still face an almost Darwinian survival process -- with only the fittest 
getting far enough to even make a claim. Often responsible for children, and 
with few financial resources, women are far less mobile than men; in some 
countries, they aren't allowed to travel on their own. Although women compose 
the majority of the world's refugees, they constitute only 30% of asylum 
applicants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in this country, women seeking asylum face another series of hurdles in 
the application process. Under the new guidelines, women applicants who have 
sensitive claims would have female asylum officers and can be interviewed 
privately. For the first time, all INS officers would receive rape trauma 
awareness training. But these procedures wouldn't apply to the immigration 
courts, which also hear asylum claims in deportation proceedings and are run by 
the Executive Office of Immigration Review, an agency independent of the INS. 
With justices in black robes and attorneys serving as cross-examiners, 
immigration courts can be intimidating. "Women who have been rape victims are 
being asked to appear at a hearing that is frequently adversarial, often before 
male examiners who are not sensitive, and tell stories of terrible trauma," 
says Stephanie Marks of the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, 
which provides pro bono representation for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Women raised to be submissive often find the very process of talking to 
officials daunting. Many fear their families will discover the abuse they 
suffered -- in many cultures rape is still considered the woman's fault and 
ruins her chances for marriage. Those who do talk find their manner of 
communication often misunderstood. The male model for credibility -- direct eye 
contact, a straightforward manner -- doesn't fit rape victims or women taught 
to be deferential. Female refugees from conservative cultures where women 
barely speak to unfamiliar men often find it impossible to reveal the graphic 
details of sexual abuse even the most sensitive male examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 The asylum case of a Salvadoran woman named Maria illustrates just how callous 
the system can be. In 1990, a California counselor recommended that examiners 
for Maria be female, stating: "Examination must be carried out with the utmost 
delicacy and understanding to avoid the emotional breakdown of this witness." 
The judge declined to substitute himself. Sobbing uncontrollably, Maria 
testified for three hours with her hands over her face, recounting before a 
male interpreter, two male attorneys and her husband how she was raped by five 
Salvadoran guerrillas. The immigration judge clipped his fingernails as she 
spoke, but granted her asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, dozens of women are seeking asylum alleging abuse by the Haitian 
army. Some have recently won their cases. Others have been unable to testify 
before male judges and face significant credibility problems as they appeal. A 
27-year-old Haitian named Marie could barely tell her story to her female 
attorney. Marie's husband painted presidential campaign pictures of 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In April, 1992, police abducted him and took turns 
raping Marie, who was pregnant. "They said, 'You have a little Aristide inside 
of you and we should stick our hand in and pull him out,"' she told attorney 
Cecilia M. Olavarria last spring. Marie never saw her husband again. 
</P>
<P>
 During her interview with Olavarria, Marie became so hysterical that the 
lawyer had to call a rape hot line for help. But I've been told that Marie 
wants to talk to me and when she arrives at the attorney's office, she greets 
me with a hug. She wears a black print dress with a white collar. Her year-old 
daughter is decked in layers of pink and white lace. Marie leans her head on 
one shoulder and then another. I mention Haiti. With a sharp jolt, she suddenly 
collapses forward onto the table, as if struck very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Cradling her head in her arm, she moans: "Every time I remember those things, 
it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard took Marie to Guantanamo Bay Naval Station after stopping 
her boat. Haitians there taunted her about the rapes, harassment that continues 
in Miami. "They ask my boyfriend: 'What are you going to do with the military's 
leftover?"' groans Marie. "Sometimes I feel like I want to run. I left the baby 
sleeping one day and walked out of the apartment. I walked and walked, thinking 
and talking to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken home by a neighbor, Marie found her daughter tottering beside an open 
window. "She's losing it and she's not getting any help," sighs paralegal 
Yolene Charles, who's translating. Marie tells me she wants help and part of 
her wants to tell her story. Of the son and stepson left in Haiti. Of the cave 
she hid in. Of the four men in blue uniforms who tied her up and raped her one 
by one, saying: "This is Aristide and this is Aristide" as her 12-year-old 
stepson watched. Marie says she will kill herself if she has to face them 
again.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I dream I'm in Haiti and I wake up screaming. I always see myself 
in the middle of the military," she says, slumping in her seat. "I have lost my 
interieur. I am praying to God to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
 For women's stories to be fully heard, changes will have to extend far beyond 
legal interpretations of asylum law to a greater awareness of women's 
experiences in the world. Documentation supporting applicants' testimony is 
critical in asylum cases, but women's problems have often been invisible to 
human-rights monitors. As a result, reports on women's status in many countries 
are scarce, making it difficult for female applicants to substantiate their 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariam, a black woman in her early 20s, is a member of the Sudanese Women's 
Union, an organization promoting women's rights. Omar Bashir's extremist 
Islamic regime outlawed the SWU after he came to power in 1989, severely 
limiting women's activities. Defying the laws, Mariam (not her real name) and 
other women met in underground SWU cells to organize. They also refused to 
veil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no other choice. I am deeply committed to women's rights and to improve 
their situation," explains the young woman in Arabic to her attorney, Khadija 
Amsrouy, who translates on a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
 Security forces arrested Mariam in 1990 at an SWU demonstration. It was the 
first of five incarcerations. Imprisoned for periods ranging from several days 
to more than a month, the law student was deprived of food, water and sleep. 
"You had to stand up all the time and they would come and watch you. If you 
were tired and wanted to sit or were starting to fall asleep, they would burn 
you with metal iron bars. They'd say: 'This is what you get when you want to be 
a feminist."' 
</P>
<P>
 Mariam fled Sudan and is living with a relative outside of New York. Being 
granted asylum is the only way she can stay here legally. So far the only 
people she's talked to here about her experience are Amsrouy, who works for the 
New York law firm Debevoise and Plimpton, and a psychiatrist Amsrouy took her 
to after she lost 20 pounds and appeared on the verge of a breakdown. Mariam 
says she feels better. But the past still haunts her. "I cannot sleep and even 
when I sleep I have very bad nightmares. It's always a repetition of what 
happened to me in Sudan. I relive that experience again and again," she says. 
"I cry a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Mariam now waits for her INS interview. Her case appears strong because her 
persecution is directly related to activities in a political organization, 
although feminism has only recently been recognized as a political stance. Her 
attorney is worried, however, that since watchdog groups have produced little 
evidence verifying the existence of the SWU, it will be difficult to back up 
Mariam's story. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SWU is a very important organization in Sudan but there was almost 
nothing on it," complains Amsrouy. "If she were a man we would have much more 
documentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Canadian refugee lawyer Marie-Louise Cote: "A country that's repressive 
toward women probably won't have any data on the status of women. So it becomes 
a Catch-22." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, human-rights groups have focused on documenting more traditional 
forms of political persecution. Now the question is: Are women's rights human 
rights? Women are not, generally, the soldiers, the guerrillas, the 
politicians. Their actions, their struggles have not by and large been the 
concern of world courts, of international aid. Women have operated primarily in 
the private sphere of the home, and family life and social mores have been 
considered off limits to outside scrutiny. The international community has been 
willing to pressure a country over its system of racial segregation, but thus 
far there have been no embargoes based on the systematic oppression of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian and now U.S. initiatives to reinterpret asylum law reflect on 
emerging international consciousness that the personal can indeed be the 
political. The initiatives also send a significant message, making it clear, as 
Nurjehan Mawani puts it, that "human rights are human rights and universal and 
indivisible, that torture is torture and rape is rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it will be years before significant legal precedents are set. "We're 
getting more wins lately," Kelly says, "but this could all be knocked off its 
feet by a bad circuit-court decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In the best of circumstances, Mariam and Aminah and Marie will overcome the 
obstacles to tell their stories and will be heard. But they are just a few, and 
there is still so much silence.

THE LITERARY PRINCE OF DENMARK; WITH 'SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW,' NOVELIST PETER 
HOEG WAS DRAGGED, KICKING AND SCREAMING, INTO THE LIMELIGHT. HIS NEW NOVE, 
'BORDERLINES,' SECURES HIS PLACE AS HIS COUNTRY'S CONSCIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN S. REYNOLDS, Susan S. Reynolds is an assistant editor in The Times' 
Book Review.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a Literary Law in Denmark known as the Jante Principal. Taken from an 
early 20th-Century Danish novel by Aksel Sandemose, it goes: "Thou shalt not 
get too famous and make too much money." To succeed as a writer is unethical. 
Too much praise is like the Emperor's New Clothes, a sleight of hand, an 
illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelist Peter Hoeg ahs failed to obey this and other commandments in a big 
way. In 1993, Farrar, Straus & Giroux -- which obeys a different Literary Law: 
Resist Modern Taste and Popular Culture in Favor of Old-Fashioned Elegance -- 
published "Smilla's Sense of Snow," Hoeg's third book but the first to appear 
in the United States. The initial printing was 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, "Smilla's Sense of Snow" had sold about 120,000 
copies, spent 21 weeks on The Times Bestseller List and 11 weeks on the New 
York Times list, had been translated into 25 languages (including Indonesian, 
Polish and Portuguese) and had been named by Time magazine as the top novel of 
1993. The paperback, which went on sale in August, has already sold nearly a 
million copies -- an astonishing figure for a novel that takes place in two 
countries, Denmark and Greenland, that few Americans would choose to escape to 
for their family holiday, much less their armchair fiction. Forget Literary 
Laws, "Smilla's Sense of Snow" was more like a UFO sighting -- a highbrow 
Danish thriller that sold like "The Bridges of Madison County." 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the chilly, unwelcoming world of the Scandinavian winter, the soul of 
the book is Denmark's 600-year guilt-ridden relationship with Greenland -- 
terra infirma in the conscience of a country that thinks of itself, and is 
regarded by much of the world, as the most gentle, humane and progressive in 
Western Europe. Reluctant colonialist, the Danes have historically mistreated 
and misunderstood the darker-skinned Greenlanders, Inuits whose own culture can 
be brutal. And that is not the only form of cruelty that Hoeg draws on. The 
characters, who muster every bit of social weaponry to hurt one another (money, 
clothes, bureaucratic authority, wit, sarcasm, but most of all, cultural 
heritage) are for the most part cold, isolated and frightened -- none more so 
that the book's fierce heroine, Smilla Qaavigaaq Jasperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Half Danish and half Inuit, Smilla is 37 years old when the novel opens. A 
glacial morphologist by training, she is a woman who is constitutionally and 
genetically unable to hold a job or get sloppy over a relationship, a woman who 
thinks "more highly of snow and ice than love." she dresses impeccably, with 
some inspiration from her Inuit mother (deerskin Kamiks) and funding from her 
rich anesthesiologist father, who loves her. "You're damned heartless, Smilla," 
her father tells her early on in the book. "And that's why you've never been 
able to hold onto a man." "Father," says Smilla, "write me a prescription." As 
Merete Ries, Hoeg's Danish publisher, says: "We all agree about Smilla. She's 
so bitter and angry. But still, there's a hole in her heart where the daylight 
shines through." 
</P>
<P>
 Every one of Hoeg's crystalline sentences is complete, taut and full of clues. 
The words are sharp and blunt. You read the first couple of pages and don't 
have to go back and reread passages, even though Hoeg imparts enormous 
quantities of information -- about the structure of snow, the history of the 
Inuits, the intricacies of the Danish bureaucracy or Valencia ruffles on linen 
dresses. Readers are lured into the freezing, predatory ocean world of this 
novel in the hopes that they will be pulled up, sometime soon, into the warm 
place in Smilla's native heart. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since the Danish publication of "Smilla," Hoeg has become a 
national hero -- the country's most revered novelist since Isak Dinesen. The 
Jante Law notwithstanding, the Danish government has awarded Hoeg a lifetime 
grant that guarantees he and his family will be provided for if his income 
slips below a certain level. The first novelist to receive the grant since 
Dinesen, Hoeg is unlikely ever to need the money. In hardcover rights alone, 
"Smilla" has earned considerably more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Farrar, Straus & Giroux is about to come out with Hoeg's next novel, 
"Borderlines." The story of three children in an institution that is part 
boarding school, part reform school, and part orphanage, in which horrific but 
banal experiments are conducted with the students' sense of time, "Borderlines" 
caused an avalanche of controversy in Denmark. The government, it turns out, 
conducted similar experiments in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot walk past a bookstore in Copenhagen without seeing a poster-size 
photo of Hoeg, one of his four books or a T-shirt bearing his name. Fiercely 
protective of his privacy, he has given so few face-to-face interviews, over 
the years that stories about him circulate, about which neighborhood he grew up 
on and where he went to school. Daily newspapers debate where he gets his 
material, why he's so critical and whether he really knows so much about Kant 
and icebergs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if Hoeg has become his country's conscience. He lives without a fax, 
computer or TV, has stopped taking advances because they threaten the quality 
of his writing, doesn't do book tours, doesn't get involved in translations or 
screenplays because he believes in the artistic integrity of the people who do 
translations and screenplays and doesn't even know how much money his books 
have made. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you meet him, he will change you life," Danish citizens told me again and 
again, as though I was about to receive some golden secret that I had access to 
only as a foreigner, like those emissaries who come for the new Dalai Lama. 
People who know Hoeg describe him in a language that could come from another 
universe or century. "He is like a fairy person," said an old friend. "(He's 
like some kind of wood elf," said another. After a few such comments, I began 
to rebel, holding on irrationally to the parts of my personality I actually 
planned to keep in his presence. I became, in the days before I met Hoeg, a 
virtual caricature of the good listener -- the doubting critic. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in 1987, Hoeg, then 30 years old and a student at the royal Danish 
Ballet, bicycled up to the door of Rosinante, a small but highly respected 
publishing house in Copenhagen. He was carrying the manuscript of his first 
novel, which he hoped would bring in a $3,000 advance so that he and his wife, 
Akinyi, could go to the West Indies for a few months. All he hoped for was 
maybe a couple thousand Danish readers. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked for Merete Ries, the founder of Rosinante, who, rumor held, actually 
read the books. His friend, composer Per Norgaard, accidentally met Hoeg that 
day in the gray, medieval street where the publishing house is located (an 
event that, in Denmark, can make one famous, even if writing four symphonies 
and ballets and the score for "Babette's Feast" doesn't). Several years before, 
Norgaard had written a ballet for Hoeg, but "he hadn't been dancing for a 
while, and he said to me: 'I've written a book, and no publisher wants it. 
Merete Ries will at least read it."' 
</P>
<P>
 Ries did more than that. She published the novel, "Perceptions of the 
Twentieth Century," a magical realist story of four Danish families, and it 
became an immediate bestseller in Denmark, a country in which bestseller means 
Margaret Atwood, Fay Weldon and Ben Okri, not Robert James Waller. "This is a 
young man," says Ries in her office, "who has such a good time writing. He is a 
sure-handed writer, a publisher's dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Ries, round, smooth-skinned and in her mid 50s, has carefully watched over 
Hoeg ever since. In her black wool dress and silver jewelry, she cuts a 
stylish, no-nonsense figure in the staunch, understated world of Danish 
letters. When she is not protecting young Danish writers (their head shots line 
her walls), she is translating Virginia Woolf. "She loves cold water," Hoeg 
says of Ries, a high compliment. "In the winter she belongs to a club in the 
Copenhagen Harbor. They take saunas and dive into the harbor." Ries is the 
gateway one must pass through to reach Hoeg, who doesn't own a telephone or a 
car. It was Ries who originally turned away the faxes (which are considered 
aggressive in Denmark) and emissaries that came pouring in from Hollywood after 
"Smilla' was published in the United States. Hoeg finally entrusted Danish 
director Billie August ("Best Intentions," House of the Spirits") with the 
novel. The movie is now in pre-production. 
</P>
<P>
 Elisabeth Kallick Dyssegaard, Hoeg's Danish-born editor at Farrar, Straus & 
Giroux, is the novelist's American guardian. Dyssegaard, who has been at the 
publishing firm for nine years, is too soft-spoken to use the word, but she has 
made it her mission to introduce Scandinavian literature to the United States. 
She had been closely monitoring the Hoeg phenomenon in Denmark but didn't think 
either of his first two novels would travel well. When she read "Smilla," she 
was convinced that the book was ideally suited for American readers. "It is, 
first and foremost, a beautifully written, literate book, full of powerful 
emotion and psychological suspense," says Dyssegaard. "It is an engaging story 
that makes the reader feel smart." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one at Farrar, Straus & Giroux predicted that "Smilla" would make so 
many readers feel smart. With no fancy author tour -- no brie, no wine, no 
"Good Morning America" -- "Smilla" sold with barely any help from Hoeg, who 
gave a reluctant handful of interviews. When Farrar, Straus flew Hoeg to New 
York for his first (and he says last) time, it was so publisher Roger Straus 
could welcome him into the fold. His visit, though, became an in-house legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There he was, wandering around Union Square," Straus says, shaking his head, 
held to his neck by an apricot-colored ascot. "He's not very big, you know. I 
thought he might need the money. He and his wife were expecting their second 
child. So I inquired, "Would you like a small advance? Say, a few hundred 
thousand or so to tide you over?' 'No thank you,' he said. Just like that. 'No 
thank you, Mr. Straus."' 
</P>
<P>
 The drive from Copenhagen to Hoeg's house in a fishing village near Nykobing 
is far too short. Hidden by scrub pine, lupines and rose hips and surrounded by 
dunes are the three tiny cabins that Hoeg, his wife, and their two young 
daughters share. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm expecting the Peter Hoeg of his book-jacket photograph -- the one the 
girls "die-over," in Ries' words; the moody Renaissance punk juggler, with his 
spiked white-blond hair and large-sleeved, heavy white cotton shirt that has 
become his public uniform (made by his mother); Denmark's literary prince. But 
when he comes out to greet me, he's much more familiar. He's wearing a fuzzy 
gray sweater, khaki pants with an incongruous big patch across the bottom, and 
thick wool socks. Akinyi walks out, smiling, with their 9-month-old baby girl 
on her hip. Like Hoeg, she is a professional dancer, a leading member of an 
African dance troupe based in Copenhagen. Graceful and welcoming, she fills in 
her husband's reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a word, Hoeg leads us to the main cabin, which is small and dark, a 
summer place where most of the time begs to be spent out of doors; now, with 
the glacial Danish winter moving in, the cabin is just starting to feel 
crowded. Hoeg has prepared coffee on a Bunsen burner and arranged the biscotti 
(which look exotic here, as though they had been brought by schooner and traded 
for herring). He gathers some blankets and gestures again that we will be 
talking in the small shed where he does his writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes have passed and he has barely spoken a word. I remember that in 
"Smilla' he writes that if you want to make a European nervous, don't say 
anything, so I am determined not to take his silence personally. His youngest 
daughter squeals as we walk out, demanding that her father kill a spider she 
has found in the flowers. "It's his job," Akinyi explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoeg's work shed is almost entirely filled by a large bed, two chairs, a table 
and the blue muslin-covered lap board on which he has written all of his novels 
by hand. When Hoeg begins to speak, his voice is barely audible over the light 
drizzle against the windows and the roof. Throughout our conversation, he 
digests my questions -- at first, for an excruciatingly long time -- letting 
the seed of his response take shape before he answers. When he can't find them, 
he is frustrated, like someone who stutters. He doesn't laugh often, but when 
he does, it's as if the roof of the shed blows off and the rain comes into the 
coffee cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoeg describes his own life as a series of pirouettes. The middle-class 
lawyer's son who grew up on a fairly poor neighborhood called Christian-shavn, 
where most of Copenhagen's Greenlanders still live. The star student who, after 
university, worked as a housecleaner ("I have a vast knowledge of different 
kinds of soaps") and crewed rich people's boats around the world ("The Italians 
were the most demanding"). The professional dancer who decided that he was not 
talented enough and became a novelist ("Now my wife she's a real dancer"). And 
the 27-year old writer who did not want to be dependent on money. "I just 
decided that I would give it up," he says, as though he were talking about red 
meat. "I would give up all my material longings and I would take the power that 
came from that decision. And it's made me free." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Hoeg about the money "Smilla" has made, which I vividly imagine piling 
up somewhere, unattended. "The only reason I even think about it is because it 
occupies other people's minds. I have no idea how much money has been made, but 
I should look into it," he adds, as though he has behaved irresponsibly. 
"Akinyi and I , we have the kind of life we want without it. It costs very 
little for us to live, almost nothing here, and we have a small rented 
apartment in a very green part of Copenhagen. It's easier in a rich culture 
like Denmark, of course, because people are taken care of. Merete Ries has said 
to me that money is freedom, but I think that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "A book is like a question," Hoeg goes on, deflecting my questions about his 
success. "You receive answers from readers and reviewers in the years after it 
is published. Once I had only 5,000 Danish readers, but now ... " his palms 
float upward. "I can't be anything for these people unless I write, and I can 
only write with a lot of peace -- a very quiet daily life, with very few things 
and a very few close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He describes his uncluttered life in the country: Mornings of meditation and 
time with the family, followed by afternoons of writings. "I cannot stand 
stress. I would disintegrate under too much stress and bad conscience if I 
didn't spend time with Akinyi and the children. I believe that we write with 
our whole bodies, with every cell. If there is bad conscience stored somewhere, 
that part of you won't write." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Hoeg if he got as attached to Smilla, writing in her voice, as his 
readers did. "Smilla was like a state of mind for me," he explains. "I'm not 
sure that for an author there can exist persons in books. Only language exists. 
Where you are sitting now, you are a person to me. If I try to describe you, 
you transform, you become language -- something much less. Books are very 
little, but they are a form, like nature, and a reader builds her won pictures. 
What you can do as a writer is make a very good form, but you can't fill it. 
This is what I like so much. It has to be field, and there's a reader who fills 
it. I make the trick. I make the illusion possible. It's not important what a 
writer knows but what he appears to know."

 "A book is often an answer to a previous book," Hoeg says, when I ask him 
about "Borderlines," which arrives in bookstores this month. Although 
expectations for "Borderlines" run high -- the first printing is for 75,000 
copies -- Hoeg has said publicly and, one suspects, hopefully, that the novel 
may throw him "back into obscurity." Half novel, half essay, "Borderlines" is a 
much more deeply disturbing book than "Smilla." "I wasn't so nice to the 
reader," Hoeg admits. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the only book in which Hoeg has allowed himself to be flagrantly 
autobiographical. The main character in "Borderlines" is named Peter; the book 
is set in the '70s, when Hoeg would have been in school, and there are passages 
in which the author, now grown , looks at his sleeping baby daughter and thinks 
about the responsibilities of raising children.

 "Every person carries biographical scars," he tells me when I ask if he was 
also an outsider -- a borderliner. "When you write you spend some hours each 
day in a landscape completely outside normal reality. It isn't madness, but I 
do identify very easily with any kind of outsider. I can see that it is a 
question of very small differences that separates the one who looks normal from 
the others. I wrote 'Borderliners' because I have had, my whole life, troubles 
with time. Children don't learn that much in all those years of school, but 
they are taught how to mark time. And here in Western civilization they start 
working too hard too early. I mean Denmark has its beauty and its social 
structure, but it also has its price. Everyday, in my body, I can feel the 
tensions of the culture that I live in. And I know that to break under the 
tension is to fail somehow."

 Copenhagen has gotten a few degrees cooler. I am struck by the mild air, the 
mild food, the mild faces. Most of the summer tourists are gone, and the 
citizens stroll along the combed gravel walks, hands folded behind their backs, 
past the Little Mermaid guarding the harbor, past the statues of Hans Christian 
Andersen, past the house he lived in on Nyhavn Boulevard, along the walks he 
took in Deer Park, all marked by brass plaques. this is a country where 
contemplation is facilitated by "walking woods" in every town; where too rapid 
a gesture in public causes heads to turn; where, everyone proudly tells me, 
"Nobody starves."

 Here is the Denmark of icy surfaces and deep currents that Hoeg's novels 
expose and criticize and sometimes shatter. And criticism, we Americans often 
forget, doesn't mean one doesn't love one's country. In fact, when I tell Hoeg 
that in spite of my loopy, saturated infatuation with Denmark, I feel 
frustrated by the politeness that lubricates all social interaction, he asks 
pointedly where my ancestors are from. When I say Sweden, he sighs and leans 
back. "Well," he says, "in Sweden, if you walk on the grass, someone will come 
running out at you waving their arms and shouting. They are angry; you feel 
bad. In Denmark, they will gently take you aside and whisper something about 
the lovely grass. You step off. They feel good; you feel good. It's part of our 
feudal tradition. Have another biscuit."

 But Smilla is less than polite. When the half-Inuit boy, Isaiah, whom she has 
fed, bathed and read to is found dead and the causes don't add up, she begins 
the long hunt, tracking down his bureaucratic killers in a way that is part 
Inuit and part Femme Nikita. In the bargain, she claws apart the entrenched 
hypocrisy of Denmark-Greenland relations. In "Borderlines," the 
boy-turned-angel Humlum watches over his friends as they try to escape from 
their school to bring a helpless, confused child to safety. One must learn new 
skills when the old ones won't suffice.

 Characters in both books make sudden, irrevocable decisions that fly in the 
face of expected behavior. They are all smart, sharp people with something to 
lose. They behave like warriors, armed with flinty moral ideas about how owe 
ought to live and treat each other. Once they make these decisions, they cease 
to flow along with everyone else, under the ice. They crack through. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his characters, Hoeg serves as a lightning rod in Denmark, 
illuminating the fissures and inconsistencies in a way that is downright 
Swedish, if I may say so. His characters develop ethical systems -- sharp tools 
created with the technology of their moral Danish backgrounds -- and then use 
those belief systems to expose the flaws in their own culture. "When you assess 
something," plots the boy Peter in "Borderliners," using good, clear 
Scandinavian logic to get out of a gruesome situation, "you are forced to 
assume that a linear scale of values can be applied to it ... Every person who 
says of something that it is good or bad or a bit better than yesterday is 
declaring that a points system exists ... but never at any time ahs a code of 
practice been laid down for the awarding of points. No offense intended to 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 No offense, indeed. With each book, Hoeg makes a new language, tries out a new 
code. Young Peter in "Borderliners" is able to memorize the shape of a key and 
have a new one made just like it. Six-year-old Isaiah in "Smilla" threatens, 
with what he has seen, the existence of one of Denmark's most powerful 
institutions: the Cryolite Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the really raw nerve: these characters, these victims, are 
children. It is illegal, in Denmark, to hit a child. Children are not supposed 
to suffer. So one could say that much like Denmark's patron saint, Hans 
Christian Andersen, Peter Hoeg, who describes himself as a river man pushing 
logs downstream, clears the conscience of his country for the sake of its 
children.
