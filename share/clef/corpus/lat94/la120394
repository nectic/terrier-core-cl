 STAR ROLE: You think most of your water comes from somewhere else? In Anaheim, 
75% comes from underground wells -- and the threat of their contamination 
through improper dumping is growing. The city's new program to increase 
awareness of this danger: "Anaheim EarthStar." . . . . Says its environmental 
expert John Hills: "We wanted to get the word star in there to let people know 
they can be heroes in protecting our ground water." . . . . The educational 
campaign is aimed at local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 LAST LAUGH: The new Super Kmart Center in La Habra got off to a shaky start, 
with protesters angry that it might hurt local small businesses. But the store 
has gained some bragging rights: It's leading Kmarts nationwide in retail 
sales, says the Troy, Mich., headquarters. . . . Especially delighted is City 
Manager Lee Risner, in the face of numerous business closures in recent years. 
Says Risner: "It says we're a very good business town." 
</P>
<P>
 PREVIEW EVENT? Mater Dei High basketball coach Gary McKnight has attended the 
NCAA Final Four the past 12 years. Maybe this year it's coming to him? . . . 
Today's John Wooden Classic (C1) at The Pond of Anaheim features four of the 
nation's top-ranked college basketball teams: Massachusetts (No. 1) vs. Kansas 
(7), followed by UCLA (5) vs. Kentucky (3). . . . "It's like having the Final 
Four in Orange County," says McKnight, who plans to attend. "We've not had 
teams like this play here ever before."  
</P>
<P>
 EARLY AWE: McKnight is one reason that Mater Dei is not just a football 
school. His basketball team is ranked second in the nation in Sporting News 
magazine's preseason poll. This week's national poll of sportswriters has the 
Monarchs ranked third. . . . They've won 100 of their last 105 games, were 33-1 
last year, and may be even better this year, thanks to sophomore sensation 
Schea Cotton. Sporting News ranks him third-best sophomore in the country.

ROBERTI LIKELY TO BE NAMED TO HIGH-PAYING STATE POST; GOVERNMENT: RETIRING 
SENATOR EXPECTS ONE OF SEVERAL JOBS HANDED OUT BY OUTGOING DEMOCRATIC POWER 
STRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The post-election flurry of Democratic leaders naming friends to high-paying 
state boards and commissions is expected to continue next week with the 
appointment of retiring state Sen. David A. Roberti to a $97,000-a-year 
government job. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, forced out by term limits and defeated in a bid to prolong his 
political career by running for state treasurer, would become at least the 
fourth person with close ties to leaders in the Senate or Assembly to be given 
a high-salaried post since the Nov. 8 election. Roberti's state salary would 
nearly double. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources told The Times on Friday that the Senate Rules Committee, which 
Roberti headed for a record 14 years as senate president pro tem, will meet in 
a closed-door session early next week to approve his appointment to the 
Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. The board rules on appeals, usually 
brought by workers against employers, who say they have been unfairly denied 
unemployment insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate it will happen," Roberti said when contacted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), whose long tenure is expected 
to end with the Republican takeover of the Assembly, put the post-election 
process in motion by handing out appointments to a girlfriend, a former law 
firm associate and the spouse of a retiring Democratic legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 While the current wave of appointments has brought the issue renewed 
attention, the awarding of plum jobs to ousted incumbents and their friends is 
viewed around the Capitol as an old practice of both Democrats and Republicans. 
Less clear, however, is how the patronage tradition will go over with voters 
who proclaimed loudly last month that they are tired of politics as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who succeeded Roberti as president pro 
tem, said he supports Roberti's appointment and considers it justified. "He has 
had a distinguished career of public service," Lockyer said. "We'd like to 
capture his skills and energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Long service in the Legislature "should not be a barrier to continued service 
in appropriate positions," Lockyer said. "This is a working job, a full-time 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 However, political scientist Bruce Cain of UC Berkeley's Institute of 
Governmental Studies said many commissions have always been treated as 
patronage plums and produce little valuable work for the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a retiring politician wants the job, you have to wonder whether there is a 
lot of work involved," Cain said. "The real question is whether we ought to 
have the commissions and whether they should be a full-time, salaried job." 
</P>
<P>
 The more important issue, Cain said, is whether the high-paying governmental 
commissions, originally envisioned as insulating regulators from political 
influence, should be re-examined and possibly abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been under the illusion that these things were anything other than 
political appointments," Cain said. "If they are going to be appointed by the 
governor and the Legislature, then we've got to accept that they are going to 
be appointed on political grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti would replace Debra E. Berg on the appeals board. She is the wife of 
longtime Roberti assistant Clifford Berg, the $120,000-a-year executive officer 
of the Senate Rules Committee, one of the highest-paid employees in state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Berg is expected to leave the Senate payroll soon and become a 
lobbyist. Sources said Lockyer will appoint a longtime member of his staff, 
Greg Schmidt, to replace Berg.  
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker of the Assembly and the Senate's Rules Committee share with the 
governor the authority to make appointments to several powerful and high-paying 
boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 These include the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, the Integrated Waste 
Management Board and the California Medical Assistance Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, 55, who has held a part-time teaching position at USC in recent 
months, is reported to have negotiated with a number of potential private 
employers. He is an attorney, but has spent most of his adult life in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources who asked not to be identified said a key reason that former 
legislators get appointments is that they usually receive a higher salary. The 
$52,000-a-year pay for legislators will rise to $72,000 next week. This 
translates into higher pension benefits when the former legislator permanently 
retires from the public payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring, Roberti narrowly beat back an expensive recall election led by 
pro-gun activists in his San Fernando Valley district. With his political funds 
virtually depleted, he was defeated in the June Democratic primary for state 
treasurer by Phil Angelides, who in turn lost to Republican Matt Fong. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti is not the only former legislator in line for a possible appointment. 
State Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-Modesto), a veteran legislator who lost his 
reelection bid, has made inquiries about appointment to a potential vacancy on 
the Integrated Waste Management Board, sources said. The $95,400-a-year slot is 
held by Wesley Chesbro, an environmentalist and pioneer recycler. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said he understood that McCorquodale was interested in the trash 
board, but added: "He hasn't talked to me directly." McCorquodale was active in 
the passage of California's "bottle bill" and other recycling legislation. 
Lockyer said he also had "heard good things about Chesbro." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said the appointment to the trash board will be dealt with by the 
Rules Committee later in the month.

BOSNIAN SERBS RATCHET UP PRESSURE FOR U.N. PULLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs stepped up the pressure for a U.N. retreat from the Balkan 
conflict Friday by rocketing the presidency building in Sarajevo while the U.N. 
mission chief and the commander for Bosnian-based troops were inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Sega missiles fired from Serbian-held territory crashed into the stately 
red-brick building shortly after U.N. Protection Force chief Yasushi Akashi and 
British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose had entered for talks with Bosnian government 
leaders, mission spokeswoman Claire Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Akashi and Rose were in the building at the time but well away from the point 
of impact," Grimes said of the midday assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident underscored the eroded authority of the U.N. mission in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Serbian rebels have detained about 400 peacekeepers 
as human shields against NATO air strikes as they press attacks on 
U.N.-designated "safe areas." And it came amid conflicting reports that the 
U.N. mission had called off enforcement of the "no-fly" zone over Bosnia as 
part of an effort to find a way to persuade the Serbs to resume negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the missiles hitting the building, it seems they (Serbs) had 
information. We're not saying they were directly targeting Akashi and Rose, but 
the implication is very strong," said one shaken U.N. official at mission 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who requested anonymity, said the U.N. hierarchy is "frustrated 
as hell," and that the apparent provocation against two of the top U.N. 
officials in the Balkans had intensified already widespread talk about 
withdrawing the Bosnia-based peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to taking peacekeepers captive, gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb 
nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic have been blocking the movement of supplies 
to thousands of other encircled U.N. forces, as well as humanitarian aid bound 
for nearly 2 million Bosnian civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi, who was spending the night at Serbian rebel headquarters, was quoted 
by a Reuters journalist in Pale as announcing that he had secured a promise 
from Karadzic to release all hostage peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, mission headquarters had not been informed of the reported agreement 
as of late Friday night, U.N. spokesman Paul Risley said, adding that it would 
be unlikely any of the captive troops would be released before daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bosnian and Croatian Serbs kept up their attacks on the Bihac pocket, 
with small-arms fighting having moved "very, very close" to the city's 
hospital, Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission has been engaged in a hostile standoff with the heavily armed 
Serbs since a series of ineffectual NATO air strikes prompted the rebels to 
grab peacekeepers as "insurance" against further shows of force to deter 
attacks on Bihac and other havens. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent attempt to wheedle the defiant Serbs off the battlefields and 
back to negotiations, a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo announced that the mission 
had called off NATO enforcement of the "no-fly" zone imposed over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Hewlett, the U.N. military spokesman in Sarajevo, told journalists 
that the flyovers had been stopped for "a cooling-off period," to create a 
better atmosphere for peace talks in hopes the Serbs would take part. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials hotly denied that they had ceased their air patrols, but U.N. 
spokesmen at the headquarters here and in Sarajevo indicated that the 
enforcement had at least been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were in Sarajevo, you couldn't help but notice that there hasn't been 
a single overflight for several days," one U.N. official here said, drawing a 
distinction between "our formal position and reality." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a senior military official flatly denied that NATO had cut back 
its enforcement flights, but he conceded that allied warplanes were now flying 
"smarter" -- that is, using electronic jamming and flying at higher altitudes 
-- to guard against Serbian missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent U.N. attempt to ease NATO pressure on the Serbs and a 
conciliatory visit by Rose and Akashi to rebel headquarters in Pale, 10 miles 
east of Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb offensives and harassment of peacekeepers 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials reported that Karadzic was no longer even replying to their 
daily requests to move fuel, food and other supplies to any of the 24,000 
peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations late Friday, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution 
aimed at stopping the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro from sending 
fuel supplies that reportedly are powering the Serbs' offensive in northern 
Bosnia. It was the first council veto in a year and a half, and the first on 
the Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, a traditional Serbian ally, said it vetoed the resolution because it 
would unfairly tighten sanctions against Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between rebel Serbs and Croats in this country have escalated in 
recent days, with artillery exchanges and small-arms fire reported along a 
100-mile arc of their front line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian government and leaders of the Serbian rebel faction occupying 
one-third of Croatia signed a token agreement to restore some road and utility 
links, as well as an oil pipeline to the Adriatic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the brokers of the deal on mutually advantageous economic cooperation 
conceded that prospects for a breakthrough toward resolution of the overall 
Serb-Croat conflict were grim. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian army units were reported to be firing across a U.N.-patrolled buffer 
zone near the Adriatic coast, and the signatory for the Serbian rebel side, 
Borislav Mikulic, immediately declared that the utility restoration should not 
be seen as rebel acceptance of rule by Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Krajina will never be part of Croatia," Mikulic, the rebels' self-styled 
prime minister, told journalists after signing the economic cooperation pact on 
behalf of those living in the Croatian territory Serbian occupiers call the 
independent Republic of Serbian Krajina. 
</P>
<P>
 Of greatest concern to the U.N. mission and the international community is the 
Krajina Serbs' use of the occupied territory to stage attacks across an 
international border into the Bihac pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Galbraith, the U.S. ambassador to Croatia, and his mediation partner, 
Russian Ambassador Leonid V. Kerestidyants, warned Mikulic against continued 
involvement of Krajina Serbs in the assault on Bihac, one of six 
U.N.-designated "safe havens" in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This risks a wider war that could have terrible consequences for them," 
Galbraith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Sarajevo report that NATO pilots had been asked to "stand 
down" in "no-fly" enforcement over Bosnia, Galbraith insisted that NATO planes 
were still active, but he conceded that the alliance pilots had to "change some 
patterns because of the (surface-to-air missile) threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic gunmen have positioned surface-to-air batteries around Bihac and 
Sarajevo airport to intimidate NATO fliers, who are prohibited from bombing the 
missile sites even though the missiles could be used to shoot them down. U.N. 
officials fear that such action would invite retaliation against the hostage 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior military official did not say where the Serbian nationalists had 
obtained the missiles or why NATO forces -- which previously had enjoyed 
unchallenged air superiority over Bosnia and authority to fire at missile-radar 
installations -- had allowed the rebels to put them in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb rebels on Friday morning released 70 of the nearly 500 U.N. 
troops they had grabbed as shields against further NATO air strikes. But about 
400 remained captives, and thousands of others are deployed to Serb-encircled 
enclaves, such as Sarajevo, where they could easily be seized by the rebels.

FLEISS CONVICTED ON 3 PANDERING CHARGES; COURTS: JURY DEADLOCKS ON TWO COUNTS 
AND ACQUITS HER OF DRUG ALLEGATION. SHE COULD GET MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS IN 
PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, who for three years ran a notorious ring of 
high-priced, short-skirted prostitutes for Los Angeles glitterati, was 
convicted Friday on three counts of pandering that could send her to prison for 
more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked on two other pandering counts and acquitted Fleiss of a 
cocaine charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-man, five-woman panel spent four days deliberating in Los Angeles 
Superior Court before reaching a verdict in the steamy, high-profile case that 
has titillated the nation and rekindled the age-old debate about whether 
prostitution should be considered a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, 28, who was arrested in an elaborate 1993 police sting, was visibly 
shaken, dropping her head down on the table when the guilty verdict was 
announced. Because pandering carries a mandatory minimum sentence, she faces 
imprisonment of between three years and 8 years, 8 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in shock. My heart has never beaten so fast," Fleiss, the daughter 
of prominent pediatrician Dr. Paul Fleiss, said in a telephone interview later 
from his Santa Monica condominium, where she took refuge after posting $75,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard them say guilty on the first count, and then I just couldn't hear 
anymore. I just went blank. . . . My father was crying -- he said, 'Be strong 
and think of something positive,' but I can't even think." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Judith L. Champagne set a preliminary hearing on sentencing for Jan. 20, 
but no firm sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss sat grim-faced through the court proceedings, sighing at one point, 
throwing her head back at another. Her father -- with whom she faces a federal 
court trial in January on related charges of money laundering and tax evasion 
-- hung his head and wept in the first row of the courtroom seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts came after four days of contentious, back-and-forth deliberations 
that was occasionally halted by a forewoman who blew on a whistle to keep 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Because some jurors were apparently unaware of the penalties required by state 
law, they appeared stunned -- and in some cases remorseful -- Friday when 
reporters informed them that Fleiss must serve at least three years in state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no, that's way too much," said forewoman Sheila Mitrowski, a 48-year-old 
phone company clerical worker from Bell Gardens. "You've got kids out on the 
streets dealing drugs, for crying out loud, and they get probation."  
</P>
<P>
 Mitrowski said half the jurors, including herself, wanted to acquit Fleiss 
when deliberations began. However, "we went right by the law," she said. "We 
haggled about it for four days." 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Nancy Reyes seemed on the verge of tears upon learning that Fleiss faced 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she should go to jail for it," said Reyes, 24, a Monterey Park 
secretary. "I just don't think it's fair that she has to do time for something 
like this. It's upsetting. . . . Hey, she didn't kill anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Alan Carter said the mandatory sentence is appropriate because 
panderers -- the legal term for madams and pimps who procure prostitutes for 
clients -- capitalize on the weakness of prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who go into the prostitution business are usually pretty sad souls, 
and they're exploited by panderers," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Carter added that the verdict "demonstrates how wrong people have been" about 
the ability of juries to reach rational decisions.  
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' mother, schoolteacher Elissa Fleiss, said she was flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something flawed about people who can't decide about the guilt or 
innocence of admitted parent-killers and people shown on camera smashing the 
head of someone else, and (who) then find Heidi guilty," she said, referring to 
the Menendez slayings and the beating of trucker Reginald O. Denny during the 
1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't believe the good of society has been served by putting Heidi in 
jail," Elissa Fleiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury indicted Fleiss in September, 1993, after a complex, multi-agency 
undercover sting operation in which the key player was a Beverly Hills 
detective posing as a Hawaiian businessman. Her arrest shook Hollywood, which 
instantly began to buzz with rumors -- never publicly verified -- that her 
clientele included entertainment industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lavish Beverly Hills hotel suite, hidden cameras filmed the activities of 
four women dispatched by Fleiss to entertain four police officers posing as 
Japanese businessmen celebrating a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 To buttress the case, police also had taped the phone conversations between 
Fleiss and Beverly Hills Detective Sammy Lee that led to the two fateful 
assignations with prostitutes on two consecutive evenings. In those 
conversations, Lee explained to Fleiss that he wanted one woman to arrive June 
8, and four the next evening when his colleagues arrived. He also asked Fleiss 
to provide a small quantity of cocaine for the second evening -- a request that 
she said would be "no problem," according to tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Burdette, a Colorado-born model, arrived on schedule June 8, and 
returned the next night with three other women and a small quantity of cocaine. 
After more than an hour of conversation -- with the undercover officers 
speaking gibberish that they hoped would pass for Japanese -- the four women 
did a striptease with only their own humming for accompaniment as about 20 
officers watched from the next room via the surveillance camera. As the last of 
the four got down to her underwear, police stormed in and placed them all under 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contended that Fleiss willingly procured women and drugs, knowing 
it is against the law. But defense lawyers argued that she had been entrapped 
by overzealous vice cops -- in legal terms, induced to commit an act that never 
would have occurred had not the police set events in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As deliberations progressed, several jurors who first leaned toward acquittal 
on the grounds of entrapment began to pull back, Mitrowski said. They 
eventually decided that only in the case of Burdette had police gone too far 
and manipulated her.  
</P>
<P>
 The key, Mitrowski said, was the fact that Burdette was summoned to the hotel 
by the "customers" twice. The police could have arrested her on her first 
visit, the forewoman said. "With Samantha, they didn't get her on anything but 
what they had set up themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have contended that they needed a second night of evidence to 
strengthen their case. 
</P>
<P>
 Another juror, a West Los Angeles woman who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said she and some other panelists felt that Fleiss had been entrapped on all 
counts, but could not find adequate evidence to persuade the rest of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, she said, the jurors were forced to bargain with each other in 
order to reach a verdict and avoid a painful deadlock.  
</P>
<P>
 Her aim, the juror said, was simply to make sure that Fleiss was not convicted 
on the cocaine charge, which she believed to be the most serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give a little and take a little. We didn't want to come up with a 
hung jury," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges routinely instruct jurors to avoid such bargaining. They are instructed 
to decide each count strictly on its merits. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss lawyer Anthony Brooklier had already planned to appeal the conviction 
on the grounds that mandatory pandering sentences constitute cruel and unusual 
punishment. After hearing news accounts of what he described as jurors 
"horse-trading" their votes on various charges, Brooklier said he will add the 
claim of jury misconduct to his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Brooklier mused, had jurors gone the other way -- convicted Fleiss 
on the cocaine charge and acquitted her of pandering -- she would have been 
eligible for probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, too, said she was stunned at some jurors' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard some of them talking afterward (on TV), and I couldn't believe it," 
she said sadly. "They thought they were doing me a favor" by convicting her of 
pandering rather than the drug charge. "They thought I'd just get a ticket or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Reyes said she believed that police were "definitely overbearing" in 
pursuing Fleiss. Referring to testimony that a smoke detector went off in the 
room where police were monitoring surveillance cameras as Burdette disrobed 
June 8 for undercover vice cop Lee, Reyes said derisively: "They were probably 
all smoking and getting off on the video they were watching." 
</P>
<P>
 But other jurors said they felt that justice was served. Juror Darryl Kitagawa 
said he did not believe that the police had acted inappropriately or induced 
Fleiss to commit a crime.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt there was no evidence of entrapment on any of the pandering charges," 
said Kitagawa, a 42-year-old Department of Water and Power illustrator who 
lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Several jurors said they fought frequently during agonizing deliberations.

 "We played the video and audiotapes. We played them and played them," said 
juror Maria Campos, 38, a hospital receptionist from Northeast Los Angeles. 
"There were a lot of arguments. We were arguing constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors revealed that little was said during deliberations about the identities 
of Fleiss' clients, who -- according to Fleiss, her prostitutes and undercover 
surveillance tapes -- included several well-known Hollywood producers, rock 
stars, foreign diplomats and international businessmen. The names of these 
customers have not been made public; Judge Champagne ruled out possible 
disclosure in court early in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, a high school dropout, said she got her start working as an assistant 
for onetime Beverly Hills madam Elizabeth Adams. She said she was Adams' 
assistant, not a "working girl." However, according to a search warrant 
affidavit, Fleiss was "Elizabeth Adams' No. 1 'girl' until she broke off . . . 
to start her own prostitution business." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss maintained her own business for three years before running afoul of 
police, according to police surveillance tapes of her phone conversations. It 
was hardly a clandestine operation. There were wild parties, including a bash 
for Mick Jagger that trashed Fleiss' house. There was almost constant 
club-hopping arm in arm with one celebrity or another. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a time of giddy days and gallivanting nights that abruptly ended in the 
police sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months before Fleiss' trial for pandering, her problems grew. 
</P>
<P>
 She was arrested in September after drug tests -- a term of her probation -- 
indicated that she had used stimulants and depressants. As a result of those 
tests, she was assigned to a Pasadena-based drug rehabilitation program, where 
she spent two months. As a condition of her release from the program, she 
undergoes drug tests five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal court, Fleiss and her father were charged in August with money 
laundering, bank fraud and conspiracy to hide her income from her prostitution 
ring. Daughter and father have pleaded not guilty to those charges. That trial, 
scheduled for January, may well unveil the identities of Fleiss' clients 
because many reportedly wrote checks to her from personal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss hinted after her arrest that she might publicly name her clients. Later 
-- after legal proceedings began -- she simply expressed frustration that she 
could be punished while the men go free. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, she was more concerned with her own predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about anything but what's happening right now," she said. "Even 
if the guys were going down too, that wouldn't help me, would it?"

WHITE HOUSE RUDDERLESS, DEMOCRATS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton met privately Friday for the first time with the new 
Republican leaders of Congress, as well as with a delegation of top Democrats, 
and found that both groups could pose problems for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker-designate 
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) sounded a note of cooperation after the meeting. But they 
left little doubt that they -- like many Democrats -- expect policy initiatives 
to be spawned under the Capitol dome, not at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich declared that "we had a very positive and very encouraging 
conversation about the general direction of American policy." But he added: "We 
agreed in principle about areas where we disagreed." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans seemed confident, many Democratic lawmakers and aides said 
in private that they see a White House that appears divided and uncertain in 
the aftermath of the Nov. 8 elections. The GOP took control of both houses of 
Congress for the first time in 40 years in midterm balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few days, some Capitol Hill Democrats have indicated that they 
are increasingly disturbed because they believe that the White House is 
misinterpreting last month's election and failing to develop a legislative 
strategy to rebuild their party. 
</P>
<P>
 Their dismay was reflected in comments after Democratic leaders met with the 
President on Friday. Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the new Senate minority leader, 
talked about how "excited" Democrats are about their "opportunities." But he 
also suggested that there will be more distance between Democrats on the Hill 
and those at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we are going to have to develop our own agenda when we have to," 
Daschle said as he and other House and Senate Democrats left the White House. 
"And we will be articulating that in the coming weeks with greater specificity. 
Obviously, to the extent possible, we want to work with them (the White 
House)," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a frank discussion about the election," the new House minority whip, 
David E. Bonior (D-Mich.), said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democrats have been even more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 After Democratic legislators who lost their seats met with Clinton earlier 
this week, several warned their former colleagues that they thought key members 
of the White House staff were in a state of denial.  
</P>
<P>
 "To be candid with you," said Rep. Lynn Schenk, who represents a San Diego 
district but was defeated in November, "I believe the President got the message 
but his closest advisers have not. . . . White House people who understand the 
problems across the country don't have the access to Clinton. Those that do 
(have access) don't have a feel for the country's mood, so he's not getting the 
message." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a recent meeting between state party officials and White House 
Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes in Florida "got really ugly," according 
to one senior Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us up on the Hill have gotten the feeling that they don't have any 
strategy for how to win back the Senate or the House," said one top Senate 
Democratic aide. "When we have met with them (in the White House), all they 
have is a list of bills they want to push. That's not a strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling we have is that they are down looking at polls trying to figure 
out what to think," said the top aide to another leading Democrat. "What they 
ought to be doing is saying to themselves: 'What are the things that we really 
care about and will define who we are and where we stand.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), the newly elected chairman of the 
Democratic House Conference -- in an interview before meeting with the 
President -- said one problem is that "the battle continues inside the White 
House" over how to interpret the elections. "There is a good deal of ferment 
there still." 
</P>
<P>
 But while many Democrats have criticized the White House for failing to 
respond to the election results, others said that they think Clinton is a 
political liability for them that no amount of tinkering can fix. As he walked 
into the meeting with defeated candidates, one unseated lawmaker whispered to a 
colleague: "What do you say to the guy who lost your congressional seat?" 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, however, said that finger-pointing is counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that these comments are being made," a White House 
spokeswoman said. "If you look back at the November election you could blame a 
lot of people. But that doesn't get you anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has acknowledged since the election "that the American public wants 
something to be done," she said, and is focused on delivering improvement for 
working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important that we learn from this election," Sen. John B. Breaux 
(D-La.) said in an interview. "Defeats are only important if you don't learn 
from them." 
</P>
<P>
 In health care, Breaux said, "the White House targeted the 15% of Americans 
who didn't have health insurance and said to them: 'We're going to make your 
lives a lot better.' Republicans went out to the 85% of those who already had 
insurance and said: 'If this plan passes, you're going to lose. They're going 
to take from you to give to them.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So we tried to make a majority out of 15% of people. Republicans are trying 
to create a majority for their position by talking to the 85% of people who had 
health insurance. And I assure you that their task was a lot easier than ours." 
 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over the direction of the Democratic Party is made more complicated 
because of the differences between the Senate, which has more moderate 
Democrats who want the party to move to the center, and the House, which has 
become more liberal because many of the defeated Democrats were moderates 
representing conservative to moderate districts, leaving a House minority that 
largely represents solidly liberal districts.

FUNDS BANNED FOR CREATION OF EMBRYOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWARTZ and ANN DEVROY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Friday announced that it would prohibit federal 
funding for creating human embryos solely for research purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came on the same day that a National Institutes of Health 
panel endorsed guidelines that would have allowed funding for such research. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe that federal funds should be used to support the creation of 
human embryos for research purposes," Clinton said, "and I have directed that 
NIH not allocate any resources for such research." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision does not constitute a ban on human embryo research, nor does it 
prohibit federal funding for research on "spare" human embryos fertilized for 
possible implantation in patients of in-vitro fertilization clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 It applies only to a guideline proposed by an NIH-appointed committee that 
scientists be allowed, under very special circumstances, to create human 
embryos specifically for research purposes. That recommendation was the most 
controversial of a set of proposed guidelines submitted to the NIH in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Human embryo research involves studies of the earliest weeks of development of 
the growing organism, beginning with the fertilization of an egg. It offers the 
promise of medical benefits such as insight into the processes of 
fertilization, better treatment for infertility, a clearer understanding of 
birth defects and improved contraceptive methods. 
</P>
<P>
 The developing organism is called a fetus after the end of the eighth week of 
development. Fetal tissue research -- science that examines how tissues develop 
later in a pregnancy -- had been prohibited from receiving federal funds during 
the George Bush Administration; Clinton relaxed that ban upon taking office. 
Fetal tissue research was not addressed in the recommended embryo research 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's announcement by the White House constitutes a significant shift in 
Administration policy. The Clinton Administration had initiated efforts to 
renew federal funding for human embryo research after an unofficial moratorium 
during the two previous Republican administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal funding for human embryo research was cut off in 1980 when the charter 
expired for the sole agency that could fund the research. Legislation passed in 
1993 made it possible to fund the research once more, and in early 1994, NIH 
Director Harold E. Varmus appointed the Human Embryo Research Panel to 
recommend guidelines for reviewing the applications that were already coming 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Varmus refused to comment on Friday's announcement by the White House. 
Patricia King, co-chair of the research panel and a professor at Georgetown 
University Law Center, said: "I don't think that what the President did has as 
much to do with the merits of embryo research as politics." 
</P>
<P>
 King, who as a panel member had expressed reservations about the creation of 
embryos solely for research, added: "The important thing is that the work gets 
started -- because it has so much promise." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said Clinton decided several days ago he 
would not allow funding for creation of human embryos for research. White House 
officials staunchly denied that the decision was driven by the Republican sweep 
in the midterm elections or by the likelihood that the GOP would attack Clinton 
as a pro-abortion liberal if he allowed such funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said and he believes that this area raises very profound questions," said 
William A. Galston, deputy assistant to the President for domestic policy. "It 
is very, very important that we not transgress ethical boundaries -- even in 
the name of very great scientific and medical possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the high-level NIH Advisory Committee to the Director had voted to 
accept the controversial report by its Human Embryo Research Panel. The panel 
had engaged in an arduous nine-month effort to draw boundaries between 
acceptable and unacceptable forms of research for the government to fund. 
Panelists received some 50,000 pieces of mail, much of it opposing the 
research.

U.S. TO DROP RECALL PROBE OF GM TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unprecedented settlement decried by consumer activists, the U.S. 
government agreed Friday to drop a recall investigation of 5 million General 
Motors pickup trucks in exchange for a $51-million contribution from the 
company for safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said he would abandon his earlier 
ruling that GM's 1973-87 C/K pickup trucks had a safety defect because the 
agreement would avoid costly litigation and enhance safety programs that could 
immediately save lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement is a common sense outcome and a victory for safety," Pena 
said at a news conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer groups, which prompted the government's safety investigation of 
the vehicles in 1992, harshly criticized the agreement as "unprincipled and 
irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 "A multibillion-dollar conglomerate has essentially bought the government's 
silence for a pittance," said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen and a 
former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
under President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her group and the Center for Auto Safety, another consumer advocacy 
group, is considering challenging the agreement in court on behalf of crash 
victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena's announcement was a surprising twist in an increasingly bitter and 
emotional battle over the pickups' safety that began in 1992. It came just four 
days before a NHTSA public meeting on a potential recall, which could have been 
the largest and most expensive in the nation's history. The meeting was 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 17, Pena made an initial ruling that GM pickups were defective and 
presented an "unreasonable risk" to consumers because their design made them 
more susceptible to fires in side-impact collisions. The vehicle's fuel tanks 
are mounted on the side outside the protective frame. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has adamantly maintained that the C/K pickups, sold under Chevrolet and GMC 
nameplates, are safe and meet all federal safety standards, including those for 
side-impact collisions. The pickups also have a better overall safety record 
than most passenger cars, company and government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position has never wavered that these trucks are not unsafe and do not 
pose an unreasonable risk to owners who continue to operate them," said GM 
spokesman Ed Lechtzin. 
</P>
<P>
 A recall could have cost GM more than $1 billion, and the company had vowed to 
fight the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said the settlement was the best option presented to him. If a recall was 
ordered, the matter would have gone to court and the vehicles would have 
remained on the road until the case was resolved in five to seven years, he 
said. If the case was closed, the public would have gotten no benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the options, I decided this kind of agreement was most in the best 
interest of the public," Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena termed the settlement unique, and safety experts said there has been no 
other case in which federal regulators had agreed to vacate a recall 
investigation in return for a corporate donation and cooperation in unrelated 
safety activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which was signed by Pena and GM Chief Executive John F. Smith, 
requires the auto maker to contribute $51 million to a variety of programs 
identified by NHTSA. The contribution can be in the form of money, facilities 
or labor, but must be new expenditures not already budgeted by GM. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for GM to cooperate in developing stronger federal 
side-impact collision standards for fuel systems. The current standard requires 
gas tanks to withstand a 20 m.p.h. crash. The government would like the 
threshold doubled to 40 m.p.h. to better mirror real-world conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto maker also will help fund a government fire safety research 
laboratory, contribute to research for burn and trauma victims, crash tests 
dummies and drunk-driving, and expend $8 million for child-safety seats for 
low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 "These programs will save hundreds of lives and prevent thousands of 
injuries," said Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 In making his initial determination of defect, Pena said 150 people had died 
in fiery collisions in the C/K pickups and 32 more would die in subsequent 
years. He said GM had made a design decision placing "sales over safety." 
Although the company altered the design in 1988, placing the gas tank within 
the body frame, Pena said there was evidence that GM knew of the problem in the 
early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena's initial recall decision came under fire in recent weeks when it was 
revealed that it was made against the recommendation of NHTSA's technical 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Gauthier, former director of NHTSA's office of defect investigation, 
said the staff found the C/K pickups do have a greater risk of fire-related 
fatalities when compared to other similar trucks -- but not an "unreasonable 
risk" when compared to all cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recommended that the defect investigation be closed," said Gauthier, who 
recently retired after 21 years with NHTSA. He added that the staff then was 
taken out of the loop and the decision was placed in the hands of political 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three and foreign auto makers complained about the initial recall 
decision in letters to President Clinton, asking him to intervene. Pena said 
that he advised the Administration of Friday's settlement but had no other 
contact with the White House regarding the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 NHTSA began an investigation in December, 1992, shortly after the "Dateline 
NBC" news program aired a critical show that purported to show GM pickups 
erupting into flames when hit in the side. But GM proved that NBC rigged the 
crash tests and the network retracted the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, the company was rocked when a Georgia jury awarded $105 million 
to the parents of 17-year-old Shannon Moseley, who died when his C/K pickup 
burst into flames after being hit in the side. An appeals court overturned the 
decision in June and sent it back to the lower court for retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 GM faces more than 50 product-liability cases involving fire-related deaths 
and injuries in C/K pickups. It feared that the Dec. 6 public meeting would 
have provided a podium for trial lawyers to parade burn victims before the 
public. Claybrook said the victims still plan their own news conference in 
Washington on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 B.J. Kincade, who heads a victims' recall group, characterized the settlement 
as a corporate payoff that "amounts to nothing more than a sentence of death" 
to drivers of these trucks. Case Dates to 1972 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a chronology of key events in the dispute between General 
Motors Corp. and the U.S. Department of Transportation over the safety of GM's 
full-sized pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 1972: GM begins production of the C/K pickup truck, with the fuel tanks 
located outside the vehicle's frame rails. 
</P>
<P>
 February, 1992: GM settles a lawsuit with the family of a 61-year-old GM 
worker who died in a fire in a 1987 pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 November, 1992: NBC's "Dateline" broadcasts a report on GM pickup trucks that 
featured a "simulated crash" of a GM truck. The truck burst into flames. GM 
claims the explosion was rigged. NBC later apologizes for the report. 
</P>
<P>
 December, 1992: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration formerly begins 
an investigation into GM trucks equipped with the so-called side-saddle fuel 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 February, 1993: An Atlanta jury orders GM to pay $105.2 million to the parents 
of 17-year-old Shannon Moseley, who died in a 1989 crash. The verdict is later 
thrown out on appeal. The Moseleys are appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 April, 1993: NHTSA asks GM to recall the vehicles and launches an engineering 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 October, 1993: GM enters into a class-action settlement with full-sized pickup 
truck owners. The settlement offers owners $1,000 in coupons toward the 
purchase of a new GM truck to compensate customers who claimed negative 
publicity had hurt their vehicles' resale values. 
</P>
<P>
 October, 1994: Department of Transportation schedules a public hearing for 
Dec. 6 to collect additional information on the defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 2, 1994: Under a settlement agreement, GM pledges to spend $51.36 million 
to set up an auto safety fund.

U.S. JOBLESS RATE HITS 4-YEAR LOW; ECONOMY: THE 5.6% LEVEL REFLECTS HEFTY GAIN 
OF 350,000 JOBS. FLAT WAGES SUGGEST INFLATION IS POSING NO DANGER. CALIFORNIA, 
STEADY AT 7.7%, IS STILL MIRED IN A SHAKY RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The national economy kept surging during November, adding a surprisingly hefty 
350,000 jobs and cutting the unemployment rate to 5.6%, the lowest level in 
more than four years and down from 5.8% in October, the U.S. Labor Department 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But California's jobless level remained unchanged at 7.7%, providing testimony 
that the state's wobbly recovery still trails far behind the robust national 
expansion. In Los Angeles County, in fact, the jobless rate rose to 8%, up from 
7.8% the month before. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, "you couldn't ask for a better economy than we have right now," 
said Ed Yardeni, chief economist for C. J. Lawrence in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's reports reflected a rare combination of big employment gains and flat 
wages -- suggesting that inflation still poses no immediate threat to the 
economy, even if it comes at the expense of individual workers who had hoped 
for bigger pay raises.  
</P>
<P>
 That outlook on inflation -- and two other government reports Friday showing 
declines in the index of leading economic indicators and in factory orders -- 
bolstered Wall Street by easing concerns about the likelihood of the economy 
overheating. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.75, to 3,745.62, and the 
price of 30-year Treasury bonds was up more than one point, reducing the 
interest rate yield to 7.9% from 8.01% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, economists predicted that the Federal Reserve, worried about the 
potential for future inflation, will boost interest rates again when its 
policy-makers next meet later this month. And that, the analysts say, will give 
the long-suffering California economy yet another obstacle to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good news that the United States is booming for Christmas, but it 
means that there will be interest rate increases at a time when California is 
still lagging behind," said Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business 
Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists contended that the nation's economic expansion still hasn't 
reached its peak, citing this week's report of rising consumer confidence, 
along with the latest employment data and other upbeat news. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy obviously has more momentum than we thought," said Robert Barr, 
deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "It's a healthy 
economy and one we don't think is too strong, or is going out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 In a satellite address from the White House to a meeting of the National 
League of Cities in Minneapolis, President Clinton said Friday's employment 
reports demonstrated the economy's "strong success in building good jobs for 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that the economy has generated 5.2 million new jobs during his 
presidency. Meanwhile, the surge of 350,000 jobs during November was 
significantly higher than the monthly average of 273,000 jobs generated this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yardeni, however, maintained that the collapse of Clinton's health care reform 
proposals and the major Republican election victories last month have spurred 
businesses to increase their hiring.  
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of health care reform, he said, "eliminates a lot of 
uncertainties hanging over the heads of business planners," while the 
Republican gains provide assurance that Washington will be friendlier to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 While employment grew last month in both construction and manufacturing, those 
industries were overshadowed by the services sector of the economy, where pay 
tends to be lower. The economy is "getting a lot of part-time and low-paid 
jobs," said Markley Roberts, the AFL-CIO assistant director of economic 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always happy to see an improvement in the economy, but the whole story 
doesn't appear in those numbers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts and other skeptics point to a long-running squeeze on family incomes. 
And in November, average hourly earnings were $11.22, down from $11.24. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. jobless rate of 5.6% last month was the lowest since August, 1990, 
when it stood at the same level. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate, at 7.7%, was the worst among the 11 big states 
whose figures were reported Friday, while North Carolina's level, 4.1%, was the 
best. If California's figures had not been included, the nation's jobless rate 
would have been 5.3%, reflecting how much healthier the economy is in the rest 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was any good news for California, it was that the state's jobless 
rate in November remained at its lowest level for the year, and well below the 
9% mark where it rested in July. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, according to the monthly survey of employer payrolls, the state's 
employment total inched up by 3,200 to 11.9 million. That was up 6,000 from 
November, 1993 -- the first time in four years that California posted a 
year-over-year job increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some California economists believe that the monthly employment 
reports are missing what appears to be a modest recovery under way in the 
state. Ted Gibson, principal economist for the State Department of Finance, 
said withholding tax revenues suggest that employment in California actually 
has grown at a rate of about 15,000 to 20,000 jobs a month all year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also pointed to indications that the holiday shopping season got off 
to a very strong start in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, even with a rise in the jobless rate to 8% in November, 
unemployment stayed down from levels that hovered around 10% at midyear. Still, 
that improvement could reflect seasonal hiring rather than any strengthening of 
the underlying economy, said Vincent M. Canales, labor market analyst with the 
California Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Canales said the latest Los Angeles County figures -- which, unlike 
the federal and state figures, are not adjusted for seasonal trends -- were 
disappointing in that "you would expect to see some improvement this time of 
year" in employment. 
</P>
<P>
 November's 8% county jobless rate was based on a survey putting the number of 
unemployed at 355,000, up 6,000 from the month before, while employment fell to 
4.083 million, down 38,000 from October's level.

FLEISS CONVICTED ON 3 PANDERING CHARGES; COURTS: JURY DEADLOCKS ON TWO COUNTS 
AND ACQUITS HER OF DRUG ALLEGATION. SHE FACES UP TO NEARLY NINE YEARS IN 
PRISON.

<P>
 Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, who ran a notorious ring of high-priced, 
short-skirted prostitutes for Los Angeles glitterati, was convicted Friday on 
pandering charges that carry a prison sentence of up to nearly nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-man, five-woman jury spent four days deliberating in Los Angeles 
Superior Court before reaching a verdict in the steamy case that titillated the 
nation and rekindled the age-old debate about whether prostitution should be 
considered a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 After back-and-forth shifts of opinion -- and some misgivings after they 
delivered their verdicts -- the jury convicted Fleiss, 28, the daughter of a 
prominent pediatrician, on three counts of pandering. It deadlocked on the 
other two counts and found her not guilty on one count of supplying cocaine to 
an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Judith L. Champagne set a preliminary hearing on sentencing for Jan. 20, 
but no firm sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss dropped her head to the table when the second "guilty" verdict rang 
through the courtroom and sat slumped for a few moments. Then, as the third and 
final "guilty" was announced, she raised her head and slammed her hand on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She sat grim-faced through the rest of the court proceedings, sighing at one 
point, throwing her head back at another. Her father, Paul Fleiss -- with whom 
she faces a federal court trial in January on related charges of money 
laundering and tax evasion -- hung his head in the first row of the courtroom 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury indicted Heidi Fleiss in September, 1993, after a complex, 
multi-agency sting operation. Her arrest shook Hollywood, which instantly began 
to buzz with rumors -- never publicly verified -- that her clientele included 
entertainment industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The key player in the sting operation was Sammy Lee, a Beverly Hills police 
officer who posed as Hawaiian millionaire Niko Akai to catch Fleiss supplying 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Alan Carter said the verdict "demonstrates how wrong people have 
been about juries. There's been a lot of jury bashing," but this case's panel 
came to a reasonable verdict, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the jury forewoman, Sheila Mitrowski, a 48-year-old phone company 
clerical worker from Bell Gardens, revealed that there had been a struggle to 
reach unanimous decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 When deliberations began Tuesday after a six-day trial, she said, the jury was 
split evenly on Fleiss' guilt. Mitrowski said she, along with three other women 
and two men, initially believed that Fleiss should be acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she said, jurors decided that they could not entirely accept the 
reasoning of Fleiss' attorney Anthony Brooklier, who contended that his client 
had been entrapped by police.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mitrowski was stunned after the verdict was announced when a reporter told 
her that Fleiss' conviction carries mandatory prison time -- at least three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no, that's way too much," she said. "You've got kids out on the streets 
dealing drugs, for crying out loud, and they get probation."  
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that Fleiss' clients might be unveiled in her trial thrust the 
high school dropout into the national spotlight, transforming her virtually 
overnight into a celebrity, fare for tabloids as well as highbrow magazines. 
One senior Columbia Pictures executive even issued a statement at the time of 
her arrest denying that his name was in Fleiss' black book.  
</P>
<P>
 There are several versions of how Fleiss became a madam.  
</P>
<P>
 By her own telling, she established herself after working as an assistant for 
onetime Beverly Hills madam Elizabeth Adams. Fleiss maintained that she was 
Adams' assistant, not a "working girl." But according to a search warrant 
affidavit, Fleiss was "Elizabeth Adams' No. 1 'girl' until she broke off . . . 
to start her own prostitution business." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Adams (known as Madam Alex) has a different account, as does Fleiss' 
ex-beau, Hungarian director Ivan Nagy.  
</P>
<P>
 Nagy said he told Madam Alex about his new girlfriend, and was shocked when 
she replied that Fleiss worked for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss maintained her own business for two years before running afoul of 
police, according to police surveillance tapes of her phone conversations. It 
was hardly a clandestine operation. There were wild parties, including a bash 
for Mick Jagger that trashed Fleiss' house. There was almost constant 
club-hopping arm in arm with one celebrity or another. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a time of giddy days and gallivanting nights that abruptly ended when 
the 1993 undercover sting operation at a lavish Beverly Hills hotel suite 
resulted in Fleiss' arrest. There, hidden cameras recorded the activities of 
four women dispatched by Fleiss to entertain four police officers posing as 
Japanese businessmen celebrating a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 To buttress the case, police also had taped the phone conversations between 
Fleiss and Beverly Hills Detective Lee that led up to the two fateful 
assignations with prostitutes on two consecutive evenings. In those 
conversations, Lee explained to Fleiss that he wanted one woman to arrive June 
8, and four women the next evening when his colleagues arrived. He also asked 
Fleiss to provide a small quantity of cocaine for the second evening -- a 
request that she said would be "no problem," according to tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The video as well as the audiotapes were played for the jury. The videotape 
captured the four women accepting $1,500 in $100 dollar bills, discussing which 
sexual acts they were prepared to perform and engaging in small talk as the 
officers pretended to speak Japanese. The four women also partially disrobed as 
they danced, hummed and clapped -- a signal that summoned about 20 officers for 
the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes proved to be the cornerstone of the case. "There really is no 
dispute about what the facts are," prosecutor Carter told the jury in his 
closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 But the controversy in court centered on how to interpret those tapes. Carter 
used them to characterize Fleiss as a shrewd businesswoman, eager to peddle her 
wares. Defense attorney Brooklier and co-counsel Donald Marks painted a 
completely different picture. 
</P>
<P>
 With the same tapes, they sought to portray Fleiss as the victim of 
overzealous police who entrapped her, inducing her to commit a crime that she 
would not have done on her own. They also tried to downplay the gravity of 
pandering, pointing out that prostitution is legal in Nevada and saying that 
the male customers are not prosecuted equally for their part in such crimes in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklier and Carter had squared off on a similar case three years ago, when 
Brooklier defended Adams on charges that she used her Sunset Strip house to 
pimp and pander, and tried to enlist an undercover policewoman into the 
prostitution ring. Adams received probation instead of jail time because police 
testified that she was an informant. Carter was the prosecutor in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months before Fleiss' trial for pandering, her problems grew. She was 
arrested in September after drug tests -- a term of her probation -- indicated 
that she had used stimulants and depressants. As a result of those tests, she 
was assigned to a Pasadena-based drug rehabilitation program, where she spent 
two months. As a condition of her release from the program, she undergoes drug 
tests five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal court, Fleiss and her father were charged in August with money 
laundering, bank fraud and conspiracy to hide her income from her prostitution 
ring. Daughter and father have pleaded not guilty to those charges. That trial, 
scheduled for January, may well unveil the identities of Fleiss' clients 
because many reportedly wrote checks to her from personal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 After the jury convicted Fleiss, prosecutor Carter said that because of her 
pending federal trial and a past bail violation, she should be remanded 
immediately into custody or released on bail as high as $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Champagne instead set bail at $75,000, which Fleiss posted. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has not made a decision on whether to retry 
Fleiss on the two deadlocked counts, spokeswoman Suzanne Childs said. The

COLUMN ONE; WAGING A LOW-KEY WAR ON NAPALM; ONCE, IT WAS THE ULTIMATE SYMBOL 
FOR THE DIVISIVENESS OF THE VIETNAM WAR. NOW, THE LAST CACHE LIES NEARLY 
FORGOTTEN AS THE MILITARY ATTEMPTS TO DISPOSE OF IT.

<P>
 Just west of this quiet farming community -- a continent away from the stark, 
black wall in Washington that commemorates Americans killed in Vietnam -- are 
three weedy and rocky fields that are host to an equally chilling, if less 
dignified, memorial to the same war. 
</P>
<P>
 The fields, part of the sprawling Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station, contain an 
enduring symbol of that divisive conflict: more than 35,000 canisters filled 
with 23 million pounds of napalm, a deadly brew of benzene, gasoline and 
polystyrene plastic that turns into a flaming syrupy mass when ignited by white 
phosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years have passed since the fall of Saigon, but the best and brightest 
have yet to find a way to dispose of the Vietnam War's final cache of liquid 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Like chemical combatants ready for inspection, the cigar-shaped, olive drab 
canisters are arranged in neat rows with military precision, each 15-foot-long 
canister encased in its own open-sided wood crate, row after row, acre after 
acre, exposed for two decades to the wind and sun and rain. 
</P>
<P>
 An eerie stillness envelops the napalm fields of Fallbrook, broken only by the 
muffled sounds of heavy artillery being used miles away by the Marines training 
at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the napalm canisters are still stamped with the manufacturer's 30-day 
warranty attesting to the contents' killing power. A few are leaking a gooey 
residue. Those that cannot be patched are taken to a toxic dump in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of napalm bombs being dropped by American jets once aroused 
passionate debate, but the fate of this forgotten stockpile has now become a 
low-key battle of attrition, a bureaucratic mix of environmental concerns, 
budgetary restraints and governmental red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of Fallbrook, a rural and politically conservative community in 
northern San Diego County, have learned to live with the napalm -- which is 
said to be non-flammable without its detonators -- and with the occasional 
promise that there is light at the end of the hazardous waste tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Technicians and environmentalists, mindful that benzene is a carcinogen and 
that the crates are soaked with a toxic wood preserver, periodically check for 
leakage and air pollution. But mostly the canisters just serve as a staging 
area for jack rabbits, rattlesnakes and field rats. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few weeks the Navy will officially launch its fourth attempt to win its 
war against the napalm, this time by paying a company to extract it from the 
aluminum canisters and send it by rail across the country for use as fuel in 
high-temperature kilns at cement plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time we think we have a better handle on it," said Richard Williamson, 
spokesman for the Naval Ordnance Center, Pacific Division, headquartered in 
Seal Beach, and point man for the napalm project. 
</P>
<P>
 The process, if it works, could take five years or more and cost $12 million 
to $18 million. Throw in the cost of cleaning up the three fields where the 
napalm has been stored, and the price tag jumps to more than $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After keeping the press at bay for years, the Navy has decided to try to 
rehabilitate the weapon's image by allowing journalists to visit the napalm 
fields. Fallbrook residents have been offered tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to demystify napalm," Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more than any other word associated with the Vietnam conflict, napalm 
came to define the sides in a bitter national -- and international -- debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972 and 1974, the United Nations General Assembly passed resolutions 
condemning the use of napalm and other incendiary weapons. The United States 
and the Soviet Union, which had supplied napalm to the North Vietnamese for 
their flamethrowers, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 In movies, books and poems, napalm has repeatedly entered into the cultural, 
intellectual and political discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over whether the Americans would have used the new, more lethal 
napalm against a Caucasian enemy hiding among Caucasian civilians is one of the 
irresolvable issues of Vietnam. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book "Fire in the 
Lake: The Vietnamese and the Americans in Vietnam," Frances Fitzgerald wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "In Europe (during World War II), the Americans rejected the use of chemical 
warfare, but in Vietnam they used napalm, phosphorus, tear gas, and various 
kinds of defoliants as a general practice and in such quantities as to render 
certain parts of the country uninhabitable." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most searing images of the war was a 1972 picture by an Associated 
Press photographer that showed Vietnamese children, including a naked 
9-year-old girl, running in terror after their village had accidentally been 
struck by napalm. 
</P>
<P>
 In Francis Ford Coppola's film "Apocalypse Now" -- seen as a polemic against 
the war -- the substance is a malevolent character in its own right. The 
war-loving Lt. Col. Kilgore, played by Robert Duvall, delivers the famous line, 
"I love the smell of napalm in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Even movies and books that take no overt position on the morality or the 
politics of the war have included napalm scenes as a shorthand method of 
evoking the carnage and confusion of battle. 
</P>
<P>
 In this year's hit movie "Forrest Gump," the simpleton hero played by Tom 
Hanks finds himself in Vietnam and acting bravely when his unit is caught in a 
napalm strike. 
</P>
<P>
 In the novel by Winston Groom, Gump says: "At dawn they call in a napalm 
airplane, but it drop the (stuff) damn near right on top of us. Our own fellers 
be all singed an burnt up -- come runnin out into the open, eyes big as 
biscuits, everybody cussing an sweating an scared, woods set on fire, damn near 
put the rain out!"  
</P>
<P>
 Despite its horrific image among many Americans, troops in the field said 
napalm saved innumerable American lives by repelling advances by the Viet Cong 
and the North Vietnamese Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholar Guenter Lewy, in his book "America in Vietnam," argued that anti-war 
activists overstated their claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impression created by critics of the war that many thousands of villagers 
and children were burnt by napalm is undoubtedly false," said Lewy, who based 
his book on millions of pages of secret military documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lewy also doubted military assertions that napalm and other incendiary 
weapons were used with surgical precision and only as a last resort. In truth, 
commanders enjoyed wide latitude to call for air strikes on civilians when they 
believed that the enemy was hiding among them, he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rather free use of napalm and attacks upon fortified hamlets with 
artillery and air strikes can be criticized on humanitarian grounds, and, 
moreover, were often counterproductive," Lewy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the truth about the number of civilian casualties from napalm, it 
cannot be denied that its use became a rallying point for those opposed to the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the angriest of his anti-war poems, Allen Ginsberg wrote: "Under the 
world there's pain, fractured thighs, napalm burning in black hair, phosphorous 
eating elbows to the bone." 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators besieged Dow Chemical Co., which made much of the napalm used in 
the war. Dowrecruiters were chased off several college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Wall Street Journal, Dow President Ted Doan tried to answer charges 
that Dow, in making napalm, was acting as immorally as the German 
industrialists who had supplied the ovens for the Nazi concentration camps: 
</P>
<P>
 "We reject the validity of comparing our present form of government with 
Hitler's Nazi Germany. In our mind our government is still representative of 
and responsive to the will of the people. . . . We plan to continue making 
napalm because we feel that so long as the United States is sending men to war, 
it is unthinkable that we would not supply the materials they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Napalm was invented by chemists from Harvard University and the Army Chemical 
Warfare Service for use in flamethrowers carried by U.S. troops in World War 
II. The name comes from its chemical constituents, napthene and palmitate. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1965, the Air Force had developed a new formula for napalm to increase its 
range and destructive power. The old napalm had merely thrown out a column of 
quickly extinguished flame. 
</P>
<P>
 The new napalm used in Vietnam, which could be spread by flamethrowers or 
dropped from jets, spread out quickly, stuck to surfaces -- trees, bamboo huts, 
clothing, skin -- and continued burning. 
</P>
<P>
 Once armed with phosphorus ignition fuses at either end, the 500-pound 
canisters were strapped beneath Navy and Air Force jets, most frequently to be 
dropped at low levels for accuracy. The napalm fire reached temperatures of 
5,000 degrees, so hot it sucked out all the air in its path. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the United States has eliminated napalm from its arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978 the Air Force declared the Fallbrook napalm to be surplus and ordered 
it demilitarized. But three stratagems by the Navy and environmental agencies 
in the intervening years to have it carted off and buried or recycled for 
civilian uses have failed for economic or regulatory reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't scare me anymore," said Jennifer Gaggero, who can see some of the 
canisters on the horizon from the back of the Good Earth nursery she runs with 
her parents. "I used to be worried about lightning striking it, but you can 
only worry about something for so long and then you have to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy and civilian officials insist that for all its fiery legacy, the napalm 
poses no danger to Fallbrook and that only the ultra hot temperatures induced 
by burning white phosphorus can ignite napalm. Even the heat of a blowtorch 
would not be sufficient to ignite the stored napalm, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unusual problem, but it doesn't present any immediate health hazards 
to anyone," said Rich Varenchik, spokesman for the state Department of Toxic 
Substance Control. "We could give them a deadline to have the stuff out but 
we're not inclined to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attempt to rid the community of the napalm hopes to capitalize on 
the mistakes of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three attempts -- by Barstow Truck in 1982, Bud's Oil from Phoenix 
in 1983, and Palm Enterprises from Monrovia in 1992 -- ran into money trouble, 
got mired in regulations or otherwise failed to meet the Navy's satisfaction. 
The abandoned and rusting remains of the removal machinery devised by Palm 
Enterprises still litter one of the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Navy hopes to hire Battelle Memorial Institute of Richland, 
Wash., which has a proven record of working on hazardous materials and 
high-technology matters for the Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm will be asked to build a facility at the Fallbrook base to extract 
the napalm from the aluminum canisters -- like toothpaste being squeezed from 
giant tubes, Williamson said -- without exposing any of it to the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is to extract the napalm into railroad tanker cars, smelt the 
aluminum for scrap, and chop up and detoxify the wooden crates to be made into 
particle board. 
</P>
<P>
 In this round, there may be less interagency wrangling over the disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the federal and state Environmental Protection Agencies have been 
involved with the napalm issue. So have San Diego County water quality and air 
pollution agencies. At one point, the federal EPA became concerned that the 
napalm canisters were disturbing the nests of the Stephen's kangaroo rat, an 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy is taking the position that local permits are not needed because the 
effort is being carried out under an executive order to clean up toxic sites at 
military bases as quickly as possible. The local pollution control agency 
disagrees, but so far has just engaged in a polite volley of letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the weapons station, which is on Ammunition Way, plan a public 
hearing next month in Fallbrook to brief the public on the latest disposal 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Charley Wolk, a civic leader, avocado grower and retired Marine lieutenant 
colonel who ordered napalm strikes during Vietnam, does not figure that 
Fallbrook residents will show much interest. The community, Wolk said, has a 
heavy contingent of retired military personnel who know that defused napalm is 
not combustible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody who has lived in Fallbrook for very long is afraid of napalm," he 
said. "You could roll those canisters down the main street and you wouldn't 
scare anybody." Napalm Fields 
</P>
<P>
 Three fields in the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station contain 35,000 canisters 
filled with 23 million pounds of napalm from the Vietnam War. The Navy hopes to 
finally dispose of them in the next five years.

ORANGE COUNTY FUND'S PLUNGE DRAWS SCRUTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The problems at Orange County's investment fund drew mounting concern and 
scrutiny Friday as investors, members of Congress, federal regulators and 
credit monitors assessed the full implications of a stunning $1.5-billion 
plunge in the value of the fund's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 While county leaders continued to call for calm, four top investors in the 
troubled county-managed fund moved to oversee future dealings on behalf of 185 
cities and special districts that had pooled their money for investment 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 A major Wall Street credit rating agency signaled that it may lower the 
ratings of Orange County bond issues, an action that could make it more costly 
for cities and agencies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an informal inquiry into the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee announced that 
congressional hearings will investigate whether limits should be placed on the 
use of public monies in the complex financial instruments that have helped 
drive down the value of Orange County's previously high-flying fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * An Orange County assemblyman said he will introduce legislation in 
Sacramento on Monday to curb the risky investment strategies used by 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who continued to face calls for his 
resignation. Citron remained locked in his office; sheriff's deputies ordered 
reporters away from his door. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nervous investors -- who directly or through mutual funds own tax-exempt 
municipal bondssold by Orange County or related agencies -- flooded phone lines 
of large funds such as the Franklin-Templeton Group of Funds in San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
 County treasury officials still were reeling from their explosive disclosure 
Thursday that risky investment maneuvers had combined with sharply rising 
interest rates to produce losses equivalent to 20% of the money invested by 
various government agencies. On Friday, they visited with their major bond 
underwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to make any dire predictions," said County Administrative 
Officer Ernie Schneider, who has hired an outside investment adviser to assess 
the potential damages. "I think we're telling people the straight situation. 
We're not trying to hide it from anyone. We're just laying it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no agencies had pulled out of the fund Friday, some city officials 
with money in the portfolio say they now wish they had withdrawn earlier this 
year, when interest rates began rising and it was becoming apparent that the 
fund's bets were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 20-20 hindsight, I should have done more, but the pool looked good," said 
David Dixon, the city manager of Orange, who said he realized when he took the 
job in March that the city had too much money in the fund. He earlier pulled $7 
million of Orange's $31-million investment out of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the new guy in the county and was told not to rock the boat," Dixon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials would not be specific about the nature of their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, we look for a lack of disclosure from whoever is marketing the 
securities to a government entity or a lack of disclosure from the government 
entity to its bondholders," said commissioner Richard Roberts. "I don't know 
too much about the Orange County situation, but my current concern is that 
state and local governments are using too many volatile financial instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the county's massive use of leverage, or money borrowed 
short-term, to buy long-term bonds in a bet that interest rates would decline 
this year. As rates instead have rocketed, the fund's portfolio has tumbled in 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the county's holdings of $8.5 billion in "derivatives" -- 
investments that typically involve more complex bets on the direction of 
interest rates -- have sparked renewed criticism of the often volatile hybrid 
securities, which have caused losses for myriad other investors nationwide this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county's investment strategy produced above-average returns for 
its investors while interest rates were falling from 1990 through 1993, 
national financial experts question whether investors had a clear understanding 
of the risk that Citron was taking with their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in contact with folks who had invested in Orange County and asked 
them if they knew the risks and they'd always say, 'I don't know if it's good 
or bad, but (Citron) has always impressed me,' " said Jeff Spies, treasurer of 
St. Petersburg, Fla. "The lack of understanding had always bothered me." 
</P>
<P>
 A measure of how dire Orange County's situation has become is reflected in how 
rapidly the fund's cash holdings have dwindled in the past month. At the end of 
October, the assistant treasurer told an investor that the county had $2 
billion in liquid assets. By Friday, the cash on hand was down to $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason investors in the pool may not be too worried about its cash flow 
situation, however, is that the county is about to get a tremendous infusion of 
capital: Property tax bills are due as of Dec. 10. Homeowners are required to 
forward 50% of their taxes this month. Citron reported in September that 
full-year receipts total more than $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have insisted that even though the portfolio's paper loss now 
amounts to 20% of the funds clients have invested, there will be little, if 
any, real loss if investors stay put, allowing the fund's bonds to mature at 
full value over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a worst-case scenario, if cities, school districts and other investors 
withdraw their money, the resulting losses would hurt municipal coffers across 
Orange County and could stop road and sewer projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Orange County's experience, the incoming chairman of the Senate 
Banking Committee said he will conduct hearings on municipal finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress and the regulators have already focused attention on derivatives 
activities due to losses suffered by corporations, investment funds and 
government entities," said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.). "Today's loss will 
most certainly lead to increased scrutiny by . . . Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) said he planned to 
introduce a bill when the Legislature convenes Monday to help thwart such a 
crisis in the future. Pringle said he began crafting the legislation in June 
with the help of John Moorlach, the accountant who predicted Orange County's 
current problem but was defeated by Citron in the race for treasurer in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure will propose a series of technical changes in state law to reduce 
the risks that investment managers can take with taxpayer dollars. It also aims 
to ensure that local governments have a better idea of the true value of their 
investments and the risks they are taking. 
</P>
<P>
 The four major investors in the pool said Friday they want to review the 
independent findings of the county's investment adviser and help plan financial 
strategy for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority, the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies (which is building the state's first toll roads), the Orange County 
Sanitation Districts and the Irvine Ranch Water District have agreed to form a 
review committee. Together, they have more than $2 billion in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Citron pulled the blinds of his office and worked the phone in an 
attempt to ease the investors' fears. His second-in-command met with brokers in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 State Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) and State Sen. John Lewis 
(R-Orange) have called for Citron's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of some Orange County bonds dropped slightly Friday, about $5 per 
$1,000 face value, amid concerns that county investment losses could harm bond 
issues. But bond traders and managers of tax-exempt mutual funds said that 
virtually no Orange County bonds were offered for sale on Friday anyway, on the 
expectation that no one would buy them.  
</P>
<P>
 After the county's announcement Thursday, large mutual funds and brokers 
worked to alleviate investors' fears. Merrill Lynch, which has extended $2 
billion in credit to the county for securities purchases, held a telephone 
conference with more than 30 holders of bonds issued by the county and its 
cities to assure them that the paper is solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from two credit rating agencies -- Moody's Investors Services 
and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group -- recently met with Orange County 
officials and expressed their concerns about the county's financial stability.  
</P>

Went Wrong 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County investment fund's crisis was brought on by the same strategy 
that enhanced Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's returns in recent 
years: the use of borrowed money to bet on falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 LEVERAGE: Using loans from brokerages, the fund has borrowed a massive $12.9 
billion on top of the $7.7 billion invested by client. Virtually all of the 
money has been invested in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 RATES TURN: As interest rates have soared this year, the fund's borrowing 
costs have jumped while the value of its bonds has tumbled. That has squeezed 
the fund's earnings and caused its overall porfolio value to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 LOSSES?: So far, the fund's losses are only on paper. But if it is forced to 
sell its bonds before they mature, the losses would become real. They would 
have to be shared by the government agencies whose money the fund manages and, 
potentially, by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT'S AHEAD: The fund's challenge now is to pay off its loans as its 
investments mature. But a further rise in interest rates or demands for cash by 
its government investors could hamstring efforts to work out the problems. Fund 
Performance 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Citron's fund has dramatically outgunned similar government 
investment pools, including one managed for local agencies by the California 
Treasurer's Office. But in recent months, their results have begun to converge.

NEW U.S. POLICY TO ALLOW IN SOME CUBAN REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 10,000 Cubans detained in camps at U.S. military bases in Cuba and 
Panama will be considered for parole into the United States on humanitarian 
grounds, the Clinton Administration announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In reversing a policy against granting asylum to Cubans who fled their 
homeland on makeshift rafts last summer, the Administration has bowed to 
mounting pressure from the exile community here to end the indefinite tent city 
internment of children and their immediate families. 
</P>
<P>
 "This government has always shown it has a big heart," said Miami city manager 
Cesar Odio, who heads a coalition of Cuban American groups that has lobbied for 
the refugees' release. "And those people were never going to stay in those 
camps." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said that only children and their 
immediate relatives would be considered for parole and that all must have "full 
financial sponsorship" in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 3,000 children under the age of 17 in the camps in Panama and 
at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba's Southeast coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Meissner, who heads the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
told a Washington press conference Friday that she could not estimate the 
number of Cubans who might qualify for parole as "extraordinary hardship 
cases." She added that living in the barren tent city encampments does not 
constitute a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuban American leaders in Miami expressed confidence that all minors would 
be paroled and that, including their relatives, between 8,000 and 10,000 Cubans 
would start to arrive here within days. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement from Washington had been expected for weeks. It came after a 
meeting in the capital Thursday between Michael Skol, deputy assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, and representatives of Miami 
Cuban American groups, who offered assurance that sponsors for all the refugees 
had been lined up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will not be a burden to the taxpayers of the United States," said Odio. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more than 32,000 Cuban rafters picked up at sea and held in the detention 
camps, only about 500 have been admitted to the United States. Most of those 
are unaccompanied minors, the elderly, or persons with severe medical problems. 
All were granted humanitarian parole. 
</P>
<P>
 About 23,000 Cubans are being held at Guantanamo, while about 9,000 others are 
in Panama. Fewer than 200 have been repatriated to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Although denied automatic entry to this country since August, any Cuban who 
does enter the country will still benefit from the Cuban Adjustment Act of 
1966, which allows for permanent residency after one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of all children and their immediate families will leave about 
20,000 Cubans in the detention camps, most of them single men and women. 
Privately, most Cuban American leaders here expect that these Cubans, too, 
eventually will be permitted to come to the United States, perhaps by 
qualifying for one of 20,000 visas that the Administration has agreed to make 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 But Odio said that those who remain in the camps will have to wait. "They are 
another chapter in this long history; we have to be patient," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the goals is to see we don't have another rafters' crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 No timetable was given for bringing the Cuban children and their families to 
the United States, although Odio said that "once organized, there will be two 
to three flights a week." Most of the refugees are expected to stay in South 
Florida, although as many as 30% could be resettled in other Cuban communities 
in New Jersey, New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton slammed the door on the rafters on Aug. 19 as a way of stopping 
the chaotic exodus, most Cuban Americans in Miami supported the move as a tough 
response to Cuban President Fidel Castro. But the anguish provoked in the Cuban 
community here by the sight of relatives and fellow Cubans behind barbed wire 
quickly turned into intense pressure on the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of resettling up to 10,000 people has been estimated at $15 million. 
The Cuban American National Foundation and other groups said that they have 
pledges for as much as half that amount now. 
</P>
<P>
 If necessary, several airlines have offered special charter flights to bring 
the refugees to Miami and private schools have said that they would provide 
scholarships to emigre children to relieve pressure on the public school 
system. 
</P>

MIDDLE EAST; LEBANON'S PALESTINIAN UNREST MIRRORS INFIGHTING IN GAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY and MARILYN RASCHKA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When clashes broke out last month between Islamic militants and Palestinian 
police in the turbulent Gaza Strip, many feared the seeds of anarchy and -- 
most feared of all -- the outbreak of Palestinian civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, moved 
quickly to quell the violence and establish a shaky cease-fire with the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, or Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 But days later, Palestinian fighting erupted in this southern Lebanese port 
city, home to Lebanon's largest and most turbulent Palestinian refugee camp, 
Ein al Hilwa. It had disturbing echoes of the violence in Gaza and a message 
for those who believed that Arafat's self-rule authority would bring peace to 
the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60,000 Palestinians who call Ein al Hilwa's narrow streets and cramped 
housing home have little stake in the Palestinian Authority miles away in Gaza 
and the West Bank town of Jericho. Most have no hope of returning to their 
Palestinian villages in Israel and the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet their factions closely mirror the Palestinian groups now struggling for 
supremacy in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 And the recent violence that broke out in Lebanon against Arafat's Fatah 
loyalists and Islamic rebels opposed to the peace with Israel was a clear sign 
that Syria is prepared to exercise its muscle among Palestinians in Lebanon to 
score points in the peace process, many analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria, whose 40,000 troops in Lebanon make it the only real power broker in 
the small, war-ravaged nation, seemed to be sending a signal of its own when 
anti-Arafat rebels in Ein al Hilwa ordered Arafat's Fatah loyalists out of the 
area once and for all, diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Syria has no troops in southern Lebanon, it is Damascus that calls 
the shots with the Lebanese army forces that surrounded Ein al Hilwa; it is 
Damascus that hosts the bulk of the Palestinian opposition to Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fighting had one very prominent signature: Hafez al Assad (the Syrian 
president)," said one Middle Eastern diplomat in Egypt. "He is a very smart 
man, and he demonstrated to everyone that he still holds the Palestinian card." 
</P>
<P>
 The intra-Palestinian fighting in Lebanon coincided with a concerted media 
attack against Israel in Damascus this week as public despair over 
Syrian-Israeli peace talks heated up on the eve of an expected visit to the 
region by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes without saying that the current Israeli position will never help the 
secretary of state to achieve anything that might mend the flaw that has 
afflicted the peace process or to scatter the climate of frustration that 
shrouds the process," Al-Thawra, the Syrian government-run daily, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ein al Hilwa has been the unhappy scene of intra-Palestinian fighting for 
years, most notably between pro-Arafat Fatah loyalists and the dissident, 
violent Abu Nidal faction. But serious trouble started brewing after the 
September, 1993, signing of the peace accord between Israel and the PLO. Mounir 
Makdah, Arafat's erstwhile Fatah forces commander in Lebanon, then broke away 
-- in opposition to the accord -- and formed his own opposition force. 
</P>
<P>
 He has allied himself with the Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah, and his 
political outlook closely mirrors that of Hamas in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, there was a sense of deja vu to the clashes in Ein al Hilwa, which 
pitted Fatah loyalists against dissidents led by Makdah. Muslim fundamentalists 
from Islamic Jihad, Hamas and other Syrian-backed dissidents sided with Makdah 
in the fighting, which left 10 dead and at least 25 others wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Makdah, in an interview, said it is no wonder that Palestinians in Lebanon are 
disillusioned with the peace agreement Arafat signed with Israel. "There are 4 
million Palestinians outside Palestine. Arafat's signing left most of them 
without a solution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalty to Arafat persists, despite opposition to the peace treaty, he said, 
because of the $450,000 a month in aid the PLO dispatches to Ein al Hilwa. 
"Their stomachs support Arafat," Makdah said of Fatah loyalists.

SINGAPORE; PAY RAISE PLAN GETS A RISE OUT OF PUBLIC; SALARIES OF TOP OFFICIALS 
WILL BE LINKED TO EARNINGS OF HIGH-PAID EXECUTIVES. THE COUNTRY'S PREMIER 
ALREADY MAKES $797,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While American voters have been agonizing over which political course will 
give them the best government in the 1990s, the question posed here has taken a 
pecuniary turn: How much should an able politician be paid? 
</P>
<P>
 The debate was provoked by a government proposal to link salaries of top 
officials directly to incomes of the highest-paid executives in private 
industry. While many Singaporeans accept some form of linkage, there was shock 
at the size of the pay packages being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny Singapore, with a population of only 3 million, already pays its prime 
minister $797,000 a year, nearly four times what President Clinton earns. A top 
Cabinet minister earns $535,000 a year, compared to $148,000 for his 
counterparts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast is even more dramatic with Singapore's Asian neighbors. President 
Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines, for example, has to get by on pay of $1,036 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong appealed for public support of his 
proposal, saying the increase should be seen in the perspective of Singapore's 
recent economic success. 
</P>
<P>
 Goh said the total cost of salaries for top political appointees is $15 
million, which he described as "small beer" when compared to Singapore's 
$60-billion-a-year economy. He suggested Singaporeans weigh that "against the 
cost to you of having an incompetent and corrupt government." 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore's bureaucracy is regarded as one of the least corrupt in Asia, which 
the government attributes to its policy of paying salaries competitive with the 
private sector. Last year, all civil servants received an end-of-the-year bonus 
of 3 1/2 months' pay as a reward for the country's sterling economic 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the government's new plan, minister salaries will be set by averaging 
incomes of the four highest-paid executives in six industries: banking, 
accounting, engineering, law, manufacturing and multinational firms. In 1992, 
the average salary taken from tax returns worked out to $845,000. Ministers 
will have their salary "benchmarked" at one-third less than the private 
industry average. 
</P>
<P>
 "This figure will be a visible demonstration of the sacrifice involved in 
becoming a minister," said a government White Paper on the pay proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of Singaporeans seemed unconvinced that ministers are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Ow Chin Hock, head of the government's Feedback Unit, a kind of informal 
polling group that the government uses to gauge reaction to public issues, told 
Parliament that initial reaction to the pay proposals was "highly negative." 
</P>
<P>
 "Singapore is a small place. People know the salaries of some of the ministers 
before they entered public service," Ow said. "If their previous salaries were 
lower than what they earn now, it is very difficult to persuade these people 
that the ministers are making a financial sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring of criticism for a government policy is rare in Singapore, 
where a single party has ruled since 1959. In the last election, the ruling 
party's majority dropped to 61% of the vote, but opposition parties won only 
four of the 81 seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay debate highlights the extraordinary transformation that has taken 
place in Singapore in the last 30 years. Per capita income is now $16,000 a 
year, more than in New Zealand and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 It was left to Lee Kuan Yew, a senior minister in the government and the 
father of modern Singapore, to have the last word. He said ministers made a 
difference to Singaporeans' lives, and citizens should not begrudge them 
salaries they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was adopted by a 61-6 parliamentary vote. Goh promised that an 
independent panel will scrutinize the private sector figures and the prime 
minister's pay annually to ensure they are in line. He said the government will 
try the formula for five years before it is reviewed. How Much Is Too Much? 
</P>

 In Singapore, a controversy has erupted over just how much top officials 
should be paid. The government wants their salaries to be roughly linked to 
those paid in private industry. But critics note that such a plan would make 
leaders of this small nation among the world's best compensated.

WHAT THE METER READER SAW: GRISLY MYSTERY IN A PATIO CHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one is quite sure how long the man sat in the patio chair in his darkened 
basement. 
</P>
<P>
 When a gas meter reader finally found him Thursday, he was still comfortably 
dressed in a woolly blue and white sweater, sweat pants and slippers.Except 
that his head was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The seated, skeletal remains were so decomposed that the skull had apparently 
toppled away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities tentatively identified the body Friday as that of Long Lu Lee, 69, 
a mechanical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lee died -- and how -- remained a mystery. A woman who investigators 
believe was Lee's wife, Thuc Khoanh Lu, 62, was providing few answers, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu told police she had not seen her husband for several months. But police 
could not find a missing-person report, said Sgt. Edward Caro, a police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of an autopsy Friday were inconclusive and doctors will conduct 
more tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn Union Gas Co. had been trying, unsuccessfully, to read the meter at 
the home in the borough of Queens for more than a year, said spokesman Ed 
Yutkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a court order, a meter reader went to the home along with a city 
marshal and a locksmith. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu tried to discourage them from going into the basement, Caro said. 
</P>
<P>
 They pushed their way through a huge, sticky cobweb and found the headless 
skeleton sitting in the white plastic chair near a boiler, Caro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's wallet was found in a pants pocket, his head under the chair.

AS PEACE TALKS STALL, MIDTERM CRISIS STIRS DISCORD IN ISRAELI GOVERNMENT; 
MIDEAST: RENEWED VIOLENCE PROMPTS CALLS TO RENEGOTIATE PLO ACCORD. PRIME 
MINISTER CALLS TWO CABINET MEETINGS TO ADDRESS FRUSTRATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 The government of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is suffering through a 
midterm crisis with its push for peace with the Arabs stalling, its ministers 
bickering publicly and its prospects for reelection increasingly uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubts about the self-government agreement that Israel signed last year with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization have spread through the Cabinet and the 
leadership of the ruling Labor Party as radical terrorism has increased, and 
many are suggesting that the accord be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for peace with Syria, the key to ending the Arab-Israeli conflict, 
diminish day by day, and Rabin is now warning that the two countries have less 
than a year left before Israel heads into its next elections and thus will be 
unable to make the compromises necessary for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 With their 1992 election pledge of "peace with security" a virtual taunt now, 
Labor Party ministers are quarreling over the government's course in the peace 
negotiations, and Rabin has scheduled two full Cabinet meetings, on Sunday and 
Wednesday, to discuss Israel's next steps in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two years left before the next Knesset (parliamentary) elections, and 
if we were wrong in rushing to implement the peace moves we should say so 
without shame," Labor Party Secretary General Nissim Zvili said this week, 
acknowledging the widespread disappointment with the search for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is not ready to participate in the risks the government is ready 
to take in order to advance peace," Zvili added, saying that Rabin would now be 
guided by the desire of Labor's supporters for "stability," meaning an end to 
devastating terrorist attacks by Palestinian radicals opposed to the agreement 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "These voters gave the peace process a chance," Zvili continued, "but the 
breakthrough with the PLO is facing difficulties that the government cannot 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin himself was described in the influential newspaper Haaretz on Friday by 
political commentator Uzi Benziman as having concluded that he will have to 
abandon negotiations with the PLO and look for another way to proceed in which 
Israeli security can be assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Although primarily a result of the problems in the peace negotiations, the 
growing malaise reflects a deeper sense within the Cabinet and Labor Party as 
well as the country that, however narrow a mandate Rabin won in the 1992 
elections, he should have done more with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were the elections held this month, we would be turned out, no question about 
it," one minister said this week. "People are angry that the peace process is 
not final and complete, but rather flawed at this moment. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, we can't tell them how much better off they are now, not 
with inflation at 15%, not with bank interest rates up to 19%, not with the 
stock market down and not with the price of tomatoes so high that many families 
cannot afford what for us is virtually a staple. Unemployment is down, it's 
true, but more people are below the poverty line." 
</P>
<P>
 Nahum Barnea, the veteran political commentator of Yediot Aharonot, the 
country's biggest newspaper, argues that this is all part of the midterm crisis 
that for more than two decades has hit virtually every Israeli government about 
two years after it comes to power and as it looks two years ahead to the next 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 With the current government, however, the crisis -- more a crisis of 
confidence than anything else -- jeopardizes efforts to settle the Middle East 
conflict through peace treaties between the Jewish state and its Arab 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This midterm panic stems from the feeling that Rabin no longer navigates," 
the liberal Haaretz said in an editorial this week. "The ups and downs in the 
negotiations with Syria and the absences of a clear government position are one 
example. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeling that after a period of achievements the peace process is 
stuck. But experience shows it is wrong to examine the chances for peace on the 
basis of public opinion. The leadership's role is to give people confidence, 
not to whimper. . . . Rabin should not succumb to defeatism. Interrupting the 
peace process won't help him win the elections." 
</P>
<P>
 The blame for all this is itself bitterly debated within the government and 
Labor Party, tearing away at the cohesion that Rabin needs for the crucial 
decisions ahead in Israel's search for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 So consuming has the Cabinet's squabbling become that Haaretz commentator Yoel 
Marcus described the Rabin government as "at daggers drawn and likely to 
collapse at any moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Another political correspondent compared the infighting to a personal 
financial scandal that brought down Rabin's last government in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimon Sheves, Rabin's top aide, has angered a number of ministers with his 
blunt criticism of their performance. They, in turn, have mounted a campaign 
against Sheves, with the housing and finance ministers reportedly telling their 
staffs not to cooperate with him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest developments, Zvili denounced Sheves, accusing him of "sliding 
into personal quarrels and animosities that can only hurt Labor's cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, defending Sheves at the last Cabinet meeting on Sunday, scolded several 
ministers and reduced Labor Minister Ora Namir to tears, thus bringing the 
weekly ministerial session to an abrupt end. Hagai Meirom, a Labor Party leader 
in the Knesset, then rebuked Rabin for his "loss of self-control." 
</P>
<P>
 "The rivalry (between the ministers and Sheves) is about power, access to 
Rabin, about getting credit and about honor," Barnea wrote Friday in Yediot 
Aharonot, adding that "the relationship between Sheves and his ego is like the 
relationship between an alcoholic and the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were serious doubts about Rabin's ability to end the feuding, to 
reassert his leadership and to stay the difficult course on which he has set 
his government. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Rabin advisers described the 72-year-old prime minister as "very upset" 
by the tough problems he is facing, particularly in the peace talks, and were 
expressing doubts about how he would manage. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the week, Rabin launched an attempt to pull the government 
out of its "midlife crisis," scheduling the two Cabinet meetings, mobilizing 
his loyalists in the Labor Party's central committee and urging upon Israeli 
editors a "balanced assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are griping about nonsense," Rabin told the central committee, 
declaring that his government was not getting credit for economic improvements 
and that patience was required for the ups and downs of peacemaking. "Things 
are far better than they might seem. . . . How bad can the situation be when so 
many cars are jamming the roads? No sooner do you build new roads than they are 
jammed. Is this an indication of a low standard of living?" 
</P>
<P>
 Avraham Shohat, the finance minister, similarly urged the party to emphasize 
the government's economic achievements to counter pessimism over negotiations 
with the Palestinians and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are far better than they are made out to be," Shohat declared, "and 
there is no justification for this foul mood that is gripping us. We have every 
reason to be proud."

SURVIVOR OF SUNKEN ACHILLE LAURO CRITICIZES CREW'S ACTIONS IN RESCUE

 As the scorched Achille Lauro sank Friday into the Indian Ocean, a surviving 
passenger blamed the crew for dropping inflatable rafts on top of a crowded 
lifeboat, injuring one man who later died. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was one of two elderly passengers who died as a result of the fire 
on the Italian luxury liner.The 979 passengers and crew who survived were 
headed for three African and Middle Eastern ports aboard 10 rescue vessels. 
They abandoned the blazing ship Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Achille Lauro once sailed around the world in 80 days. But it was 
best-known for a 1985 hijacking by Palestinian terrorists, who killed an 
elderly Jewish American passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 According to passenger Geoffrey Wall, interviewed Friday by Britain's Sky TV, 
one man was injured when crew members released inflatable rafts onto the 
lifeboat, which held about 35 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall said people gave the injured man mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before a 
rescue ship arrived about four hours later. "Unfortunately, he died," Wall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear if the man died because of the injuries.

LEBANON'S PREMIER TO STEP DOWN; MIDEAST: AMID POLITICAL STANDOFFS, FRUSTRATED 
BILLIONAIRE LEADER GIVES UP.

<P>
 Lebanon's billionaire prime minister, Rafik Hariri, confirmed Friday that he 
is abandoning his massive plan for reconstruction of the war-torn nation and 
stepping down amid widespread charges of corruption and political standoffs 
that have deadlocked his government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old prime minister, who built a real estate fortune in Saudi 
Arabia, Europe and the United States and was considered by many the main hope 
for rebuilding Lebanon, stormed out of an acrimonious Cabinet meeting Thursday 
night and said he was quitting after two frustrating years as premier. 
</P>
<P>
 "God willing, Lebanon will move forward, and a bunch of gamblers and arrogant 
people will not be able to halt the course of development and reconstruction . 
. . whether we are in power or not," Hariri said Friday afternoon. "It is 
imperative that a government of institutions evolve in Lebanon, rather than a 
government of outlaws who join the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Hariri is scheduled to meet with Syrian officials this weekend in what some 
observers said could be a last-ditch move to persuade him to remain in his 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria, with its 40,000 troops in Lebanon, is the nation's major powerbroker 
and has backed Hariri since he took over the prime ministry in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 No prime minister or head of government in Lebanon can serve without the 
blessing of Damascus, and Hariri has voiced strong public and policy support 
for Syria even as he sought to rebuild the nation enough to eventually regain 
its independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis was only the most recent to have rocked Hariri's government as he 
sought to launch a 10-year, $12-billion reconstruction program to drag Lebanon 
out of the ruins of more than a decade of civil war and lure home to Beirut 
Lebanese citizens and their billions of dollars in assets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, Hariri locked himself in his residence for a full week in a power 
standoff with his partners in government. He was frustrated in his bid to 
reshuffle his Cabinet and reform the civil service administration by opposition 
from other powerful figures in the government, including President Elias Hrawi 
and National Assembly Speaker Nabih Berri. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest crisis appeared to be triggered by a standoff with labor unions and 
an array of corruption allegations that have rocked the government over the 
last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest last week of Parliament member Yahya Shamas on charges of drug 
trafficking was followed by Shamas' implicating other officials and their 
relatives, including Hrawi's son. An opposition deputy accused several 
politicians of taking kickbacks for votes or favors. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations may have been turned against Hariri himself during Thursday 
night's Cabinet session, when Housing Minister Mahmoud abu Hamdan is said to 
have alleged that Hariri would personally benefit from a $60-million real 
estate deal proposed for the historic St. Georges Hotel site on the Beirut 
seafront. 
</P>
<P>
 Hariri, with landholdings all over the world and one of the world's 100 
richest men, has frequently been charged with seeking to benefit from the 
reconstruction of downtown Beirut. He has invested millions of his own money in 
Lebanese real estate and media holdings but has separated himself from the 
company undertaking the massive downtown redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 His defenders point out that Hariri is one of the few Lebanese who is too rich 
to try to make money from his political position. 
</P>
<P>
 Also feeding the government crisis was a standoff with the labor unions, which 
rejected a 20% pay raise decreed by the government Thursday and held out for an 
80% hike to keep pace with inflation. The unions staged a one-day strike 
earlier in the week and threatened to step up their protests next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hariri's resignation, even if it is rescinded, reflects growing frustration on 
the part of many Lebanese officials with the 1989 Taif agreement that ended 
Lebanon's civil war and established the current system of government under 
which power is supposed to be shared equally by the country's Sunni Muslim, 
Shiite Muslim and Christian factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials said Hariri's resignation was triggered mainly by 
irreconcilable differences with ministers close to Berri. "How can Hariri rule 
with Berri always against him?" an unnamed Cabinet source told Reuters news 
agency. 
</P>

JAPAN OBJECTS TO ATOMIC BOMB STAMPS; WWII: ONE IN U.S. POSTAL SERIES SAYS 
ATTACKS HASTENED END OF CONFLICT. IT IS THE SECOND DISPUTE OVER UPCOMING 
ANNIVERSARY. 
</P>

 A planned American commemorative stamp, declaring that atomic bombs dropped on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki "hastened" the end of World War II, is an "affront to 
the feelings of the Japanese people," Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama declared 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must make Japan's thinking known to the United States in an appropriate 
way," the Socialist leader told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The stamp, to be issued by the U.S. Postal Service next year as one of a 
series to commemorate the 50th anniversary of World War II's end, depicts an 
atomic bomb mushroom cloud and carries a caption reading, "Atomic bombs hasten 
the war's end, August, 1945." 
</P>
<P>
 The flare-up marked the second acrimonious dispute that has erupted over the 
upcoming anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington to display the Enola Gay, 
the B-29 aircraft that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, and artifacts of the 
bomb's effects in Hiroshima and Nagasaki stirred protests from American 
veterans groups and the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 They complained that depictions of the suffering caused by the devices' use 
distorted the historical backdrop of the bombings. In the wake of the protests, 
the Smithsonian agreed to remove part of the displays showing the devastation 
caused by the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, U.S. Ambassador Walter F. Mondale warned of impending 
emotional trouble over commemorations of the end of World War II that are being 
planned in both countries. "Here we are 50 years after the war, and we still 
cannot agree on the facts of what happened," Mondale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans generally believe that the bombs -- which killed about 140,000 of 
Hiroshima's 340,000 residents and 70,000 of Nagasaki's 270,000 in 1945 -- saved 
hundreds of thousands of American troops who might have been forced to have 
staged a ground invasion of the Japanese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Japanese believe that the civilian toll and the survivors' distress 
over radiation illnesses even decades later made the attacks inhuman and 
unjustifiable.  
</P>
<P>
 Murayama made his statement after Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Kozo Igarashi and leaders of organizations of survivors of atomic 
bombs dropped in Hiroshima Aug. 6, 1945, and Nagasaki Aug. 9, 1945, all 
condemned the stamp as an attempt to justify the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is disagreeable to see such a stamp in view of the special feeling of the 
Japanese people," Kono said. 
</P>
<P>
 Igarashi noted that "more than 300,000 people (including those who died after 
1945) were killed, and even now there are those who are suffering atomic bomb 
illnesses. We want (the United States to realize) that pain exists deep in the 
hearts of the Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
 One official who tried to avoid criticizing the stamp was forced to retract 
his remark. 
</P>
<P>
 Terusuke Terada, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman, initially said the timing 
of Japan's surrender nine days after the Hiroshima bomb lent credence to the 
"way of thinking" that the bombs did hasten Japan's surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 In withdrawing his remark, Terada said only that he wanted "to avoid 
historical judgments at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the Postal Service replied to Japanese criticism of the planned 
stamp, saying a citizens' advisory committee had studied the issue carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "With regard to the specific stamp in question, we would be remiss in omitting 
such a watershed and historically critical event as the use of the atomic 
bomb," agency spokesman Robin Wright said. ". . . Our purpose is to provide a 
comprehensive history of the events of World War II, and we are not making a 
value judgment on any of those events."

TAIWAN ELECTIONS: TEST OF NATIONHOOD; ASIA: BALLOT PITS 'MAINLANDERS' AGAINST 
NATIONALISTS. SOME FEAR VOTE COULD SPUR CONFRONTATION WITH CHINA.

<P>
 Twelve times, Nationalist Party gubernatorial candidate James Soong tried to 
restart his speech before an animated crowd assembled at a soccer stadium here 
in west central Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve times, supporters of Democratic Progressive Party opponent Chen 
Ting-nan shouted him down, chanting "traitor" and "Taiwanese vote for 
Taiwanese." 
</P>
<P>
 Riot police, arranged three rows deep on the stadium floor, watched nervously 
as the political drama unfolded Monday night. What was supposed to be the 
country's first election for a national office -- provincial governor of Taiwan 
-- was evolving into a referendum on what constitutes nationhood on this 
prosperous, crowded island of 21 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Soong, 52, a Mandarin-dialect speaker born in mainland China, represents the 
longtime ruling elite of "mainlanders" driven to the island from China when 
Nationalist forces were defeated by the Communists in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen, also 52, a Taiwanese-dialect speaker born on Taiwan, stands for the 
aspirations of the island's long-oppressed majority of Taiwanese natives. 
</P>
<P>
 Their political collision at the Changhua soccer stadium demonstrated clearly 
the vitality of the emerging Taiwanese democracy. But it also revealed what 
some believe is a dangerous trend in nationalist, ethnocentric politics that 
could drive Taiwan into a confrontation with mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
 No other country in Asia has made more progress in developing democratic 
institutions in recent years than has the Republic of China on Taiwan. After 
decades of martial law and one-party rule, Taiwan since 1989 has exploded into 
a passionate political arena and role model for Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year alone, the country has gone to the polls five times, 
culminating in today's hotly contested vote for governor and mayor of the 
country's two biggest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung. Lively political rallies 
have dominated island life for weeks. A national presidential election is set 
for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, say some worried Asian specialists, is that this sudden epidemic 
of democratic debate has pushed the previously taboo subject of national 
independence to the forefront of the political scene. In Taiwan, they argue, 
democracy is becoming too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that Taiwan is responding to domestic political 
pressures that are creating strong impulses to try and muscle out greater 
political room for itself," said a senior Western diplomat in Beijing, where 
Taiwan's electoral politics are monitored in minute detail. "It is equally 
clear that a major breakthrough in that area would risk a confrontation or a 
crisis in the Taiwan Strait of unpredictable scale." 
</P>
<P>
 That is not a true picture, countered a Western observer in Taipei, where risk 
of a military confrontation is generally downplayed in the foreign community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a conservative, middle-class voting population," the observer said. 
"The last thing they want to do is rattle Beijing's cages. The last thing they 
want to do is come out for independence. These are practical people." 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of the independence debate is the principle of "one China." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1949, both the mainland Communists and ruling Nationalists on Taiwan 
have publicly maintained the fiction of "one China" that includes both the 
mainland and the prosperous little island. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a handful of old-timers, however, most people here long ago 
abandoned the dream of recapturing the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, tiny Taiwan has emerged as one of the world's great trading states, 
the world's 14th-largest economy and the biggest holder of foreign reserves, 
with more than $80 billion in its treasury. The average annual income exceeds 
$10,000 -- more than 10 times that of neighboring China. 
</P>
<P>
 Economically, at least, Taiwan had become a de facto independent state. All it 
lacked was diplomatic recognition, a national flag and a seat in international 
bodies. But as the current political campaign has shown, such issues have 
proven a powerful and irresistible tool for politicians in all camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question for Taiwan," said a Western diplomat in Beijing worried about 
the recent rise of the Taiwan independence movement, "is what it really wants. 
There are two aspects of independence. One is flags, anthems, membership in the 
U.N. and all that. The other is having complete control of your own affairs and 
maybe not having all those little symbols." 
</P>
<P>
 Even local elections are affected by the debate. All three of the country's 
three major parties have learned how to use the issue to their advantage or, 
conversely, to the detriment of their foes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the governor's race, for example, candidate Soong has been damaged by his 
party's official -- if half-hearted -- support for eventual unification with 
the Chinese mainland. Opinion polls show that most Taiwanese citizens oppose 
the idea of rejoining the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the important Taipei mayor's race, Democratic Progressive Party 
candidate Chen Shui-bian saw his 10-point lead in the polls evaporate under 
attack from an opponent, New Party candidate Jaw Shao-kang. Jaw won points by 
charging that Chen's pro-independence stance would lead Taiwan into a bloody 
military confrontation with the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasing polarization of Taiwan politics along linguistic and ethnic 
lines was evident again Friday, the eve of the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 At Taipei Municipal Stadium, 50,000 supporters of Jaw waved Republic of China 
(Taiwan) flags and yellow pennants emblazoned with the party's slogan: "In 
Chaotic Times, the Best Choice." All speeches were in the Mandarin dialect, 
official language of the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Three miles east at the China Trade Center, an even larger Democratic 
Progressive Party crowd rallied in a parking lot for their candidate, Chen. At 
this meeting, however, only the Taiwanese dialect was spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday editions of most leading Chinese-language newspapers, supporters 
of the Nationalist Party, known here as the Kuomintang, or KMT, took out 
half-page ads with apocalyptic warnings of the island's future under the 
Democratic Progressive Party: "Communist China would use military forces 
against Taiwan, bringing endless disaster upon us. . . . Companies would move 
out, there would be huge capital flight, foreign investment would dry up, the 
stock and property values would crash." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Taipei mayor's race, the New Party tactic of exploiting a common fear 
of mainland military intervention effectively shifted attention from Chen's 
popular promise to clean up Taipei, plagued by pollution and some of Asia's 
most nightmarish traffic. The attack only intensified appeals from Chen's 
supporters for Taiwan's independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the issue of independence for Taiwan dominated the political 
agenda. Used either offensively or defensively, the independence issue has 
proved to be an effective hot button for the incipient Taiwanese democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason generally cited for the popularity of President Lee Teng-hui, for 
example, is his high-profile push for a Taiwanese seat in the United Nations.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is precisely such actions, responding to democratically induced 
pressures, say critics, that may be pushing Taiwan into conflict with its big 
neighbor to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 On many occasions, including the recent meeting in Jakarta between President 
Clinton and mainland Chinese leader Jiang Zemin, China has stated that it will 
act militarily against Taiwan if the island declares independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-independence leaders here say the Chinese are posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the mainland attacks Taiwan," Hsieh Ru-an, 45, a high school sports 
instructor who was one of those in the Changhua stadium crowd, said 
confidently, "the international community will support Taiwan. As long as 
everyone supports democracy, they will all condemn China." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, including some senior U.S. officials, claim that the Chinese 
threat to invade should be taken seriously, particularly if aging, ailing 
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping dies and China becomes embroiled in a political 
succession battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worry about a power struggle in China," said Antonio Chiang, editor of a 
magazine called Journalist. "It seems that every time there is a problem, they 
ring a bell. The bell is always Taiwan."

BHOPAL ACTIVISTS REPORTEDLY DETAINED; INDIA: GOVERNMENT DENIES POLITICAL MOTIVE 
IN ARRESTS ON EVE OF TRAGEDY'S ANNIVERSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Union Carbide gas tragedy, activists 
Friday angrily accused local authorities of detaining people by the thousands 
to torpedo their plans for giant protest rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want a big crowd here," asserted Abdul Jabbar, a leader of a 
group of victims of the 1984 gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last several days, Jabbar claimed, 11,000 people were arrested here and 
at other locales across central India's Madhya Pradesh state to prevent them 
from congregating in Bhopal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another activist, a leader of impoverished and illiterate tribes people whose 
homes and livelihoods are menaced by a controversial dam under construction, 
said thousands were turned back. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were prevented from coming here because the government was afraid," the 
activist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madhya Pradesh Home Secretary Vijay Singh confirmed that some arrests had 
taken place in the eastern districts of the state, India's most vast. 
</P>
<P>
 But he denied that they were linked to the marches and demonstrations called 
to commemorate the Dec. 2-3, 1984, leak in Bhopal of deadly methyl isocyanate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a drive by the railways to check ticketless passengers," Singh 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three days, 1,500 passengers who were trying to travel for free on 
trains were pulled off and fined, said Singh, the state's highest-ranking civil 
servant charged with maintaining law and order. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question of a political motive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jabbar and other organizers of the Bhopal anniversary protests conjectured 
that the government of Chief Minister Digvijay Singh may have been frightened 
by the slaughter that followed a Nov. 23 street rally in the neighboring state 
of Maharashtra. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nagpur, where the Maharashtra state assembly was meeting, a police charge 
on a protest by poor, uneducated tribes people demanding preferential job 
quotas touched off a deadly stampede in which 114 people were trampled to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are worried about the violence problem," Jabbar said. "So they want to 
keep people away." 
</P>
<P>
 Jabbar's Bhopal Gas Affected Women's Industrial Organization has proclaimed 
the anniversary of the Union Carbide accident a national day of shame to 
protest the government's failure to prosecute those responsible and its laxity 
and slowness in compensating and aiding victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Union Carbide Corp. and India agreed in 1989 on a $470-million 
compensation payment by the U.S.-based multinational, only one Bhopal resident 
in six who claims to have suffered ill health because of the gas has had his 
case settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact death toll taken by the toxic cloud that seeped from the now-closed 
pesticide plant is disputed and extremely controversial, but Madhya Pradesh 
officials say 4,000 people perished in the accident's immediate aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tacit admission of how tardy officials have been in handing out 
compensation awards and ensuring medical care and employment to survivors, 
Madhya Pradesh's assembly on Friday reaffirmed by unanimous vote its commitment 
to faster action. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not enough for Babulal Gaur of the opposition Hindu nationalist 
Bharatiya Janata Party, the former head of the ministry created to provide 
relief and rehabilitation to gas victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaur accused the central government of indifference to the plight of the more 
than 600,000 Bhopalis who claim that their health was harmed by the poisonous 
vapor. He said every city resident should receive compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the main events in Bhopal are not supposed to occur until 
today, but a unified show of strength by several groups of protesters on Friday 
was a decidedly anemic affair. Only about 1,500 people took part from the 
Bhopal women's group, organizations representing Madhya Pradesh's tribes and 
opponents of the giant and controversial Narmada dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a brilliant afternoon sun, the marchers ended up on a traffic circle 
dominated by a garlanded statue of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal 
Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors of the Bhopal tragedy and foes of the Narmada dam sat together on 
the asphalt and chanted "Death to Union Carbide!" and slogans against the huge 
dam in neighboring Gujarat, which if completed will inundate the homes of about 
200,000 people, half of them tribal peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam is being built to harness the Narmada River, India's fifth largest, 
for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation and drinking water.

MINUS NEW BOSNIA PLAN, ALLIES PUSH OLD PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unable to agree on any new measures, five of the world's most powerful nations 
Friday fell back on a months-old plan to end the war in Bosnia that has already 
been rejected by Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 After an apparently acrimonious four-hour meeting, the foreign ministers of 
the United States, Britain, France, Russia and Germany -- known collectively as 
the Contact Group -- could agree only to reiterate the peace plan they advanced 
in July as a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum to the warring factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in July, however, there were no suggestions of punishment for any 
faction that refused to go along. After the Bosnian Serbs rejected the earlier 
plan, the Contact Group failed to carry through its threat to repeal the arms 
embargo against the under-equipped Bosnian army or to impose other sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, the five nations 
considered but rejected suggestions to increase the use of air power to try to 
force the Serbs to agree to peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we seek here is peace, not a reign of terror which would result from 
carpet bombing," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that U.S. military officials doubt that bombing would have a major 
impact on the war. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the five nations could not agree on any new provision to 
sweeten the appeal of the plan to the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev pressed for holding out the 
prospect of an eventual confederation between the Bosnian Serbs and the 
government of Serbia. But U.S. officials said Christopher "beat back" explicit 
language on the subject, agreeing only that Bosnian parties can negotiate 
"constitutional arrangements" acceptable to all. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the meeting, Russia suggested concessions to the Bosnian Serbs and 
the government of Serbia. But they were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the meeting fell short of expectations, Christopher said, "The 
combined pressure of five nations is a significant force to bring to bear." 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led Bosnian government, the Bosnian Croat faction, the government 
of Croatia and the government of Serbia have all accepted the plan, which calls 
for partition of Bosnia with a federation of the government and the Bosnian 
Croats getting 51% of the land, and 49% going to the Serbs, who now hold more 
than 70% of the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was no change in the basic proposal, the powers appeared to 
place all their hope on what they termed "a reinvigorated diplomatic effort" 
that has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Redman, once Washington's Balkan trouble-shooter and now U.S. 
ambassador to Germany, is already in Sarajevo, the capital of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, for meetings with Bosnian government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
said they will visit Belgrade on Sunday to urge Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic to exert increasing pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, the faction that 
he trained and armed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Redman was selected to go to Sarajevo because he had 
developed a good rapport with Bosnian government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In a formal communique issued after their meeting, the ministers appeared to 
dampen speculation that the 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers now deployed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina might soon be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 They called the U.N. mission one of "great importance" and added: "It should 
continue provided that the risks do not become unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 France, Britain and Russia have sizable contingents of troops in the U.N. 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev called for relaxation of economic sanctions against the government of 
Serbia to reward Milosevic for accepting the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian foreign minister predicted that gradually the world would agree to 
reward Serbia, although a U.S.-led effort rejected that step, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign ministers appeared to have few answers when asked repeatedly at a 
news conference why they believed a plan already rejected by the Bosnian Serbs 
might now somehow gain acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road will be very difficult," Christopher admitted. "But we don't see any 
other road to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Added a clearly agitated Juppe: "If we'd allowed failure to put us off, we'd 
never achieve anything. We shall keep trying and keep trying."

NEWS ANALYSIS; DISPUTE OVER EXPANSION LAYS BARE CORE DIFFERENCES WITHIN NATO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was a perfect diplomatic ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev had said his country was ready to 
agree to a long-awaited working arrangement with NATO, and he wanted a 
high-profile ceremony -- a brief formal exchange of documents in front of the 
cameras, lots of cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Thursday evening, with NATO's smiling, unsuspecting leadership right 
where he wanted it in front of the cameras, Kozyrev unleashed his trap: Instead 
of handshakes and backslaps, he declared that he could not agree to the working 
plan. NATO's decision to begin immediate preparations for eastward expansion, 
he said, had raised new problems. 
</P>
<P>
 While the blindside attack won Kozyrev points among hard-line conservatives in 
Moscow wary of alliance intentions, it was also an effective Russian strike at 
an alliance weak point -- deep divisions over the wisdom of rapid expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 What Kozyrev saw and zeroed in on was just one of a growing number of internal 
differences that have begun to strike at the heart of the 44-year-old North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, which remains the key institution linking the 
United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers that ended here late Friday may 
have managed a facade of unity, but it did little to resolve differences on 
fundamental issues, some of which could haunt the alliance for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, dispute is no stranger to NATO, an alliance of 16 free-thinking 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jimmy Carter Administration's proposal of the late 1970s to develop a 
neutron bomb that would destroy life but not property briefly drove a wedge 
through the alliance, while German resistance in the late 1980s to American 
pressure to develop a new short-range nuclear missile also cooled transatlantic 
ties briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 But today NATO is especially vulnerable to internal tension. For the first 
time, the alliance has no visible external threat to keep it together. For the 
first time, it is unsure of its own role. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial job of secretary general, whose role is to find and build 
consensus among the 16, is held by a capable diplomat, but one inexperienced in 
military affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Bosnia, alliance harmony got a hefty assist from a last-minute shift in 
Washington that brought the Clinton Administration into line with the 
Europeans' plan to offer Bosnian Serbs important concessions in return for 
agreeing to a preliminary peace formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia, not about NATO," was a refrain recited 
on cue by alliance Secretary General Willy Claes and members of nearly every 
delegation present. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the underlying divisions on how to deal with the conflict itself 
still remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments earlier this week by Sen. Bob Dole (R.-Kan.) denigrating the French 
and British for faintheartedness in Bosnia, and his pledge to push the new 
Congress for greater use of NATO air power and a lifting of the internationally 
imposed arms embargo against the Bosnian government, have also not been 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "If British and French forces die in the next couple of weeks, there will be a 
tendency in Britain and France to blame the United States for this," said 
Patrick Glynn, an expert on the Balkans at the American Enterprise Institute, a 
Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts believe that NATO's decision on eastward expansion carries more 
serious long-term implications for alliance unity. 
</P>
<P>
 While all 16 members officially welcomed the first concrete step toward 
enlargement, doubts pervade Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alliance is overextending itself" with expansion, warned Heinrich Vogel, 
director of the Institute of International and East European Studies in 
Cologne, Germany. "It's nice wording on expansion, but there's little thought 
given to it. They are releasing an additional Pandora's box." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Europeans worry that the Clinton Administration, thinking that it may be 
a one-term phenomenon, has set a target of completing the initial expansion by 
1996, a pace the Europeans see as dangerously fast. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to delay any NATO expansion beyond late 1996, when a review of the 
European Union's treaty on political and economic union is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes more time to think through the implications, the assumptions for 
this kind of a step," Vogel added. "The assumptions on NATO expansion depend on 
the potential development of Russia, and there's no agreement on that. Some see 
it as a basket case, others as a neo-imperialist power." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also concern in Europe that rapid NATO expansion could provoke 
Russia, which, as Kozyrev's performance underscored, remains deeply suspicious 
of its old enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev's hard-line stance in Brussels met with approval in Moscow, where 
lawmakers and opinion leaders have warned that expanding NATO membership to the 
former Warsaw Pact nations would have disastrous consequences for Russia's 
relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO in the last year has embraced 23 nations, mostly former Soviet-bloc 
countries, in an adjunct organization called the Partnership for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The train of European history has started off in the wrong direction, and a 
crash is unavoidable," said defense analyst Alexander A. Konovalov of Moscow's 
U.S.A. and Canada Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite NATO efforts to reassure Russia that any expansion of the alliance 
east poses no threat, Moscow will view any enlargement of NATO as an unfriendly 
act that would polarize Europe and isolate Russia behind "a new Berlin Wall," 
Konovalov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Konovalov said, "nobody can explain seriously why NATO should 
enlarge if Russia is not the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the alliance begins its preliminary work on expansion, some Western experts 
are asking the same question.

CHALLENGES MEAN NO HONEYMOON FOR ZEDILLO; MEXICO: ON FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, THE 
NEW PRESIDENT FACES NEWSPAPER PROTEST, CHIAPAS TENSIONS, CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As President Ernesto Zedillo settled into Day One of his six-year term Friday, 
an open letter appeared in an influential newspaper demanding the immediate 
dismissal of the man Zedillo had just appointed mayor of this capital city. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the newspaper's journalists had been injured, along with dozens of 
anti-government protesters, when riot police attacked a stone-throwing mob 
hours after Zedillo's inauguration Thursday. The workers union of the daily 
Jornada said in the letter that it deplores the "contradictory images" of 
"provocation and repression" at a time when Zedillo is promising a presidency 
of "tolerance, unity and transparency." 
</P>
<P>
 "Less than 24 hours after having taken power, (Mexico City) Mayor Oscar 
Espinoza Villareal broke the presidential promise of negotiation and 
tolerance," the union declared. "Therefore, we demand his immediate dismissal." 
</P>
<P>
 The swift condemnation of a police action that the government justified as 
self-defense by a riot squad that had endured nearly an hour of stoning 
illustrated the immediacy, and depth, of the challenges facing Mexico's 63rd 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of great expectations and high popularity ratings for Zedillo, there 
were other examples in the Mexican capital and countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The young criminal lawyer whom Zedillo appointed from the opposition to serve 
as his attorney general -- and point man for the creation of an independent and 
honest judiciary -- defined one of the new administration's biggest challenges. 
Antonio Lozano declared at his own swearing-in ceremony that the powerful law 
enforcement institution he is inheriting "is in a serious credibility crisis, 
which no one can hide." 
</P>
<P>
 In the embattled southern state of Chiapas, tensions continued to mount as a 
statewide network of indigenous organizations threatened massive civil 
disobedience next week if the governor-elect from Zedillo's ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party tries to take office. 
</P>
<P>
 And in isolated incidents nationwide Friday, it was clear that the violent 
street crime and narcotics trafficking that Zedillo had denounced as among the 
greatest threats to Mexico's national security appeared to continue unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in the southern state of Oaxaca reported that unidentified gunmen 
attacked a religious procession on a pilgrimage, killing three. The motive was 
unknown. In the western state of Michoacan, 15 family members opened fire on 
another family, killing five, in what police said was a feud. And in Chiapas, 
security guards for a private rancher battled militant farm workers who 
returned with arms after the guards expelled them from the land as squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 But as new, independent polls showed the new president starting off with the 
support of nearly 60% of the Mexican people, he and his Cabinet ministers also 
began the hard task of forging solutions that Zedillo, in his inaugural speech, 
had cautioned will take time. 
</P>
<P>
 After diplomatic sessions at Los Pinos presidential estate Friday with Latin 
American presidents and prime ministers, Zedillo met with Mexico's top bankers 
and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 As a study disclosed that just 61% of all students complete elementary school, 
new Education Ministry staff members began laying the groundwork for plans to 
fulfill Zedillo's promise of full secondary education for all Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 And Zedillo's new secretaries of agriculture, land reform and finance also 
started looking for ways to, as Zedillo phrased it, "break the vicious circle 
of ignorance, unemployment and poverty in which many Mexicans are trapped."

QUEBEC SEPARATIST RECOVERING FROM KILLER BACTERIA; CANADA: BOUCHARD'S BRUSH 
WITH DEATH SPARKS SPECULATION ON FUTURE OF INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a medical struggle that enthralled Canada, doctors said Friday that they 
have saved the life of Quebec separatist leader Lucien Bouchard from a 
virulent, muscle-destroying bacteria that had forced the amputation of his left 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not out of the woods, but nearly out of the woods," Dr. Patrick D'Amico 
said of Bouchard, the opposition leader in the Canadian Parliament and widely 
regarded as the country's most compelling advocate of Quebec independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The infection was described as under control and responding to antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing an 80% mortality rate from necrotizing myositis, the muscle-harming 
manifestation of the streptococcus A bacterium, D'Amico and other members of 
the medical team that worked on Bouchard called his survival "almost a 
miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 They said Bouchard, who turns 56 this month, could be out of Montreal's Saint 
Luc Hospital in three to four weeks and then would face about four months of 
physical therapy and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors said Bouchard had undergone three surgeries since Tuesday, two on 
his leg that included the amputation and another in his abdomen and chest area. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard's brush with death and expected absence from the political scene 
triggered immediate speculation about the future of the Quebec independence 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard shares leadership of the movement with Jacques Parizeau, the recently 
elected premier of Quebec. The two men were expected to reveal their strategy 
next week for winning a province-wide referendum on independence to be held 
next year. Bouchard and Parizeau were to be co-captains of the campaign in 
favor of a "yes" vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Marc Leger, a top Quebec pollster, said Bouchard remains the most popular 
politician in the province, with appeal to a broad demographic of 
French-speaking voters and to more moderate factions wary of Parizeau's intense 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 A Leger poll released Monday showed 45.7% of Quebec voters in favor of 
independence -- or sovereignty, as it is most often described here -- and 54.3% 
backing continued union with Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Nemni, a political science professor at Laval University in Quebec City 
and an expert in Quebec nationalism, said the courage and determination 
attributed to Bouchard by his doctors Friday could give a significant emotional 
boost to separatism. 
</P>
<P>
 There are parallels to the political lift that then-President Ronald Reagan 
received after he survived an assassination attempt in March, 1981, Nemni 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a certain extent (in an election campaign), images are more important than 
actions or words," Nemni said. "Sympathy is going to pour over Mr. Bouchard for 
quite some time for his bravery, etc. So I think that this will be a plus for 
the sovereigntists. . . . When you're dealing with nationalism, emotions are 
extremely important." 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran separatist strategist made a similar observation. "It's going to 
be like Rocky," the strategist said, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeremy Webber, a law professor at McGill University in Montreal who also 
analyzes Quebec politics, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that the sympathy for Mr. Bouchard would translate into a 'yes' 
vote for the referendum. It's much too serious an issue for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard was admitted to the hospital Tuesday with what was then described as 
phlebitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels in the leg. Canadians were 
stunned Thursday night by a terse announcement that Bouchard's left leg had 
been amputated and that he was in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight it leaked out from friends and associates that Bouchard was 
suffering from necrotizing myositis and that he was fighting for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters camped on the sidewalk in front of the hospital. "Canada A.M.," a 
morning television program, flew co-anchor Keith Morrison from Toronto to 
Montreal and broadcast live from the hospital entrance Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressions of sympathy crossed all political boundaries. A single yellow rose 
was left on Bouchard's desk in the House of Commons. The doctors' noon press 
conference was telecast live across Canada.

EX-CIA CHIEF TURNER TELLS OF FAILURES ON HIS WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former CIA Director Stansfield Turner stunned a conference of dozens of 
current and former agency analysts Friday with a blunt critique of the CIA's 
effectiveness -- and his own -- during his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not listed on the program, Turner stole the spotlight when he told 
the audience the agency had shortchanged President Jimmy Carter in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said the CIA "didn't do well" in foreseeing the downfall of the Shah of 
Iran or the collapse of the Soviet Union and had consistently failed to serve 
the President in its handling of its primary analytical product, the lengthy 
documents known as National Intelligence Estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 These reports were not inaccurate or misleading, Turner said, but were simply 
"irrelevant" to the President in making policy. "If anyone is to blame, it is 
I," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Gates, who served as CIA chief under President George Bush, 
disagreed sharply with Turner, saying the intelligence agency's reports on the 
Soviet Union "underpinned the entire arms control process" through the 
presidencies of both parties. "You could not negotiate with the Russians 
without the NIE," Gates said in an interview, adding the Senate would not have 
ratified arms control treaties without assurances the CIA could verify Soviet 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Turner, other critics said the agency's reports were too long, too 
biased or flat wrong. But they all welcomed the release at the conference of 
the latest batch of CIA documents from the Cold War years. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, sponsored by the CIA and Harvard University, is devoted to 
evaluating how the agency performed in its most critical role -- assessing 
Soviet weapons and plans.

SEX ABUSE CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST DAY-CARE TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Friday dropped their case against a former day-care teacher who 
served five years in prison before her conviction on charges of molesting 19 
youngsters was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 The move ended a nearly 10-year ordeal for Margaret Kelly Michaels, who was 
accused of engaging in sex games with children ages 3 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels, 32, was convicted in 1988 of 115 counts of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 An appeals court overturned her conviction. And the New Jersey Supreme Court 
later harshly criticized the "coercive and highly suggestive" methods used by 
investigators in interviewing the children. The high court's ruling said the 
evidence may be unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Superior Court Judge Joseph A. Falcone dismissed the charges at the 
request of prosecutors, who told the judge that some witnesses are now 
unavailable and that some children and parents refuse to participate in new 
legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Michaels told reporters that she was "greatly relieved 
to have this terrible nightmare over with," but she added that her reputation 
had been irreparably harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sex games were alleged to have taken place at a Maplewood, N.J., day-care 
center during the 1984-85 school year.

 An outbreak of yellow fever has killed at least 300 people, the News Agency of 
Nigeria reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The national agency said the outbreak began two weeks ago in eastern Imo 
state. State officials reportedly sent more than $1,000 to local administrators 
to buy vaccines, but doctors in the area said none had arrived, it said.

CLINTON BANS FUNDING FOR EMBRYO CREATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a highly unusual move, President Clinton injected himself into the 
scientific process Friday night by announcing that his Administration would 
prohibit the use of federal money to create human embryos solely for research 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe that federal funds should be used to support the creation of 
human embryos for research purposes," Clinton said, "and I have directed that 
NIH not allocate any resources for such research." 
</P>
<P>
 The ban applies only to the most controversial question involved in embryo 
research: Whether to allow the creation of such embryos for research purposes 
only. Notably, his action did not address the larger question of the use of 
federal money for any human embryo research, leaving the door open for possible 
government approval of wide-scale research on the thousands of already existing 
and unused embryos now in storage as a result of in-vitro fertilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, his decision -- coming on the same day that a federal advisory 
panel to the National Institutes of Health recommended permitting the creation 
of research embryos under some circumstances -- almost certainly will send a 
disturbing message to a research community that has grown increasingly troubled 
in recent years over what it views as political intrusion into the scientific 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Research on embryos has generated growing ethical concerns because it deals 
with creating and manipulating human life. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists believe that studying the human embryo, which after one week 
of growth constitutes a cluster of cells no bigger than the period at the end 
of this sentence, could yield infinite knowledge about some of nature's worst 
medical scourges, including genetic diseases, infertility and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the work has been condemned by abortion foes and others who view it as the 
destruction of human life, and have vowed to fight any efforts to conduct such 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the Clinton ruling was reminiscent of the moratorium during the 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations on research using human fetal 
tissue, which met with similar opposition. Paradoxically, Clinton lifted that 
ban with great fanfare in 1993 during his first few days in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also have been critical of the growing involvement of Congress and 
other federal officials in pursuing their own investigations into questions of 
scientific fraud and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one member of the NIH advisory panel, Patricia King, a law professor 
at Georgetown University who served as the committee's co-chair, bluntly 
dismissed Clinton's action as having more to do with "politics" than the 
"merits of embryo research." 
</P>
<P>
 The action marked the second apparent concession Clinton has made to 
conservatives since the Nov. 8 election. On Thursday, Clinton unveiled plans to 
increase defense spending, in part to head off a GOP push. 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House denied that the decision was influenced by the election 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election had nothing to do with this decision," White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Friday after the announcement. "The President 
simply believes this (funding) is not right." 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory panel, which presented its findings to NIH Director Harold E. 
Varmus earlier Friday, endorsed human embryo research generally, but proposed 
only two specific circumstances under which embryos could be created for 
research reasons: "when the research by its very nature cannot otherwise be 
validly conducted," and when a "compelling" case can be made that it is 
necessary "for the validity of a study that is potentially of outstanding 
scientific and therapeutic value." 
</P>
<P>
 Varmus was expected to study the panel's findings and decide soon whether to 
accept them. Clinton's action, in effect, circumvented that process. 
</P>
<P>
 Varmus could not be reached for comment Friday. NIH sources, however, 
indicating they were taken completely by surprise by the White House action, 
said it took several hours to sort through and understand exactly what the 
directive meant. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said they concluded that "it probably should be narrowly 
interpreted," meaning that the NIH would likely still consider "all the other 
avenues of important research" not addressed by Clinton's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, in endorsing the field of human embryo research, said it holds 
significant promise for medical advances, but proposed a strict framework for 
its conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations apply only to research conducted on human embryos that are 
created outside the uterus, that is, embryos produced in a laboratory by mixing 
sperm and egg. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said that research should be limited "to the shortest time 
possible."

GINGRICH GROUP ASKS DISMISSAL OF ELECTION PANEL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A political committee headed by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the next House 
Speaker, asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss an attempt by regulators to 
have the group declared in violation of election law. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, GOPAC, denied that it tried to solicit money for federal 
candidates in 1989, an action that could have forced it to publicly disclose 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer took the motion to dismiss under 
advisement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Election Commission filed suit to force GOPAC to pay a fine and be 
declared in violation for not registering as a political action committee. 
GOPAC, in earlier negotiations, had refused to admit a violation and to pay a 
$150,000 fine -- a figure that could be several times larger if the FEC wins 
the court case. 
</P>
<P>
 The court arguments focused on a 1989 GOPAC letter from Gingrich, then as now 
the House Republican whip and general chairman of GOPAC. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 letter asked potential donors for money to protest congressional mail 
costs in a Democratic-run Congress and gerrymandering of House districts by 
state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the letter also expressed the goal of building a House GOP majority in 
1992, an objective reached in November's elections.

MARIO SAVIO BACK IN BERKELEY, URGING OPPOSITION TO PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From a Times Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firebrand free speech activist Mario Savio, who rallied hundreds of UC 
Berkeley students during the 1960s Free Speech Movement, returned to campus 
Friday to encourage opposition to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the steps of the main administration building Savio addressed a 
crowd of more than 800 gathered to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Free 
Speech Movement.He called on the audience to practice and support civil 
disobedience if the initiative receives court approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, overwhelmingly passed by California voters in November, 
denies public health and educational services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is American know-nothing fascist," Savio said. "We need to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Find out how this law impinges directly on every class of people: on 
students, on workers, on teachers," Savio said.  
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were met with enthusiastic applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans of the Free Speech Movement, which led the university to repeal 
restrictions on political speeches, have come from around the country to 
participate in rallies, panel discussions on current political issues and in 
more lighthearted celebrations for five days ending Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg and Jack Weinberg, head of the 
Berkeley chapter of Racial Equality in 1964 and now a Greenpeace International 
official, also were among those attending.

SENATE TO VOTE ON NAMING FREEWAY FOR REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the Assembly convenes Monday to the high drama of a partisan power 
struggle, one of the first orders of business in the Senate is expected to be 
uncontested: the renaming of the Simi Valley Freeway for former President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 A Senate resolution to post the ailing ex-president's name on the 118 Freeway 
from San Fernando to Ventura County is expected to win easy approval, said 
Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the measure's main author. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's appropriate to acknowledge Ronald Reagan's contribution as a 
private citizen, as governor and as president," the Senate leader said Friday. 
"And naming a freeway after him is one of the ways that those honors get 
bestowed." 
</P>
<P>
 The action follows a brief skirmish between the California Department of 
Transportation and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who as chairman of the 
Assembly Transportation Committee said he opposes naming freeways for living 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd prefer the policy of naming freeways in honor of people who have died," 
he said. "I have nothing against Ronald Reagan, but where do you draw the 
line?" 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that Caltrans was trying to rush the freeway renaming, Katz sent a 
letter to the department Sept. 12 warning it against moving forward without 
first obtaining Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said the assemblyman's request for assurances 
amounted to "much ado about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "He voiced the concern," Drago said. "But the fact of the matter is this is 
going through the normal process anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans estimates the cost of installing signs to designate the 118 as the 
Ronald Reagan Freeway at about $4,000.

MODERN MADAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heidi Fleiss is but the newest twist on the oldest profession. The alleged 
Hollywood madam -- who is charged with five counts of pandering and one 
narcotics charge -- faces a maximum of 11 years in prison; other punishments 
have ranged from probation to prison terms to less conventional penalties. Here 
are a few recent examples: 
</P>
<P>
 NAME: Karen Wilkening ("Rolodex Madam") 
</P>
<P>
 CASE: Wilkening's arrest for running a high-priced call-girl ring set San 
Diego atwitter with talk of the identities of her male clients, contained in 
her so-called "Rolodex 500." Wilkening also testified in Dallas that Don R. 
Dixon, head of a failed savings and loan, had used thrift funds to stage lavish 
parties at his San Diego beach house. 
</P>
<P>
 VERDICT: Wilkening served two years of a 44-month sentence after pleading 
guilty in 1989 to one count of pandering and one count of obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMENT: Wilkening told reporters that her first activities after being freed 
in May, 1991, would be visits to a salad bar and the Pacific Ocean. She was 
picked up at California Rehabilitation Center at Norco by a friend in a 
limousine. They were last seen heading for the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 NAME: Elizabeth Adams ("Beverly Hills Madam") 
</P>
<P>
 CASE: Charged with using her Sunset Strip house for pandering, Adams was 
arrested after she tried to enlist an undercover policewoman in her 
prostitution ring. 
</P>
<P>
 VERDICT: After pleading guilty to one felony count of "sale of person for 
immoral purposes," Adams was put on probation in October, 1991. Police 
testified that she was a valuable informant. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMENT: Police said Adams provided "pillow talk," or crucial information, 
about murder suspects, terrorists, drug traffickers and fugitive financier 
Robert Vesco. 
</P>
<P>
 NAME: Marlene Baldwin 
</P>
<P>
 CASE: Baldwin, a San Francisco woman, was convicted of running a bordello in 
July, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 VERDICT: She was sentenced to 90 days in a convent. The order, Convent of the 
Good Shepherd, was established 300 years ago in France to help wayward women. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMENT: "It's not unlike what Hamlet said to Ophelia -- 'Get thee to a 
nunnery,' " said defense attorney Art Groza. 
</P>
<P>
 NAME: Sydney Biddle Barrows (the "Mayflower Madam") 
</P>
<P>
 CASE: Accused of running a million-dollar call-girl ring, Barrows' arrest made 
headlines in New York papers. Barrows, a descendant of two Mayflower pilgrims, 
was kicked out of the city's Social Register. 
</P>
<P>
 VERDICT: Barrows pleaded guilty in July, 1985, to a misdemeanor charge of 
promoting prostitution in New York. She paid a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMENT: When her case was over, Barrows told The Washington Post that she had 
become a madam because she didn't have a graduate degree. "With all those women 
out there with MBAs, you can't get a job for $40,000 or $50,000." NORA ZAMICHOW

GODMOTHER TO BE ARRAIGNED IN CHILD'S DEATH; VIOLENCE: WOMAN IS ACCUSED OF 
HIDING TODDLER'S BODY IN AN OTTOMAN. POLICE SAY HER STORY 'JUST DIDN'T MAKE 
SENSE.' 
</P>

<P>
 The 28-year-old guardian and godmother of a 2-year-old boy will be arraigned 
Monday on charges that she beat the toddler to death and stuffed his body into 
a living room ottoman, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rialto Police Sgt. Chris Sullivan said officers found the body Thursday after 
concluding that Betty Ann Mills' story that little Marcus Anthony Jackson had 
simply wandered off "just didn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 After arresting Mills, a counselor at a home for boys in Yucaipa, officers 
also arrested her roommate, Kimberly Ann Cole. Cole, 35, will be arraigned 
Monday on charges that she was an accessory to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the tidy San Bernardino County neighborhood where the crime took 
place expressed shock and disbelief Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Monday, the Mills lady came up to me and said, 'Have you seen my little 
boy? I have reported to police that he is missing,' " Daniel Zamorano, a 
neighbor, said. "I thought she was sincere." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said the suspects seemed 
like "such nice ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame," said Gilbert Perez, a friend of the dead child's father. "That 
little boy was adorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said that because the child's father was a transient and his mother 
"was between houses and felt she could not care for him," legal custody of the 
boy had been awarded to Mills. Neighbors said the boy and his 8-year-old half 
brother had been living with Mills and Cole for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old's father, Bobby Jackson, who is separated from the child's 
mother, Marcella Jackson, said they had chosen Mills and Cole to care for the 
children because they all were "good friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Jackson said that even though he once caught Mills using illegal drugs, 
he "paid it no attention. I mean, I was living in her house, and she was nice 
to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The father said that later, however, he found his son in dirty diapers and 
with cuts on his neck. Jackson said that when he argued with Mills about her 
treatment of the child, she called police and he was ordered to leave the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he pleaded with his wife "to get the kids out of there," but to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcella Jackson would not comment on how her son came to be in Mills' 
custody. She refused to answer any questions and would only say that Mills 
"pretended in front of us real good. We never thought she would do this to 
Marcus." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe that Mills beat the child to death about a week ago, 
crammed his body into a plastic bag and stuffed it through a tear in the bottom 
of the upholstered ottoman. The tear was sealed with duct tape, detectives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Sullivan said, Mills called police and reported the child missing. 
To her surprise, he said, she and Cole were arrested on suspicion of child 
endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were inconsistencies in their stories," he said. "The boy was supposed 
to have wandered off, but the door had a deadbolt that locked from the inside, 
and the boy couldn't have unlocked that. (Mills) kept saying that he wasn't in 
the house. We finally realized that is where he had to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a search warrant, officers returned to the home, where they found 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he believes Mills and Cole hid the body in the ottoman because 
they did not expect to be arrested when they reported the child missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they felt that after cursory checks, we would leave and they'd have a 
chance to dispose of him," the sergeant said.

USAIR ADDS PRECAUTIONS TO ENSURE THEIR JETLINERS HAVE ENOUGH FUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USAir is adding two steps to its preflight refueling procedures after reports 
that nine of its planes had left airport gates with insufficient fuel aboard, a 
company spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline is now instructing its gate agents to orally confer with the 
cockpit crew on how much fuel is aboard before the flight is turned over to the 
flight crew and the plane's door is shut, said spokesman Richard Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Weintraub said, the pilot or first officer will confirm the 
amount of fuel in pounds as the final step while the plane is on the tarmac 
before it pulls onto the runway for takeoff, Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two new checks are being added to two already existing checkoffs made by 
USAir flight crews. "This is just a redundancy, frankly, to assure those in the 
public who might have any lingering doubts about the integrity of the fuel 
checks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, the New York Times reported that nine USAir flights had left 
their gates with insufficient fuel aboard during a 16-month period and one had 
to make an emergency landing.

WHITE HOUSE MISJUDGED THE COST OF WELFARE REFORM, ANALYSTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congressional budget experts say the White House underestimated the price of 
its original welfare reform plan by miscalculating demand for child care from 
single mothers who would be required to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office said the White House also overstated the 
savings it expected to wring from several federal programs to finance its 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration has not decided whether to push its welfare plan 
when Republicans take over Congress, Friday's study is significant because it 
documents the high price of changing the welfare system to encourage work. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House estimated the cost of its plan, which would push increasing 
numbers of women into work and training programs, at $9.3 billion over five 
years. The CBO put the cost at $11.8 billion and said much of the difference 
was due to higher child-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget office also said that the Administration could expect to save only 
$6.9 billion -- not the $9.3 billion it expected -- through a variety of 
spending cuts, including restrictions on aid to immigrants, drug addicts and 
wealthy farmers.

HILL GETS 2 LIFE TERMS FOR CLINIC SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former minister Paul Hill on Friday received the maximum sentence of two life 
terms in prison for violating the new federal clinic-protection law in the 
shotgun slayings of an abortion doctor and his bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, a judge will decide whether Hill should get the electric chair on 
state murder charges in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, of Pensacola, is the first person prosecuted under the federal law 
against using violence or otherwise interfering with those entering abortion 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The life-without-parole sentences will run concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a former Presbyterian minister, killed Dr. John Bayard Britton, 69, and 
his volunteer bodyguard, retired Air Force Lt. Col. James Barrett, 74. 
Barrett's wife, 69-year-old June Barrett, was wounded in the attack July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill asked U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson to view a videotape of an 
ultrasound taken of a woman's body during an abortion, which Hill said would 
illustrate his motivation for the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinson responded that he was not sure that would be relevant to the sentence, 
but encouraged Hill to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rationale, your honor, is simply I was trying to prevent Dr. Britton from 
killing the 30 people he was going to kill that day," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinson said he did not doubt Hill's sincerity about believing he had a higher 
motive, but added: "God does not look with favor on the taking of any human 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who was wearing a faded green jail jumpsuit, blue slippers and ankle 
shackles, seemed calm throughout the proceedings, which lasted just under one 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill also received 10 years under the new law for shooting June Barrett and 
five years for a weapons violation. He was ordered to pay June Barrett $480 for 
medical expenses and counseling and $1,815 for her husband's funeral expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The state jury that convicted Hill a month ago recommended the death penalty, 
but Circuit Judge Frank Bell is not bound by the recommendation at sentencing 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said he has no plans to appeal either sentence and hopes his death will 
inspire "faithful men to take up arms in defense of the unborn." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the more apparent an injustice is, the more likely 
people are going to be to rise up to stop that injustice," Hill said in a 
telephone interview with Reuters from the Escambia County jail. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes that it might motivate others to follow him if he is sent 
to death in the electric chair. "There's a real possibility it could be a 
partially motivating factor to do as I have done."

A SENSE OF BETRAYAL; FEDERAL DECISION CHILLS SALVADORAN REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came as waves of refugees fleeing warfare, most anticipating a short stay 
until the violence subsided. But eventually, the vast majority settled down and 
adapted to life in the United States, abandoning hopes of ever moving back to 
their ravaged homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, though, as word spread that the Clinton Administration had decided 
to end a special status accorded to tens of thousands of expatriate El 
Salvadorans, the prospect of a forced return became alarmingly real, despite 
official assurances to the contrary. A sense of confusion and betrayal was 
evident in the Pico-Union/Westlake barrio that is Los Angeles' bustling Central 
American heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going back now is difficult to contemplate," said Martin Granados, father of 
nine children, six born in El Salvador and three born here. "Life for our 
family is in this country now. I work here, my children are learning English. . 
. . We'll try to do everything we can to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 With an uneasy peace prevailing in El Salvador -- and with a U.S. public 
apparently opposed to offering special treatment to immigrants -- the Clinton 
Administration concluded Friday that it was time to end the Salvadorans' 
"Deferred Enforced Departure" protection, the latest incarnation of a program 
that had allowed many Salvadorans to remain in the United States legally since 
1991. As a result, 90,000 to 187,000 Salvadorans -- authorities could provide 
no more precise estimate -- will find their legal status terminated Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty among expatriates is most intense in Greater Los Angeles, home to 
the nation's largest Salvadoran community, numbering perhaps 500,000. Many now 
fear forced repatriations -- though experts say that is extremely unlikely and 
officials went out of their way Friday to allay such concerns, stressing the 
gradual nature of any change. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no immediate, large-scale deportations," Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner told a Washington news 
conference Friday. "We don't expect anything to happen abruptly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, while allowing Salvadorans' status to lapse Dec. 31, the 
Administration also agreed to extend work permits of affected Salvadorans for 
nine months. That provides a cushion until Sept. 30 for those currently 
possessing working papers. And other legal protections are likely to extend for 
years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 In the already tense, post-Proposition 187 climate of California, however, 
Salvadorans who learned to be wary of officialdom back home were not dismissing 
the possibility that there one day could be large-scale roundups and 
deportations. Most arrived here as illegal immigrants by crossing the 
U.S.-Mexico border, many after leaving their homeland under threat and dodging 
police and immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, few relish the prospect of reverting to the shadow life of the 
undocumented, particularly with the increasing difficulty of finding work 
without papers. But even fewer seem willing to return to a nation still reeling 
economically, socially and politically from the aftereffects of a long civil 
war that many believe was prolonged by massive U.S. aid to the Salvadoran 
government -- assistance prompted by Cold War geopolitical concerns that seem 
distant today. 
</P>
<P>
 "What future would I have now in El Salvador?" asked Cristina Melendez, a 
mother of two who stopped by Friday at the offices of El Rescate, the Central 
American social service organization in Pico-Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Melendez has two U.S.-born children, a 2-year-old son and a 1-year-old 
daughter, and has no intention of ever taking them to El Salvador. "I don't 
want my children to suffer as I did," said Melendez, 23, who works at a 
Fullerton paper products factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Less certain about what she would do was Maria Navarrete, also a mother of two 
young children, who said she would consider going back if she did not succeed 
in having her working papers extended beyond next September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll return if I have to, if there's no other alternative," said Navarrete, a 
single mother who earns $6 an hour as a machine operator. "But it would be a 
much more difficult life for my children." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Salvadorans in the United States, experts say, will probably file 
political asylum claims, applications that can drag on for years. With time, 
Salvadorans who fled to Los Angeles, Houston, Washington and other centers 
during the 1980s -- when one-fifth or more of the Central American nation's 
people are believed to have left -- have become less of a refugee population 
seeking to return home than an established immigrant community unwilling to go 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many, like the Granados family of Los Angeles, sold their properties back home 
and sent for their families, often paying so-called coyotes thousands of 
dollars to smuggle children and spouses on the perilous journey through Mexico 
and across the U.S. border. The Granadoses' nine children are together with 
their parents now, and the father -- a former farmer who now toils in a carpet 
factory -- says he doesn't have a clue as to where they would even live in 
today's El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 The same uncertainty exists among refugees' relatives in El Salvador, where 
annual remittances from expatriates in the United States and elsewhere are 
thought to top $1 billion, propping up the nation's sagging economy. Salvadoran 
officials acknowledge being ill-prepared to cope with the return of huge 
numbers of expatriates. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, who discussed the issue with Vice 
President Al Gore in Mexico City, said he received assurances that there will 
be no massive deportations. "And we must be clear about that because many 
Salvadorans, here and in the United States, were full of anxiety and 
uncertainty," the president said after returning to San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Dec. 31 deadline, hard-won legal protections will continue to 
shield affected Salvadorans. 
</P>
<P>
 All those whose status expires later this month are eligible for special 
consideration when filing asylum claims under the terms of the 1990 settlement 
of a landmark court case alleging that U.S. officials discriminated against 
asylum-seekers from U.S.-supported regimes in El Salvador and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, social service organizations working with Salvadorans and other 
immigrants are gearing up for a deluge of new asylum applications from those 
whose status is due to lapse. While it is difficult to win political asylum 
under U.S. law -- fewer than one in 10 Salvadorans were granted asylum even 
while the civil war was raging -- activists say it is crucial that Salvadorans 
file in order to prolong the process and possibly gain permanent residence 
status at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're trying to win time," said Juan Carlos Cristales, who is 
coordinating asylum applications at El Rescate, taking statements from scores 
of applicants about their fears of returning home. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, many in the asylum pipeline may be able to win "suspension" of 
deportation. That is granted to some illegal immigrants who have been in the 
United States at least seven years, have shown good moral character and can 
demonstrate considerable hardship if returned to their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Central American Resource Center, the other major Pico-Union social 
service outlet, leaders urged Salvadorans on Friday not to panic but to file 
expeditiously for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed today, but we still have a space to look in the future for 
a long-term solution," said Roberto Lovato, the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Tracy Wilkinson in El Salvador and Robert Jackson in 
Washington contributed to this report.

NEW CONTRACT MAY SPICE UP LAX FOOD; TRAVEL: AIRPORT PANEL IS EXPECTED TO 
APPROVE TRANSFER OF SOME DINING SERVICES TO SUCH OPERATORS AS WOLFGANG PUCK AND 
MCDONALD'S. DISNEY WOULD HELP WITH DESIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-four years of culinary hegemony is expected to end soon at Los Angeles 
International Airport, as officials plan to transfer restaurant operations from 
a single concessionaire to an eclectic mix of operators headlined by Wolfgang 
Puck, McDonald's and the Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposed innovations is the transformation of the airport's landmark 
Theme Building into a "Space Age cafe," of Disney design which would offer food 
created by some of the city's finest restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 If an evaluation panel's recommendations are approved Tuesday by the Airport 
Commission, about 40% of the food service at the airport will be taken from 
long-time operator Host International Inc. and placed in the hands of seven 
restaurants or partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are so sure that the commission will approve the proposal that 
they have already scheduled a news conference, before the vote, to introduce 
the partners in the food plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The gastronomic revolution for the airport's 46 million annual passengers is 
supposed to be completed in early 1996, with some outlets opening sooner. 
Previous timelines for the project, however, have proved overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's appointees on the Airport Commission have pledged to 
make the nation's fourth-busiest passenger airport more accommodating to 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said they want to maximize profits and would not institute a price 
limit on food, as the airport staff had proposed. John Wayne Airport in Orange 
County and other airports have such price controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riordan team projects that, once all new leases for the airport's 
restaurants and bars are final, the minimum annual rent should at least double, 
to $10 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-month search focused on adding pizazz to airport fare that has been 
dominated by boxed sandwiches, vending machine pizzas and steamed hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of airport employees and commissioners sought proposals with a 
distinctly Southern California flair and those that reflected Los Angeles' 
cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most unusual proposal, though, is the L.A. Encounter Restaurant, which 
would extend the Theme Building's spaceship design to its interior, complete 
with waiters in space garb, interactive displays, holograms and other high-tech 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Imagineering would design the restaurant; the food operation would be 
in the hands of CA One Services, which has food operations at 37 other 
airports. The food service firm, in turn, would contract with some of the 
city's best-known restaurants to provide their signature creations for the 
"L.A. Encounter" menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theme Building's perennial problem in attracting visitors to its isolated 
location would be attacked by shuttling patrons to and from the restaurant in a 
space probe-style van, perhaps with a driver wearing a space alien costume. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Encounter" would provide a "campy and fun" greeting for visitors and a 
destination even for locals who would not otherwise be at the airport, 
predicted lawyer Lisa Specht, who is helping to put the deal together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's phenomenal. It's the kind of thing you look at and say 'Wow!' " said 
Airport Commission President Ted Stein, who has guided the remaking of the food 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the airport, the Daily Grill chain would bring its menu of 
American fare to a soon-to-be-expanded mezzanine in the Tom Bradley 
International Terminal. The restaurant would seat 283. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half of the international mezzanine would be devoted to foreign 
foods -- Mexican, Japanese and Chinese. Elsewhere in the terminal, the 
Chatsworth-based Rhino Chasers micro-brewery would expand into the bar 
business, offering obscure beer brands in surfing safari surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Puck would expand his Wolfgang Puck's Express concept, now at a handful of 
locations, at Terminal 2. The restaurant would serve gourmet pizzas and salads 
in the mode of Spago, one of the celebrity chef's signature restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for five McDonald's outlets and for new coffee and Haagen 
Dazs ice cream shops. The striking success of a Starbuck's coffee outlet in 
Terminal 5 has triggered plans for even more designer coffee businesses -- 
possibly including coffee pushcarts in all terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 A general operator remains to be chosen for most of the remaining restaurant 
and bar space at the airport. Host International is a candidate to operate 
those 23 facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 What would be done with the projected new earnings at the airport remains in 
doubt. Riordan continues to hold on to his hope that airport revenue can be 
diverted to the city's general fund, perhaps to help hire more police officers. 
But so far, federal law has prohibited transfer of airport revenue to 
activities outside of the airport.

BLACK FIREFIGHTERS CALL FOR REFORMS; LABOR: GROUP SAYS DEPARTMENT IS PLAGUED BY 
RACISM, URGES MAYOR TO APPOINT A BLACK COMMISSIONER. 
</P>

 Charging that the Los Angeles City Fire Department is plagued by racism and 
discrimination, the organization representing African American firefighters 
called Friday for the mayor to appoint a black fire commissioner and for 
department officials to implement reforms in the 3,100-member force. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Fire Department) remains for a vast majority of our members a very 
hostile, closed organization where systems, safeguards and procedures have been 
put in place and which serve to perpetuate a sexist and racist environment," 
said Capt. Kwame Cooper, director of the 225-member Los Angeles Stentorians. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by more than 50 firefighters and supporters, Cooper spoke at a news 
conference called to voice support for the findings in a controversial city 
audit released last month. The scathing study concluded that white males 
dominate top posts and that women and minorities have been harassed and given 
unfair evaluations by supervisors, all in an effort to run them off the force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, the daily reality and struggle and discrimination which exists in 
this department has been documented as a widespread problem," Cooper said, 
standing in front of an old stucco building south of Downtown that once was one 
of two all-black firehouses before the department was integrated in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 The group pledged to work with the Fire Department but threatened legal action 
if progress is not made. 
</P>
<P>
 The harsh criticism by the Stentorians adds to the growing controversy 
engulfing the department. The City Council's Personnel Committee plans to 
investigate the force and has scheduled two hearings this month, which are 
certain to generate more heat on the department and its chief, Donald O. 
Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning has dismissed the Personnel Department's audit as a "hatchet job" 
based on unscientific methodology and the grumblings of a few anonymous 
firefighters and embittered former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Dean E. Cathey, a department spokesman, denied Friday that 
racism and discrimination are a widespread problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 3,100 firefighters, it would be unrealistic to assume that everyone is 
going to get along," Cathey said. "But (it) is a far stretch to say that this 
department is plagued by racism and sexism." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the department has done more to ensure a harassment-free workplace 
than any other agency in the city. Cathey added that the department is well on 
its way toward implementing reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of that effort is a $2-million proposal by Manning to create a 
17-person human resources bureau that would have recruiting teams, affirmative 
action officers and officials who would mentor women and minorities to help 
improve their promotion rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A department task force working to develop that proposal includes members of 
the Stentorians, Cathey noted, as well as women, Latinos and representatives of 
the 3,000-member firefighters union. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force was lauded Friday by Fire Commission President Elizabeth Lowe 
as a big step in the right direction. "I feel confident that this team will 
produce a plan to satisfy all the issues that have been raised," Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, civil rights attorney Melanie E. Lomax, the 
Stentorian's legal adviser, called on Mayor Richard Riordan to fill an upcoming 
vacancy on the Fire Commission with an African American. When Riordan took 
office last year, Lomax said, he replaced the five-member board, leaving it 
without a black representative for the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riordan spokeswoman said Friday that the mayor would select a new 
commissioner based on qualifications, not race or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomax, pointing to the audit's findings, said there was a clear pattern of 
harassment and discrimination in the Fire Department's promotions process. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit said the department has made significant gains in its entry-level 
hiring, but it found that white males make up 95% of the top 20 officials. 
"Ninety-five percent white male speaks for itself," Lomax said.

U.S. JUDGE REFUSES TO INTERVENE FOR SIMPSON LAWYER; COURT: SHARPLY WORDED 
RULING LAMBASTES BOTH DNA EXPERT AND JUDGE ITO. SCHEDULING CONFLICT WITH A NEW 
YORK CASE MAY FORCE POSTPONEMENT OF KEY HEARING IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Throwing yet another wrench into the timing of the O.J. Simpson murder trial, 
a federal judge on Friday declined to intervene in a squabble between two 
jurists by refusing to overturn an order that requires one of Simpson's lawyers 
to begin a New York trial next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sharply worded ruling, U.S. District Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy accused 
lawyers Peter J. Neufeld, a DNA expert, of putting off work for his New York 
client once he was presented with the more glamorous Simpson case. Duffy also 
had harsh words for Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, who ordered Neufeld to 
appear for a hearing on DNA evidence in the Simpson case but whose order Duffy 
said did not appear to be drafted with "full knowledge of all the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simpson's lawyers said they would continue to contest the requirement 
that Neufeld appear in the New York case, at least for now the decision 
threatens to force a long postponement of a DNA hearing scheduled to begin Dec. 
12. Simpson's attorneys have said they cannot go forward with the DNA hearing 
without Neufeld, and the New York case could last more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Other matters could be addressed during the interim, but any long postponement 
of the DNA hearing would push back opening statements as well. That would 
conflict with Simpson's oft-repeated desire to get his trial under way as soon 
as possible and increase the hardship on jurors, who are being required to 
avoid most news media while they await the beginning of their duties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is charged with killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman, but he has pleaded not guilty and has vigorously declared his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict over Neufeld's responsibilities began Monday, when New York 
Supreme Court Judge Harold J. Rothwax ordered the lawyer to be ready for trial 
next week in a case in which he represents Pedro Gil, a man accused of killing 
a New York police officer. After a shouting match between Neufeld and the 
judge, Rothwax warned the attorney that he would be jailed if he failed to 
appear as ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys then complained to Judge Ito, who issued an order of his 
own, demanding that Neufeld appear in Los Angeles on Dec. 12 for the scheduled 
start of a much-anticipated hearing on the admissibility of DNA test results in 
the Simpson case. That order set up a conflict between the two judges, but 
Rothwax refused to yield, instead charging that Ito was interfering in his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the threat that Neufeld could be jailed if he failed to appear for 
the New York case, his attorneys filed a request for a restraining order 
Friday. They argued that Simpson's right to effective assistance of counsel 
would be infringed if Neufeld is not allowed to travel to California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief, veteran civil rights lawyer William Kunstler wrote that if 
Neufeld were forced to obey Rothwax's order, Simpson would "be denied the 
indispensable services of Mr. Neufeld in the forensic hearings commencing on 
Dec. 12, 1994, the outcome of which is crucial to his defense of the extremely 
serious charges pending against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler filed that brief Friday, but it was denied within hours as Duffy, in 
New York, issued a wry, three-page order that took aim at a number of the 
participants in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy noted that defendants are entitled to competent lawyers but not 
necessarily to a particular lawyer of their choice. As a result, he said, he 
could not find that Simpson would be stripped of effective counsel by Neufeld's 
absence unless he was prepared to rule that the rest of Simpson's small army of 
highly regarded attorneys was incapable of representing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Simpson to have standing to raise any issue as to 'due process' in this 
court would necessitate a finding that Robert L. Shapiro Esq. of the California 
Bar and his entire defense team . . . are incompetent -- a finding I am 
unwilling to make, at least at this time," Duffy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In his order, Duffy also blasted Neufeld, suggesting that the lawyer was 
forgoing his responsibilities to his New York client in order to pursue the 
higher-profile Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Neufeld's position in the Gil case is no different than that of any other 
lawyer who undertakes the defense of a criminal case and then finds a more 
interesting and lucrative matter presented," said Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Ito's handling of the matter, Duffy added: "I cannot believe that Judge 
Ito's order was issued with full knowledge of all the facts. It is hard for me 
to believe that Judge Ito would hold that there are no California lawyers 
capable or competent to understand, present or refute scientific evidence, 
including DNA evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts were generally unsurprised that Duffy declined to act in the 
case. Jonathan Varat, a UCLA law professor, said federal courts are not allowed 
to intervene in pending state court matters except in extraordinary 
circumstances. Conflicts such as the one that has arisen between Ito and 
Rothwax generally are resolved informally, but so far neither jurist has been 
willing to yield. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler, the latest legal luminary to sign up with the Simpson team, said he 
would return to an appellate court in New York next week to continue fighting 
Rothwax's order. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep it up," Kunstler said. "My office never gives up." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Shapiro said he wants to take the weekend to consider the 
defense team's options if Neufeld is not available for several weeks. Ito said 
he would take the matter up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the battle over Neufeld flared on both coasts, the judge and lawyers in the 
Simpson case continued to plod ahead with jury selection, netting three more 
possible alternate jurors by the end of Friday's session. That brings the total 
number of prospective alternates to 41, just five short of the number Ito hopes 
to have when the attorneys begin exercising peremptory challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the candidates cleared for possible service Friday was a 39-year-old 
postal employee who called himself a "regular guy" and who at first expressed 
some confusion about the legal standard that requires prosecutors to prove a 
defendant's guilt but does not require a defendant to prove his innocence. That 
issue has proved a stumbling block for many of the prospective panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Ito and Simpson attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. explained the 
concept to the man Friday, he said he understood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's presumed to be innocent," Cochran said. "You have any problem with 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem at all," the man said, pledging to weigh the evidence in the case 
impartially and to disregard the bits and pieces he had picked up from the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other jury candidates cleared questioning Friday. One is a 27-year-old 
travel clerk and student who expressed misgivings about having to miss some 
classes. But that woman said she could rearrange her schedule, and she was 
asked to return next week for consideration as an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a 53-year-old South-Central woman was allowed to remain on the panel 
after saying she had only limited exposure to the case, in part because she 
favors television soap operas over newspapers. The alternate jury candidates 
are to return Wednesday.

CITYSCAPES / JAMES RAINEY: WHEN THE DOWNTOWN RENTAL MARKET TURNED SOUR, SO DID 
PLANS FOR L.A.'S NEW WELCOME MAT TO THE WORLD.; DREAMS OF A CIVIC CENTERPIECE 
FALL HARD ON VACANT LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A civic center can often mirror a city's soul, reflecting its present fortunes 
and its highest aspirations.  
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, you step outside City Hall and see the ornate old War 
Memorial Opera House, the Museum of Modern Art and shining Davies Hall, a 
glass-walled cathedral to the arts. The concert hall fairly glows with 
sophistication and urbanity -- a vision of all San Francisco's best feelings 
about itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, you step outside City Hall and see government offices, the 
high-rises of Bunker Hill and one notably vacant lot, strewn with brush, piles 
of concrete rubble and mismatched trees. The empty parcel, surrounded by a 
sagging cyclone fence, rubs like a burr in a city already chafing with 
self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been nearly 20 years since the property at 1st Street and Broadway was 
laid bare -- stripped of the old state office building that had been deemed 
unsafe after the Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the last, best plan for refurbishing the land is in danger of falling by 
the wayside and the city is without a suitable welcome mat at its own front 
door.  
</P>
<P>
 The government officials who oversee the property are threatening to cut off a 
seven-year agreement with developer Raffi Cohen, who has failed to carry out a 
plan to build twin office towers, fronted by an expansive plaza, shopping 
arcade, fountain and trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was the deadline for Cohen to start the project or relinquish his 
option to develop the land, which is owned jointly by the state, county and 
city. Until the last minute -- and even after it passed -- Cohen was scrambling 
to modify his lease agreement, trying to buy time so that his dream development 
could go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 A backhoe and a tractor rumbled over the property in the waning days of 
Cohen's lease -- turning the old steps of the state building to rubble. 
Underground, crews began to tear asbestos out of the long-closed parking 
garage.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who have followed the property's fortunes for years said the hurried 
groundbreaking was a desperate attempt by Cohen to preserve his development 
rights. But a construction manager said that the eleventh-hour demolition was a 
sincere attempt to begin the project that is to be called First Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen won't talk about it. County officials who manage the property are also 
close-mouthed, although they are expected to decide its fate as early as next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In its time, the plan for 1st and Broadway had offered Los Angeles as much 
flash as cash. Architectural critics praised the verve of its design -- twin 
office towers shouldering a glass pyramidal "head" and a wide plaza dotted with 
kiosks offering food and drink. Government money managers salivated at the 
prospect of $2.5 billion in rent that they were to collect over 66 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plans were dependent on finding tenants to fill 600,000 square feet of 
offices and, when the Downtown rental market turned sour, so did plans for 
L.A.'s new welcome mat to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 One partner backed out of the deal not long after it was set. Then Cohen 
defaulted on the $125,000 monthly rent he paid to control the property. 
Construction schedules were set back. Now, with tenants still lacking, Cohen's 
current partner, Melvin Simon, reportedly wants out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen has already poured $5.5 million in rent into the property and he owes 
about $1 million more, plus other expenses. All he will have to show for that 
investment, if his lease is not extended, is about $3.5 million he has 
collected from an adjacent parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides an extended lease, Cohen wants permission to begin construction of the 
plaza and a subterranean parking structure while postponing the office 
construction, said Dan Rosenfeld, who manages the state of California's 
properties. "A plaza in front of City Hall is worth something, but how long can 
we give him a hunting license for something else that might not be there?" 
Rosenfeld asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Something must be done, he said, or the empty lot will remain "like a gaping 
hole where a tooth has been ripped away." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan calls it ugly and says that the end of the Cohen deal 
might open the door for a new arrangement to create "a broad open plaza with 
huge trees." He holds out high hopes for the old city core, noting that the 
Union Rescue Mission is moving out, that the dilapidated police headquarters 
will probably be rebuilt, and that as many as 5,000 state workers are scheduled 
to move into new offices Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Pregerson, a U.S. Court of Appeals judge and a lifelong Los Angeles 
resident, said he cringes every time he passes 1st and Broadway. He has quietly 
tried to promote the opening of a center for cultural understanding, a place 
where ethnic, racial and religious groups could come together. Pregerson would 
like the center named for "two models of tolerance" -- Rodney G. King and 
Reginald O. Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now there is just the old, graffiti-marked concrete bunker that was 
once the foundation of the state office building, and an abandoned gas pump. 
</P>
<P>
 The rusted chain-link fence surrounds a graveyard of old political placards. 
Through the years, the only semblance of progress was the addition -- after 
each election -- of a new list of politicians to the billboards that loomed 
over the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Now even the billboards have been knocked down. What will happen next, nobody 
is quite sure.

WATER DISTRICTS TAKE 40 RARE TROUT FOR STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of biologists hired by water districts caught 40 rare steelhead trout 
in Santa Paula and Matilija creeks this week as part of a last-minute study to 
influence whether the oceangoing fish will soon be protected as an endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an electric fishing rig similar to a stun gun, the biologists also 
captured a bucketful of steelhead in the Ventura River. But these fish were not 
killed. Instead researchers clipped a portion of a fin on each fish for genetic 
analysis and then let them go. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, environmental activists have protested the capture of steelhead in 
Ventura County streams and dozens of fish farther north, contending that the 
research duplicates earlier efforts and is pushing the species closer to 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly has the potential of studying these fish to death," said Jim 
Edmondson, executive director of California Trout Inc. "How many fish do we 
need to kill before we answer the question if this species qualifies as 
endangered?" 
</P>
<P>
 Federal researchers are doing their own study on the fish, aimed at 
determining whether the Southern California steelhead is a genetically distinct 
species that needs protection under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Water suppliers maintain they want only to help the federal government make 
the right decision, particularly because steps to protect an endangered species 
could limit how much water they can siphon from streams and rivers to supply 
cities and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motive here really is to make sure that any decision is based on the best 
scientific data available," said Jennifer Persike-Becker, a spokeswoman for the 
Assn. of California Water Agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to protect species, but we also want to protect water supplies in 
California," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute study, dubbed Operation Steelhead, initially spawned a series 
of skirmishes over state Department of Fish and Game permits to kill as many as 
200 fish in 11 streams in California. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point last month, two Fish and Game officials staked out the road to 
Matilija Creek after headquarters alerted them that water agency biologists 
might try to capture more of the remnant trout than their permits allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The biologists never showed, instead agreeing to postpone casting electric 
rods into the water until state Fish and Game officials determined which creeks 
could stand to lose another 20 fish to research. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the department gave permission to kill up to 140 fish in seven 
streams. It also granted approval to catch, clip the fins and release steelhead 
in four other streams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't issue those permits until me and my supervisors were convinced that 
they would not harm the steelhead populations," said Dennis McEwan, a steelhead 
specialist with the state Fish and Game Department in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 California Trout continues to protest the permits, citing that the National 
Marine Fisheries Service received permission to capture 110 steelhead for its 
genetic studies to determine whether to propose adding the fish to the 
endangered species list. The fisheries service will announce its decision Feb. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other inquiries, both studies are trying to determine whether the 
steelhead in Southern California can be considered genetically distinct from 
its Northern California cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a finding would make the fish a strong candidate for the endangered list. 
"I would be hard-pressed to find a group of steelhead who are more endangered 
than this one," McEwan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Baldrige, a biologist coordinating the study of Southern California 
steelhead for the water agencies, said her study should complement rather than 
duplicate the work done by the fisheries service. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the fish collected in streams should fill gaps in information 
developed in the federal study. "The National Marine Fisheries Service has 
limited staff and limited dollars to dig up all of this information," Baldrige 
said. "Our work is to supplement their data." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldrige said her crews have been careful not to harm the steelhead 
populations. For example, she said, they decided not to take any fish from 
Coyote Creek above the Ventura River because they could not find the 20 needed 
for a representative sample. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has been surprised at the commotion over permits issued to her 
research crews. "We've been taking 20 fish out of a stream where anglers could 
take five fish a day all year-round," she said. "You have to ask, 'Why is it 
such a big deal?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura and Santa Clara rivers once supported thousands of steelhead, as 
did many rivers from northern Mexico to Alaska. But steelhead no long exist in 
Northern Mexico, or San Diego and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They are limited to small populations in four streams in Southern California 
-- the Santa Clara and Ventura rivers in Ventura County, Malibu Creek in Los 
Angeles County and the Santa Ynez River in Santa Barbara County -- and their 
tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the salmon, steelhead are born in freshwater. They look identical to 
rainbow trout and remain in freshwater streams for one to three years before 
swimming to sea for a similar period. Once in the ocean, they take on a 
different color and their lower jaws become more pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 As adults, they return to their natal streams to spawn. Then they either 
return to the sea, or die, worn out from the upstream battle.

MEMORIES OF SHOOTING SPREE RECALLED; MEMORIALS: SURVIVORS, FRIENDS AND 
RELATIVES OF THOSE KILLED DURING THE COUNTY'S BLOODIEST RAMPAGE GATHER FOR 
SPECIAL RITES ON ANNIVERSARY.

 Irma Lopez kept reminding herself that Dec. 2 was a day like any other. But as 
the anniversary neared of the macabre shooting rampage at an Oxnard 
unemployment office that left five people dead and four wounded, the surreal 
memories rushed back, and she wanted time to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our friends that lost their lives, I don't think we'll ever forget them," 
said a tearful Lopez, who was seriously wounded during the massacre one year 
ago. " . . . They were the most wonderful people you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors, friends and relatives of those killed during Ventura County's 
bloodiest shooting spree gathered Friday for several memorials honoring the 
public servants lost in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Ventura County Government Center Friday morning, about 75 people 
listened to Lopez and other speakers as the Board of Supervisors held a 
ceremony at a commemorative rose garden planted so the mass murders will never 
be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 About noon at the Santa Clara Cemetery in Oxnard, about 100 police officers 
and relatives of slain Detective James O'Brien met to recount his heroism and 
honor the anniversary of his death. Bagpipers played the mournful "Danny Boy," 
a U.S. Marine Corps honor guard gave a 21-gun salute, and a large wreath was 
placed next to the fallen policeman's grave.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll never forget him," said Mary O'Brien, standing beside her brother's 
grave. "Hopefully everybody else won't." 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 of O'Brien's friends and family members also held a candlelight 
vigil on Victoria Avenue Friday night at the roadside where the detective was 
gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a chance to finalize our feelings and bring this to a 
conclusion," said Assistant Police Chief Stan Myers. The vigil was organized by 
the Oxnard Police Wives Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each person placed a green and red ribbon on a 10-foot-tall Christmas tree. A 
note with the message, "A cop's cop, but a friends' friend," was attached to a 
nearby pole that bears O'Brien's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy unfolded last Dec. 2, when unemployed computer engineer Alan 
Winterbourne burst into the state Employment Development Department office in 
Oxnard and began indiscriminately shooting people, apparently frustrated after 
years of looking for work.

 He gunned down unemployment workers Phillip Villegas and Anna Velasco and 
Richard Bateman, a rehabilitation counselor with the Assn. for Retarded 
Citizens visiting the office that day. Four other people were seriously 
wounded, including employee Lopez, who was shot in the back while desperately 
rushing to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Winterbourne later shot and killed O'Brien before dying amid a fusillade of 
police gunfire as he attempted to enter another unemployment office in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The massacre lasted only 13 minutes. Yet for the survivors and the relatives 
of those who were killed, the sorrow and trauma will last forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was some kind of sick joke that my wife was supposed to be in 
the emergency room," said Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, husband of Irma Lopez, 
during the rose garden dedication. "But it wasn't a sick joke, and it was a 
horrible day for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who lived through the tragedy said Friday that the anniversary 
brought back painful emotions they had hoped to put away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has always been in the back of our minds," said Villegas' mother, Nellie, 
at the rose garden ceremony. "This is reviving everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Chaplain Larry Modugno said that many officers, reminded of the 
blood bath of a year ago, have consulted with him in recent days, trying to 
make sense of what occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we get to this anniversary, it brings back a lot of painful memories for 
the officers," Modugno said at the cemetery. "It's very difficult for officers 
to think about the loss of another officer, and the taking of a life, even if 
it is Alan Winterbourne." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the show of support for O'Brien and the other victims of the 
shooting spree lifted their spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I'm here this has left me with some good memories," Mary O'Brien 
said. "I'll always remember the support we received." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Hartnett, Bateman's daughter, said she had not brought her young 
children to her father's funeral a year ago because she thought it would have 
traumatized them. But the rose garden ceremony was something they could handle, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this was a more appropriate thing for them to experience," Hartnett 
said, after walking the children through the rose garden to a plaque honoring 
the victims of the shooting. "I'm happy with this."

PASTOR SEEKS 'JUSTICE' AFTER ACCIDENT RECOVERY; OXNARD: NEARLY KILLED BY A 
SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER, HE FACES A HUGE MEDICAL BILL. ACCUSED MAN REMAINS FREE. 
</P>

<P>
 As he sat in a wheelchair and talked about his miraculous recovery, the Rev. 
Gerald Buxton made it clear he is not angry that the man accused of maiming him 
walks free today. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is not happy about it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice needs to be served," said Buxton, who has spent the last four months 
at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard recuperating from a 
debilitating accident. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 6, the 62-year-old Pentecostal pastor was struck by a pickup truck and 
thrown 90 feet as he tended to his disabled 1974 Toyota Landcruiser on Oxnard 
Boulevard. Dozens of bones were broken, and doctors did not expect him to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested David Estey, 28, of Thousand Oaks on suspicion of felony drunk 
driving. A blood test showed Estey was legally drunk and had methamphetamine in 
his system, Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Grant said. But Estey has not been charged 
with any crime because prosecutors have twice sent the case back to police for 
further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no animosity in my heart or hatred for him," Buxton said. "But he 
needs to pay the dues I'm paying." 
</P>
<P>
 Those dues include a $500,000 medical bill that Buxton's insurance will not 
cover. He belongs to a consortium of pastors who share medical costs. But the 
pastors' agreement does not include traffic accidents, Buxton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this bill were $20,000 or $30,000 I'd worry a lot more," said Buxton's 
wife, Shirley. "But a half million dollars is just too unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Buxton said she and her husband have applied for assistance from 
several governmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buxtons have received no help from Estey, who was uninsured. Nor is the 
couple satisfied with what has been done to prosecute him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," she said. "It makes all of this much harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the case was returned to Oxnard police for more investigation 
shortly after the accident. The police report was resubmitted to the district 
attorney Wednesday after the Buxtons were questioned again about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was rejected a second time Thursday and sent back to police, prosecutor 
Grant said. "It's just not ready for filing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grant said he wants to file felony charges against Estey, but cannot do so 
until the police reconstruct the accident scene and establish where Buxton was 
standing when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police OfficeW. Lumas said Buxton's injuries played a large role in 
delaying the investigation. Because he was on a ventilator and had tubes in his 
throat, Buxton was unable to speak for nearly three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "His information is very critical to the case," Lumas said. "We need to figure 
out where he was standing in the roadway." 
</P>
<P>
 But the delay has frustrated the Buxtons further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't understand what difference it makes where my husband was 
standing," Shirley Buxton said. "(Estey) was drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Buxton's vehicle was stalled in the slow lane of Oxnard Boulevard when he was 
struck. Grant said it is possible Buxton is partly liable in the accident, 
depending on where he was in the road when hit. But Buxton said he does not 
remember where he was standing, and no one witnessed the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Estey refused to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the entire ordeal, Buxton has amazed his doctors with his positive 
attitude. Doctors said Buxton should have been killed in the accident. Instead, 
he now hopes to walk again and plans to leave the hospital before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The accident didn't affect my mind," Buxton said. "God preserved my mind. 
That's a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes to be back in his pulpit and before his 200 parishioners in 
Rialto next year. "He has a tremendous faith and a positive attitude, and I 
think that's why he has come as far as he has come," said George Yu, the 
physician who treated Buxton in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was broken," Yu said. "He was bleeding profusely." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not breathing either when Lorraine Heter rushed to Buxton's crumpled 
body moments after the accident. Heter was across the street when, she said, 
she heard the tell-tale sound of metal crushing metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and saw the reverend about four feet off the ground," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two months, nearly every day brought a new life-threatening 
crisis as Buxton remained in the intensive-care unit. He was paralyzed below 
the neck and internal organ-after-internal organ had problems, Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were all kinds of nasty things," Yu said. "He should have died several 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Buxtons are awaiting a Dec. 23 hospital release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to leading a normal life again," Shirley Buxton said. 
Like her husband, she said her religious faith and positive attitude have 
buoyed her through the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the couple's spirit, Yu said he will not charge for his work over 
the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is now a friend of mine," Yu said. "This is the least I can do for 
him."

CALTRANS REJECTS BARRIERS ON HIGHWAY 126; SAFETY: COUNTY BELIEVES CENTER 
DIVIDERS WOULD REDUCE CASUALTIES ON DANGEROUS STRETCH. STATE SEES POTENTIAL NEW 
HAZARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by the death rate along a dangerous stretch of California 126, city 
and county leaders Friday faced off against the state Department of 
Transportation over whether installing concrete center dividers would ease the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from throughout the county have endorsed a proposal to place the 
barriers along perilous sections of the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans flatly rejected the plan at Friday's meeting of the Ventura 
County Transportation Commission, telling the panel that although barriers 
would prevent head-on collisions, they would increase other types of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past five years, there have been 1,168 accidents and 29 people have 
died along the winding stretch between Ventura and the Los Angeles County line 
east of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a verbal report to the commission, Caltrans spokesman Steve Leung said 
the dividers would create a new set of traffic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The barriers would stop vehicles from crossing over" into oncoming traffic, 
but "the blunt ends of the barriers would create a dangerous object for people 
to hit," Leung said. "If someone can come up with the facts and prove to us 
that concrete barriers are the best solution, we are ready and willing to 
discuss it."  
</P>
<P>
 The commission reacted angrily to the report, saying it is up to Caltrans to 
provide information about the feasibility of installing barriers and accusing 
the agency of stubbornly resisting their plea without giving it full 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing you have shown us today convinces us" that barriers would not reduce 
the fatality rate, said Commissioner David Smith, who also serves as a 
Camarillo city councilman. "I don't believe that you have the information that 
says if we put barriers in it will be worse. I'm not convinced." 
</P>
<P>
 Leung suggested a list of alternatives to the barriers, among them posting 
signs along the roadway cautioning motorists to drive carefully, stepping up 
efforts to have drivers turn on their headlights during the day and increasing 
law enforcement to nab speeders and drunk drivers.  
</P>
<P>
 Leung reminded the commission that road-widening projects are scheduled for 
the next several years on two narrow, accident-prone strips of the highway. He 
recommended that a task force be formed to address the safety problem and 
suggested that the county consider eventually transforming the highway into a 
freeway because freeways are generally safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Executive Director Ginger Gherardi bristled at Leung's suggestions, 
saying the role of the proposed task force was already being performed by the 
commission and that making California 126 a freeway would "heap a host of 
environmental problems" on the county, "not to mention funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Campbell, a Fillmore city councilman who is spearheading the effort to 
install median barriers, harshly criticized Leung's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really clear to us that you started out with the premise 'We're not 
going to do this,' " Campbell said. "I see a lot of conflict in what you're 
telling us. In fact, you're not giving (the commission) enough information to 
make a factual decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission directed Caltrans to research the matter more carefully and 
return with a beefed-up report in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said they want Caltrans to tell them the type of accidents that 
occur when dividers are installed, whether the number of fatalities would fall 
if medians are installed and what sections of the highway would be conducive to 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent fatal crash on California 126 occurred in October, when two 
men were killed and three others injured in a head-on collision near Fish 
Hatchery Road. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thanksgiving Day in 1988, seven people died in a gruesome crash, including 
a family of five traveling from Orange County to visit friends in Santa Paula.

 May we recommend the Emergency Room Special?Woodruff Community Hospital in 
Long Beach promises that anyone who shows up in its emergency room will see a 
physician within 20 minutes or there'll be no charge for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are busy and don't want to have to wait an hour or more like they 
would at a bigger hospital," reasoned Lisa Ciccanti, director of business 
development for the 96-bed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciccanti said Woodruff, which handles about 15 to 25 ER cases a day, hasn't 
had to award any freebies for tardy service since instituting the policy in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The rival Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach has no plans for a counter ad 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see nearly 50,000 patients a year in our ER, and we're one of the last 
remaining trauma centers in L.A. County," said spokesman Ron Yukelson. "So it 
would be counterproductive for us to market our emergency services." 
</P>
<P>
 We wonder, though, if some other hospital will attempt to one-up Woodruff on 
fast service. This being L.A., isn't a drive-through emergency room inevitable?

" 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers were warned that the form was confusing so they were advised to 
"start filling it out from the bottom and complete it in reverse. That way you 
will have a chance of ending up with the information on the right line."

 Milestones in tattooing: The December issue of International Tattoo Art 
contains a feature on the late Lee Roy Minugh, a legend in the business for 
more than half a century in the L.A. area. 
</P>
<P>
 Minugh first set up shop in the back of a Downtown bookstore, attracting 
passersby with an outside sign that proclaimed: "Tattooing in the rear." 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't achieve national renown until the 1950s, when he appeared on 
Steve Allen's popular TV show and decorated Allen's arm. "Four little black 
dots I think it was," Minugh later recalled. "Just so he could say he was 
tattooed." 
</P>

 It was quite a breakthrough -- though tattooists don't like to use that term.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
COURT REBUFFS JUDGES' BID TO USE ANONYMOUS JURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two judges who are waging a legal fight to use anonymous juries in criminal 
trials lost the latest round this week when a state appeals court said they do 
not have the right to pursue the issue in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip K. Mautino and John David Lord, presiding judges of the Bellflower and 
Downey Municipal Courts, had asked the appeals court to overturn Superior Court 
rulings forbidding the use of anonymous juries in two cases.State law offers 
jurors anonymity once a trial is over, but Mautino and Lord believed that that 
protection is meaningless unless it is offered at the start. The public 
defender's office contends that blanket anonymity biases trials by creating the 
impression that defendants are to be feared.  
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal had agreed to hear arguments Dec. 21, but on 
Wednesday it dismissed both cases in a brief written ruling. The court wrote 
that Municipal Courts lack the legal standing to challenge Superior Court 
decisions. The role of the court, the justices said, is as a neutral party, not 
an entity with a "beneficial interest" in the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Deputy County Counsel Daniel E. McCoy, who represents both judges, 
said he will ask the California Supreme Court to grant a hearing.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STUDENTS TRANSFORM DINGY TUNNEL INTO A WORK 
OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until recently, an underground walkway near E. P. Foster School in Ventura was 
a dingy concrete tunnel marked by the graffiti of neighborhood gangs. Light 
poured in from both ends, but not much else brightened the passageway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be spooky, but now this is like walking through a little cartoon," 
said D'Anira, an Ojai muralist who uses only her first name. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon that D'Anira has helped create is an underwater seascape that 
contains elements from whimsical drawings done by a class of 28 fifth-graders 
at the school just off Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Using cans of latex paint, sponges and roller brushes, the students first 
painted a background of blues and greens, then began filling in the aquatic 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the outlines drawn by D'Anira, they dabbed in jelly fish (without 
stingers), goldfish, turtles and a large gray whale. In between, they painted 
wavy green plants and orange coral. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Angela Waites said her favorite part of the project is "painting 
stuff and seeing how it comes out." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela, who walks through the tunnel beneath Ventura Avenue every day, said 
the paint has brightened the passage, making it easier to see. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Anira, who is studying to become a chiropractor, said she first learned 
about the tunnel when she lived in the Ventura Avenue area 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her three children, age 5, 10 and 12, now attend school in Ojai, 
D'Anira said she wanted to give something back to her old neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the children to know they can make a difference, that they can do 
things themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After proposing the project to E. P. Foster Principal Fred Rivera, she turned 
to the city for permission to paint the tunnel and received a $1,000 grant 
through a beautification project. 
</P>
<P>
 The project should be finished within the next few weeks. It will then be 
coated with a clear paint that will make it easier to clean off graffiti 
without damaging the mural. The tunnel is open during school hours. JULIE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CONSERVATIVE SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO SPEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting a head start on their mission to reform public education, a group of 
newly elected conservative school trustees from across Ventura County will hold 
a panel discussion Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The main topic of the round table, scheduled for 8 p.m. in the Casey 
Auditorium in downtown Moorpark, is the role of the Ventura County Board of 
Education and its relationship to local school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 But organizers said the discussion may also cover ideas for changing public 
education and their panelists' reasons for seeking office. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists are Norm Walker, newly elected trustee of the Simi Valley 
Unified School District; Elaine McKearn, just elected to the Conejo Unified 
School District board; Mildred Lynch, who won reelection to the Conejo board; 
and Angela Miller and Marty Bates, who defeated incumbents to capture seats on 
the county school board. 
</P>
<P>
 With the election of Miller and Bates, the five-member county board has three 
trustees backed by conservative Christian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates and Miller were endorsed by the Southern California Christian Times, a 
conservative newspaper. And county school trustee Wendy Larner, elected in 
1992, ran with the support of the Pro-Family Caucus of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The makeup of the county school board has changed dramatically," said Matt 
Noah, president of the Moorpark chapter of the Republican Assembly and the 
event's moderator. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, its clout remains limited. County school trustees work with the 
county superintendent to run 17 schools for disabled and troubled students. The 
board also approves the budget for programs to train county teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Noah said the panelists will discuss whether the county school board can 
exert more influence over local school districts in Ventura County. MAIA DAVIS

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
BLOCK URGES ILLEGAL RESIDENTS TO KEEP REPORTING CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that "a great deal of uncertainty" exists in immigrant communities 
because of the passage of Proposition 187, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman 
Block on Friday urged illegal immigrants to continue stepping forward if they 
are witnesses to or victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are victims or witnesses are in no danger of investigation for 
possible deportation, Block said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in the United States illegally remains a civil violation that is 
enforceable only by the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, Block 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which was overwhelmingly approved, does call for people who 
are arrested on other offenses and cannot prove their legal residency to be 
reported to immigration authorities. But that section of the initiative, and 
most others, are enjoined by state and federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department does make available to the INS the names of those 
arrested who say they were born outside the United States. "The procedures in 
place are the things we've been doing forever," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff said the one portion of Proposition 187 that has taken effect -- 
new state statutes against the manufacture and use of fraudulent citizenship 
documents -- will be enforced "on a uniform basis by all law enforcement 
agencies in this county." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the county district attorney's office filed felony charges 
against five Huntington Park-area men accused of manufacturing fake papers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; APPEALS COURT 
REFUSES TO BLOCK WORK ON TOLL ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals panel in Pasadena refused Friday to block construction of a 
4.7-mile stretch of a toll road that will cut through the environmentally 
sensitive Laguna Canyon.  
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel found that the Federal Highway Administration did not 
violate the National Environmental Policy Act simply because it failed to 
discuss every alternative to the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental group Laguna Greenbelt sued the federal agency, claiming 
that it had inadequately studied the environmentally sensitive canyon before 
approving the route, a $1.1-billion roadway that will run 17 miles from San 
Juan Capistrano to Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 In unanimously affirming U.S. District Judge Linda McLaughlin's pretrial 
ruling, the panel dissolved the lower court's order to temporarily halt 
construction.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel also found that the highway 
administration's decision not to prepare a supplemental environmental impact 
statement after a wildfire swept through the canyon last year was not arbitrary 
or capricious.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WILLOWBROOK; WOMAN 
LOSES ARM AFTER 3-YEAR-OLD SON SHOOTS HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Willowbrook mother's left arm had to be amputated above the elbow after her 
3-year-old son accidentally shot her with an assault rifle, a hospital 
spokeswoman said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Elvira Arzate, 30, was alert and in stable condition Friday at Martin Luther 
King Jr./Drew Medical Center, according to Dr. Tessie Cleveland.  
</P>
<P>
 Arzate was shot in the arm Thursday by her son, Eliazar, when the boy grabbed 
an assault rifle he had found in the back of his father's car, said Angie 
McLaughlin, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 Eliazar Reyes, 29, was booked on suspicion of storing a weapon in an area 
accessible to children and held in lieu of $15,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
 The toddler "has a toy assault rifle he plays with that is very similar to his 
father's real one, so he knew how to point the weapon and pull the trigger," 
McLaughlin said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; VETERANS BACK USE OF GREENBELT PARCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veterans group has endorsed a greenbelt property as its preferred site for a 
veterans nursing home, possibly dooming Ventura's chances at securing the state 
project, Mayor Tom Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400-bed facility, which would be paid for with state and federal funds, 
could bring up to 400 jobs to Ventura, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city lost a bid for a nursing home in an earlier round of decisions by a 
state task force. Members of the state panel, upon hearing competing proposals 
from the city and a developer, said Ventura was too internally divided for the 
state to invest money in a facility there.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's proposal would have put the home on 22 acres in east Ventura, but a 
local Chumash group told the task force that they oppose building there because 
it is near a Chumash burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The other proposal was from local developer Rudy Contreras, who wanted to put 
the home on his land on Olivas Park Drive, just outside the city limits. The 
city opposes that site because it is zoned for agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
 Local war veterans, who earlier backed the city's choice, voted 12 to 4 this 
week to support the Olivas Park site. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Sanderlin, the local post commander for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said 
county veterans shied away from endorsing the city site in part because Chumash 
opposition made the location too controversial. He said the Contreras site, on 
the other hand, is in a safer area and closer to the ocean. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OFFICIALS ASK NAVY CHIEF TO TOUR BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's two congressmen have invited Navy Secretary John H. Dalton to 
tour the area's two Navy bases for a firsthand view of their importance to the 
nation's security and the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps.Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills) sent a letter to Dalton earlier this week asking him to visit the Point 
Mugu and Port Hueneme bases early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recent reports indicate that these facilities are being actively considered 
as part of the 1995 base closing process," the congressmen wrote in a Nov. 29 
letter. "We feel very strongly that, before making a decision to place these 
bases on your list, a tour would be appropriate and useful." 
</P>
<P>
 A Navy spokesman said Dalton would have no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressmen also wrote that Southern California has suffered a 
disproportionate share of base closures and budget cuts in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge you to visit these bases so that you can see firsthand the impact of 
further base closures to the already fragile economy in Southern California, 
which continues to lag behind other regions of the country in its economic 
recovery." KENNETH R. WEISS

ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS PURSUE DOGS PREYING ON SHEEP; LIVESTOCK: ONE PACK 
MEMBER, POSSIBLY A PET, ESCAPES POSSE DESPITE AIRBORNE ASSISTANCE. DAMAGE TOLL 
RUNS INTO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was hours before dawn Friday, but animal control officers were already 
assembled -- weary, but armed and game to do battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had managed just a few hours of sleep since Monday, frustrated in their 
efforts to hunt down a pack of dogs that had killed dozens of local sheep. By 
week's end, the trail had gone cold -- three of the dogs had eluded captors for 
days, blending into the desert darkness at night, hiding in the dense 
underbrush during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't we just napalm them?" one official quipped early Friday. For the 
next seven hours, he and a posse of Los Angeles County animal control officers 
and local ranchers waited for a glimpse of the dogs that have been terrorizing 
livestock in this part of the north Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 By midmorning, they finally got a break. Two of the culprits were spotted with 
the help of airborne reconnaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 A fleet of all-terrain vehicles and trucks took up the chase through the 
desert near Rosamond, trailing the fleeing canines as they ran toward Kern 
County. Overhead, the plane kept track of the dogs, and the hunters believed 
they were finally at the end of the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 That turned out to be partially true: One of the marauding dogs was killed and 
another was captured, but the third -- a German shepherd-pit bull mix -- 
apparently escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday's drama, the dogs had struck at least three times in a week. 
Stakeouts by ranch hands and animal control officers had failed to foil the 
dogs, who had slaughtered more than 30 lambs, worth thousands of dollars. By 
sundown Thursday, workers at Eugene Nebeker's ranch had begun patrolling the 
pens in trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:30 a.m. Friday, the animal control officers shuffled into their 
headquarters, just a few miles from the ranch. They hopped into trucks in teams 
of two and drove to surveillance points along the mostly dirt roads nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the sheep pens, the dogs would have to leave their desert camouflage 
and dart across the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a waiting game," said Officer Michael Wilson of the county 
Department of Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 As daylight came, officers and ranchers drove around trying, with little 
success, to flush out the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunt changed when Michael Lamb drove up in his pickup and asked, "Why 
wasn't I invited to this hunt?" Officer Leslie Troncale, Lamb's neighbor, 
smiled, saying, "He has a plane ." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Lamb was airborne, radioing observations to the ground 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunters learned that the dogs had struck again near dawn -- at another 
ranch further north -- killing several goats. The chase moved toward the Kern 
County line, where the hunters met Kern County animal control officers who were 
also pursuing the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, the group got word that a homeowner just north of the county 
line reported seeing three dogs running from her property, carrying a chicken. 
Dirt and tumbleweeds flew when the hunters sped off, crisscrossing riverbeds 
and ditches as the dogs scattered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest dog, a black terrier, was killed when it dashed in front of a 
pickup and was run over. Another, a tan German shepherd mix, dived into a 
drainpipe to hide, but the exit was blocked by officers, who crawled in, 
retrieved the whimpering dog and tossed it in the lockup. The third dog's 
escape left officers unsure about the likelihood of further attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we got his gang, but we didn't get the leader," Cramer said. 
The remaining dog, he said, "may or may not be active. Once they lose their 
pack, their psychology changes." 
</P>
<P>
 The hunters say they saw a collar on the fleeing dog. That was just what 
rancher Nebeker had expected. Last week his crews shot three other domestic 
dogs that had attacked his livestock. He was fuming that a pet owner's 
carelessness had cost him tens of thousands of dollars worth of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 "About two-thirds of our business has come to a screeching halt," he said. 
"I'm just absolutely fed up with this situation, and I'm not going to rest 
until it's better controlled. The custom up here with too many people is just 
to let their dogs run free."

DRIVER WHO REJECTS VEHICLE LAWS GETS 6 MONTHS IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sylmar man who contended that he was a "sovereign citizen" with the right to 
drive without any governmental controls was sentenced Friday to six months in 
jail for driving without a license.  
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Municipal Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt imposed the maximum term for 
David Sanders, who was found guilty in a non-jury trial of driving without a 
license and driving an unregistered vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiatt imposed the maximum penalty after Sanders refused to accept probation on 
the grounds that he was a "sovereign citizen," not a "person," and therefore 
was not subject to the California Vehicle Code, Deputy City Atty. Norman 
Wegener said.  
</P>
<P>
 Wiatt ordered Sanders, 37, to begin serving the jail term immediately, and set 
bail at $15,000 after the defendant said he intended to appeal.

AL MARTINEZ: A LAST ACT OF DEFIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day Jerry Rubin died I called his home telephone number for comment 
from someone close to him. 
</P>
<P>
 No one answered, but his message machine clicked on and Rubin's voice exploded 
in my ear, full of the relentless energy that characterized his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm back in town, and looking forward to talking to you and everything's 
great and I'll call you back and make your day fantastic!" 
</P>
<P>
 By the heat in his delivery, Rubin could turn the simplest phrase into a call 
to arms, and his telephone message was no exception. It said, Stand by , 
America , Jerry Rubin's comin' at you!  
</P>
<P>
 It was a voice on the brink of doing, a message from the soul of those who 
rebel and defy, whose clenched fists glorify the commandments of freedom that 
allow them to rage. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I liked him. 
</P>
<P>
 Though later in his life he would slip into the warmer robes of affluence he 
once scorned, Rubin remained true, at least, to his insuppressible nature, 
defying even his own past and those old rebels who mocked his new standards. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at the end, he perished defying the most modest of regulations, traffic 
lights, in favor of dodging cars to cross a dangerous thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Struck by an automobile, he lay in the street like a fallen flag and died two 
weeks later, leaving us his voice and his memory to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I began writing about Rubin 25 years ago when he was a screaming Yippie. He 
and Abbie Hoffman had come to symbolize a time of fire in the streets and 
violence at the barricades of those who demanded a war's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's voice at the trial of the Chicago 7 still rings in history's ears, 
mocking the process, challenging the Establishment and daring authority to 
silence his rage. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, as a reporter put it long ago, a radical's radical who could never be 
silenced, the very epitome of those who shout defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 I met him last February in his $5,000-a-month high-rise condo, still a living 
superlative, the salesman's salesman, a network marketeer, hustling health 
powders instead of world peace . . . but with no less stridency than he 
displayed a quarter of a century before. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting took place because I had written about another Jerry Rubin, the 
Venice peace activist, and the ex-Yippie Rubin had telephoned to demand 
clarification. The Venice Rubin, I had said, was out of work and needed money. 
The Yippie Rubin was incensed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think it's me!" he said over the phone, in a voice that managed to be 
both pleading and uncompromising. "My landlord thinks I can't pay the rent! My 
girlfriends think I'm broke! You've got to clear this up!" 
</P>
<P>
 I knew it was a gimmick to get him back into print, but in gimmickry often 
dwells the stuff of ideas. I got the two Rubins together. Before the Venice 
Rubin could even sit, the Yippie Rubin fixed him with a stare that could melt 
steel and said, "I want you to work for me! I want every Jerry Rubin in America 
to work for me!"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice Rubin sat quietly as his namesake, a man he deeply admired and was 
often mistaken for, paced the room, answered telephone calls, promised wealth 
and demanded that I heed every word he uttered. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, for that instant, the Rubin we all remembered; not a "people's 
capitalist" in pin-striped suit, but the bearded, wild-eyed, frizzy-haired kid 
in jeans whose rage and rhetoric helped end a war and bring down a President. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Rubin last February was to watch the energy of social activism 
abruptly redirected, a transformation so total and miraculous it belied the 
very existence of the Yippie who had cursed what he was to become. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new persona, he loved America, hated drugs and believed that power 
belonged not so much to those who seized it as to those who could afford it. He 
understood the irony, and gave it the finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that was true to his character. He was defying every word he had once 
uttered, and the smoke of that defiance filled his penthouse that day we sat 
together, the Venice Rubin, the Yippie Rubin and me. 
</P>
<P>
 As I look back on it, I realize that Rubin, the eternal Yippie, was what he 
had always been, part hero and part hypocrite, and totally defiant of both 
elements of that nature. 
</P>
<P>
 At his best, he was a kid in the streets, burning flags and raising hell, and 
saying what had to be said in the context of his era. I would wish him now to 
rest in peace, but this wasn't the kind of peace he was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead I'll say to those who remember, raise a fist and bow your head. A 
rebel lies uneasy in his grave.

SANTA CRUISES STREETS AT HOLIDAY ARTWALK IN VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Claus traded in Rudolph for a red convertible on Friday for Ventura's 
Holiday Artwalk, a self-led tour of art galleries in the city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 3,000 people were expected to fill the city's streets, shops, 
galleries and eateries for the annual event, which was scheduled for 5 to 9 
p.m., said Sonia Tower, director of Ventura's Office of Cultural Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures waited at City Hall with her husband and 
5-year-old grandson for a ride from Santa, who was cruising the downtown 
circuit. She remarked that it was mitten weather, even though the only snow was 
painted on glass storefronts or strewn in window displays. 
</P>
<P>
 The art walk is the fourth such event organized by the city. Besides Santa, 
the celebration featured a brass band, a belly dancer, a juggler, carolers and 
minstrels. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from allowing people to gift-shop and admire artwork in a scattering of 
galleries, the art walk "creates a greater awareness of the beauty of our 
downtown," Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 One gallery new to the event this year was at Turning Point Foundation on 
Thompson Boulevard. The foundation, which offers services to people with mental 
illness, exhibited works created during an 11-month city-funded project in 
which local artists, using art as therapy, worked with foundation clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Reynolds, executive director of the center, said much of the artwork was 
done in preparation for the annual holiday art show at Camarillo State Hospital 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event also gave business people a chance to show their artistry 
with a Window Wonderland contest. City officials were to announce the contest 
winner at a reception Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people paused to smile at Georgia Olivas-Madrid's fanciful display 
window. Olivas-Madrid, owner of the Ladies & Gentlemen resale boutique on Main 
Street, festooned a red Mexican wedding dress with her collection of Christmas 
ornaments and posted three illuminated choristers in front. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Crawford, manager of Phantom Bookshop on Main, said it took two weeks to 
create her store's nostalgic display, which included an old-fashioned sleigh 
and horse, and a Christmas tree with a curtain of silver tinsel as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower said the next art walk, planned for March, will include a "java jump" 
that focuses on coffeehouse crawling. JAN STEVENS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SUSPECTED DRUG DEALER OUT ON BAIL IS 
JAILED

<P>
 A suspected Newbury Park methamphetamine dealer who was freed on bail this 
week for gun and drug charges was jailed again Friday on suspicion of 
threatening a witness, said a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hazher, 32, and a friend, Jimmy Sewell, 22, of Northridge went to a 
police informant's house in Thousand Oaks on Friday morning and threatened to 
kill him for giving tips to police about Hazher, said Ventura County Sheriff's 
Sgt. Gary Pentis.Hazher and another man were arrested earlier this week on 
suspicion of drug dealing, gun possession, credit card fraud and phone-service 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The unnamed informant reported the threat to police at about 11:30 a.m. 
Friday, and Pentis happened to spot the pair driving through Thousand Oaks 
about an hour later, he said.

 Pentis said he radioed from his undercover car for backup and kept an eye on 
the dark green Toyota pickup that Sewell and Hazher were riding in. A marked 
car joined the pursuit and pulled the truck over on the northbound Moorpark 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sewell stopped the truck at the Avenida de Los Arboles exit, the deputies 
ordered the men out at gunpoint and arrested them, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentis said Hazher and Sewell will each be charged with threatening a witness. 
Hazher also faces an additional charge of credit card forgery and Sewell faces 
a charge of possessing a stolen credit card voucher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail was set at $262,500 for Hazher and $250,000 for Sewell, according to jail 
officials. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; REPORT CITES BENEFITS OF CHANNEL WORK

 Widening a large section of the Arroyo Simi Flood Control Channel in Moorpark 
would cause no significant environmental damage, and would actually increase 
the amount of wetlands in the area, according to a new county report. 
</P>
<P>
 The project calls for widening the channel and replacing a 16,000-foot section 
of its concrete lining to guard against floods, officials said.The improvements 
would enable this portion of the channel between Hitch Boulevard and Spring 
Road to withstand a 100-year storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, expected to cost $4 million to $6 million, would also help reduce 
annual maintenance costs along the channel, while at the same time protect 
against erosion of its banks, according to the project's environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Although construction work related to the improvement project would cause 
increased traffic, noise and pollution, the environmental report recommends 
steps that can be taken to reduce their impact on the surrounding area. 
Construction activities, for instance, would be limited to weekdays between 7 
a.m. and 7 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The report found that the project would result in some benefits, primarily 
creation of an additional 11 acres of wetlands due to the widening of the 
channel, Deputy Public Works Director Alex Sheydayi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will consider the environmental report Tuesday.

<P>
 Using a felt-tipped pen and a computerized drawing, Simi Valley ninth-grader 
Alexandra Ianculescu created a star-patterned sketch that was selected this 
week as the 1995 Ventura County Science Fair poster. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've won an award for art," the 14-year-old La Reina 
High School student said."At first I didn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandra's drawing, which started out as an extra-credit assignment in her 
biology class, will cover more than 1,000 posters that will be distributed to 
schools across Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The science fair is presented by the county Superintendent of Schools Office 
and the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. It is open to students grades 
6 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandra's poster depicts eight stars that each represents a fair category: 
botany, chemistry, environment, math or computers, microbiology or medical 
science, physics, psychology or sociology, and zoology. 
</P>
<P>
 The science fair will take place April 25 to 27 at the Ventura County 
Fairgrounds. TRACY WILSON

PERSONAL ACCOUNTS OF WORLD WAR II ARE PRESENTED IN EXHIBIT; REAGAN LIBRARY: THE 
TOURING DISPLAY OF PHOTOGRAPHS, WEAPONS, ARTIFACTS AND PAPERS OPENS TODAY.

<P>
 A rich, searing new exhibit on World War II opens today at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library with the sleepy sounds of a ukulele. 
</P>
<P>
 Drifting from the burnished walnut grille of an old RCA radio there, this is 
how a Hawaiian broadcast must have sounded on the night of Dec. 6, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 Then appear flickering home movies of the U.S. fleet exploding under Japanese 
bombs at Pearl Harbor, and the history of World War II unfolds across the 
gallery in an impressive display of photographs, weapons, artifacts and 
personal papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "World War II: Personal Accounts," collected by the Lyndon Johnson 
Presidential Library from the National Archives and a host of private lenders, 
is making its last stop on a national tour that closes at the Reagan library 
near Simi Valley on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got no more than half an hour to see this, I guarantee you're going 
to be engaged on several levels," said Richard Norton Smith, director of the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 There are models of battle machines, photographs of soldiers and sailors, and 
equipment used by those whom the war made famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Spotlights pick out a battered brass compass used by German Field Marshal 
Erwin Rommel. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's silver pince-nez. Gen. Dwight 
D. Eisenhower's olive-drab jacket. Eva Braun's photo album. War correspondent 
Ernie Pyle's compact Corona typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Famous documents are on display: the declaration of war against Japan, Adolf 
Hitler's last Will and Political Testament, the actual papers of surrender 
signed in 1945 by German and Japanese commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the first draft of President Roosevelt's speech to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, December 7, 1941, a date which will live in world history . . . " 
he began, then scratched out the last two words, penciling in the word infamy . 
</P>
<P>
 Here are letters from the war's greatest commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one fine thing done when the tenth panzer attacked us," Army Gen. 
George S. Patton wrote to his wife from the North African campaign against 
Rommel's tanks. "One platoon of K Company eighteenth died to a man the last 
thing they were heard yelling was come on you hun bastards." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the debris of battle -- a GI's shrapnel-torn helmet plucked from the 
sands at Normandy, and one of the perfectly round, glossy, ocher ceramic jars 
used as Japanese grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 And here are physical mementos of conquest -- a Japanese sword surrendered by 
the POW camp commandant at the River Kwai, a German Iron Cross medal, the 
wooden plug that airmen pulled to arm the atomic bomb over Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the gallery, loudspeakers play the national anthems of all the 
nations embroiled in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 And lifelike plaster figures of Allied and Axis infantrymen stand frozen in 
the act of smoking a cigarette, draining a canteen, capturing a prisoner of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Most poignant of all, though, are the visions of war recorded in secret 
diaries and letters to the home front written by the warriors themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The larger-than-life figure is here, but mostly it's the GI's war," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guards using horse whips & clubs especially on Sr. officers," wrote U.S. Army 
Col. Albert Svihra, recording the Bataan Death March on tissue-thin cigarette 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moved on to Balanga (129) for night's stop. Water allowed at Pilar only . . . 
Filipino civilians giving away food regardless of Jap threats. . . . In 
compound there merciless beatings." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the carrier Lexington destroyed at the Battle of Midway, Navy fire 
controlman Clifford M. Dunn Jr. wrote: "It's getting quite dark now and the 
flames finally reach the planes on her stern that couldn't get off . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Ammunition left in the guns along flight deck explodes and the tracers shoot 
up in the sky as if someone was still firing them -- She is now completely 
covered by flames and her hull is white hot, lighting up the sky & water for 
miles around." 
</P>
<P>
 Army Lt. Walter F. Commander wrote his wife from the Italian front: "I want to 
remain changeless for you, Dolly, but I can see the changes in myself even as 
the days pass. You get something twisted out of your insides by all of this 
filth & sewage. . . . Darling, hold me so close tonight. Never before have I 
had so much need of you." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are letters from Axis soldiers showing they were just as scared and 
determined as their Allied counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian had built a little bridge-head. . . . In a great counter-attack 
we threw him back across the river and took this island where we are lying 
now," wrote Kuno Schmitt, an Obergefreiter in the German army, in a letter to 
his sister from the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of action in the last few days and all my extra fat is gone," 
he wrote. "My beautiful dress uniform looks more depressing now. One must never 
lose faith in God even if things look real bad." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are hints of the patriotism and the will to live that propelled 
these men through the most wide-ranging war the world had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 In one display case lies a red scrap of cloth, all that was left of the U.S. 
flag that Col. Paul Delmont Bunker lowered and then burned upon the U.S. 
surrender at Corregidor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunker sewed the swatch into his clothing. He later died of beriberi in a 
Japanese prison, but Cpl. Delbert Ausmus eventually got to present it to U.S. 
War Secretary Robert P. Patterson -- as Bunker had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the amphibious landing at Normandy, Army Lt. Col. Alfred F. Birra 
wrote his wife, Barbara, "Now it's our turn . . . The ramp is lowered and the 
Sgt. and I stepped off into four feet of water . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We had about 500 yards of water to cross, we couldn't run cause the water was 
too deep, we couldn't crouch, we couldn't do anything except just what we did. 
Wade on into shore." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 "World War II: Personal Accounts" is on display from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven 
days a week through Feb. 28 at the Reagan library. Because they are fragile and 
sensitive to light, the Instruments of Surrender signed on V-E Day and V-J Day 
will be on display only between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. each day. Otherwise, 
protective lids bearing photographs of those documents are locked in place over 
them. Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for seniors and free for children under 
age 16. At the request of former President Reagan, all World War II veterans 
and their immediate families can enter the museum free during December.

SYNAGOGUE COUNCIL LOOKS TO BE ON VERGE OF COLLAPSE; JUDAISM: THE FAITH'S ONLY 
INTERDENOMINATIONAL BODY IS BESET BY BUDGET DEFICITS AND DIFFERENCES AMONG 
CONSERVATIVE, ORTHODOX AND REFORM FACTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Synagogue Council of America, Judaism's sole interdenominational body, has 
apparently collapsed under the weight of financial shortfalls and internal 
differences after nearly 70 years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been no formal vote to disband the Synagogue Council, it is 
vacating its Manhattan offices this month. A plan to move the council's 
administrative headquarters temporarily to a Reform temple in White Plains, 
N.Y., was vetoed by Orthodox representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There don't seem to be enough people who are really interested in maintaining 
the organization," said Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, an Orthodox rabbi in Manhattan 
who has been the council's president for the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have a natural constituency of lay people. Those of us who are 
volunteer leaders have tried very hard, but we can't keep afloat something that 
isn't sustained by the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council owes $200,000 in rent, catering bills and loans made by some of 
its constituent organizations, according to Rabbi Jerome Epstein, executive 
vice president of United Synagogue, the Conservative movement's congregational 
arm and one of six denominational agencies whose representatives comprise the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1926, the Synagogue Council has been the only Jewish 
religious group in the nation in which the Orthodox, Conservative and Reform 
movements were represented. Members of those movements cooperate in other 
Jewish agencies, but those groups are secular in nature, not religious. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has had ongoing relationships with the National Conference of 
Catholic Bishops and the National Council of Churches, the umbrella body for 32 
Protestant and Orthodox Christian denominations, and was one of the partners in 
the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations, which 
represents world Jewry in dealings with the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Mordechai Waxman, a past Synagogue Council president, said interfaith 
talks, particularly with the Vatican, could be slowed while attempts to form a 
new organization to take over for the council remain unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, as yet unnamed group, will likely not include Orthodox organizations, 
although individual Orthodox rabbis may be included. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most controversial elements of the Synagogue Council's procedures 
-- and some say, the element that paralyzed it -- was the right of any one of 
its constituent groups to veto any proposal. Theological discussions were often 
stymied by hesitancy among Orthodox Jews to engage in such talks with non-Jews, 
and even with non-Orthodox Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-Orthodox council members blamed the organization's demise on the Orthodox, 
and noted that even without Orthodox participation, the organization that 
replaces the council would still represent more than 80 percent of the 
organized American Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Mordechai Liebling, executive vice president of the Federation of 
Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot, said "the Synagogue Council was an 
artificial organization because the Orthodox maintained a stranglehold over it, 
not allowing any substantive discussion and preventing any real interfaith 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabbi Lookstein denied that the Orthodox caused the agency's collapse. He 
said interest waned on the part of all participants.

CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR SEEKS MIDDLE GROUND IN SCHOOL PRAYER DEBATE; EDUCATION: 
CHARLES HAYNES SAYS THAT IF RELIGION WERE TREATED AS AN ACADEMIC SUBJECT, 
WITHOUT ADVOCATING ANY ONE SET OF BELIEFS, BOTH SIDES COULD BE SATISFIED. 
</P>

 To pray or not to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over prayer in public schools presents what seem like two 
irreconcilable alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But a 1st Amendment scholar has proposed a third option that he believes can 
bring the bitter constitutional dilemma to a peaceable solution: teach about 
religion with textbooks, not piety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people neither wish to impose religion in the schools nor eliminate 
religion from the schools," said Charles Haynes, visiting professional scholar 
at the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want programs that give religion an appropriate place while protecting 
everyone's freedom of conscience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion, Haynes said, is typically excluded from school curriculum because 
teachers and administrators fear running afoul of church-state separation or 
because they are not adequately prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 A new guidebook for public schools on teaching about religion -- published by 
the Freedom Forum center, a think tank on First Amendment issues -- suggests 
that schools make religion an academic subject, rather than a devotional 
exercise, and teach students about all religions, without denigrating or 
promoting one set of beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Omission of facts about religion can give students the false impression that 
the religious life of humankind is insignificant or unimportant," the book 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure to understand even the basic symbols, practices and concepts of the 
various religions make much of history, literature, art and contemporary life 
unintelligible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes said some progress has been made to persuade publishers to include 
treatment of religion in textbooks, "but we're still a long way from home." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're over the hump," he said of texts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we need to go beyond the mention of religion -- that Martin Luther King 
was a Baptist minister -- to getting religion more fully treated." 
</P>
<P>
 While providing specific guidelines and a list of 29 "religious influences in 
American history" that teachers of history, literature and social studies 
courses can use, the guidebook also covers such areas as religious holidays in 
the public schools, students' rights to religious expression and the status of 
school prayer laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes said that if schools would move toward inclusion of religion in 
learning, it could end some of the debate over prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest in a prayer amendment would evaporate if schools deal with 
religion where they can, rather than where they can't," Haynes said.

JEWS, CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS DEFUSE WAR OF WORDS; DIALOGUE: AFTER MEETING FOR 
FIVE HOURS, MORE THAN 30 LEADERS AGREE THAT ANGRY RHETORIC IS HARMFUL. ADL 
REPORT CRITICAL OF CHRISTIAN RIGHT IGNITED THE DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jewish and conservative Christian leaders came together over a kosher lunch on 
Capitol Hill this week and agreed to a cease-fire in the escalating war of 
words they have waged since last spring's Anti-Defamation League report on the 
Christian right. 
</P>
<P>
 After five hours of dialogue behind closed doors, the leaders agreed that the 
angry rhetoric coming from both sides poses a greater threat to the nation's 
declining moral health than their differing social and political viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants said they agreed to disagree, without maligning each other on 
such issues as school prayer and abortion, and to try to find values shared by 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 They also agreed to respect each other's right to participate in the political 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We established the line between differences and disdain," Phil Baum, national 
director of the American Jewish Congress, said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Montgomery, counsel for the National Assn. of Evangelicals, said "our 
real concern is, and should be, what is happening to our culture. We can 
disagree without rancor." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 Christian and Jewish leaders attended what was billed as the 
first such large-scale gathering of its kind. Organizer Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, 
president of the Chicago-based International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, 
said the meeting was put together because of the "crisis situation that has 
been dividing the two communities." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very, very positive day," said the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Liberty 
University chancellor and ex-Moral Majority leader. "It was a beginning of a 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The ADL report released in June -- titled "The Religious Right: The Assault on 
Tolerance & Pluralism in America" -- accused evangelical and fundamentalist 
Christian leaders of using "a rhetoric of fear, suspicion and even hatred" in 
their quest for political power. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The report called the Christian right "exclusionist" and a threat to American 
democracy, pluralism and religious freedom. "At times," the report said, "their 
rhetoric reflects hostility to Jews and Jewish concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 The report drew immediate fire from Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, 
singled out by the ADL as the Christian right's most influential organization. 
The Christian Coalition said the report was filled with fabrications and 
half-truths "reminiscent of the political style practiced by Joseph McCarthy in 
the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Coalition officials accused the ADL of using "reckless charges of 
anti-Semitism" for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges and countercharges prompted a slew of articles in Jewish and 
Christian publications, and the rhetoric became increasingly heated as the 
November elections neared. 
</P>
<P>
 Many participants at this week's meeting said they were apprehensive about the 
session because of the growing tension between the two sides, but they were put 
at ease by the willingness of both sides to back away from confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 ADL National Director Abraham Foxman and Christian Coalition Executive 
Director Ralph Reed attended this week's meeting, held in the Senate Hart 
Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxman said after the session that "the report stands." He acknowledged the 
"pain" it had caused conservative Christians, but said Jews also feel pain when 
they hear Christian right leaders call the United States "a Christian nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Foxman also said the ADL might not have issued the report had more open 
communication existed between the two communities -- such as that established 
in this week's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said "in a general sense, the Christian Coalition remains dedicated to an 
ongoing dialogue with the Jewish community and finding areas of mutual concern 
. . . in a way that is respectful." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed called the ADL report "a painful and unfortunate episode in the history 
of Jewish-Christian dialogue. It is my hope such an episode will never be 
repeated." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ADL report precipitated the round of verbal warfare between the 
two communities, meeting participants agreed that the issues separating them 
long predate the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to this table with our baggage, with our historical pain, with our 
anxieties," said Eckstein. "This meeting was held against a background of 2,000 
years of fratricide." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to meeting participants, discussion ranged from the political issues 
of the day to the explanation of religious language. School prayer -- opposed 
almost across the board by most Jewish groups but favored by many conservative 
Christians -- was mentioned several times, Eckstein said, in discussions 
described by one participant as "testy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Richard Land, executive director of the Southern Baptist Convention's 
Christian Life Commission, said participants agreed that although "this nation 
is not a secular society," it was also "a society of religious pluralism" that 
allowed for disagreement on issues such as school prayer.

 Blueprints for a new shopping mall and school campus on the hilly Seventh-day 
Adventist property in Newbury Park violate half a dozen development standards 
outlined in Thousand Oaks' General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's proposed project, which comes before the Planning Commission on 
Monday, requires massive grading that would seriously alter the topography of a 
sweeping site north of the Rancho Conejo Industrial Park, according to a city 
report released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 To develop the rugged terrain, engineers would have to fill canyons, slice 
ridges and build on steep hillsides. The huge earth-moving project would also 
destroy 68 acres of sage scrub and grassland, and intrude into 74 acres of 
wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project is so large that it will have a major effect on the way this city 
develops," Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction would affect 179 acres of the church's 458-acre Wendy Drive 
property and would cost about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the Adventist Church's project is inconsistent with city policies 
on ridgeline preservation and hillside construction, senior planner Larry 
Marquart wrote in a 17-page report to the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The development would also break a longstanding city policy of drawing 
shoppers to two main commercial hubs: one at The Oaks mall and another in the 
Westlake neighborhood. With its Target store and 12-screen movie theater, the 
Adventist project would create a third retail center with regional draw. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, Marquart wrote, the Adventist project "would involve major policy 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Adventist representatives, who have worked on their project for more than a 
decade, contend that every major policy change enacted for their development 
will help Thousand Oaks residents in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the benefits our project will have overall and balance them 
against the so-called (negative) impacts, it comes out overwhelmingly positive 
for the community," architect Francisco Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the development, the Adventist Church will sponsor $50 million 
worth of public-works improvements in Newbury Park. Their biggest project: 
reconfiguring the Wendy Drive interchange with the Ventura Freeway to speed 
traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the destruction of grassland, the developer plans to build 
miles of new trails and dedicate 258 acres of canyon country to the Conejo Open 
Space Conservation Authority. The church would also hire biologists to 
transplant the most sensitive plants, like the endangered Blochman's dudleya, 
away from construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The extensive grading, Behr said, will actually improve the property's 
aesthetics by blending the new development into the existing hills. "We're very 
confident in this project," Behr said. "We know it's a good project." 
</P>
<P>
 The complicated project calls for a one-story mall, with 70% as much retail 
space as The Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping mall would displace an eclectic collection of church buildings, 
including a faded school, senior citizen bungalows and a rambling equestrian 
center. Those facilities would be moved to the northern portion of the church's 
property on a hilly campus flecked with oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that northern campus is now designated as "undevelopable," or zoned 
for low-density housing. The Adventist Church has asked the City Council to 
rezone the land to permit more intense development. After the Planning 
Commission issues its recommendations, the council will consider the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Adventist proposal is so complex, two planning commissioners said 
they doubt they will finish deliberations in one evening. They are scheduled to 
start debate Monday at 7:30 and continue in special sessions on Dec. 8 and Dec. 
15, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote, when it finally comes, will be the last taken by the current group 
of planning commissioners. The terms of four out of the five commissioners 
expire this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman-elect Andy Fox will select a new commissioner, and Councilwomen 
Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah can either nominate new candidates or reappoint 
current commissioners. The fourth commissioner will be appointed by the person 
who takes the seat of departing Councilman Frank Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new commissioners would presumably better represent the incoming 
council, Planning Commissioner Linda Parks said she believes the current group 
should vote on the Adventist project. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much technical information," she said. "It would be very hard for 
inexperienced commissioners (to follow). We would have to start way back at 
ground zero to explain everything."

DECISION TO DROP STAMP OF MADONNA AND CHILD REVERSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religion News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service has reversed a decision to stop producing its popular 
"Madonna and Child" stamp series in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, postal authorities said they would end a longstanding 
tradition of producing the popular Christmas religious stamp.Next year's lineup 
would, instead, include a stamp bearing the image of a "Victorian-era angel" 
and stamps featuring Santa Claus and children with holiday gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Postmaster General Marvin Runyon now says the Postal Service will produce 
the Madonna series after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the Madonna and Child stamp has occupied such an important place in 
our stamp program for so many years and is so meaningful to so many Americans, 
I have asked the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee to develop designs for a 
Madonna and Child stamp to be included in the 1995 program," Runyon said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The reversal resulted, in part, from pressure by President Clinton, according 
to the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who was out of the country when the Postal Service announced its 
initial decision to discontinue the Madonna stamp, was so upset that he 
instructed his staff to contact key congressional committees to protest the 
move, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service began the Madonna series in 1966 and has produced it every 
year since 1978.

SIMI COUNCIL BACKS PLAN TO RECYCLE SEWER WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to conserve costly drinking water, the Simi Valley City Council has 
endorsed a program that would use treated sewer water to hose down dusty trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million pilot program, to be paid for by the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, is designed to cut down on the city's water consumption by recycling 
a tiny portion of the city's sewer water. 
</P>
<P>
 The system -- a series of pipelines, pumps and reservoirs -- should be pumping 
treated effluent to the Simi Valley Landfill in 18 months, said Don Kendall, 
Calleguas general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 After water disappears down Simi Valley toilets and sinks, it would be sent to 
a treatment plant, where it would be cleaned sufficiently for use at the dump 
without posing a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reclaimed water can save money, and it is a big factor in drought 
management," Kendall said. "There is a big incentive for all of us to use 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, an individual household uses about half an acre-foot, or 163,000 
gallons of water a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Reselling used water could eventually help cut down on water bills, which now 
run about $390 a year in Simi Valley for a four-person household. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas is working on a similar program in Hill Canyon in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Calleguas project, designed in conjunction with the Las Virgenes 
Municipal Water District, is near completion. The system will process water 
from Oak Park and North Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a seemingly simple concept, proposals to reuse waste water have been 
deemed too costly until now, Councilman Bill Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been on the city agenda for a long time, but as you can see, doing 
something like this isn't cheap," Davis said. "With the help from the (water) 
district, I think we'll finally see this happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the project, the district would sell about 250 acre-feet of treated 
waste water, or about 81.5 million gallons, each year to the city for 
distribution at the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, the project could lead to a $15-million system that would 
supply 4,774 acre-feet of reclaimed water a year, nearly half the effluent 
processed at the city's sewer plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking water sells for more than $400 an acre-foot, while the treated waste 
water will cost an estimated $350 an acre-foot, Mayor Greg Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton praised the project, but said he wanted to ensure that if it is 
successful, the city reaps a share of the financial benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that Calleguas is doing something for the residents of 
Simi Valley, and I want to encourage this," Stratton said. "But I also know 
that if this program expands, it is going to be up to the city to market it, 
and the city should get compensated for that."

NO LONGER TOO SOFT ON TERRORISTS; FBI'S FREEH PROPOSES BOLD NEW STEPS TO DETECT 
AND DETER 'UNDESIRABLE ALIENS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terrorism within the United States became a frightening reality with last 
year's bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. That incident was linked 
to individuals who had entered the country under questionable visa status. Now, 
as part of an intensified effort to curb terrorism, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh 
is calling for closing loopholes in U.S. immigration policies and practices, 
including the tightening of controls on student visas and sham marriages 
between U.S. citizens and foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly terrorism is not necessarily a "foreign" activity, and aliens 
regardless of status should not be unlawfully harassed. But safeguards need to 
be considered to make the nation less vulnerable to terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by Times staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow, Freeh made the 
recommendations in response to the Justice Department's request for a review of 
immigration policies and practices in the wake of the New York bombing and a 
1993 assault-rifle attack that killed five people outside CIA headquarters in 
Langley, Va.  
</P>
<P>
 Freeh proposed strengthening investigative powers against suspected 
"undesirable aliens," accelerating deportation appeal proceedings and limiting 
U.S. participation in a visa waiver pilot program under which 9.5 million 
foreigners entered the country in fiscal 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh said requests for asylum have become "one of the easiest ways to enter 
and remain" in the United States for those intent on engaging in illegal 
conduct. Current procedures call for only the posting of a small bond 
guaranteeing appearance at a future hearing or release on one's own 
recognizance. Too often, asylum-seeking aliens never show up for their 
hearings. Freeh advocated provisions for detention and deportation of those 
asylum seekers who skirt the law.  
</P>
<P>
 The two other categories of abuse are student visas and sham marriages. 
Students often do not abide by the terms of their study visas and marriages to 
American citizens are sometimes intended merely to gain legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department is reviewing Freeh's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has long maintained a policy of being as open as possible. 
That has been a way of refreshing the nation. But abuse of national generosity 
to carry out ulterior motives, especially terrorism, is not to tolerated. 
Freeh's recommendations are directed toward taking preventive measures to weed 
out possible terrorists. The FBI director's ideas warrant thoughtful 
consideration; America must do a better job at warding off terrorism.

THE RISK OF LIVING IN INVESTMENT'S FAST LANE; ORANGE COUNTY POOL SUFFERS A 
$1.5-BILLION PAPER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron commendably 
earned comparatively high rates of return for the 180 agencies that had joined 
the investment pool he runs. The pool seeks returns of 7% to 9% through 
investments that are mostly in bonds. Although it doesn't aim for returns of 
15% or 20% by buying wildly speculative stocks, there is risk -- and that 
became gut-wrenchingly clear this week when it was disclosed that the pool had 
suffered a paper loss of nearly $1.5 billon since January.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who played certainly knew the danger, that the greater the potential 
reward the greater the risk. The investment pool had been in place a long time 
and was very well known. None of the Orange County public agencies that 
participated can claim to have been caught by surprise. Nobody complained when 
the pool was reaping attractive returns. 
</P>
<P>
 EFFECT IS UNCERTAIN: It is still not clear what the overall financial impact 
of Citron's strategy will be for the long term. But the disclosure certainly 
should reinforce the message for investors of public funds everywhere that 
caution should be exercised before committing money to risky financial 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, the cities, school districts, transit authorities and other agencies 
involved in the Orange County pool have not run for the exits in a panic. The 
county has made a smart move in seeking independent review of the portfolio, to 
study the potential damage and to recommend changes, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for the loss appeared to be Citron's investments in 
derivatives, which are financial contracts that derive their value from another 
asset, such as stocks, bonds or commodities. They have been used for years but 
have become more common recently. They are very volatile: In the age of 
computer investing, they can soar or plunge quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Public agencies have special responsibilities when they handle the public's 
money. One is not to gamble foolishly; another is to earn the highest return 
prudently possible. If they err, it should be on the side of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, many investment advisers were warning of likely increases in 
the interest rate by the Federal Reserve Board and counseling clients to take 
their money out of bond mutual funds. If Citron had concerns, the agencies that 
were his clients said, he did not announce them. The Federal Reserve began 
raising rates in February, sending bond prices down. Yet in May and June, 
before his reelection over an opponent who challenged the county's investment 
strategy, Citron insisted he was confident about the investments. One question 
that must be answered is whether he should have switched the portfolio mix and, 
if so, when. 
</P>
<P>
 SOME SAID NO, THANKS: Last April Citron released more than 700 pages of 
investment data, so the agencies entrusting their money to him were able to see 
where their investments had gone. After looking at the data, the treasurer and 
the City Council of San Juan Capistrano, not a member of the pool, decided the 
county investments were too speculative for their taste. So did Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities and agencies did diversify. The City of Orange reduced its 
investment in the pool this year to about 20% of its assets. The Sanitation 
District of Orange County said it had about two-thirds of its investment 
portfolio in the Citron-managed pool. That would seem to be a gamble, even 
though the pool itself is diversified. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's loss, even though only on paper -- at least at this point -- 
should warn other public agencies of the dangers of taking on too much risk. 
Until everyone understands derivatives better, and they are better regulated, 
public agencies should approach such investments with extreme caution.

COUNCIL SPLIT ON FILLING VACANT SPOT; THOUSAND OAKS: APPOINTING FOURTH-PLACE 
VOTE-GETTER IN DOUBT AS COUNCILWOMAN FAVORS HOLDING SPECIAL ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Immediately after last month's Thousand Oaks City Council election, the 
appointment of fourth-place finisher Mike Markey to fill Frank Schillo's 
vacated seat looked like a sure thing. There was talk of giving Markey the seat 
to mend fences between council members known for their contentiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Elois Zeanah, a key supporter of the fresh start, said Friday 
that she now supports holding an election instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to maintain an open mind," Zeanah said. "But I certainly do have a 
preference for a special election. I feel that residents deserve their right to 
directly elect the fifth council member." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said that seeing the final election tally swayed her toward a special 
election. Markey placed fourth with 9,894 votes, while fifth-place finisher Lee 
Laxdal received 9,375 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was initially leaning towards appointment when we were thinking that the 
final vote would end up giving Markey a clear plurality," she said. "There 
isn't that. There is just a mere fraction of a percentage point." 
</P>
<P>
 During the recent campaign, Zeanah ran against Markey, who was endorsed by her 
archrival, retiring Mayor Alex Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar and incoming Councilman Andy Fox, who both favor 
appointing Markey, said they believe holding a special election will cost 
residents both monetarily and politically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be six months before we could even have an election," Lazar said. 
"For a city to operate on a four-member council basis for six months is bad 
enough, but we would also be operating with a four-member Planning Commission 
as well." 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly 500 votes is a pretty significant number," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth planning commissioner would be nominated by the fifth council member. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost of a special election is $100,000, city officials said. 
Laxdal has sent a letter to council members saying he supports appointing 
Markey. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said that a significant portion of the two years remaining in Schillo's 
term would be lost if a special election is required. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes 30 days to certify an election, so that puts us in July," Fox said. 
"Then the council is off in August, so the first time the fifth person would 
serve in any meaningful capacity would be September." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeanah said her understanding is that a special election could be held as 
soon as April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there is talk that this would hamstring the community," she said. 
"We've got some serious development issues coming before the council. I think 
the community deserves a five-member council as well, but it should be 
representative of the public." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Mark Sellers said that an election probably could not be held 
before June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be at least 90 days away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue will be discussed at a council meeting Dec. 13. Initially, the 
replacement of Schillo was not expected until early January, when he takes 
office as county supervisor. But Thursday, Schillo announced that he would 
resign the following Tuesday, prompting Lazar to propose a vote on the Markey 
appointment for the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski protested, saying that meeting is 
dedicated to inaugurating the council's new member and saying farewell to old 
ones. So the discussion was delayed until the following week. 
</P>
<P>
 On either side of the issue, council members said they have heard only support 
for their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hearing from the beginning that people prefer a special election," 
Zeanah said. "They stop me in public to tell me that." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said he has yet to receive a phone call in favor of a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that this (appointing Markey) is what the majority of the 
people want to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski did not return phone calls Friday, but has said earlier that she 
favors a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the council splits 2-2 on the issue, then a special election would be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey said he is disappointed at Zeanah's change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elois, she's the one that came out in the paper and said that she wanted to 
get a fresh start and start the new council on a positive note," Markey said. 
"Here she is changing her mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he is ready to start campaigning again if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll find out the 13th," he said. "And I'll announce that night and start 
campaigning right away. I've still got a campaign fund that is viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Zeanah struck a somewhat conciliatory note, saying she plans to 
nominate Fox to serve as mayor pro tem during Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Jaime represents the former council, Andy would represent the 
newcomers," she said. "I think it would be appropriate having a combination 
representing the new and the old on the council."

REQUIRING PRAYER IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William F. Buckley Jr. (Column Right, Nov. 27) must know that there are many 
who find requiring children in public school to say, "Almighty God, we 
acknowledge our dependence on thee, and we beg thy blessings upon us, our 
parents, our teachers and our country," unacceptable if only because they are 
not sure there is a God, almighty or not, or that we are dependent on a God, or 
that a God listens to prayers, or that having listened can or does bless as 
begged (rather than, for example, doing the opposite or nothing at all), or 
that such blessings would have any effect, positive or negative -- leaving 
aside such questions as whether government's establishing such a set of 
religious beliefs is consistent with our traditional ideas of religious freedom 
or whether the child on a given day is favorably disposed toward fellow 
students, parents, teachers or country. 
</P>

<P>
 I was astounded by the speciousness of Buckley's arguments for school prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first argument, Buckley argues that comparing school prayer to the 
establishment of a state religion is equivalent to comparing a valentine to a 
marriage contract, and yet, as he reminds us in his first paragraph, he is 
discussing a possible amendment to our Constitution -- a modification of the 
highest secular contract in the land -- no mere valentine. 
</P>
<P>
 In his second argument, after paying lip-service to the rights of the 
minority, he goes on to write "the majority should have the right to say 
something pleasant to God when school assembles in the morning," as if the 
opponents of school prayer were disputing the right of the majority to say 
prayers in the morning when they argue that the minority should not be forced 
to say prayers in school by a new law or amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with school prayer, though, is not just its impact on the 
minority. Passing a law that forces anyone to pray in school, whether that 
anyone is a believer or a nonbeliever, teaches exactly the opposite of what the 
law intends to teach. Rather than teaching that we are all beholden to a power 
higher than either ourselves or our government and that our lives must be 
guided not just by laws but by the dictates of our conscience, it teaches 
instead that the law can dictate the nature of our relationship to a higher 
power and the nature of our conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Subordinating the religious to the secular, as mandatory school prayer would 
do, diminishes the majesty of both the religious and the secular.

<P>
 Before deciding the issue of school prayer, examine the results of our public 
schools with it and without it. Our schools experienced a continued improvement 
in academic scores and discipline problems were an exception until our Supreme 
Court decided to ban school prayer.  
</P>
<P>
 From that time, we have seen a steady decline in test results and student 
behavior. A coincidence? I doubt it, but the absence of prayer is only a 
symptom of a society that is experiencing steady moral decay. Placing prayer 
back into our schools isn't nearly as important as the statement that our 
society wants it there.

 So our representatives want to cut taxes yet increase military spending. They 
want to bring down big government yet enforce school prayer and restrict women 
from making choices about their own bodies. How stupid do they think we are? 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, I'd like to see Newt Gingrich try to keep a typical American 
classroom silent and reverent for a minute each day for a month!

U.S. OVERTURES TO IRAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his article "Iran Is Ripe for a Peaceful Overture" (Commentary, Nov. 17), 
Gary Sick tries hard to pass off one of his threadbare theories under the new 
label of "lessons from North Korea." Several points are in order. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no need to recommend a policy of appeasing Khomeini's regime to the 
State Department, since the department has been pursuing this line for the past 
decade. Need I remind Sick of the Irangate debacle? It is no coincidence that 
Sick nominates Robert Pelletreau, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern 
affairs, as best suited to open a dialogue with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Sick failed to mention his voluminous works about ferreting out a moderate 
mullah, only to be embarrassed each time when Hashemi Rafsanjani resurfaced at 
the top of the Iranian regime's network of international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has never been the U.S.' reluctance to hear about Iran's security 
concerns. The real problems are the mullahs' lack of interest and ability to 
change their domestic or foreign behavior, ruling out dialogue with the U.S., 
and the U.S.' dogged policy of accommodating Tehran. This approach has only 
encouraged Tehran to persist in its threats, aggression and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 In October the State Department's Near East Bureau, headed by Pelletreau, 
released a biased report about the People's Moujahedeen of Iran, contradicting 
a congressional mandate and public opinion, which strongly criticized it. The 
Tehran Times daily, which reflects Rafsanjani's views, praised the State 
Department report.  
</P>
<P>
 Five days later, Tehran brought out its Scud-B missiles for the first time 
since the Iran-Iraq War, firing off three from Kermanshah province, across the 
international border, at a moujahedeen base in Iraq. Three days later, 
Rafsanjani appeared in Kermanshah, and Iranian fighter jets bombed the bases of 
Iranian Kurds in Iraq's no-fly zone.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the Khomeini regime's representative to the United Nations, the 
missile attack was carried out in self-defense, to address "Iran's security 
concerns." Although there was no U.S. reaction to either violation, Sick's 
hypothesis did not pan out, and the mullahs called for President Clinton's 
death on Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran's ruling regime is engulfed in crises. The New York Times reported that 
inflation is fueling discontent (Nov. 20), and other U.S. media have reported 
major uprisings in the cities of Qazvin, Tabriz and Qa'emshahr. 
</P>
<P>
 What Iran is ripe for is change toward democracy, not overtures for friendly 
ties which will never materialize.

ENFORCEMENT OF LABOR LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While we are always appreciative of Robert Scheer's support of our 
multi-agency labor law enforcement program, we feel he overlooked several 
important issues in his article ("Instead of 187: Enforcement of Labor Laws," 
Column Left, Nov. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 Scheer recognizes that the almost unrestricted flood of undocumented workers 
into California has left the state with significant labor law enforcement 
problems. He then chastises the governor for not using more state taxpayer 
dollars to rectify a problem created by the failure of the federal government 
to enforce the borders. His statement that "for the entire state, on a good 
day, there are only 16 inspectors to enforce the labor laws" implies that these 
are the only investigators the state has. In fact, the Division of Labor 
Standards Enforcement currently has 173 professional employees who are 
responsible for such investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 What Scheer does not mention is that the U.S. Department of Labor, which is 
the federal partner in our multi-agency enforcement effort, has the mandate to 
enforce the federal wage and hour laws in California. Unfortunately, it has 
only 62 employees (including investigators, management and clerical staff) in 
the entire state. Unlike the state, these same Department of Labor 
investigators have the mandate to check immigration status during 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 We would be happy to see increased enforcement in industries attracting 
undocumented workers, but feel it is time the federal government steps up to 
the plate and either increases its own enforcement of labor laws or provides 
funding for the state to do so.

 Once when appraising a factory building, I observed that most of the workers 
appeared to be Latinos. During the appraisal the owner left me to go speak to a 
worker whom he addressed in Spanish. When he came back he said, "Any time you 
can hire $12 worth of work for $6 an hour it's good business." Perhaps 
anticipating my thoughts as to who these workers were displacing, he said, 
"Look, you either import the cheap labor or you'll end up exporting the job." 
</P>
<P>
 If what this businessman said is true, it's hard to see how these Latino 
workers are a liability to California.

SENATE TO VOTE ON 'REAGAN FREEWAY' PLAN; TRANSPORTATION: APPROVAL IS EXPECTED 
ON THE PROPOSAL TO RENAME THE SIMI HIGHWAY. CALTRANS, KATZ SKIRMISH OVER ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the Assembly reconvenes Monday to the high drama of a partisan power 
struggle, one of the first orders of business in the Senate will be renaming 
the Simi Valley Freeway after former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 A Senate resolution to post the ailing ex-President's name on the 118 Freeway 
from San Fernando to Moorpark is expected to win easy approval, said Senate 
President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the measure's main author. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's appropriate to acknowledge Ronald Reagan's contribution as a 
private citizen, as governor and as President," Lockyer said Friday. "And 
naming a freeway after him is one of the ways that those honors get bestowed." 
</P>
<P>
 The seemingly non-controversial proposal follows a brief skirmish between the 
California Department of Transportation and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
who, as chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, opposes naming 
freeways for living people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd prefer the policy of naming freeways in honor of people who have died," 
Katz said. "I have nothing against Ronald Reagan, but where do you draw the 
line?" 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that Caltrans was trying to rush the freeway re-christening, Katz 
sent a letter to the department on Sept. 12, warning it against moving forward 
without first obtaining Senate approval. The Assembly had adopted its version 
of the Reagan resolution Aug. 31 but failed to get it to the Senate floor in 
time for a vote before adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz's concern and the tone of his letter -- in which he asked Caltrans to 
confirm that it " will not allow the posting of signs" before Senate approval 
-- left state transportation officials questioning the appropriateness of his 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said the assemblyman's request for assurances 
amounted to "much ado about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "He voiced the concern," Drago said. "But the fact of the matter is this is 
going through the normal process anyway and going to the Senate for a vote." 
</P>
<P>
 As for breaking with tradition and naming a freeway after a living figure, 
William G. Brennan, deputy secretary of the state Business, Transportation and 
Housing Agency, said this is one case that warrants a departure -- particularly 
in light of Reagan's recent disclosure that he has entered the early stages of 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's said that people have to wait until they die to be acknowledged or 
recognized for their achievements," Brennan said. "I just don't get offended 
about going out and naming a freeway after him now, while he can still enjoy 
it. I wish there was a bigger one and a longer one we could pick." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans estimates the cost of designating the 118 corridor as the Ronald 
Reagan Freeway at about $4,000. That should cover the price of erecting and 
maintaining new signs at each end of the freeway, Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding will come from private donations expected to be collected by a 
nonprofit entity set up by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), a co-author of the Senate 
resolution, said one benefit of renaming the freeway will be to remind people 
of the presidential library's location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give us the opportunity to highlight that the library is in Simi 
Valley," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Katz said a more appropriate decision would be to name California 23 for 
the former President, since that highway leads right to the library's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Katz said, it was suggested that the Pacific Coast Highway be 
named after Reagan, "but I couldn't see naming the state's most scenic coastal 
highway for a man who once said, 'When you've seen one redwood, you've seen 
them all.' "

PIERCE COLLEGE PLAN IS REVISED TO SPARE THE FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College President Mary Lee, at the behest of a community group working 
to preserve the school's farm, has revised a tentative master plan for the 
school that would have encroached on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, designed in part to bring in revenue to the financially strapped 
school, includes such commercial ventures as a golf range, farm museum and 
300-seat domed theater that would also serve as a planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
 It also includes a discovery pavilion, where children and adults can get 
hands-on experience in science, and a 160- to 260-seat conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 When the original version of the plan was introduced, Margo Murman, president 
of the Coalition to Save the Farm, praised Lee's efforts to bring in more 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also urged Lee to consolidate the plans onto a 160-acre tract on the 
main campus near the administration building, leaving the farm's 240 acres 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original version of the plan, the discovery pavilion, farm museum and 
planetarium would have been situated on farmland. Under the revised plan, they 
have been moved to a part of the campus away from the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made some changes based on input," said Lee, who has been meeting 
with community and school groups throughout the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Murman has been named chairwoman of a newly created community 
advisory committee, formed to offer advice to the school on the master plan and 
other issues. The group has 18 members, including Shirley Blessing, a member of 
the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, and Evie Phillips of the Woodland 
Hills Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which next meets Jan. 3, will review an updated version of the 
plan presented by Lee, said Murman.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee has asked Lee to provide more details in her plan, Murman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unclear as to how much space these buildings are going to take up 
and where the parking is going to be," Murman said. "All the buildings and 
things should be drawn to scale, and they are not." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who took over as president in April, has been under pressure to preserve 
the farm but also to alleviate the school's fiscal woes. Some say the farm is a 
waste of money because of low enrollment in the school's agricultural programs. 
That money would be better used for the school's basic academic programs, those 
critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessing, whose organization has clashed in the past with school officials 
over land-use issues, said any plan should focus on improving education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to think about where we will be 25 years from now," she said. "You 
can't just think about the straits the college may be in financially today."

IRVINE PUTS A SCARE INTO NO. 14 OHIO; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ANTEATERS ARE CAUGHT

 Gary Trent overcame a sluggish start Friday to score 25 points, including two 
that tied it at the buzzer and six in overtime, to lead No. 14 Ohio University 
to an 81-72 first-round win over UC Irvine in the Hawkeye Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio (5-1) will play Pepperdine or host Iowa in tonight's championship.The 
Waves and Hawkeyes met later Friday in the other first-round contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent, held to four first-half points, scored on a layup to tie the score at 
66-66 as the final horn sounded to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford scored 15, Gus Johnson 12 and Jason Terry 11 for the Bobcats, who made 
nine of 10 free throws in the overtime to secure the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Raimonds Miglinieks scored 17, Chris Brown 13 and Khalid Channell 10 for 
Irvine (0-2), which squandered a 39-30 halftime edge but still led 66-62 on 
Brown's two free throws with 1:05 remaining in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 A bucket by Trent made it 66-64 with 55 seconds left, and the Anteaters failed 
to ice the game when Miglinieks and Kevin Simmons each missed the front ends of 
one-and-one opportunities in the final 28 seconds.

BUT WHAT DID THEY REALLY THINK OF THE SKINS GAME?

<TEXT>
<P>
 I've played golf for 70 years and have always found the courses and people 
I've played with to be very interesting and enjoyable. However, heaven forbid I 
ever witness another Skins Game. 
</P>
<P>
 The four monkeys who were led around with rings in their noses by the 
promoters of last week's Skins Game should either donate all their winnings to 
charity or, along with the sponsors, join up and return that pockmarked, 
miserably called golf course to its original desert beauty.

 What more self-serving drivel than to watch four pampered millionaires playing 
for funny money, acting like they're playing a $20 Nassau or for "loser buys 
drinks" over a grueling format of nine holes per day, studded with patronizing, 
egocentric cameo interviews, and then sprinkled with Bighorn advertisements 
parading as golf commentary, viz., Vin Scully interviewing Jim Colbert, the 
resident pro?

RAVELING A NICE GUY WHO IS FINISHED AT LAST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's one USC basketball fan who was happy to see George Raveling go.George 
took over a promising program and proceeded to go 115-118, despite schedules 
full of Houston Baptists and Tennessee Martins. Other than a few bright spots 
courtesy of Harold Miner and an ability to beat UCLA, he accomplished virtually 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt he's a heck of a guy, but as a basketball coach he left a lot 
to be desired. I'm sure fans at Iowa and Washington State would agree.

CLOUDY BOWL SITUATION NEEDS TO BE CLEARED UP

<P>
 It is Jan. 1 and 2, 1995, and the five major bowls are touting "Final Four" 
candidates. Bowl hysteria is at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 14-15: The first Final Four weekend. On Saturday, Penn State, Nebraska, 
Alabama and Florida State clash in the two most-watched college football games 
in history. The next day, Miami-Pittsburgh and Dallas-San Francisco in the NFL 
conference championship games round out the greatest sports weekend of the 
year.

 To choose Notre Dame (6-4-1) for the Fiesta Bowl and USC (7-3-1) for the 
Cotton Bowl over Kansas State (9-2, with losses only to Nebraska and Colorado) 
is a travesty and proof that bowl committees are more interested in a team's 
name publicity than its ability.

ARE THERE ANY ANSWERS TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From a Southern California native living in Northern California: 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone care about anything down there? Isn't anyone in politics or 
business interested in keeping the Rams in Anaheim? Does anyone recognize the 
psychological impact of a top-notch sporting franchise to the community? How 
long has it been since any team in Southern California won anything? 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone see a correlation between the general breakdown of discipline and 
a lack of winning teams in Southern California? I don't blame the Rodney King 
fiasco on the Dodgers, Lakers or Rams, but didn't we used to have a collective 
pride in our community when things were going well with our sports teams.Maybe 
it was coincidence, but isn't it just possible that we could better identify 
with each other when Smokey Alston brought us another World Series championship 
and ditto for the Lakers? Weren't we happier when John Wooden was bringing us 
our annual NCAA championships and USC was going to the Rose Bowl just about 
every year?  
</P>
<P>
 Did we care more back then or is it just my imagination?

 What's wrong with the Rams? They admit they have had several good drafts in a 
row and have picked up some quality free agents. Yet, unlike the Steelers and 
Chargers, who are rebuilding winners, the Rams continue to flounder with 
lackadaisical play, repeatedly committing stupid blunders that lose games. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to blame? In view of these facts, it must be the coaching.

FOR WARD'S FOOTBALL CAREER, IT'S A CASE OF THE SHORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUN POWELL, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At one point this fall, only the Democrats were having a tougher time than New 
York quarterbacks. Boomer Esiason and the Jets' offense rolled sevens instead 
of scoring them. Giants Coach Dan Reeves went back and forth and back again 
with Dave Brown and Kent Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback topic sizzled on the sports talk shows and screamed across the 
back pages of the tabloids. The subject even ventured inside the New York 
Knicks' locker room, of all places. 
</P>
<P>
 Knicks guard Doc Rivers sized up the situation and came to a conclusion. 
Graham, Brown, Boomer ... the answer was all so simple. "The best quarterback 
in New York," Rivers said, "is Charlie Ward." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Ward. In a period of time when college football's most famous award is 
being handed to the wrong players for the wrong reasons, Ward was a deserving 
landslide winner last year. He pushed Florida State through a demanding 
schedule and to the national championship by playing bigger with each game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he became the only non-military Heisman Trophy-winner to pass unselected 
through the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first autumn that he can remember, Ward isn't on a football team, 
although you can argue the Knicks come close enough. They selected him in the 
first round, they've invested nearly $5 million in Ward over the next five 
years, and they're counting on Ward being their point guard -- their 
quarterback -- of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well in basketball, Ward will never play in the NFL. If that is 
what fate has in store for Ward, he will accept it, even if others can't. "I 
didn't know what I'd be doing after I finished college, to tell you the truth," 
Ward says, in a voice that's nothing more than a whispered mumble. "I knew I'd 
be involved in sports, because the Lord has blessed me with athletic talent. 
Whether I was headed to football or basketball, I couldn't control. I only knew 
I was going to make the best out of whatever situation I landed in. That was 
something I could control." 
</P>
<P>
 The bypassing of Ward is still being debated. There are theories and reasons 
and excuses, but the bottom line is this: When the mighty NFL scouting machine 
consumed all of the vitals about Ward and belched its verdict, Ward wasn't 
considered an attractive pro prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's agent, Eugene Parker, says three-fourths of the NFL expressed interest. 
Some were more serious than others. All were represented when Ward held a 
one-day workout. And every team, while impressed with Ward's mechanics, had 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 There was mention of his arm, the same limb that threw for 3,032 yards, 27 
touchdowns and only four interceptions as a senior. There were whispers that 
Ward's arm wasn't strong enough, although you notice young NFL quarterbacks 
like Rick Mirer dumping off to running backs and throwing a lot of 10 
yards-and-out passes these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive set used at Florida State was questioned. When Ward became the 
starting quarterback in his junior year, he threw nine interceptions in his 
first three games. He didn't flourish, the pro scouts say, until the Seminoles 
switched from a pro-set offense to a shotgun formation with extra wide 
receivers. However, that system isn't obsolete in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 What about race? Ah, yes. Race. The days of exclusionary tactics against black 
quarterbacks seemingly are over. At least, that's the popularly held belief. 
Yet, former Dallas Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson suspects the color of Ward's 
skin did play a part in his evaluation by NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a stigma that blacks ... can't figure out sophisticated 
pro-style offenses," Johnson says. "It's a tragedy that Charlie Ward wasn't 
drafted. And don't give me that bull about how he was thinking of playing in 
the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the most popular strike against Ward, which had nothing to do 
with color, arm strength or elaborate offensive schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak for the rest of the league, but my impression was that his 
height was a major, major factor," says Jets General Manager Dick Steinberg, 
who says he was a Ward fan. "That's a non-correctable negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Knicks list him at 6 feet 2, Ward measured a shade over 5-11 for 
the NFL. Apparently, that was a few shades short. The league has always favored 
the 6-3-and-up quarterback, the kind who could remain in the pocket and see 
above defensive linemen, over smaller quarterbacks who often must roll out or 
pass between defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any quarterback playing in our league who's under 6 feet," 
Steinberg says, matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few days after Steinberg made those comments, the Cincinnati Bengals' 
season experienced a pleasant turn when they switched to Jeff Blake, who stands 
5-11 and who played the previous two seasons for the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's face displays a weary expression when he's asked about the days leading 
up to the NFL draft. "I heard a lot about what I could and couldn't do," Ward 
says. "For a person who proved himself at the highest level in college, I sure 
heard a lot of myths. I'm not one to be real big on excuses. I never use them 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ward wasn't taken in the first round, his exclusion from the rest of the 
draft became a matter of economics. Knowing Ward could expect to command nearly 
$1 million guaranteed annually as a first-round pick in the NBA -- a salary 
that's about three times what lower NFL picks earn -- football backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have gone to the Canadian Football League, like Doug Flutie, another 
Heisman winner whose height made him an outcast, but Ward never gave it serious 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, less than a month after being snubbed by the NFL, Ward switched to 
wearing baggy shorts and a tank top. Pro football became a dead issue. "I 
figured I'd put it to them the way they put it to me," Ward says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward was at first mostly a curiosity to NBA folks. Ward played only one 
complete basketball season at Florida State, and that was a throwaway freshman 
year. Football commitments bit into his final two seasons, during which Ward 
played only 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
 That inactivity made him a hard read for NBA scouts. Their preliminary report 
on Ward was favorable, but mostly incomplete. He displayed solid poise as a 
leader, an obvious carryover from football. The Atlantic Coast Conference 
provided good competition, which included Duke's Bobby Hurley. Ward's 
decision-making didn't encourage many mistakes. He had quick hands, which 
helped him finish as the school's career leader in steals. His outside shooting 
was average at best and there were times when Ward would bypass open shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He first caught my eye in his junior year," says Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' 
vice president and general manager. "He seemed always under control. There were 
some flaws, but he never went through the normal preseason regimen. So that 
actually fell in his favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward had one month to convince scouts that he was worthy of being taken in the 
draft's first round, where the money was guaranteed and a place on a roster 
almost assured. 
</P>
<P>
 He made the all-tournament team at the Phoenix Desert Classic, the most 
influential NBA combine. He followed that with thumbs-up efforts in the United 
States Basketball League and the NBA's annual pre-draft camp in Chicago and 
during private workouts with individual teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie made really good strides in the All-Star venues," Grunfeld says. "You 
could see his game improving steadily. That was impressive for a guy who played 
basketball only three months out of the year. And every time he played in those 
pre-draft camps, his teams always seemed to win, and that was impressive, too." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a particularly strong draft for point guards. There was Jason Kidd, 
but few others. Ward played his way into the pack and then it became only a 
matter of taste for NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the Knicks didn't have a pressing need for a point guard. 
During the course of the season, they received veteran Derek Harper through a 
trade. He would have been named MVP of the NBA Finals had the Knicks beaten the 
Houston Rockets. Greg Anthony, their top pick three years ago, was the backup, 
ahead of Doc Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anthony was erratic; the Knicks have been trying to trade him since the 
season ended. Rivers underwent reconstructive knee surgery at 33. 
</P>
<P>
 They also had a pair of late first-round picks, which put them in a perfect 
position to gamble. So with the 24th pick they selected Notre Dame forward 
Monty Williams, a capable scorer who had been treated for a heart problem, and 
then took a Heisman winner at 26. In his first official news conference as an 
NBA player, Ward asked reporters: "No football questions, please." None were 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 He was moderately successful in his first NBA test. Ward emerged as the MVP of 
the New York summer league. He showed 3-point shooting range and an ability to 
distribute the basketball, the two skills of his that were most questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Ward went to the Knicks' fall training camp and his improved 
passing drew praise from Coach Pat Riley, who also said Ward "has to take a 
step up defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 When the season began, Ward, as expected, was cemented to the end of Riley's 
bench, a victim of numbers and seniority. Neither the Knicks nor Ward are 
pressed for time, however. He is still learning the game and the Knicks are 
giving him the necessary time and tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the ability to do what I want to do," Ward says. "Even though others 
might not believe in me, I've never doubted myself as an athlete. When I do, I 
might as well give up."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS SOAR ON SIGNS OF INFLATION-FREE GROWTH; MARKETS: THE 
DOW GAINS 44.75 WHILE THE DOLLAR RISES AGAINST THE MARK AND THE YEN. BOND RATES 
TAKE A DIVE.

<P>
 Signs that the economy is adding jobs without creating inflation sent stock 
prices soaring and long-bond interest rates plunging on Friday, with the Dow 
Jones industrial average gaining 44.75 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar surged, rising to a three-month high against the German mark and a 
seven-week high against the Japanese yen. Oil and gold prices plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the stock market was staging a technical rebound from sharp 
losses earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,745.62, reversing a 38-point loss 
on Thursday and ending the week with a 37-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond yield plummeted to 7.91% from 8.02%, 
while its price, which moves in the opposite direction, shot up 1 6/32, or 
$11.875 per $1,000 of face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates dropped despite an unexpectedly strong November employment 
report, which showed the nation's unemployment rate dropping 0.2-percentage 
point to 5.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that data might have signaled that the economy was growing at an 
inflationary pace, and could encourage the Federal Reserve Board to further 
raise short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But bond investors focused on part of the jobs report that showed a drop in 
hourly wages and the average workweek, both of which signaled that inflation 
may not be an immediate problem. Signs of low inflation could slow down any 
plans the Fed may have for further tightening credit, and that was taken as 
good news for both stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conclusion, at least for today -- and it's only tentative -- is that the 
economy is going to slow to a no-boom, no-bust, sustainable, non-inflationary 
pace," said Hugh Johnson, chief market strategist at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson and others said the market had been technically poised to rally 
after losing substantial ground earlier in the week, and that technical 
factors, like program trading, were responsible for some of the market's gains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stock investors are very, very tentative," Johnson said. "The level of 
confidence is not high." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the broader market, advancing issues had a solid 3-to-2 lead on 
decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was a moderate 284.76 
million shares, down from 288.31 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors' fears of higher interest rates were also softened by a drop of 0.1% 
in October in the government's index of leading indicators, and a 
0.4-percentage point drop in factory orders in October, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Clark, senior director in equity trading at Mabon Securities, said stocks 
were also getting a lift from the firmer dollar and lower oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended the week in New York at 100.61 Japanese yen, up from 99.34 
late Thursday. It was the currency's first close above 100 yen since Oct. 11 
and the highest since Oct. 7. The dollar closed at 1.580 German marks -- the 
best finish against that currency since Aug. 31 -- up from 1.573 marks 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil futures plunged to a seven-week low after 28 Pennsylvania counties 
backed away from using a new gasoline aimed at reducing air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of reduced demand for the cleaner-burning fuel triggered a 6.8% 
drop in gasoline futures and a sharp decline in heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, light sweet crude oil for January delivery plummeted 83 cents on 
the New York Mercantile Exchange to $16.99 a barrel, the lowest settlement for 
near-term deliveries since Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Commodity Exchange, December gold sank $3.10 to $375.50 a troy 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Whirlpool Corp. sank 2 1/4 to 46 1/2 on news that it is halting shipments to 
discount retailer Best Buy Co. and that Whirlpool is being investigated by the 
Justice Department for price practices. Best Buy closed up 7/8 at 33 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quaker Oats Co. jumped 2 3/8 to 62 3/4 on rumors that Coca-Cola Co. will 
tell the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has bought more than 5% of 
Quaker's stock. Neither Quaker nor Coca-Cola officials were immediately 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * ITT Corp. gained 3 1/8 to 80 1/8, boosted by a PaineWebber upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sun Co.'s shares lost 1 5/8 to 27 1/2 after it projected its fourth-quarter 
operating income at $10 million, down from $55 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * IQ Software dropped 4 1/4 to 11 3/4 after the software developer reported 
worse-than-expected third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel Corp. rose 1/4 to 62 7/8. The stock was recovering from two days of 
sharp losses amid concerns about problems with the company's Pentium computer 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amgen fell 1 1/4 to 56 3/4 and Synergen rose 1/64 to 9 3/64 after Amgen 
revised its antitrust application to acquire Synergen, postponing the 
acquisition until Dec. 15 from Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks closed lower. In Mexico City, stocks pared some of their 
earlier heavy losses but still closed sharply lower Friday, hit by rising 
tension in the southern state of Chiapas and by Thursday's selloff on Wall 
Street, traders said. The Bolsa index ended 53.86 points lower at 2,537.48. 
</P>
<P>
 London's Financial Times 100-share average ended at 3,017.3, down 22.3 points, 
while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average lost 8.08 points to close at 2,038.51. 
In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average lost 15.30 points to finish at 
18,998.30.

WHIRLPOOL STOCK FALLS ON NEWS OF U.S. ANTITRUST INVESTIGATION; PRICING: 
APPLIANCE MAKER HAS BEEN MOST AGGRESSIVE PRICE RAISER IN INDUSTRY. JILTED 
CUSTOMER BEST BUY LEAKED WORD OF THE PROBE. 
</P>

<P>
 In an unusual display of corporate tit-for-tat, Best Buy Co. seems to have 
extracted some revenge on Whirlpool Corp. for dropping Best Buy as a customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Whirlpool's stock fell in heavy trading Friday after word leaked out that it 
was the subject of a federal antitrust probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaker was its jilted former customer, Best Buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department confirmed the existence of a probe. "The antitrust 
division has an ongoing investigation of pricing practices in the large 
home-appliance industry," spokeswoman Gina Talamona said. She declined to be 
more specific. 
</P>
<P>
 County Natwest analyst Nicholas Heymann said the probe, disclosed Thursday, 
could make it difficult for Whirlpool to raise prices, something the company 
needs to do to protect its profits in the face of new challenges from low-cost 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann said Whirlpool has been the most aggressive appliance maker about 
raising prices in the United States and Europe, but the gains have been largely 
offset by heavy promotional expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Whirlpool recently told analysts it intends to reduce promotional spending, 
but it is unclear if retailers will accept higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronics retailer's stock plunged Thursday after it released a 
disappointing third-quarter earnings forecast, then fell even further after a 
report that Whirlpool would no longer supply its Whirlpool appliances to Best 
Buy. 
</P>
<P>
 After the close of trading Thursday, during which Best Buy shares plummeted 
26%, the Minneapolis-based company issued a news release confirming its falling 
out with Whirlpool. 
</P>
<P>
 But tucked into the release was a previously undisclosed fact that Best Buy 
was privy to as a major appliance retailer: Whirlpool is a subject of a federal 
antitrust investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whirlpool spokeswoman Robin Skiles said the company decided to stop selling 
its Whirlpool brand through Best Buy because Best Buy operates largely as a 
discount warehouse operation and this conflicts with Whirlpool's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we put them into a distribution channel that is a price-value channel, 
it's a conflicting message for our brand," Skiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of the government probe, she said Whirlpool believes the 
investigation is focusing on several appliance makers and said Whirlpool is 
cooperating fully. 
</P>
<P>
 Whirlpool shares fell $2.25 Friday to close at $46.50, on volume of 1.08 
million shares.

DISNEYLAND JOURNEYS INTO NEW TERRITORY; ATTRACTIONS: THE INTERACTIVE INDIANA 
JONES ADVENTURE THRILL RIDE, WITH AT LEAST 27 VARIATIONS, WILL TARGET THE 
HANDS-ON GENERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The creators of Disneyland's new Indiana Jones Adventure are banking on it to 
do more than just take visitors deep within the Temple of the Forbidden Eye for 
a hair-raising encounter with Mara, deity of ancient India. 
</P>
<P>
 They're also hoping it holds the key to the Secret of the Eternally Changing 
Theme Park Audience. 
</P>
<P>
 So even though it doesn't open for three months, park officials on Friday gave 
the press an unprecedented walk-through tour of a major attraction in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are they suddenly deviating from the secrecy that usually cloaks each new 
addition until the last dab of paint has dried? 
</P>
<P>
 To get word out early that "this is not just another ride," answered Tony 
Baxter, senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering and one of the key 
creative forces behind Star Tours, Splash Mountain and New Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest difference between the Indiana Jones Adventure and other 
attractions is that this one is, in essence, a large-scale, interactive video 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The third joint project by Disneyland and filmmaker George Lucas (the others 
are Star Tours and the Captain EO 3-D film), Indiana Jones is a conscious 
effort to woo the hands-on, participation-oriented video-game generation, 
Baxter said. "They're used to taking control, pushing the buttons and being 
part of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Pirates of the Caribbean, for instance, the pirates are doing their thing 
and you just eavesdrop on them," Baxter said during an early-morning stroll 
through passageways that look like the walls of a catacomb. "Here, everything 
is happening because of you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything" will include flaming eruptions, collapsing stone ceilings, flying 
darts and, of course, a giant ball of rock that threatens to crush anyone 
attempting to escape the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 But thrills alone weren't considered enough for the attention span of the MTV 
generation. So the Indiana Jones Adventure also includes several branching 
points in its central portion that will, Baxter said, produce 27 variations of 
the journey through the temple. And, the '30s-vintage-looking vehicles that 
take people through will have a changing menu of mishaps that befall them. The 
idea is to give repeat visitors a different experience each time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once guests board those trucks, different paths lead to either the Chamber of 
Earthly Riches, the Fountain of Eternal Youth or the Chamber of Destiny. Each 
room represents one of the gifts that the deity Mara offers to those who adhere 
strictly to the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Along each journey, riders will be faced with infestations of rats, snakes, 
bats, insects or other pests. The ride also borrows generously from the Uncle 
Remus "don't throw me into that brier patch" school of human motivation: Those 
who enter are warned sternly "not to gaze into the eyes of Mara." 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said designers also acknowledged kids' tendency to touch anything 
marked "don't touch." Along the path that brings people into the temple (on 
other rides this is known as "waiting in line"), booby traps will be triggered 
by those who indulge their curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the line into the ride is the most elaborate of any Disneyland 
attraction's, incorporating several hints of what is to come, '30s-style 
newsreel films detailing an archeological dig and much of the equipment used. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the attraction, scheduled to open Feb. 28, will not incorporate 
the voice of Harrison Ford, star of the "Indiana Jones" films. "But we're still 
looking at that," Baxter said. "We'd sure like for him to be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The ride does include the prop truck from the first "Indiana Jones" film, near 
the entrance. Everything else is themed to look like an archeological dig in 
the jungles of India in 1935, from hissing-cobra topped temple columns to a 
fictitious alphabet created for warning messages carved into the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, Baxter said, takes "what at first seemed like a liability and turned 
it into an asset." The liability: how to fit a significant new attraction into 
Disneyland's already tightly packed space. Baxter said the project gave 
designers the opportunity to make the most of that space with multiple levels 
and snaking corridors that can accommodate 2,400 people per hour, the highest 
capacity of any thrill ride at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Space Mountain accommodates 1,800 people an hour; Pirates of the Caribbean, 
not a thrill ride, handles 2,200. A park spokesman said it will take about an 
hour to get from the camp entrance through the Indiana Jones Adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride occupies territory previously part of the Jungle Cruise. A bend in 
the river has been rerouted to make way for the 60,000-square foot building 
that houses the trilevel attraction. The Jungle Cruise entrance has been 
revamped to be thematically more in keeping with the Indiana Jones Adventure 
and to accommodate more people who presumably will drawn to Adventureland 
because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the ride has been estimated at $50 million, a figure that a park 
spokesman would neither confirm nor deny. He said it is the biggest attraction 
in Disneyland's history and that it is the focal point of the first complete 
face-lift for Adventureland since the park opened in 1955.

WILL NEW NIGHT AFFECT 'NORTHERN EXPOSURE'?; TELEVISION: CBS' 'CHICAGO HOPE' 
WILL TAKE THE COVETED MONDAY SPOT AND THE CITIZENS OF CICELY WILL MOVE TO 
WEDNESDAY AT 10 P.M., LEAVING ONE OF THE SHOW'S EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS FEELING OUT 
IN THE COLD.

<P>
 After 3 1/2 years of occupying the coveted Monday 10 p.m. slot on CBS, the 
acclaimed series "Northern Exposure" is about to get exposed on a new night. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Jan. 4, "Northern Exposure" is moving to Wednesdays at 10 p.m., while 
"Chicago Hope," a first-year medical drama that airs Thursdays at 9 p.m., will 
take up residency in the 10 p.m. Monday time slot on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ratings for "Northern Exposure" have declined slightly this 
season, it is still popular, and one of the show's executive producers is less 
than pleased about the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we're disappointed," David Chase said in an interview Friday, saying the 
show has been hurt this season by the popularity of ABC's "Monday Night 
Football." 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday at 10 p.m. was a great time slot for us," Chase said. "I think when 
football is over, we would have continued to do better in that time period. 
It's true that when something is not broken you don't fix it, and our show 
isn't broken. I just hope it isn't damaged by the move." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "However, who knows? This could be the greatest thing that could 
happen to us. And we're more than willing to shoot it out with any show." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesdays, "Northern Exposure" will be up against NBC's popular drama, 
"Law & Order." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift is expected to be part of a schedule overhaul that CBS will announce 
early next week. Among other anticipated changes, sources said, is the 
cancellation of the low-rated "Touched By an Angel," a first-year drama that 
was airing Wednesdays at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to "Northern Exposure," the new Wednesday lineup is expected to 
include "Women of the House," a comedy starring Delta Burke; "Double Rush," a 
comedy with Robert Pastorelli (who played the house painter on "Murphy Brown"), 
and "Love & War," moving over from Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling "Love & War's" slot at 9:30 p.m. Mondays will be "Cybill," a comedy 
starring Cybill Shepard as an actress with two daughters from different 
marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS officials declined to comment Friday on their plans, or on Chase's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 But one network source disputed the notion that "Northern Exposure" was being 
moved to make room for "Chicago Hope," which was created and is produced by 
David Kelley, the Emmy Award-winning producer of "L.A. Law" and CBS' "Picket 
Fences." CBS hopes both shows will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a hit show, and if we're going to rebuild by shoring up other nights, 
this is the perfect show to have as a building block," said the source. "If you 
build it, they will come. The show has a loyal audience that will follow it to 
Wednesdays. We're taking a hit show and moving it to a night where it will 
perform better." 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings for "Northern Exposure," now in its sixth season, are off about 
11% from last year, and the series is undergoing some revamping with the 
imminent departure of star Rob Morrow. It had its best rating of the season 
last Monday and still ranks as the 22nd most popular show on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago Hope," while trounced earlier this season in its head-to-head battle 
with NBC's "ER" on Thursdays at 10 p.m., has shown promise in other time 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chase of the move: "More than anything, this indicates that CBS has more 
than one concern in its life. And we're sympathetic to that. But we would just 
prefer not to leave."

COMMENTARY; NEEDLING A STEREOTYPE; RECENT WORKS CHALLENGE THE AMERICAN VIEW OF 
ART AS FEMININE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beyond being a lavishly endowed recipient of the solemn and empty rhetoric 
known as lip service, the arts do not occupy a place of more than marginal 
prominence in the United States. They never have. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's the art-free curricula found in almost every public school, or 
the nearly complete absence of writers, artists, composers and the rest from 
the nation's civic life, the arts languish on the sidelines of American 
culture. It's easy to see why. The most noteworthy reason Americans don't much 
care about the arts is that, generally, they regard them as a feminine 
activity, not a masculine one. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the stock cartoon-depiction of a culturally minded matron dragging 
her reluctant husband to the opera -- or the museum, theater or concert hall. 
It's a staple of American humor because it speaks an American truth. 
</P>
<P>
 This usually unspoken identification of the arts with feminine activity has 
lots of ramifications. A crucial one is that the arts get invested with the 
same peculiar status traditionally afforded women: They're put up on a 
pedestal, where they won't be in the way for the serious, rough-and-tumble 
business of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 The feminization of culture in the American mind is an issue whose time may be 
at hand. It's a subtext to "Guys Who Sew," a small exhibition on view through 
Dec. 11 at the University Art Museum at UC Santa Barbara. More important, it's 
moving front and center in the work of a few intriguing artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys Who Sew" looks at a recent proliferation of male artists who employ 
needlework -- a medium historically associated with women. Some early feminists 
even heralded needlework as the quintessential women's art for the modern era. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilts, samplers, embroidery -- the idea is that women, traditionally confined 
to the home, found an outlet for creative expression through the only means 
available to them. Usually, that meant the domestic art of sewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Curators Elizabeth A. Brown and Fran Seegull have assembled work by 13 
artists, including Willie Cole, Robert Gober, Georg Herold, Jim Isermann and 
Mike Kelley. For some, such as Isermann's 1993-94 pieced-fabric wall hanging, 
sewing is central to the enterprise. For others, such as Gober's 1989 
dismembered wax leg that wears pants, it's incidental. A Lucas Samaras 
"crazy-quilt painting" from 1979, composed from long, colorful strips of sewn 
fabric, assumes the role of father figure. 
</P>
<P>
 A firm cultural equation between needlework and women's work is essential for 
a show like "Guys Who Sew" to have any frisson. "Gals Who Sew" wouldn't 
generate any sense of trespass. But the stew is even more provocatively 
seasoned by art's repressed aura as itself a feminine activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The feminization of culture in the American psyche has meant that art, in 
order to have any true value, must typically conceal its feminine spirit, often 
behind an exaggerated masculinity. It has needed to be clear that a man -- 
specifically a heterosexual man -- has taken charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys Who Sew," through its funny, swaggering title, lampoons that commonplace 
concealment. Yeah, this is sewing-cum-art, but don't worry: Regular guys are 
doing it ( burp ). 
</P>
<P>
 The inclusion of several artists who are openly gay, and of a number of works 
whose forms pointedly derive from doll clothes, dresses, quilts and other 
culturally feminine things, plainly seeks to short-circuit established 
standards. They play against expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the work of two other artists (not in the Santa Barbara show), an even more 
pointed disruption than this is now being encountered. Rather than play against 
type, as the motif advanced in "Guys Who Sew" generally does, this art means to 
speak with the very language of our otherwise unspoken cultural prejudice. It 
makes explicit our subliminal identification of art with femininity. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Trosch and Sally Elesby make purposefully effeminate painting and 
sculpture. They are avatars of a voluptuousness that brings the feminization of 
culture to the surface. Their work takes the sow's ear attributes typically 
ascribed to women -- weakness, timidity, delicacy, emotionalism -- and sensibly 
remakes them into haute-couture silk purses. 
</P>
<P>
 Trosch, a New York-based artist who had his first solo show in Los Angeles at 
the Ruth Bloom Gallery last year, makes wonderfully fey paintings of cheerful, 
wide-eyed society women in elegant, uptown drawing rooms stuffed with 
avant-garde art. Via cartoony word-balloons, the ladies -- dedicated arbiters 
of taste -- speak with passionate urgency about Ludwig Wittgenstein's aesthetic 
philosophy and Dorothy Rodgers' Park Avenue decorating dictums. 
</P>
<P>
 These fluttery pictures, made by a man, operate with a drag-queen sensibility. 
For the feminine artifice and deception of drag doesn't make fun of women, as 
is often supposed; drag mocks instead the authoritative tastes of straight men. 
</P>
<P>
 Trosch's are, as a friend put it, perhaps the faggiest paintings ever made -- 
and yes, that's meant as a compliment. They luxuriously indulge themselves in 
the feminine role Americans have silently assigned to artistic culture. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in a very different way, do the ecstatic sculptures of Los Angeles-based 
Sally Elesby, seen this fall in a breakout show at Food House. Rather than 
painted drag queens, however, Elesby makes luscious showgirls. 
</P>
<P>
 Her exuberant, non-figurative wall sculptures strut their stuff in clouds of 
tulle, feathers, sequins, satin flowers, rhinestones and ribbon. Elesby arrays 
these seductive materials in serial patterns on wire armatures, melding 
austere, minimalist structure with floozy forms. 
</P>
<P>
 These glamour-puss constructions recall nothing so much as Donald Judd's 
influential, serial wall sculptures of galvanized iron and painted steel from 
the 1960s and after. But his industrially pretty, butch decorativeness has been 
deliriously replaced by her girlish, domestically produced froufrou. Out of 
Judd's garage workshop and into Elesby's sewing room, a rigorous investigation 
of sculptural space has been dramatically recast in a whole new set of terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed by feminist precedent, Trosch's paintings and Elesby's sculptures 
take a radical, necessary step. Think of theirs as "effeminist" art, for a 
culture that would rather not know.

OPERA REVIEW; A TAWDRY, TROUBLED 'TROVATORE' IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where, oh where, are those Marx Brothers when we need them? 
</P>
<P>
 Verdi's "Il Trovatore," which received a sort-of new production at the 
budget-conscious San Francisco Opera this season, is funny enough without the 
help of Harpo, Groucho, Chico and the other Nibelungen. But there is a big 
difference between helpless comedy and inspired foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
 The foolishness at the War Memorial Opera House on Thursday was anything but 
inspired. It was clumsy and tacky -- just the sort of thing that confirms every 
opera-hater's worst prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was decorated, once more, by Gerard Howland, San Francisco's new 
all-purpose el-cheapo designer. For this dark, bloody, tempestuous tale of 
love, passion, betrayal, intrigue, revenge and mistaken identity in 
15th-Century Spain, he came up with a jumble of styles amid kitsch-postcard 
aesthetics: cloud-cutouts to frame the proscenium, irrelevant religious images 
painted in cardboard-Baroque splendor, and clunky quasi-modernist props to 
differentiate primitive locales. The flimsy, arbitrary window-dressing actually 
made one long for the bad old days of wrinkled canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 The costumes, attributed to no one, suggested a desperate though undeniably 
resourceful raid on the local warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The staging scheme, such as it is, was created by John Copley for a different 
cast last September. The current principals, who do not happen to be thespian 
giants, have been told by Paula Williams where to enter, where to stand, when 
to clutch heart or throat and where to collapse or exit. 
</P>
<P>
 This was opera by the numbers. Dull numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tawdry and pretentious charade (top ticket: $120) still might have been 
salvaged, to a degree at least, by great music-making. Or, perhaps, by Divine 
Intervention. No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Robertson, who normally functions as company chorus-master, took over the 
baton from Daniel Oren. He wielded it briskly and lightly, in an ever-efficient 
manner that might befit Donizetti better than Verdi. He didn't do much, 
however, to sustain dramatic vitality or to propel rhythmic urgency. If his 
primary goal was to get home as early as possible, one couldn't blame him. 
</P>
<P>
 The production has been plagued by crucial cast changes from the start. The 
first set of performances found both romantic principals -- Aprile Millo and 
Michael Sylvester -- on the sick list. The chief attraction at the December 
revival was supposed to have been the fascinating Hungaro-German soprano Julia 
Varady (who happens to be the wife of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau), but, true to 
her habit, she found herself available only for a limited number of 
cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace her, San Francisco's adventurous impresarios turned to one 
Zvetelina Vassileva, a possibly terrified neophyte from Sofia, Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 She is very pretty, and she struck fetching poses on Thursday. She earned 
points for restoring "Tu vedrai che amore in terra," a cabaletta most prima 
donnas prefer to omit. Vocally, alas, she teetered on the brink of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Her small and thin soprano turned shrill at the top and all but evaporated at 
the bottom. The arching cantilena defeated her breath supply, and proper pitch 
was a sometime thing in ascending lines. Leonora's lines ascend a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a flight of creative economics, San Francisco had upped the box-office ante 
by $10 per ticket whenever Placido Domingo appeared this season. By consistent 
rights, the management should have offered refunds -- say $7.50 per customer -- 
to acknowledge the value of the latest Slavic import. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the cast was at least competent. With more incisive dramatic and 
musical leadership, the abiding dullness factor might have been diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis O'Neill, the stodgy-portly Manrico on duty, looked and acted pretty 
much like a standard cartoon tenor. Luckily, much of his singing allowed sound 
to overpower sight. He floated ravishing mezza-voce tones when Verdi asked for 
them, and, even without the prescribed trills, was able to make "Ah si, ben 
mio, coll'essere" a poignant reverie. He also mustered a reasonable facsimile 
of climactic power for "Di quella pira" -- both verses for a change -- and 
capped the stretta with a plangent top C (a pitch the glamorous tenorissimi 
avoid via transposition). 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Chernov, James Levine's anointed Verdi-baritone at the Met, turned 
the mellifluously evil Count into a pleasant singing-statue. He produced plenty 
of solid, even, burnished tone, but little dynamic variety and less emotional 
tension. Although "Il balen" emerged as a good demonstration of the art of 
legato phrasing, the aria told us little about Luna's tormented character. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefania Toczyska sang the affecting plaints of Azucena with more force than 
her previous efforts in this repertory had led one to expect. She could hardly 
eradicate memories of her great, fiery, gutsy predecessors in the role -- from 
Stignani to Castagna, Elmo to Barbieri, Simionato to, yes, Zajick. But she did 
perform with informed style, admirable security and reasonable thrust. Under 
the circumstances, one had to be grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Skinner brought ample basso-competence to the narrative platitudes of 
Ferrando. The resident comprimarios were OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson's charges sang the music of the masses lustily for their boss. It it 
would require a higher power, however, to make anyone take that infernal Anvil 
Chorus seriously these days, on either side of the proscenium. On Thursday, the 
quaint crashing and clunking served just one useful purpose: It kept an 
understandably somnolent audience awake, at least for a little while. 
</P>

PERFORMANCE ART; KAREN FINLEY: NAKED TRUTHS ABOUT WOMEN IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jesse Helms' worst nightmare: Karen Finley, be-hatted but otherwise stark 
naked, moaning out a list of injustices to women ("I make 63 cents to your 
dollar. . . . I got my perfume on 'cause a woman needs to keep her smells to 
herself . . . "); describing the death of a 12-year-old who drank Draino 
because she couldn't tell her parents she was pregnant; and telling about the 
night her father hit a baby deer and shot its mother and then ran over them 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to love her. Or at least you've got to be glad she exists, even if 
seeing her once will probably be enough for most people (except, of course, for 
the people who want her banned, and they usually don't get around to seeing her 
at all). 
</P>
<P>
 To recap, Finley came to national prominence in 1990 when the National 
Endowment for the Arts denied her funding after syndicated columnists Rowland 
Evans and Robert Novak (who had never seen her perform) attacked her. 
Apparently her most unforgivable crime was to smear her naked upper torso with 
chocolate to symbolize society's degradation of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley stopped into a temporary performance space in Santa Monica on Thursday 
night to display her distinctive brand of protest art. And while her show, "A 
Certain Level of Denial" (presented by the Santa Monica Museum of Art in 
conjunction with "Power in America," a series of events in observance of Worlds 
AIDS Day and Day Without Art), at times veers dangerously close to parodies of 
this kind of performance, there is little doubt that Karen Finley feels her 
pain. In fact feeling her pain is her art, with all of the egocentrism and 
masochism that implies. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing or lying nude, or sitting at a lectern in pants and a turban, Finley 
rails against prevailing evils, using scenes from her own life to illustrate 
that things are rotten in the state of, well, everywhere. Like a TV 
schizophrenic, she employs two voices: One is low and laced with melodramatic 
vibrato, sounding very much like a Southern evangelist summoning the deepest 
demons in her congregation; the other is a high-pitched, pain-filled tremolo, 
like the ones actresses use when playing grown women forced to relive some 
childhood trauma under hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Karen Finley an extraordinarily sensitive instrument, a woman who has no 
emotional defense against all of the pain in the world? Or is she an exploiter 
and whiny abuser of that pain for her own fame? She claims that karma was 
invented to keep the miserable in a state of acceptance, yet her endless litany 
of complaints seems to indicate, if not a love of, at least an attraction, to 
suffering. ("I've been a mother, a whore and a slave, but never valued by 
anyone," she says at one point. One wants to step in for her imaginary shrink 
in this scene and offer some pertinent advice, such as, "Get over it.") 
</P>
<P>
 After her show had started, a man in a black wig, leather miniskirt and 
stiletto heels entered the theater and stood in the back. While she performed a 
monologue about a friend with AIDS who committed suicide, the man began to sob, 
deeply and loudly. He continued sobbing into her next story, in which she hung 
her head like a catatonic and rocked a toy rocking horse by gently lifting its 
head off its body while recounting a rape by two Chicago policemen. She stopped 
rocking for a moment and said, gently and in a normal, soothing voice, "I hear 
you. I just want to tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 The cynical New Yorker in me wondered if the man was a plant. I don't believe 
he was, and it doesn't matter anyway. At that moment I believed in her pain 
because it wasn't centered on her own anguish. For me, it was Karen Finley's 
finest moment. "I am this country! I am this sickness!" she shrieked at another 
point in the evening, and there is no question that, like her or not, Karen 
Finley serves a purpose in this culture.

JAZZ REVIEW; SMOOTH INTERCHANGES MAKE THE FREEWAY A NICE RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no easy way to describe the Freeway Philharmonic's music. The 
quartet's unusual, string-based instrumentation and eclectic take on its 
material are impossible to slip easily into any one category. 
</P>
<P>
 Because improvisation plays a part in its music, it could be called a jazz 
band. But the instrumentation (there are no horns) and the minor role that jazz 
rhythms play (the group swings at times, but it also waltzes, rocks and does 
the two-step) would seem to make it something other than a jazz combo. 
</P>
<P>
 Its viola, acoustic guitar and Chapman Stick front line (the Stick is a 
12-stringed instrument that looks like a long guitar neck without a body) gives 
the sound a classical flavor at times. But its arrangement of Aaron Copland's 
"Hoedown," with its contemporary leanings, stands at a great distance from the 
composer's original. And even though the group covers the Beach Boys and the 
Beatles, it is too close to jazz and classical styles to be considered a pop 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 Its show Thursday at the Dana Point Cafe neatly demonstrated the Phil's 
versatility. The pastoral sound, neither too loud nor too timid, fit perfectly 
into the cozy setting and suggested that there might be a category for this 
band after all: Call it "wine bar music." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little that demanded strict attention from listeners during the 
pleasant first set, though there was just enough intricacy in the arrangements 
and interplay for those who wanted to look beneath the surface. The foursome, 
together some seven years, falls together in such practiced style that its most 
complex passages arrive with attractive simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With drummer Scott Jackson playing an electronic percussion machine in 
deference to the intimate cafe's acoustics, the quartet sampled heavily from 
its just-released "Sonic Detour" CD (on the audiophile-oriented Sheffield lab 
label). "Bullfrog Rag" featured guitarist Robert Stanton on 12-string, Novi 
Novag's viola dancing against clip-clop percussion, and Larry Tuttle's bass 
lines from the Chapman. At times the piece took on a loose, ragtime feel; at 
others, Novag's viola added touches of bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Albert's Go-Kart" continued the rhythmic and tonal variations with Tuttle's 
Chapman adding both bass line and synthesized guitar effects. Novag took a 
short improvisation during the number that was neither too aggressive nor 
somnolent. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's fun-loving side came through in its pop arrangements. Tuttle 
developed a long string-section introduction before the group swung into 
"Eleanor Rigby." "Good Vibrations" closed on a tightly played line from James 
Brown's "I Feel Good." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hoedown" was the most varied piece of the set, including not only portions of 
Copland's high-stepping theme but also touches of "Old Folks at Home" and rural 
color from Stanton's jew's-harp. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood became more somber as Stanton moved to a nylon-stringed guitar for 
his own "Lullaby of Tears," a moody piece that at times suggested Brahms' 
famous lullaby. But that tempered frame of mind dissipated quickly as the four 
responded with the upbeat theme from "The Bugs Bunny Show." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of playful contrast defines the Phil's approach: The band is not too 
much of any one thing. The musicianship is fine but never so technically 
oriented that it becomes inaccessible. The band works in a host of musical 
styles, melding them in a pleasant hybrid that never becomes too emotional, one 
way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 But such evenhandedness might present problems for those who want more 
dynamics and feeling in their music. The Freeway Philharmonic plays a smooth 
soundtrack to modern life but doesn't reflect its more intense demands or Angst 
-producing situations. Need a breather from the harried pace? Try the Freeway.

 Auction High Point: Collectors spent more than $25 million on 172 paintings, 
drawings and sculptures at Sotheby's in New York on Thursday, bringing the 
auction house its most lucrative sale of American works in five years. The 
night's top lot was Childe Hassam's "Poppies," which sold for more than $2.6 
million, nearly doubling its pre-estimate of $1.4 million. Other big-ticket 
works were William Merritt Chase's "Seaside Flowers" ($2.4 million), George 
Bellows' "Dock Builders" ($1.4 million) and Georgia O'Keeffe's "Jimson Weed" 
($1 million). In addition, each of 16 Norman Rockwell works offered were sold, 
bringing in nearly $1.7 million for the group. The sale set records for several 
artists, including Fitz Hugh Lane, whose "Ships at Sunrise" went for $910,000, 
six times its high estimate of $150,000. TELEVISION

"Spic-o-Rama," and co-stars with Wesley Snipes in the coming film "To Wong 
Foo." The show will air at 8:30 p.m., the slot that has lately been filled with 
the second of back-to-back episodes of "The Simpsons." "Buggin' " is often 
referred to as a Latino version of "In Living Color." Fox also has another

DANCE REVIEW; A BOLD 'NUTCRACKER' FROM CHAMBER BALLET

 Forget Christmas card nostalgia. From its Bauhaus-style snowflake-tutus to the 
"Blond Ambition" bra on Mother Ginger, the brand-new L.A. Chamber Ballet 
"Nutcracker" adopts a boldly 20th-Century theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
 Danced to tape in its premiere at Cal State L.A. on Thursday, the production 
set the Christmas party scene against flat geometric panels that could suddenly 
open up to become a doorway, a box holding doll-dancers -- or a saw-toothed 
abstraction of a Christmas tree.

 Later on, set designer Yu-Ming Chien offered a gigantic origami mobile in 
place of the usual snow forest and a series of descending brass clock faces to 
decorate the rather chilly, wide-open vistas of Candyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Chien's taste for emblematic simplicity didn't stand a chance 
against the blitz of neo-Expressionist effects launched by costume designer 
Francine Lecoultre -- an astonishing spectacle on its own terms, perhaps, but 
seldom suited to either the distinctive linear shapes of classical ballet or 
the curiously traditional version of the story line adopted by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, choreographer Laurence Blake couldn't tell that story clearly -- 
much less create dances that defined character -- so all the modernist hoopla 
of the staging ended up utterly hollow. Little Marie, the mysterious 
Drosselmeyer and the rest never came alive -- they just kept punching out 
flashy steps in flashy costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his ensemble choreography suffered from the attempt to make Marie a 
constant participant in the action rather than a mere observer, Blake clearly 
responded to the feverish drive of these passages in the score with a surge of 
genuine invention. And his Mouse battle blazed with resourceful stagecraft. But 
the last act divertissement provided little beyond hand-me-down platitudes -- 
including a standard-issue pas de deux for a guest ballerina. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Sylvia Rico brought impressive warmth, ease and technical surety to 
her Sugar Plum duties, looking radiant even when Eric Skinner mismanaged a lift 
and nearly dropped her. Besides being Rico's accident-prone cavalier, Skinner 
served capably as the Nutcracker soldier and prince, a character very much in 
the shadow of Drosselmeyer in this version. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even Drosselmeyer had no real narrative function after the party 
scene, and all of Francois Perron's technical authority in the role counted for 
little under the circumstances. As Marie, Carol Guidry worked doggedly to forge 
connections between characters and scenes, eventually resembling the desperate 
hostess of some deadly party. 
</P>
<P>
 John Funk proved equally convincing as a hot, wiggly Mouse King and a cool, 
slinky Arabian dancer. But the most memorable transformation of the evening 
involved veteran Royal Ballet character dance paragon Stanley Holden as Mother 
Ginger. A purple-haired, post-punk, music hall vision with nine kiddies hidden 
under his skirts, Holden set the seal on a production ultimately more focused 
on dressing outrageously than with dancing, storytelling or the Christmas 
spirit.

SOME VAMPIRE VIDEOS THAT BLOOD HOUNDS CAN COUNT ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the fang-and-cape monsters prowling through "Interview With the 
Vampire," the oddest has to be Louis, a depressed thing who prefers drinking 
blood from poodles rather than people. His adopted daughter, a darling 
kiddie-vamp, is close. She's cranky now and then, but at least she's not so 
finicky -- grown-ups taste just fine, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, one thing you can say about this spurting, dripping, giggling film 
adaptation of Anne Rice's novel is that it has some very strange incarnations 
of the old Dracula legend. But they're certainly not the first. Hollywood and 
beyond have been providing peculiar vampires for years. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a blood-lover and his loyal blood-loving dog? Then there's the New 
Yorker who may or may not be a vampire, but, just to make sure, he buys a pair 
of novelty teeth before stalking prey in Central Park. You demand affirmative 
action? Black jugular-biters have turned up in a couple of movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding these suckers shouldn't be hard. You don't need a Renfield or a Van 
Helsing, just the clerk at the local video store, especially if it's fully 
stocked. Here's a rundown of some of the stranger, more obscure vampire flicks 
available -- some decent, some horrible, some frightening, some merely 
hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 * For camp value, there's "Dracula's Dog," which came out in 1978. It seems 
the original Count had nothing better to do, so he nibbled on a neighborhood 
hound named Zoltan. The mutt, now growling with vampire lust, heads to Los 
Angeles with another vampire to search out relatives of the first Dracula. Yes, 
this movie's a keeper, as nutty as it sounds. It was released with the snappier 
title, "Zoltan, Hound of Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
 * In "Vampire's Kiss" (1989), Nicolas Cage plays a yuppie who has more than a 
passionate one-night stand with a woman he believes is a vampire. Cage thinks 
he's one too, but it may all be in his head, just a manic extension of his 
womanizing and self-involvement. Cage is hilarious -- besides those fake 
incisors, he works that slab of a face of his into some amazing vampiric 
contortions. Although probably too kinky for mainstream viewers, "Vampire's 
Kiss" is a cartoonish metaphor with bite. 
</P>
<P>
 * The only black Dracula to ever rise from the grave is at the furiously 
pumping heart of "Blacula" (1972). A black prince from somewhere far away is 
bitten by a vampire, then takes to roaming the streets of Los Angeles, 
apparently a favorite destination for Transylvanians. This cheapie actually has 
a few shocking scenes, and director William Crain takes an opportunity or two 
to investigate the hip, urban black environment of the early '70s. It spawned a 
stupid sequel, "Scream, Blacula, Scream!," in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Vampire Lovers," which came out in 1971, is one of the most erotic 
takes on the legend. It should be, featuring as it does lesbian vampires on the 
make for both sensual and liquid thrills. Peter Cushing is featured in this, 
one of the handful of his popular Dracula films made in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 * An amusing follow-up, for often unintentional reasons, is "Twins of Evil" 
(1972). Get this: beautiful twins are nice to look at, but one of them is a 
vampiress devoted as much to mayhem as she is to lingerie. The local citizenry 
can't tell the women apart, a major disadvantage. Almost notable for starring 
Playboy's first twin playmates, Madeleine and Mary Collinson. 
</P>
<P>
 * A true bomb, and funny just because it's so explosively rotten, is "Vampire 
Men of the Lost Planet." This movie, which soiled drive-in theaters in 1970, 
melds sci-fi with bloodletting. Vampire attacks have scientists annoyed and 
confused until they trace them to a distant planet where this sort of thing 
goes on all the time. A jumble of filmed sequences and stock footage from other 
flicks is used by schlock director Al Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are partial to other foul offerings by Adamson, there's "Dracula vs. 
Frankenstein" (1970). In this, the last movie in the long careers of both Lon 
Chaney Jr. and J. Carroll Naish, Adamson tries to yank a satire from the jaws 
of terror. The plot finds an aging Dracula making a deal with an aging Dr. 
Frankenstein for a lifetime's supply of blood. This is bad, very bad; recommend 
it to an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The French got involved in 1979 with "Dracula and Son," a mild comedy. 
Christopher Lee stars as the Count, and Bernard Menez shows up as his 
boneheaded son. A crude, jokey style permeates the throaty misadventures as 
father and offspring fight for the affections of a gorgeous babe. 
</P>
<P>
 * More extraterrestrial madness can be found in "Not of This Earth," the 1988 
remake of Roger Corman's 1957 movie of the same name, which isn't on video. The 
more recent offering follows the first's plot closely, centering on an alien 
vampire who comes to Earth to collect blood for his nuclear war-ravaged home 
planet. Former porn diva Traci Lords makes a brief appearance as a 
tight-skirted nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 * The original "Nosferatu" (1922) is the first vampire and perhaps the 
greatest. F.W. Murnau's silent classic doesn't offer a suave or sympathetic 
monster (he's not the Bela Lugosi of the far more famous "Dracula" from 1931), 
just a blood-hungry pervert who is demented and, with his mad great-goblin 
features and scythe-like fingers, very creepy to look at. 
</P>
<P>
 A sequel didn't come along until 1979, when respected German director Werner 
Herzog made "Nosferatu the Vampyre." Klaus Kinski is eerie as a Dracula with a 
heart almost as big as his choppers; Kinski is able to be spooky and vaguely 
sympathetic at the same time. Herzog also evokes some of the expressionistic 
flavor that helped make the original so compellingly alien.

FOND MEMORIES OF CAB CALLOWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a publicist in New York in the '40s and '50s, I was fortunate to represent 
a number of the great talents of the musical world, including Cab Calloway. 
</P>
<P>
 I handled his publicity at a time when he was in a popularity decline, and my 
most vivid memory of that association was the time I "gave him away" as a prize 
on the TV quiz show "Stop the Music."He had just returned from a disastrous 
engagement in a Philadelphia nightclub, where business had been terrible; I 
proposed that he needed more exposure on the new electronic medium, television. 
Unlike some clients, he listened and cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, "Stop the Music" was one of the most popular programs on TV, 
giving away prizes to people on the telephone who could correctly identify the 
name of a song the orchestra was playing. I proposed to the producers that 
instead of merchandise, they "give away" Calloway and the band for one night. 
(Calloway and the band, of course, were to perform on the program each week 
until there was a winner.) Calloway and the producers readily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 After about three or four weeks of national exposure on "Stop the Music," 
Calloway and the band were "awarded" to an elderly couple in Providence, R.I. 
They had them play at a benefit dance for their church, but first we had them 
perform at the couple's tiny home, seated on cases of canned foods, appliances 
and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, the band returned to that club in Philadelphia, and it filled 
so quickly that the ropes were up nightly by 9. 
</P>
<P>
 I can say, without hesitation, that he was a wonderful man and a delight as a 
client. I already miss him.

TV'S FUTURE NEEDS TO REMEMBER ITS PAST; PROGRAMMING: GRANT TINKER, THE MAN WHO 
TURNED NBC AROUND A DECADE AGO, SAYS, 'THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A MARKET FOR 
THE KIND OF TELEVISION WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way Grant Tinker sees it, TV technology may be leaping ahead in new and 
exotic forms, but a key to the success of the developing and futuristic 
alternatives could well be good, original, mainstream series in the network 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are coming to realize they have to have something to deliver," the 
former NBC chairman said in an interview. "That was sort of forgotten for a 
couple of years while people (companies) ran around and desperately tried to 
marry each other and merge and acquire so that nobody was going to be left 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of future programming that captures his imagination, even in the 
high-tech world, is "quality programming, the kinds of things that succeeded 
for us at NBC -- the 'Cheers' and the 'Hill Street Blues' and the 'St. 
Elsewheres.' I'm not talking about the niche programming -- fly fishing and 
bridge playing -- that are going to be in the narrow channels of the universe 
that's to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking, and have thought for some time, that the one thing that people 
have not looked ahead to anticipate delivering is the kind of programming we've 
all grown up with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tinker touches on this area of contemplation in his new book, "Tinker in 
Television: From General Sarnoff to General Electric," written with his 
longtime friend and former head of corporate communications for NBC, Bud 
Rukeyser. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conversation at a Westside restaurant, Tinker said that the kind of 
programming he is thinking of would "be delivered variously. There are people 
competing right now -- cable and fiber optics and direct broadcast satellites 
and over-the-air and on-line. The networks are sort of healthier at the moment 
than they were a year or so ago, but they're not going to stay healthy forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I've been wondering: Who is going to collect the resources to make a 
'Hill Street Blues' or 'NYPD Blue' or 'ER' or 'Cheers'? I'm talking about new 
stuff," says Tinker. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he think that viewers who have received such traditional, large-scale, 
commercial new series for free on the traditional networks will now buy them? 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll have to," he says. "What else are they going to look at? They'll look 
at sports and they'll look at news and they'll look at movies -- but that only 
goes so far. There's always going to be a market for the kind of television 
we've always known." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinker stops short of flat-out predicting what is to come, making clear -- 
like other TV executives, even those on the extreme cutting edge of the 
medium's future -- that he is no absolute seer. 
</P>
<P>
 But several of his notable accomplishments in TV make his thoughts on 
programming and the structure of the business -- now and possibly in the future 
-- intriguing. He guided the jewel of TV's production companies, MTM 
Enterprises ("The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Hill Street Blues," "Lou Grant," 
"The Bob Newhart Show"), and led the rebuilding of the all-but-dead NBC from 
1981-86. 
</P>
<P>
 These significant television efforts are "two things I'm very proud of," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have remained chairman of NBC when its parent company, RCA, was 
bought by General Electric, but he wanted out. He tried producing some new 
series, including a number of shows for CBS, but they didn't fly, although he 
believes that two of the dramas -- "WIOU" and "TV 101" -- might have caught on 
if given more time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He decided several years ago to get out of "the business that I loved -- the 
independent production business, where you could truly be, as MTM was, 
independent, living on your own income, not using (studio) money or reimbursal 
-- because it was dead, for economic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he ever think of reteaming on projects with his former program chief at 
NBC, Brandon Tartikoff, after their years together as a remarkably successful 
and popular TV duo? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," says Tinker. "Actually, I sold Brandon a show that's become the world's 
most popular -- 'Baywatch' -- which he chose to cancel." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last few years, Tinker was involved in writing his book, a breezy, 
personal account of his years in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to Tinker, it quickly becomes clear that although he decided to pull 
out of "the business that I loved," he still retains his typically quiet 
passion for TV, especially the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 He jokes that, at 68, "I'm Christmas past," but in fact he is not infrequently 
approached by network executives and producers to sit down and discuss the 
business as a kind of elder statesman of TV. And he likes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I maintain good relationships with people like (CBS Entertainment President) 
Peter Tortorici and all the guys -- Warren Littlefield (president of NBC 
Entertainment) and Ted Harbert (president of ABC Entertainment). They're all 
very good at what they do. And I'm past going over to sell them shows. Nor am I 
interested in producing shows. But I love to sit with guys like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to be one of those as-you-get-older-people who say, 'We used to do 
it better in the old days.' The truth is, they're in a more difficult business 
today. The audience is fragmented. From a network standpoint, it's two-thirds 
of what it was for most of my working life." 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of problems do the network chiefs have? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," says Tinker, "they're different. Peter at the moment has a problem 
more like the one I inherited in 1981. At ABC, they're doing very well. And 
NBC, as we've seen this fall, has had a resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "CBS clearly has two jobs to do: One is to get more audience and a better 
(younger) demographic audience, and that's not easy. But it's do-able. I know 
it's do-able because we did it in the '80s at NBC. So Peter should take some 
comfort from that. NBC is running very competitively with ABC in that 
demographic area (of 18-to-49-year-old viewers), which is bottom-line 
connected." 
</P>
<P>
 At his former network, NBC, Tinker thinks the need is "to consolidate some of 
the success they've been having." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was blatantly, overly promotional for them to spend (two) 
mornings of the 'Today' show on the 'ER' set. There's an awful lot of that 
creeping into TV, as we know. If you've already got the hit show of the season, 
you don't have to send Bryant (Gumbel) and Katie (Couric) out here for two days 
on that set. It may have been a commercially good thing to do, but I didn't 
think it was a classy thing to to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, he adds, now is "the biggest and best of all the networks. They clearly 
run their store very well. Their owned stations are head-and-shoulders above 
the other guys. So there's huge income there. And with things like getting into 
ESPN (ABC has a piece of several cable channels) and what-not, they've 
diversified and acquired very well. I mean, they've got a huge business, not 
just a network." 
</P>
<P>
 The position of ABC grew even stronger this week when it allied itself with 
the new "Dream Team" production company of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and David Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Tinker, he likes "the obvious shows" such as "Seinfeld," "NYPD Blue," 
"Law & Order," "60 Minutes" and HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" -- an example of 
the new series being developed on TV's alternative channels. He also likes 
"both the medical shows" -- NBC's "ER" and CBS' "Chicago Hope" -- "which, as 
I've said, were badly scheduled against each other." CBS has since moved 
"Chicago Hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinker is disturbed by such tabloid series as "Hard Copy," by the 
proliferation of reality programs, by "much of the subject matter" on daytime 
talk shows and by local news -- "the preoccupation with the negative: the 
violent, the bloody, the sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 He tosses out a thought. He wonders what would happen "if one network decided 
to suddenly have a policy -- 'We're going to do news the way it used to be 
done, not wall-to-wall carnage' -- and stuck to that resolve, and kept doing 
it. I would like to see whether those stations in those markets wouldn't begin 
to succeed. And I think that they're all afraid to try it."

MUSIC REVIEW; CHANTICLEER'S CHRISTMAS PROGRAM A BIT TOO POLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holiday cheer played very little part in Chanticleer's Christmas concert 
Thursday night at the Wadsworth Theater. Instead, the 12-man a cappella vocal 
group, now in its 17th year, presented a subdued program that never soared 
beyond a patina of studied refinement. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish and admirable control oozed from every moment. The San Francisco-based 
ensemble brought reliable intonation, pristine enunciation and an ever-balanced 
blend to readings of works from the Renaissance and the 20th Century, as well 
as to familiar carols. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet technical perfection emerged as emotional detachment, even in David 
Conte's "Charm Me Asleep," based on Robert Herrick's poem "To Music -- To 
Becalm his Fever," in which an ailing protagonist begs music to ease his pain 
by lulling him into death. Noting that the concert fell on World AIDS 
Recognition Day, director Joseph Jennings prefaced this piece by pausing "to 
remember, to reflect, to hope and, if you so desire, to pray." 
</P>
<P>
 Awareness was clearly not the problem. The choice of compositions and 
arrangements -- steadfastly conservative in their harmonies and almost all 
drawing on the choir's fluid legato -- contributed greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, throughout the evening, the singers themselves -- modest voices that 
never ventured past mezzo forte, and that consistently emphasized the higher 
ranges -- achieved an insubstantial gloss.

DANCE REVIEW; S.F.'S 'ROMEO AND JULIET'S' PASSION BUILDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virtually a whole new cast of principal performers were dancing fast and dying 
young in "Romeo and Juliet" on Thursday, the second night of this week's San 
Francisco Ballet engagement at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed at first as if the fate of the eponymous lovers was to be upstaged 
by David Justin as the far lustier Mercutio -- a role always in danger of 
making a straightforward balcony scene seem dull. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the more Romeo and Juliet's stars got crossed, the more Tina 
LeBlanc and David Palmer grew into their roles. The problem was never 
technique: Palmer's turns were often impressive, while LeBlanc danced with a 
sweet precision and harmonious ease. But in the balcony scene, their love 
seemed like an innocuous crush. It needed the kind of tension you get from 
moments of suddenness and surrender, and nuanced phrasing that conveys a 
singular desire you can't bear to imagine destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, LeBlanc, in particular, blossomed in distress; her limbs no longer 
stretched in vague happiness but found impassioned directness, pleading with 
her parents, collapsing in despair, reaching and drawing away from the poison. 
In the tomb, the couple's dramatic choices were finally, beautifully effective. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mercutio, Justin's passion never flagged as he made his way through 
prancing, flirting and sword-fighting duties. Justin is a fully embodied 
dancer, able to incorporate his sharply correct pirouettes and beautifully 
buoyant leaps into a foolhardy, likable character. As often happens with a good 
Mercutio, surrounding characters appeared somewhat drained of life by 
comparison, even before the bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Peter Brandenhoff held his own as the mild-mannered Benvolio, 
and Jorge Esquivel provided a strong contrast as a very tense Tybalt. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Romeo and Juliet," presented by the San Francisco Ballet at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center, 135 N. Grand Ave. Remaining performances 
(with differing casts) today at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2. Tickets $15-$50 at 
box office. (213) 972-7211. JENNIFER FISHER

 "Tell me a story." Sometimes we just want to let our imagination switch into 
overdrive and, through the mind's eye, paint a picture with words. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive entertainment has acquired new meaning through one of the oldest 
forms of communication -- storytelling, and no batteries are required. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words, Wisdom and Wit" is the first of a series of live spoken-word concerts 
for and by adults to be presented tonight at 8 at the Beverly Hills Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight Los Angeles-based storytellers will be featured at the event, including 
With Our Words (WOW) founding member Milbre Burch. 
</P>
<P>
 Burch, a nationally known raconteuse, describes storytelling as a live and 
healing art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Storytelling arose in a time in the world when society was a tightly woven 
fabric," Burch said. "What happens during your life stays with you; 
storytelling is that reweaving of the fabric, and people have been hungering 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Burch said that most adults assume that storytelling is primarily for 
children, and equate it with baby-sitting, but many are pleasantly surprised, 
for the experience is not what they expected. "Adults come away from a 
performance saying, 'Gosh, I enjoyed that!' " Burch said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an audience, adults are more polite than children, Burch explained. "Adults 
will be very nice to you, but children are more vocal. They'll just say, 'I 
hate that already!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled to appear at Saturday's performance are Karen Golden, Phyllis 
Applegate, Vicki Juditz, Angela Lloyd, Kathleen Zundell, Leslie Perry and 
Willie Sims. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmy nominee Applegate is a storyteller who has toured the United States and 
Europe with her one-woman shows "The Horn of Plenty" and "Sheroes." During the 
Vietnam War, she brought her USO show to the American forces and received a 
commendation from the late Gen. Creighton Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate said that through her performances she connects with people. 
"Storytelling has a magic, a beauty all its own," Applegate said. "It brings 
out the extraordinary things that ordinary people do." 
</P>

A MODERN JUXTAPOSITION IN 'HERCULES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even in a town noted for the eccentricity of its art, Charles Garabedian's 
seems quirky. These days he's seen as a forerunner of the neo-Expressionism of 
the '80s, but neither before nor since has he been identified with any set 
style or movement. He just works away producing compelling images that appear 
more or less bumbled together. 
</P>
<P>
 A current exhibition of about 20 large paintings at the L.A. Louver Gallery 
pursues the theme "The Labors of Hercules." There's an almost humorous 
disjuncture between the classical heroic theme and Garabedian's entirely ad hoc 
style. Its like imagining a "Venus and Adonis" by the Douanier Rousseau.  
</P>
<P>
 This kind of grand subject isn't new to Garabedian. He's always grappled with 
the paradoxical relationship between gritty reality and sublimated myth. His 
previous show was devoted to the Odyssey. There was a lot of battle-scene gore 
in it but it came across with the innocence of an ancient James Thurber 
cartoon. In it a fencer has just decapitated his opponent. The severed head 
says, "Touche." Garabedian's a lot like that. 
</P>
<P>
 The present show is more lyrical. Its leitmotif image is probably "Amazons in 
Albania." In it two figures lie recumbent in an Italian Renaissance square in 
forced perspective. A horse rears in one corner like something out of Uccello. 
Edges are rendered in a stuttering line and hues are as liquid as watercolor. 
It's a picture that joins a Renaissance Italian like Mantegna to a modern one 
like Di Chirico, bringing out the culture's smiling weariness and charm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garabedian's quotations from old master art seem as unlikely as his classical 
themes. Turned inside-out they point to the piston that drives his aesthetic 
engine. Its basic attitude is one of populist egalitarianism. This is an 
Everyman art that seems to say, "Just a second. I don't wish to be presumptuous 
but I believe a regular citizen like myself has something to say about these 
matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he's as direct as in "In the Ocean Stream," in which a little fire 
evokes early Matisse and his sophisticated grasp of the primal. At other 
moments Garabedian is philosophically oblique and discursive. "Hercules and 
Antaeus" includes an image recalling Pollaiuolo's famous little sculpture of 
the subject and sets it next to another based on Manet's paintings of the 
American Civil War vessel the Kearsarge.  
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely juxtaposition carries the idea of violent solutions to human 
conflicts across the gulf of time. There's an unflinching gentleness about this 
art. It's baffled and bemused by the human condition but never tries to hide 
either its beauty or its ugliness. 
</P>

ZEPPELIN'S JONES, GALAS TRY NEW TERRAIN; POP BEAT: THE UNLIKELY PAIR JOINS 
FORCES TO CREATE A SOUND JUST OUTSIDE THE REALM OF TRADITIONAL ROCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The collaboration of ex-Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones and 
confrontational vocalist Diamanda Galas may seem as freakish as a double cream 
and battery acid smoothie. But remember, before Elvis peanut butter and banana 
sandwiches were considered outlandish too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's less surprising once you hear what we've done," says Jones, 48. "I do 
believe there are some people at our shows going, 'What the hell are you 
doing?' But fortunately, they're the minority." 
</P>
<P>
 While the much-publicized reunion of Jones' ex-band mates Jimmy Page and 
Robert Plant finds the two milking old Zeppelin songs for all they're worth, 
Jones -- who was never even contacted about the venture -- is veering off into 
new terrain with Galas on their album "The Sporting Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Galas, who perform at the Wadsworth Theater on Sunday, meet on a 
bizarre plain just outside the realm of traditional rock, and bring with them a 
bristling edge of dark humor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Galas lets her many dramatic voices rip, sounding as if she's channeling 
dozens of turbulent souls through her thin frame, while Jones -- playing 
eight-string bass and lap steel guitar, co-writing half the songs and producing 
the record -- provides a weighty foundation of menacing blues and rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is not only comfortable with the pairing, but also draws parallels 
between his recent and past work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zeppelin was always known at the time, at least I thought, as being 
innovative and exciting on stage," says Jones, who hooked up with Galas last 
year at the urging of a mutual friend. "We're doing both of those things. It's 
basically a rock act with some blues, some soul. . . . Like Zeppelin, we cover 
a lot of bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Zeppelin split in 1980, Jones has played with Brian Eno, written music 
for R.E.M., produced a Butthole Surfers record and scored several films, among 
other endeavors. He's been a fan of Galas since his wife introduced him to the 
artist's 1982 debut album, but Zeppelin is something Galas only recently 
discovered.  
</P>
<P>
 While Jones was playing "Stairway to Heaven" to stadiums full of kids in the 
'70s, the San Diego-born Galas was honing her performances in subterranean 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years back I was touring with some people who were listening to 
Zeppelin a lot," she says in a separate interview. "I kept saying, 'Damn, what 
is this? The bass and drums are just killer!' They said it's the Jones and 
(John) Bonham rhythm section, and I thought 'Now that's the kind of power I'm 
looking for.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' presence has brought a lot of new fans into the dramatic realm of 
Galas, and has also given Jones a chance to spread his wings a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be doing something that's 'out there,' that's challenging," Jones 
says. "It's not some airy, weird stuff, but instead hard, uncompromising and 
ultimately satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 * Galas and Jones play Sunday at the Wadsworth Theater, Veterans 
Administration grounds, Brentwood, 8 p.m. $26 and $23. (310) 825-2101.

 Jac Zinder: L.A.'s underground music scene lost a major catalyst last week 
when promoter, deejay and critic Jac Zinder died in an automobile accident on 
Thanksgiving. Zinder, whose Fuzzyland was one of the city's coolest and most 
eccentric clubs, had been supporting obscure and offbeat bands since his days 
as a sound man at the Anticlub in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his full devotion to the weird, he went on to set up his own shows 
and tiny clubs (including Third Eye) wherever there was space, supporting such 
bands as L7, Beck and Extra Fancy along the way. As a deejay he was able to 
spin everything from lounge tunes to Middle Eastern mantras and make them 
danceable. Zinder, 33, also wrote for the L.A. Weekly seemingly about every 
form of music around.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Jac's) tireless work at making a cool underground will be missed," said L7's 
Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner in a faxed statement. "We can't count the number 
of times we'd see him around town passing out flyers for some truly bizarre 
show or club he'd concocted. He was a master patron of the obscure and absurd. 
We'll miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial performance is being organized for next Saturday at the site of 
Fuzzyland: Mr. T's Bowl, 5621 Figueroa St. in Highland Park.

TV REVIEWS; BIBLICAL DUPLICITY IN TNT'S 'JACOB' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of Jacob, as recounted in the book of Genesis, is filled with even 
more twists than the average Old Testament tale, thanks to the astonishing 
levels of duplicity resorted to by its principals. The amount of sheer lying 
that occurs therein -- even (especially?) by the hero and his beloved -- has on 
occasion confounded Sunday school teachers, but, of course, is just the sort of 
double-dealing that helps drive a good TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is where TNT's "Jacob" steps up to the ladder. As the second in a series 
of Bible sagas made into telefilms, "Jacob" enjoys the distinct advantages (at 
least in television terms) of not only having a younger, handsomer leading man 
than the earlier "Abraham" but also of operating from source material full of 
sex, lies and combat with angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Jacob (Matthew Modine) gets his hip thrown out of joint by that 
wrasslin' heavenly messenger near the climax, he has a lot to learn. At the 
start, he's a mama's boy, a conscientious but bitter lad encouraged by his 
mother to steal his hunkier, hairier brother Esau's (Sean Bean) birthright. 
This he does by disguising himself as Esau just long enough to fool his 
sightless father, Isaac, and receive the blessing that will lead to the 
establishment of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad blood inevitably ensues, and the shamed-yet-blessed Jacob runs for his 
life to uncle Laban's (Giancarlo Giannini) outpost, where he works for nothing 
for seven years in return for the promise of landing Laban's lithesome daughter 
Rachel (Lara Flynn Boyle).  
</P>
<P>
 Sir Peter Hall, longtime leader of Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company and 
National Theatre, keeps the story moving at just the right clip, without an 
undue amount of narrative embellishment. This desert saga (lensed in Morocco) 
is a little on the dry side, though; surely there's dark humor inherent in 
these turnabouts that could've stood to be played up some. 
</P>
<P>
 And Modine, though creditable in a tough gig, never is quite able to convey a 
passion that would lead a fellow to engage in fisticuffs with a divine 
emissary. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, though, "Jacob" admirably strikes the near-impossible 
balance hoped for: a biblical telefilm textually faithful and sober enough to 
work as a church study tool and just saucy enough to suffice as the stuff of 
which movies of the week are made. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Jacob" airs on TNT Sunday at 5, 7 and 9 p.m., with repeat broadcasts 
Wednesday and Dec. 10, 11, 14 and 17. CHRIS WILLMAN

TV REVIEWS; 'RETURN OF NATIVE' EVOKES SOME OF HARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Hardy, the great Victorian novelist, should perhaps remain locked up 
between the covers of a book. The camera isn't easily drawn to the density and 
moody, pessimistic tone of his work, as evidenced by earlier screen adaptations 
of "Far From the Madding Crowd" and "Tess of the D'Urbervilles." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hardy (1840-1928) is such a wonderful unraveler of thick plots and 
memorable characters that filmmakers keep trying. Now "Hallmark Hall of Fame" 
has tackled Hardy's classic 1878 novel of the English countryside, "The Return 
of the Native," the first time the story has been put to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The British movie, with young, comparatively fresh faces (except for the 
indomitable Joan Plowright), looks like Hardy and it quacks like Hardy but it's 
not Hardy. It's the surface of Hardy, which still isn't bad for prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 The adaptation (by Robert W. Lenski, acclaimed for such "Hallmark" scripts as 
"O Pioneers!" and "Decoration Day") is on the sodden side and, perhaps out of 
necessity, too deeply trimmed and telescoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in Exmoor, England, the atmosphere is keenly realized, unfolding on this 
"graveyard of a heath," to quote the sensuous, mysterious Eustacia Vye 
(Catherine Zeta Jones, who may remind some of a young Vivien Leigh). She's the 
muse who spreads her deadly allure and whom one attractive admirer (Clive Owen) 
insists "doesn't even breathe the same air as most women." 
</P>
<P>
 As the entitled native who returns to his bleak village, the openhearted Clym 
Yeobright (Ray Stevenson) is catapulted into a disastrous marriage and goes 
blind. In a Hardy novel, where people are buffeted around by nature, anything 
that can go wrong will. 
</P>
<P>
 But, crucially, little of the novel's depth and brooding heart spill through, 
which isn't so much the fault of the writer or director (Jack Gold) as it is 
the intractable problems in transferring Hardy's rigorous vision to film. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Return of the Native" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

 Move Over, Perry Como, *** VARIOUS ARTISTS ,"The Unplugged Collection" Warner 
Bros.  
</P>
<P>
 There aren't any Christmas songs here, but this may be the best seasonal 
variety special since Perry Como's network heyday: 16 performances -- 11 never 
before on album -- collected from the trend-setting MTV acoustic music series, 
with a top-notch roster including R.E.M., Neil Young, Don Henley, Elton John, 
Paul Simon and Paul McCartney. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, "Collection" (due in stores Tuesday) is not just a hodgepodge of 
tracks, but an expertly programmed set. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening with blues tunes by Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton and Lenny 
Kravitz's surprising reworking of "Are You Gonna Go My Way" as a John Lee 
Hooker-like stomp, each rich performance leads nicely to the next,  
</P>
<P>
 Among the other previously only-on-TV highlights: Henley's emotional rendering 
of "Come Rain or Come Shine" and selections from Elvis Costello, k.d. lang and 
Soul Asylum . . . and not a clunker among them. New albums are rated on a scale 
of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars 
(excellent).

TV REVIEWS; GOOFY LEARNING ON 'TIME TRAVELERS'

<P>
 The Fox network, which has basked in the critical success of its Saturday 
morning educational cartoon series "Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?," today 
is adding another children's edutainment program to its weekend roster. Sort 
of.Actually, "A.J.'s Time Travelers," a live-action miniseries highlighting 
historic people and events, will preempt "Carmen" throughout December. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the series' first two episodes, it's not a fair trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the ambitious, well-intended new show, which includes brief segments 
of instructive film footage and animation, doesn't try hard to mix fun with 
infobits. It tries too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 John Patrick White is A.J., the teen-age commander of a spaceship-style time 
machine with an unusual crew that includes a wisecracking insect. For conflict, 
arch-enemy Warp (Larry Cedar) tests A.J.'s newly acquired knowledge after each 
adventure and threatens dire consequences for a wrong answer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first episode, the great Egyptian architect Imhotep shows up to talk 
about pyramid-building; in the second, space travel is the subject, with guest 
Sir Isaac Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 Breathless and busy, information whizzes by, delivered with hyperkinetic 
quips, cartoonish sound effects and forced enthusiasm, eyes and mouths wide, 
brows raised in perpetual amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while the show's slogan is "knowledge is power," what are children being 
taught when historic figures are reduced to capering buffoons? This Imhotep 
delivers fussy interior decorator tips, and Sir Isaac fares even worse: He's 
cross-eyed and buck-toothed and talks around great gobs of partially masticated 
popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A.J.'s Time Travelers" premieres at 10:30 a.m. today on Fox (Channels 11 
and 6). LYNNE HEFFLEY

 The gilt trips -- such as driving to Michaels for gold leaf, schlepping to 
House of Fabrics for gold ribbon, descending on HomeBase for gold spray paint 
-- have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 It's loving-hands-of-home time. Time to make decorations, presents, wrapping 
paper, cards and wreaths. Time to fill the coffers of the multibillion-dollar 
crafts industry, which not only supports a slew of magazines and specialty 
stores but also gives voice to the glue-gun armed celebrities of home and craft 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've tied a wedding bow on a pew, made a wreath or sacked up some 
potpourri, you're considered a craftsperson by the Hobby Industry Assn., an 
Elmwood, N.J.-based trade group. And this is your moment. The fourth quarter is 
a big one for the business that has grown 41% since 1988, spokeswoman Susan 
Brandt says. 
</P>
<P>
 In growing numbers, the craft population is tuning in to how-to television for 
inspiration. That's where I found my two spiritual guides, Martha Stewart and 
Aleene Jackson, women on opposite ends of a parallel universe. Other than 
empires built on television shows, magazines, books and Type-A personalities, 
they have virtually nothing in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 53, lives her life as if it were a coffee-table book. Hers is a 
handwrought, picture-perfect lifestyle known in magazine and television form 
(Sunday mornings on KCBS Channel 2) as "Martha Stewart Living." From her 
command post in Westport, Conn., she demonstrates the arts of cooking, 
cleaning, gardening and decorating. She makes topiary Easter baskets out of 
living succulents, Christmas wreaths from prickly-pear pads and gift baskets 
for pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 70, was broadcasting "Aleene's Creative Living With Crafts" from her 
Solvang, Calif., ranch long before Stewart signed the mortgage on her Colonial 
farmhouse. (And when her show got its 9 a.m. weekdays time slot on the 
Nashville Network two years ago, Jackson built her own television studio.) In 
the late '50s, Jackson was arranging flowers on local TV. In the '60s, she took 
her how-to shows on the road, booking her "Caravan of Crafts" into 20,000-seat 
convention centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has made her fortune off her domestic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has made hers off sales of more than 15 million bottles of Aleene's 
Tacky Glue, an adhesive sold in craft stores and via her show and magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart leads me on; Jackson keeps me going. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had the time, the money, the patience, a full-time nanny and bigger, 
faster tools, I'd try more of Stewart's projects. Lacking all of those, I flip 
through her magazine (10 issues a year for $24) and mutter: "Yeah, right, 
Martha." 
</P>
<P>
 (I haven't forgotten her suggestion to put the dishwashing liquid, so 
unsightly in its tacky plastic bottle, in a cut glass wine bottle with a 
special spout. Two hours later, the kitchen floor was the cleanest it had ever 
been, not counting the shards of decorative glass I'm still finding.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's magazine (12 issues for $24.95), on the other hand, moves me to 
utter, "Not on your life, Aleene." 
</P>
<P>
 (I could do her projects with one hand tied behind my back if I wanted to, 
which usually I don't. Even my Brownie troop refused to make angel ornaments 
out of recycled shoulder pads, as Aleene suggested. Judging by a recent issue 
of Aleene's Creative Living, angels are big this year. Always the recycler, she 
also proposes making them out of dried -- thankfully -- manicotti and wallpaper 
scraps.) 
</P>
<P>
 This business of being a domestic goddess may seem glamorous, but Stewart, who 
manages to look good even as she spreads manure around her garden, knows that 
for every disciple, there is a detractor. Several years of Martha-bashing 
peaked last year when Oprah Winfrey pitted Stewart and her fan-club president 
against a couple of vociferous Martha-haters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, thankfully, is in the past," Stewart says in a telephone interview from 
the farm she calls Turkey Hill. "The negative stories and such have lessened 
tremendously. I think people are finally getting it." She says it as if it were 
some New Age religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," she adds pragmatically, "there will always be detractors, and the 
people too lazy to do the projects or ones who don't like to do those kind of 
homey things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's Stewart, an industrious, seemingly humorless homebody who sets a 
gorgeous table. The equally humorless Jackson declines to comment on her 
upstart rival, but her daughter, Tiffany Windsor, sniffs: "Oh, Martha makes 
beautiful stuff, but she doesn't deal with the common folk." 
</P>
<P>
 Common folk are Jackson's best customers, and she makes it very easy for them 
to follow her lead. She mails project instructions for the price of a 
self-addressed, stamped envelope. Among the most requested brochures is one for 
a project involving Tacky Glue and white bread. "We do some very inexpensive 
crafts, junk crafts out of scraps, so people can save money," says Jackson, 
whose children help run the business. 
</P>
<P>
 If any anti-Aleene forces exist, they keep to themselves. Jackson gets adoring 
letters, she says, and fans drop by her factory in Buellton, Calif., a town 
proud of its pea soup. 
</P>
<P>
 What Stewart and Jackson share is a following of casual observers, people who 
think they can occasionally watch the shows or read the magazines and say, "I 
could make that." 
</P>
<P>
 Crafting is an addiction, tools the fix. Even the pros are not exempt. Stewart 
says she yearns for a drill press to make holes in acorns and pine cones. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Carey started with a glue gun about 10 years ago, quickly moved 
through the saw-and-drill phase, acquired specialty tools such as the Dremel 
Moto-Tool (a tiny drill with thousands of specialty bits), dedicated a room to 
her craft projects and has lately commandeered the garage for her welding 
projects.

GARDENING; TURN OVER A NEW LEAF -- THEN EAT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nothing against lettuce, mind you, but it's not the only leafy green plant out 
there worth growing. Many other greens -- such as kale, collards, Swiss chard, 
spinach and arugula -- are easy to grow and do very well here during the winter 
months. Most taste sweetest when nipped by cold nights.  
</P>
<P>
 Although these vegetables have been around for centuries and are often eaten 
in other cultures, they've been overshadowed by lettuce in this country. But 
the tide is turning green, says Wendy Krupnick, horticultural adviser for 
Shepherd's Garden Seeds in Felton, Calif.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are starting to rediscover leafy greens," she says. "In conventional 
supermarkets, they didn't used to carry vegetables like kale and collards, but 
now they're quite common." 
</P>
<P>
 This rising awareness of leafy greens can be attributed to an interest in 
ethnic cooking styles and healthy eating. Most greens pack a nutritional punch, 
with a higher vitamin, mineral and fiber content than lettuce.  
</P>
<P>
 Nurseries also now offer a wider variety of leafy green transplants and seeds, 
says Denis Loggins, manager of Laguna Nursery in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leaf crops that will thrive in your cool-weather garden include the following: 
</P>
<P>
 Arugula. Known as roquette in French, arugula has become popular recently. 
This green has a unique, sweet peppery flavor that sparks up salads. The 
notched leaves are ready to use when they reach two to three inches tall.  
</P>
<P>
 Collards. Long a favorite in the South, they flourish in cooler weather but 
can also withstand hot spells. These plants are hardy and grow to 2 1/2 feet 
tall, providing plenty to eat.  
</P>
<P>
 Dandelion greens. Seen as a pest in much of the United States, their tangy 
taste has been prized in France for hundreds of years. Some people feel they 
have medicinal properties. When harvested young and tender, they make a good 
salad addition. Older leaves should be steamed or sauteed after a quick 
blanching.  
</P>
<P>
 Kale. A staple in many European countries, it is cold-tolerant and tastes 
better if exposed to frost. With its decorative, fringed leaves, kale can also 
be used as an edible ornamental. Young leaves are tasty and tender; it can also 
be cooked.  
</P>
<P>
 Mache. This plant -- also known as lamb's lettuce, feldsalat and corn salad -- 
has rounded, buttery flavored leaves that grow slowly. It does best in cool 
weather.  
</P>
<P>
 Mustard greens. Quick-growing, these plants can be ready to eat in as little 
as 35 days from seed. They have a peppery, pungent, mustard-like taste that is 
popular in many Asian and Southern dishes. If eaten raw, the leaves are best 
young and tender. They can also be steamed or sauteed .  
</P>
<P>
 Bok choy. Also called Chinese white cabbage, this is one of the better-known 
varieties of Oriental cabbages becoming popular in this country. Bok choy is 
the primary ingredient in foods such as chow mien, egg rolls and won-ton soup. 
Another cabbage, tat-soi, is good stir-fried and can also be eaten raw when the 
leaves are young and tender.  
</P>
<P>
 Sorrel. The perennial French plant makes a good addition to salads and 
coleslaws with its biting taste. Be careful to check this plant for pests such 
as slugs and snails, however, as they find it a good hiding place.  
</P>
<P>
 Spinach. Only grows well during cool months, when the days are short. A native 
of Persia, this green was enjoyed by Europeans for centuries before the 
Spaniards brought it to North America. Harvest spinach by pinching off outer 
leaves or cutting back the entire plant, which will regrow.  
</P>
<P>
 Swiss chard. This popular green grows well here in winter and summer. It comes 
in a standard white-stemmed variety and a striking crimson type. Chard has a 
mild flavor, contrasted with some other greens. It can be gently steamed, 
served raw in salads, sauteed , stir-fried or used as a substitute for spinach 
in casserole dishes. Chard grows to from two to 2 1/2 feet. Begin harvesting 
outer leaves when they are seven to nine inches tall. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 You can grow leaf crops from seed by planting them in the ground or starting 
them in containers and transplanting. There are advantages and disadvantages to 
each method.  
</P>
<P>
 Loggins suggests planting directly in the ground so you don't put the plants 
through the needless shock of transplanting. Krupnick, on the other hand, says 
she has better luck with transplants.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder for the seeds to germinate in the cold soil," she says. "Rain may 
also wash away the seeds, or migrating birds could devour your tiny seedlings. 
I like to germinate my seeds indoors on a sunny window and transplant them."  
</P>
<P>
 The time from seeding to harvest varies greatly for greens from as soon as 35 
days to 60 or 70 days. In most cases, you can harvest outer leaves before 
plants reach maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-sun location for leaf crops during winter is important. If your summer 
garden is shaded in the winter, find another spot. Because drying Santa Ana 
winds come sweeping through in winter, wind protection is also a good idea.  
</P>
<P>
 Keep leafy greens evenly moist. Letting them dry out or grow on the dry side 
will cause bitter crops, Loggins says.  
</P>
<P>
 Leaf crops need plenty of nitrogen. Loggins suggests cottonseed meal, which 
offers 6-2-1. This is a slow-release organic and needs only be applied every 
two months or so.  
</P>
<P>
 While pests and diseases are definitely fewer during winter months, leaf crops 
attract a handful of hungry critters. Some common pests include caterpillars, 
leaf miners, cabbage root maggots, slugs, snails and birds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove gardener Frank Cusenza grows a wide variety of greens, including 
kale, mustard greens, collards, dandelion greens and tat-soi , in a 
150-square-foot area of his yard. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage his leaf crops to grow more quickly during winter, Cusenza 
mulches with black plastic and plants next to a white, south-facing wall. The 
plastic retains heat in the ground, which spurs root growth and keeps the soil 
most.  
</P>
<P>
 It's best to keep a close eye on your plants, which will enable you to catch 
any problems before they become infestations, says Cusenza, who harvests from 
his garden every day.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I pick greens, I remove and kill any pests I find," he says. "This stops 
any problems from starting."  
</P>
<P>
 Lightweight row cover also works well to keep pests from infesting crops.  
</P>
<P>
 If a problem does get out of hand, several organic solutions are available. 
Bacillus thuringiensis is an organic, nontoxic control for caterpillars. 
</P>
<P>
 Organic solutions for slugs and snails include scattering ash or sand, which 
deters them. This must be replaced after a few waterings or rain, Loggins 
notes. Or try a new copper-coated bender board that gives slugs and snails an 
electric shock when they try crossing it.  
</P>
<P>
 Leaf crops can be harvested in one of three ways, Krupnick says. Remove outer 
leaves; wait until the plant is mature and harvest the entire thing, or use the 
"cut and come again" method, which means chopping the plant off to its crown 
and then letting it regrow. Seed Sources

 Transplants for many greens are often hard to find in nurseries, so your best 
bet is planting by seed, which most nurseries do carry. You can also find seed 
through mail-order companies, including the following.

 Whether you're counting down to the New Year or just to when dinner's served, 
you might want to check out some time-wise table pieces by New York designer 
Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
 The pocket-watch charger ($140) was inspired by the antique timekeeper most 
often associated with grandfathers. The buffet plate, crafted of fine bone 
china, features a distinctive clock face with Roman numerals and old-fashioned 
hands. It is enhanced with a 24-karat-gold, hand-gilded border. 
</P>
<P>
 Another piece of jewelry, the Rolex watch, was the inspiration for Lauren's 
Watchband tableware pattern. The flatware is available in stainless steel or 
with a gold center band (about $83 for a five-piece setting; about $94 with 
gold). 
</P>
<P>
 The charger and flatware in the Home Collection are available in Orange County 
at the Polo store, South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, and most major department 
stores. COLD CLIMATE 
</P>
<P>
 New state-of-the-art refrigerators from Sub-Zero are designed to fit any room 
-- from kitchen to den or bedroom suite -- and any decorating scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sub-Zero 700 Series, which will be available in January, is a system of 
cabinets and drawers rather than a traditional icebox.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the base unit, which consists of two drawers, can be put anywhere, you 
can have freezer or refrigerator drawers next to, or below, your stove or 
microwave or integrated into a center island. The compressor is beneath the 
bottom drawer.  
</P>
<P>
 The flexibility makes it possible to have a refrigerator drawer near the stove 
for onions and such, a drawer elsewhere for items that need to be eaten soon 
and one filled with juices and fruits within easy reach of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new series is also slimmer, only 27 inches wide, so it fits into all 
standard-size cabinets," said Monica Baer, spokeswoman for the Madison, 
Wis.-based company. "There's also an alarm that beeps to remind you to close 
the doors or drawers." 
</P>
<P>
 Other features on the units include halogen lighting, adaptive defrosters and 
individual temperature controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The series (about $3,500 for a tall cabinet that includes two drawers) is 
offered as all-refrigerator, all-freezer or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call (800) 200-7820. MADE IN THE SHADE 
</P>
<P>
 Slipcovers, which can dress up old furniture or change its look, aren't just 
for sofas and chairs anymore. Now lampshades have joined the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by Vista Products in Sarasota, Fla., the Overshade, a fabric 
slipcover, is offered in three styles -- round, oval and barrel -- and fits 
most standard sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 10 solid colors, a marble print in eight colors and two country 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Two holiday patterns are offered for Christmas, a green/red plaid and solid 
red complete with greens and berries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has them, but everybody needs them," said Vista spokeswoman Tammy 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Overshades (about $15) are available at Klassy Krafts in Mission Viejo and 
JCPenney in the Brea and Westminster malls.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; 'ACID RAIN' IN WATER HEATER? IT'S FROM ASBESTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. A serviceman recently advised us to replace the vents from our furnace and 
water heater because they had Transite sleeves, which when they become moist 
form an "acid rain" that could damage the electronic elements of the furnace 
and the interior of the water heater. Other professionals I've talked to have 
never heard of such a problem. Is it possible? 
</P>
<P>
 T.V.O. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine* 
</P>
<P>
 A. In some older homes, you can find vent pipes made of Transite, which is a 
white asbestos product, says Joel Gwartz of B.J. Discount Plumbing & Heating 
Supply in Garden Grove. Normally, these types of vents aren't a problem. But 
when you combine them with the newer, highly efficient furnaces, you can get 
condensation within the Transite vent. This moisture could then drip down and 
damage the electronic controls. When furnaces are replaced, the vents are 
usually checked for Transite, and they're replaced if they're found to contain 
asbestos. Your serviceman probably saw the type of furnace you have and saw 
that you could have a problem down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We have several brown spots on our bathroom mirror. The bathroom is small 
and has only a fan, no window. Any ideas on how to get rid of them? I'd hate to 
replace the entire mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 J.P. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's probably moisture getting behind the mirror, says Dee Watt of College 
Glass & Mirror in Anaheim. What often happens is that the moisture gets into 
the metal channel that supports the mirror at the bottom, and the water becomes 
absorbed in the back of the mirror. Unfortunately, these brown spots can't be 
removed. If the staining is at the edge of the mirror, the edge can be cut off 
and polished. If you can keep water from getting into the channel, you can 
prevent the problem. Glass installers often use a small shim to lift the mirror 
in the channel and prevent it from sitting in the moisture. You can also use a 
water-sealing caulk around the area. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. I'm going to be painting some chairs with a high-gloss enamel. Why must I 
sand the finish between coats? 
</P>
<P>
 T.I. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 A. The reason is obvious once you think about it: Paint doesn't adhere well to 
glossy surfaces, says Charlie Kaczorowski of Tustin Paint Mart. After you apply 
your first coat, you end up with a glossy surface that may not fully cover your 
chair. If you were to apply a second coat without sanding, you would not be 
giving the second coat much to adhere to. Use a fine or very fine sandpaper to 
etch the surface into your initial coat. That will give the second coat a good 
surface to stick to, and you'll end up with a stronger finish. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We have a urethane-finished hardwood floor in our kitchen that's 5 years 
old. It's in pretty good shape, and we do our best to keep it up, but in places 
it looks like it needs a new finish. I've heard there's a polish that can be 
used on urethane floors. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 R.R. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. Unfortunately, there isn't a polish designed for urethane, says John Drew 
of Chamberlain Floors in Fountain Valley. If you were to add polish or wax to a 
urethane floor, the surface would become very slick. Generally, the only 
treatment for urethane is to clean it with a product recommended by the floor 
manufacturer and, if necessary, refinish or reapply the urethane where it's 
needed.

<P>
 Q. We'd like to get (inset) wood blinds for one of our windows, but the window 
is somewhat crooked. The top and bottom are the same width, but the middle goes 
in about an inch. Can blinds be made to fit such odd dimensions? 
</P>

 A. You probably could get some made, but you may be better off fixing the 
window opening, says blinds installer Steve Wisen. The problem is that they're 
going to look funny dipping in like that. You're better off having the window 
reset and replastered so that it's straight before you get blinds.

CONSTRUCTION; REPOINTING MORTAR JOINT TAKES SOME CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even well-made mortar joints between bricks can suffer damage over time, 
especially when they are exposed to severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked or crumbling joints allow moisture to penetrate the wall, where it can 
freeze and cause even more extensive damage. Inspect exterior masonry every few 
years -- before cold weather makes masonry work impractical -- and repair 
damaged joints as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixing mortar joints is called repointing (or tuck-pointing). It involves 
chiseling out damaged mortar and replacing it. Although the process is not 
difficult, you should evaluate the job carefully. It's easy to repair small 
areas, even on a chimney, if they are near the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But if your task requires scaffolding or major rebuilding of brick facing, 
call a professional mason. Similarly, if your chimney lacks a liner or has 
holes, large gaps, or smoke coming from anywhere but the top, call a mason. 
</P>
<P>
 You will need a small sledgehammer, a cold chisel and an old paint scraper to 
remove the old mortar. You'll also need a stiff-bristled wire brush, a trowel, 
and a tuck pointer (a trowel with a long, narrow blade) to work the mortar into 
the joints, and a brick jointer, a tool that gives a mortar joint its final 
shape. All are available at hardware stores and home centers, which also sell 
the ready-mix mortar you'll need. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to wear safety goggles when chiseling and cleaning joints. In addition 
to goggles, wear protective clothing, including gloves, when working with 
mortar. Mortar is mildly caustic. If it splashes on your skin, wash it off with 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Tap Out Loose Mortar 
</P>
<P>
 Use a chisel and sledge to tap out loose mortar in each joint to a depth of at 
least one inch or until you reach solid mortar. Hold the chisel at a sharp 
angle and try not to chip the bricks. Rake the joints clean, leaving a flat 
surface at the back of the cut. Brush the joints vigorously with the wire 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour some ready-mix mortar into a bucket, add a little water gradually until 
the mix is a uniform stiff paste that you can change into a ball. Let it stand 
for 10 minutes and stir again before using. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the bricks from the bottom up. Start by brushing water into the 
joints. This prevents the mortar from being weakened by losing its moisture to 
dry bricks. Scoop some mortar onto a trowel, hold the trowel up to the joint, 
and push the mortar in with the tuck pointer. Fill vertical joints first, then 
horizontals. Fill deep joints in layers; allow each layer to stiffen somewhat 
before applying the next one. After filling each joint, smooth the mortar with 
the tuck pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 New mortar should match the old as closely as possible in composition, color 
and joint profile. To check the color, mix a small batch of mortar, repoint an 
inconspicuous area and let it dry (it will lighten in the process).

GARDENING; BOOK SPROUTS WISDOM ON GROWING ANYPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES WALTERS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Taylor's Master Guide to Gardening" describes itself as a complete, 
one-volume reference with a fully illustrated encyclopedia of the best plants 
to grow in every region. 
</P>
<P>
 And, surprisingly in this era of hyperbole, the 672-page presentation -- while 
abbreviated -- does come close to the billing. 
</P>
<P>
 Editors Rita Buchanan and Roger Holmes cover more than 3,000 plants and six 
distinct gardening regions within the United States and Canada: West Coast, 
Rocky Mountains, Southwest, South, Midwest and Northeast. An impressive list of 
experts from each region contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 For average gardeners, the main attraction is likely to be color photos of 
about 1,000 of "the best trees, shrubs and plants," with the pictures on the 
same page as the descriptions. The book is in 9-by-12-inch hardcover format, 
lists for $60 and is published by Houghton Mifflin Co., which also brought out 
the first Norman Taylor gardening dictionary in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four main sections: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Creating a garden" examines how to develop a home landscape and recommends 
plants for various situations. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "plant gallery" is organized by type of plant (trees, shrubs, etc.) and 
important groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "plant encyclopedia" lists plants alphabetically by genus and tells how 
to grow them. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gardening techniques" tells how to buy plants, make compost, fertilize, 
water, prune and propagate. 
</P>
<P>
 The description of portulaca, or moss rose, is typical of the encyclopedia's 
entries: "Low-growing annuals with plump succulent leaves on trailing stems. 
Some have showy flowers. About 40 species, nearly all from warm and tropical 
climates." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandiflora is described this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "A favorite annual for hot, dry sites. Blooms from early summer until frost. 
The trailing stems are covered with plump cylindrical leaves and waxy round 
flowers, one-inch-wide, single or double, in shades of yellow, orange, red, 
pink or white. Old-fashioned types closed by late afternoon and didn't open at 
all on cloudy days, but new strains keep longer hours. Excellent for edging 
walks, beds or driveways, or in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to grow: full sun. Prefers ordinary soil and watering but tolerates 
infertile soil and long dry spells. Buy bedding plants in spring or direct-sow 
seeds about the time of last frost. The seeds are tiny, but the seedlings grow 
fast. It often self-sows. Shear halfway back and fertilize in midsummer to 
promote fresh growth and renew flowering." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) is described as an evergreen shrub used as a 
culinary herb and useful as a specimen, hedge or ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to grow: Full sun, Well-drained ordinary or unimproved soil. Tolerates 
heat and drought. Plant 2 feet apart for ground cover (prostrate types) or 
hedge (upright growers). Pinch growing tips to promote full, bushy growth. 
Grows well in containers and can be overwintered indoors in a cool, sunny 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan and Holmes, the co-editors, formerly were with Fine Gardening 
magazine. Recently they have collaborated on a number of titles in the Taylor 
gardening guide series. Listed contributors and consultants included Nancy 
Beaubaire, editor of the magazine.

LANDSCAPES; TURN A TINY BACKYARD INTO A PRIVATE OASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAROL V. MENZIE and RANDY JOHNSON, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether your outdoor space is attached to an urban condo or a suburban 
dwelling, a pretty and comfortable garden can provide an oasis of civility, a 
place to refresh mind and body, soul and eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the simple ways we've seen homeowners give character to the 
small, blank rectangles most started with: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tiny fountains. In one garden, a half whiskey barrel is filled with a liner 
and a little bubbler-type fountain. It has rocks, plants and even a couple of 
goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arbors. One enterprising homeowner uses copper tubing to make an arbor of 
arches from the side of the house to the fence on the other side of a narrow 
areaway. He is training vines on the pipes, but in the meantime they're 
decorated with strings of tiny white lights. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tiny fences. A garden uses an ornate wrought-iron gate opening into a square 
rose garden. The owner said he cut it down from a piece of fencing left over 
from the front walk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raised beds. In a yard with a paved back yard, raised beds are used to 
provide an environment for plants. Tall beds were 2 1/2 to three feet off the 
ground, and short ones as tall as one railroad tie. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brick patios or walkways. In one long yard, there are two paths: a straight 
one that follows the fence to the back gate, and a curvy one that wanders 
between wide border beds. The meandering path makes the garden seem much 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden projects are among the easiest and most rewarding you can undertake. 
Even an element as dramatic as a pond, if you have space for it, is remarkably 
easy. You can buy a rigid black plastic liner and dig a hole to fit it, or you 
can dig a free-form space and fit it with a flexible liner. (Just be sure the 
liner is big enough to cover the excavation.) Add a plant step about nine 
inches from the top, if you're planning to add water plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Line the excavation with damp sand, drape the liner over it, and place bricks 
or stones around the edge to anchor it. Gradually fill with water, adjusting 
the bricks as the liner sinks to fit the contours of the pond. Trim the liner, 
leaving about six inches to fit under the edging. Flat stones are the 
traditional edging, but bricks will also work. 
</P>
<P>
 Brick walks and patios are also easy to build. 
</P>
<P>
 As with ponds, the hardest part is the digging. Mark the sides of the path or 
patio, and excavate about six inches. It's best to install a permanent edge; 
you can use a pressure-treated 2-by-6, held in place by stakes driven below 
ground level, or you can use concrete and pour permanent sides and bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not using concrete, put two inches of sand in the bottom of the 
excavation and tamp it down (you can buy or rent a hand tamper). Level it a 
brick's depth below the top of the edging (about three inches), using a board 
notched on each end to ride on the edging. (For a large space such as a patio, 
level with the longest board you can comfortably use; check for level by 
placing a level on the edge of the board at intervals.) 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding what pattern to lay the brick in is one of the fun parts of the job 
-- will it be straight, herringbone, diagonal herringbone, lattice or something 
of your own invention? Just be sure to use a brick that is designed for paving. 
Some old bricks aren't glazed and will crack and crumble. Tamp the bricks into 
the sand with a board and fill the gaps with more sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people line the excavation with black plastic sheeting to keep weeds from 
growing between the bricks. The walk may still need occasional weeding, and 
because it's set in sand, it will move with the heaving of the earth, so you 
may have to reset a brick every now and then. A concrete foundation will offer 
a relatively weed-free and perfectly level surface, but it's a lot more work, 
more expensive, and it won't have the handmade charm of the sand.

GARDENING; WHY PAINT THE TOWN RED WHEN YOU CAN JUST PLANT POINSETTIAS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In many homes, holiday decorating isn't complete until you've perched a 
beautiful, brilliantly colored poinsettia in a place of honor. This striking 
flower with its velvety blossoms has become such a tradition at Christmastime 
that it ranks as the best-selling flowering potted plant in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit for introducing the poinsettia to this country in 1820 goes to Joel 
Roberts Poinsett, the first U.S. ambassador to Mexico. While visiting Taxco, 
Mexico, Poinsett saw the spectacular red flowers in bloom and brought specimens 
back to his home in Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Already officially designated Euphorbia pulcherrima, the flower became 
commonly known as the poinsettia in honor of the ambassador: Poinsettias differ 
from many blooming plants in that the most colorful parts of the plant are the 
leaves (called bracts ). The flowers are actually the tiny yellow berries 
surrounded by the bracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the center for production and distribution of poinsettias is the 
900-acre Paul Ecke Ranch in the San Diego County community of Encinitas. There 
are also a number of other growers based in Southern California -- including 
those near Ventura, which has used the nickname "Poinsettia City" since 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 Some varieties of poinsettias can be grown outdoors here and in some parts of 
the South. However, most poinsettias are raised indoors in greenhouses by 
commercial growers and are destined to spend their lives inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Poinsettias come in a variety of shapes and sizes -- everything from the 
standard three- to six-stem plants to trees, bushes, hanging baskets, topiaries 
and the recently developed miniature poinsettias. Deep red still rates as the 
most popular poinsettia color, but pink, peach, white, yellow, marbled and 
speckled varieties offer stunning alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When buying a poinsettia, look for plants that are well-shaped and balanced on 
all sides, with stiff stems, deeply colored leaves and tightly clustered 
berries. The plant also should have plenty of green leaves all the way down to 
the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep a poinsettia at its best, place it in a cool room (about 72 degrees 
during the day and 65 degrees at night) away from drafts, ventilating ducts or 
fireplaces. Poinsettias need at least six hours of bright sunlight, but avoid 
placing them where the hot afternoon sun will shine directly on the bracts. 
This can cause them to discolor and burn. Water when the soil feels dry to a 
light touch, and pour off the excess that drains through. If poinsettias sit in 
water, they can develop root rot. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage a poinsettia you've received at Christmas to bloom again next 
year, follow these steps. First, keep the plant in a sunny window until the 
bracts fade (usually in late March or early April). Then cut the branches back 
six inches to eight inches, and put the plant back in the window. At the 
beginning of June, transplant it to a pot two inches to four inches larger than 
the original pot and place it outside. (Or plant the poinsettia in a protected 
garden bed.) In the fall, as the weather turns cool, bring the plant indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the first of October, place the poinsettia in total darkness each night 
for 14 continuous hours, then in a window during the day so that it gets six to 
eight hours of bright sunlight. Continue this routine for eight to 10 weeks, 
until the bracts are fully colored and pollen shows in the berries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Groupings of potted poinsettias make ideal decorations for the holidays. For 
large areas, use plants in six- to eight-inch pots with three to six stems 
each. For smaller spaces, use four- to five-inch pots or miniature poinsettias. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find miniatures perfect for bouquets, corsages and boutonnieres for 
holiday weddings or other formal gatherings, or as accents for wreaths, swags, 
garlands, small centerpieces or flower arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you hesitated to bring a poinsettia home because you're afraid your pets 
or young children might eat one of the leaves and get sick? If so, there's no 
need to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 The myth of the poisonous poinsettia has been debunked. According to research 
by Ohio State University and the Society of American Florists, poinsettias pose 
no threat to people or animals. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the Poisindex Information Service, which serves most of the 
poison-control centers in this country, says that a 50-pound child would have 
to eat more than 500 leaves to ingest an amount that might be unsafe -- but 
scientists found no toxicity at that level.

3RD STRIKE FOR O.C. WOMAN IN $50 DRUG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tustin woman convicted of selling $50 worth of cocaine became the first 
Orange County defendant to receive the maximum penalty under the state's new 
"three strikes" law Friday when she was sentenced to 25 years to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Demyers, 36, grimaced as she heard the judge pronounce her sentence, and 
then glanced back at her two weeping daughters. As she was led from the 
courtroom, she shook her head and summed up her situation this way: "They made 
an example out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Demyers is believed to be the first woman in the state sentenced to 25 years 
to life in prison under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 While her two partners in crime each received four-year prison terms for their 
roles in the June drug deal, Demyers' lengthy criminal history prompted 
prosecutors to seek the toughest sentence possible under the new law, dubbed 
"three strikes and you're out" for the life sentence it mandates for third-time 
felons with prior convictions for serious or violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Demyers' police record dates back to 1978 and includes six felonies, ranging 
from robbery to burglary to food-stamp fraud -- even a murder charge of which 
she was acquitted -- and a larger number of misdemeanor convictions. Her 
criminal history shows that over the years she has given police at least a 
dozen aliases and a similar number of birth dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Doug Myers pleaded with the judge to show mercy to his 
client, whom he described as an addict who committed crimes to support her drug 
habit. He asked Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald to 
reject the life sentence as "cruel and unusual punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said his client had only a $5 stake in the $50 drug deal, which took 
place inside an Anaheim motel room. Prosecutors said Demyers and two 
co-defendants arranged to sell the drugs to a buyer who turned out to be an 
undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney also questioned the cost-effectiveness of sending Demyers 
to prison for life. It will cost taxpayers at least $420,000 to house her for 
the 20 years she must remain behind bars before she becomes eligible for 
parole, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is in the interest of justice," said Myers, adding that 
some murderers don't even receive 25-years-to-life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Jeff Winter argued that Demyers was an apt candidate for the 
"three strikes" penalty, because she apparently had not learned her lesson from 
her many previous brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter noted that Demyers has spent more than 12 years in prison, and has 
never paid court-ordered restitution to her victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court has before it a career criminal," Winter told the judge. "Every 
time she gets out she is engaged in criminal conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter also noted that Demyers has been deemed an unfit mother whose three 
youngest children are in foster care. One child was abandoned at UCI Medical 
Center and two of her children tested positive for drugs at birth, according to 
the prosecutor and court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald made no remarks as he imposed the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of court, Demyers' daughters said their mother did not deserve such a 
strict punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's sick, she deserves treatment, not prison," said Shontella Demyers, 19, 
of Tustin. "We really need our mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of defendants statewide have been charged under the new law that 
mandates increasingly longer sentences for repeat felons, and hundreds of 
defendants have already been sentenced for one or two "strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 But only in recent weeks have statewide law enforcement officials begun to see 
defendants given 25-year-to-life sentences -- the penalty mandated for felony 
convicts with at least two previous "strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 defendants have been charged in Orange County under the "three 
strikes" law. Only a handful are women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes" legislation was signed into law in March by Gov. Pete Wilson 
and received overwhelming voter approval in last month's election. Critics, 
however, say the measure is overly broad and will cost taxpayers billions in 
additional prison costs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the sentencing hearing, Demyers' daughter Ebony Olds, 17, of Tustin, 
stood outside the courtroom and wiped the tears from her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe she deserves this," Olds said. "I guess that's what they call 
justice."

U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLS TO 5.6%, A 4-YEAR LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The national economy kept surging during November, adding a surprisingly hefty 
350,000 jobs and cutting the unemployment rate to 5.6%, the lowest level in 
more than four years and down from 5.8% in October, the U.S. Labor Department 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But California's jobless level remained unchanged at 7.7%, providing testimony 
that the state's wobbly recovery still trails far behind the robust national 
expansion. In Los Angeles County, in fact, the jobless rate rose to 8%, up from 
7.8% the month before. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the jobless rate was 5.1% in October, the latest month for 
which figures are available. That was the lowest level in almost three years 
and down nearly a full percentage point from September. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, "you couldn't ask for a better economy than we have right now," 
said Ed Yardeni, chief economist for C. J. Lawrence in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's reports reflected a rare combination of big employment gains and flat 
wages -- suggesting that inflation still poses no immediate threat to the 
economy, even if it comes at the expense of individual workers who had hoped 
for bigger pay raises.  
</P>
<P>
 That outlook on inflation -- and two other government reports Friday showing 
declines in the index of leading economic indicators and in factory orders -- 
bolstered Wall Street by easing concerns about the likelihood of the economy 
overheating. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.75, to 3,745.62, and the 
price of 30-year Treasury bonds was up more than one point, reducing the 
interest rate yield to 7.9% from 8.01% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, economists predicted that the Federal Reserve, worried about the 
potential for future inflation, will boost interest rates again when its 
policy-makers next meet later this month. And that, the analysts say, will give 
the long-suffering California economy yet another obstacle to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good news that the United States is booming for Christmas, but it 
means that there will be interest rate increases at a time when California is 
still lagging behind," said Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business 
Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists contended that the nation's economic expansion still hasn't 
reached its peak, citing this week's report of rising consumer confidence, 
along with the latest employment data and other upbeat news. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy obviously has more momentum than we thought," said Robert Barr, 
deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "It's a healthy 
economy and one we don't think is too strong, or is going out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 In a satellite address from the White House to a meeting of the National 
League of Cities in Minneapolis, President Clinton said Friday's employment 
reports demonstrated the economy's "strong success in building good jobs for 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that the economy has generated 5.2 million new jobs during his 
presidency. Meanwhile, the surge of 350,000 jobs during November was 
significantly higher than the monthly average of 273,000 jobs generated this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yardeni, however, maintained that the collapse of Clinton's health care reform 
proposals and the major Republican election victories last month have spurred 
businesses to increase their hiring.  
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of health care reform, he said, "eliminates a lot of 
uncertainties hanging over the heads of business planners," while the 
Republican gains provide assurance that Washington will be friendlier to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 While employment grew last month in both construction and manufacturing, those 
industries were overshadowed by the services sector of the economy, where pay 
tends to be lower. The economy is "getting a lot of part-time and low-paid 
jobs," said Markley Roberts, the AFL-CIO assistant director of economic 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts and other skeptics point to a long-running squeeze on family incomes. 
And in November, average hourly earnings were $11.22, down from $11.24. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. jobless rate of 5.6% last month was the lowest since August, 1990, 
when it stood at the same level. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate, at 7.7%, was the worst among the 11 big states 
whose figures were reported Friday, while North Carolina's level, 4.1%, was the 
best. If California's figures had not been included, the nation's jobless rate 
would have been 5.3%, reflecting how much healthier the economy is in the rest 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was any good news for California, it was that the state's jobless 
rate in November remained at its lowest level for the year, and well below the 
9% mark where it rested in July. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, according to the monthly survey of employer payrolls, the state's 
employment total inched up by 3,200 to 11.9 million. That was up 6,000 from 
November, 1993 -- the first time in four years that California posted a 
year-over-year job increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some California economists believe that the monthly employment 
reports are missing what appears to be a modest recovery under way in the 
state. Ted Gibson, principal economist for the State Department of Finance, 
said withholding tax revenues suggest that employment in California actually 
has grown at a rate of about 15,000 to 20,000 jobs a month all year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also pointed to indications that the holiday shopping season got off 
to a very strong start in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, even with a rise in the jobless rate to 8% in November, 
unemployment stayed down from levels that hovered around 10% at midyear. Still, 
that improvement could reflect seasonal hiring rather than any strengthening of 
the underlying economy, said Vincent M. Canales, labor market analyst with the 
California Employment Development Department.

 Rosenblatt reported from Washington and Silverstein from Los Angeles. Times 
staff writer Don Lee also contributed to this report. Jobless Rates

O.C. FUND PLUNGE DRAWS INCREASING CONCERN, SCRUTINY; CRISIS: COUNTY TREASURY 
OFFICIALS STILL REELING FROM $1.5-BILLION LOSS. INVESTORS, CONGRESS, FEDERAL 
REGULATORS AND WALL STREET MOVE TO TIGHTEN OVERSIGHT ON INVESTMENT POOL. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County's financial crisis drew mounting concern and scrutiny Friday 
from top investors, congressmen, federal regulators and a Wall Street credit 
agency as they assessed the full implications of a stunning $1.5-billion plunge 
in the value of the county's investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 While county leaders continued to call for calm, four top investors in the 
troubled county-managed fund moved to oversee future dealings on behalf of 185 
cities and special districts that had pooled their money for investment 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 A major Wall Street credit rating agency signaled that it may lower the 
ratings of Orange County bond issues, an action that could make it more costly 
for cities and agencies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an inquiry into the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee announced that 
congressional hearings will investigate whether limits should be placed on the 
use of public funds in the kind of exotic financial investments that now 
afflict Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * An Orange County assemblyman declared that he will introduce legislation in 
Sacramento on Monday to outlaw the risky investment strategy used by 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who continued to face calls for his 
resignation. Citron remained locked in his office; sheriff's deputies ordered 
reporters away from his door. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nervous investors -- who directly or through mutual funds own tax-exempt 
municipal bonds sold by Orange County or related agencies -- flooded phone 
lines of large funds such as the Franklin-Templeton Group of Funds in San 
Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
 County treasury officials still were reeling from their explosive disclosure 
Thursday that risky investment maneuvers combined with sharply rising interest 
rates to produce losses equivalent to 20% of the money invested by various 
government agencies. On Friday, they visited with their major bond underwriters 
and fielded dozens of calls from anxious investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to make any dire predictions," said County Administrative 
Officer Ernie Schneider, who has hired an outside investment adviser to assess 
the potential damages. "I think we're telling people the straight situation. 
We're not trying to hide it from anyone. We're just laying it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no agencies had pulled out of the fund Friday, some city officials 
with money in the portfolio say they now wish they had withdrawn earlier this 
year, when interest rates began rising and it was becoming apparent that the 
fund's bets were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 20-20 hindsight, I should have done more, but the pool looked good," said 
David F. Dixon, the city manager of Orange, who determined when he took the job 
in March that the city had too much money in the fund. He pulled $7 million of 
Orange's $31-million investment out of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials would not be specific about the nature of their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, we look for a lack of disclosure from whoever is marketing the 
securities to a government entity or a lack of disclosure from the government 
entity to its bondholders," said commissioner Richard Roberts. "I don't know 
too much about the Orange County situation, but my current concern is that 
state and local governments are using too many volatile financial instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the county's use of "derivatives" -- investments that typically 
involve complex bets on the direction of interest rates. Like many large 
institutions, the county essentially borrowed money short-term to invest in 
longer-term bonds, using its participating agencies' funds as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy earned big returns of up to 10% a year while interest rates were 
declining and the difference between short-term and long-term rates was wide. 
But the tactic has backfired on the county in a period of rising interest 
rates. Investors in the county pool learned this week that if they wanted to 
withdraw money, they could do so only at a 20% loss. 
</P>
<P>
 A measure of how dire Orange County's situation has become is reflected in how 
much cash it has lost in just the past month. By the end of October, the 
assistant treasurer told an investor that the county had $2 billion in liquid 
assets. By Friday, the cash on hand was down to $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason investors in the pool might not be too worried about its cash-flow 
situation, however, is that the county is about to get a tremendous infusion of 
capital: Payments on property-tax bills are due as of next Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Although it's unclear exactly how much in taxes will be paid, homeowners are 
required to forward 50% of their taxes this month. Citron reported in September 
that full-year receipts total more than $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 National financial experts question whether investors had a clear 
understanding of what Orange County's treasurer was doing with their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in contact with folks who had invested in Orange County and asked 
them if they knew the risks and they'd always say, 'I don't know if it's good 
or bad, but (Citron) has always impressed me,' " said Jeff Spies, city 
treasurer of St. Petersburg, Fla. "The lack of understanding had always 
bothered me." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a worst-case scenario, if cities, school districts and other agencies 
investors withdraw their money, the resulting losses would hurt municipal 
coffers across Orange County and could stop road and sewer projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Orange County's experience, the incoming chairman of the Senate 
Banking Committee said he will conduct hearings on municipal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.). called Orange County's plunge "by far the 
biggest loss to date" in investments in such securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress and the regulators have already focused attention on derivatives 
activities due to losses suffered by corporations, investment funds and 
government entities," he said. "Today's loss will most certainly lead to 
increased scrutiny (by Congress.)" 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) said he planned to 
introduce a bill when the Legislature convenes Monday to help thwart such a 
crisis in the future. Pringle said he began crafting the legislation in June 
with the help of John M.W. Moorlach, the accountant who predicted Orange 
County's current problem but was defeated by Citron in the race for treasurer 
in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure will propose a series of technical changes in state law to reduce 
the risks that investment managers can take with taxpayer dollars. It also aims 
to ensure that local governments have a better idea of the true value of their 
investments and the risks they are taking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to encourage more prudent investing," Pringle said. 
"You don't necessarily need to take the greatest risk with taxpayers' dollars. 
This occurred because people were trying to stretch the public's dollars 
farther. But you can't keep betting against those odds and win." 
</P>
<P>
 The four major investors in the pool said Friday they want to review the 
independent findings of the county's investment adviser and help plan financial 
strategy for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority, the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies (which is building the state's first toll roads), the Orange County 
Sanitation Districts and the Irvine Ranch Water District have agreed to form a 
review committee. Together, they have more than $2 billion in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see what is being done now and want to feel comfortable with it," 
said Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District. "I think a lot of 
smaller investors depend on us doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Citron pulled the blinds of his office and worked the phone in an 
attempt to ease the investors' fears. His second-in-command met personally with 
brokers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to deal with the situation," Schneider said. "Things are pretty 
crazy right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Citron -- county government's only elected Democrat -- struggling 
to save the county's financial future, but he is also trying to save his job. 
Some Republican leaders smell blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no coincidence that the one Democrat who holds elected office in Orange 
County is the one who screws it up for the rest of us," said Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said county officials, including the Board of Supervisors, continue 
to support Citron, who this year faced his only challenger in 24 years. "But I 
don't want to make any predictions about the future," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) and state Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange) 
have called for Citron's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what I know right now, it sounds like he has been rather reckless 
and irresponsible in his investment patterns," Lewis said. "Unless there's a 
very good defense of this, I think that (resignation) would be the best thing 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At the national level, the losses were proving to be an embarrassment for 
Orange County. Louis Rukeyser, host of the "Wall Street Week" television 
program, quipped Friday that the financial crisis "has John Wayne spinning in 
his airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Among investors holding Orange County bonds, there were few signs of panic 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of Orange County bonds dropped slightly, about $5 for every $1,000 of 
value, on concerns that county investment losses could harm bond issues. Bond 
traders and managers of tax-exempt mutual funds said that virtually no Orange 
County bonds were offered for sale on Friday, on the expectation that no one 
would buy them.  
</P>
<P>
 After the county's announcement Thursday, large mutual funds and brokers 
worked to alleviate investors' fears on Friday. Merrill Lynch, which has 
extended $2 billion in credit to the county for securities purchases, held a 
telephone conference with more than 30 holders of bonds issued by the county 
and its cities to assure them that the paper is solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from two credit rating agencies -- Moody's Investors Services 
and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group -- recently met with Orange County 
officials to express their concerns about the county's financial stability. 
Moody's said it was looking at the "pool's ability to meet its ongoing 
liquidity needs" and what might happen should losses occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's said that while it has no indication that Orange County has 
a problem with its liquid assets, the agency put Orange County bond issues on 
negative notice, an action that usually precedes a credit rating downgrade.

 A risky investment strategy has thrown Orange County's once high-flying 
investment fund for local government agencies into turmoil. The fund's 
challenge: to keep agencies from pulling out, which would force fire sales of 
securities and balloon Orange County's losses. REVERSE REPOS: HEART OF THE 
PROBLEM 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County used financial instruments called reverse repurchase agreements 
to borrow against its $7.5 billion in investment holdings, leveraging the fund 
up to more than $20 billion. Here's how reverse repos work: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The owner of a security -- a $1-million, five-year Treasury note with a 6% 
coupon, for example -- pledges the note to an investment bank as collateral for 
a $1-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The investor then uses the loan to purchase another $1-million, five-year 
note earning 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Assume the investor is being charged for the loan at an annual rate of 4%. 
If interest rates remain stable, then his yield on his $1 million -- originally 
only 6% -- is now 8%: 6% plus 6%, minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Here's the risk: The investor is borrowing short-term; reverse repo 
transactions generally have a term of 30, 60, or 90 days, at which point they 
are routinely rolled over. But the investor is using the money to buy long-term 
investments. If interest rates shoot up, as they have this year, he gets 
squeezed twice: 
</P>
<P>
 A. The value of his collateral -- the original $1-million note -- drops, so 
his lender demands cash or more securities to make up the difference. Since 
August, Orange County has had to add $650 million in collateral with rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 B. The rate charged by the bank on the loan rises as the loan is rolled over. 
If rates rise quickly enough, the cost of the loan may rise above the return on 
the investment. MAN ON THE SPOT 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Citron's performance as Orange County treasurer-tax collector has 
come under fire with the disclosure of substantial reversal's in the county's 
investment fund. Some background on Citron: 
</P>
<P>
 * Age: 69 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary: $100,339 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * First elected: Won election as Orange County tax collectro in 1970. Became 
treasurer in 1973 when the Board of Supervisors combined the positions.  
</P>
<P>
 * Politics: The only Democrat holding elective office in Orange County 
government. Ran unopposed between 1970 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * '94 Challenge: John Moorlach, a certified public accountant and financial 
planner, ran against Citron, criticizing his management of county funds as too 
risky. Citron won with 61.1% of the vote in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Orange treasurer-tax collector; Times reports What Went Wrong 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County investment fund's crisis was brought on by the same strategy 
that enhanced Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's returns in recent 
years: the use of borrowed money to bet on falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 LEVERAGE: Using loans from brokerages, the fund has borrowed a massive $12.9 
billion on top of the $7.7 billion invested by client. Virtually all of the 
money has been invested in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 RATES TURN: As interest rates have soared this year, the fund's borrowing 
costs have jumped while the value of its bonds has tumbled. That has squeezed 
the fund's earnings and caused its overall porfolio value to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 LOSSES?: So far, the fund's losses are only on paper. But if it is forced to 
sell its bonds before they mature, the losses would become real. They would 
have to be shared by the government agencies whose money the fund manages and, 
potentially, by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT'S AHEAD: The fund's challenge now is to pay off its loans as its 
investments mature. But a further rise in interest rates or demands for cash by 
its government investors could hamstring efforts to work out the problems. Fund 
Performance 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Citron's fund has dramatically outgunned similar government 
investment pools, including one managed for local agencies by the California 
Treasurer's Office. But in recent months, their results have begun to converge.

U.S. COURT OKS LAGUNA CANYON TOLLWAY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stunning blow to Laguna Canyon environmental groups, a federal court 
Friday cleared the way for construction to resume on the final phase of the 
17-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco 
unanimously affirmed a 1993 lower court decision allowing the project to 
proceed. A coalition of environmental groups had won an injunction from the 
appeals court in June to stop bulldozers from grading along an environmentally 
sensitive 4.7-mile section of the road that would cut through the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's decision "means we can start construction on the tollway in that area 
as soon as we get the (court) mandate," said Lisa Telles, a spokeswoman for the 
San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency. The ruling, she said, "is 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, about 30 of whom gathered at the proposed grading site in 
Laguna Beach to protest the decision, expressed deep disappointment and vowed 
to keep fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not over until I'm physically moved out of the way," said Marion Pack, a 
Riverside County resident who drove an hour to join the other protesters. "We 
are prepared to block the bulldozers and do whatever it takes to stop this." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction began more than a year ago at both ends of the tollway, which 
will run between San Juan Capistrano and Newport Beach. The June injunction 
halted the work while the two factions argued whether the project's 
environmental studies were adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The area includes eight coastal canyons, the county's only natural lakes, and 
habitat for several rare species, including the California coastal gnatcatcher, 
a bird listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling means that grading can resume within 21 days, Telles said. But Joel 
R. Reynolds, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Los 
Angeles and attorney for Laguna Greenbelt Inc., said the environmental groups 
may seek a rehearing or other legal remedy. If that happens, he said, grading 
would not resume for at least 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals judges said that the tollway does not violate the National 
Environmental Policy Act and that the roadway's main builder does not need a 
supplemental environmental impact report to proceed. Environmentalists had 
argued unsuccessfully that a supplemental EIR was needed after last year's 
devastating Laguna Beach wildfire, which damaged or destroyed 441 homes or 
businesses, charred 16,682 acres and caused $528 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters who gathered Friday vowed to be relentless in their efforts to 
halt development in the picturesque canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means a disaster," said Robert King of Save Our San Juan, a 550-member 
group fighting the tollway route through San Juan Capistrano. "It is a roadway 
that isn't needed, that will never pay for itself and will end up destroying 
the unique canyon and unique community of San Juan Capistrano." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Leeds, who co-founded the Laguna Canyon Conservancy, said, "What is 
lost? Everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Laguna Beach residents know how to "pop back up after a major blow," Leeds 
said. "The citizens of Laguna Beach in 1990 passed a bond issue for $20 million 
to help leave the canyon in its natural state by buying the land. They voted 
against development and the toll road." 
</P>
<P>
 The activists, some of whom were arrested for trespassing in September, 1993, 
when they chained themselves to heavy earth-moving equipment, said they will 
monitor the canyon regularly to ensure that no grading is done before all legal 
means of halting the tollway are exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition of environmentalists has focused on the 4.7-mile middle section 
of the road, known as the Laguna Greenbelt. In an injunction issued in 
September, 1993, to block construction there, U.S. District Judge Linda 
McLaughlin described the area as the last significant open space in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin lifted the injunction in June, however, and bulldozing proceeded 
for a day. But the appeals court immediately imposed a new order that has 
stopped further work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Reynolds said Laguna Greenbelt has a federal lawsuit pending that 
contends the tollway violates the endangered species law because it could 
destroy or severely alter the gnatcatcher's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge in Washington has postponed that case until next year while 
another case involving the gnatcatcher is heard, Reynolds said. "Obviously, we 
will try and activate our case on an emergency basis, if we need to, to protect 
the greenbelt." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the tollway route could be altered so that it would be 
consistent with the area's ecology and landscape. That possibility was proposed 
to the Transportation Corridor Agency, he said, but "it was ignored, and the 
9th Circuit Court didn't buy it. Unfortunately, the decision today sends a 
message to the agency that they can do it their way." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling stated that an environmental study "need not consider every 
conceivable alternative," rejecting environmentalists' contention that the 
government had failed to take seriously their proposal to minimize the effect 
of the road by using bridges and tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan offered by the environmentalists would not have left enough space in 
the middle of the roadway for a proposed rail line, the court said. The 
official study examined all feasible alternatives, the court said, including 
the option of not building a road, in light of the potential effect of traffic 
congestion on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tollway could encourage population growth, the evidence supports 
federal officials' conclusion that the project would not affect the amount and 
pattern of growth in the county, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's population probably will grow in the coming years" even without 
the road, the court said, citing population growth of 2.1 million between 1950 
and 1989 with little new highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The corridor agency had estimated that it stood to lose $5 million in revenue 
for each month the tollway was not completed as scheduled. It is due for 
completion in March, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction delays caused by numerous lawsuits have added $8.9 million to the 
original $793-million cost of the project. In addition, the tollway agency has 
paid more than $2.9 million in court-related legal fees.

VICA FORUM ISSUES CONFIDENT FORECAST FOR '95 
</P>

 Despite the financial and psychological toll of the Northridge earthquake, San 
Fernando Valley business leaders Friday forecast a robust Valley economy next 
year, citing the area's resilience and efforts by government to become more 
business-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 The optimistic assessment came from business owners and elected officials 
meeting at an annual economic forecasting conference sponsored by the Valley 
Industry and Commerce Assn., a prominent group with more than 400 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are really upbeat about 1995," said Ben Reznik, a Sherman Oaks attorney 
and past chairman of VICA, who contrasted the rosy outlook with the group's 
gloomy economic assessment a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was a real downer," Reznik said. 
</P>
<P>
 In forecasting an upturn in the Valley economy next year, bankers cited 
increased deposits from clients, real estate experts pointed to a stable 
property market and entertainment firms predicted new jobs from the expected 
addition of new television networks and movie-making studios. 
</P>
<P>
 To buttress their assessment, several business leaders also pointed to a 
rousing Christmas shopping turnout last weekend in which Californians spent 
nearly 10% more than they did a year ago. And Southern Californians outspent 
their counterparts in the northern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, the worst is over," said Carla Gazzolo, senior vice president 
of Los Angeles-based CB Commercial Real Estate Group, who cited the "resiliency 
of the Valley" as a factor supporting an upturn in the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- the conference's keynote speaker -- 
joined in the sunny forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley has bounced back with pride and confidence," he said, adding that 
he will try to cut bureaucratic red tape for businesses and strive to make city 
department heads more accountable for financial mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the confidence in psychological factors, the basis for projecting an 
upturn was more difficult to discern. Some executives suggested that federal 
emergency dollars and insurance settlements to repair quake damage will help 
kick-start a spending cycle that will rejuvenate the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a recent economic analysis estimated that the quake caused $357 
million worth of damage to businesses in Los Angeles and that federal and local 
aid -- not counting insurance awards -- will provide only about $50 million for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Others disagreed with the theory that quake-repair money will be a significant 
economic stimulant, saying recovery dollars will probably provide only enough 
of an infusion to counter the negative impacts of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 20 years and I've seen other earthquakes," said Walt Mosher, 
VICA chairman and co-owner of Pacoima-based Precision Dynamics. "My personal 
opinion is that it will have a net zero effect." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mosher said he is optimistic that last month's elections brought new 
leaders to state and federal government who will be more sympathetic to the 
concerns of business owners, such as workers' compensation reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of emphasis, since the elections, to get down to work," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Marquis, executive vice president of TransWorld Bank, the Valley's oldest 
and largest independent bank, said deposits are up 20% this year and the bank's 
net income has jumped 86%. 
</P>
<P>
 Observing that small businesses in the transportation, construction, export, 
defense, computers and other high-tech industries are growing, and predicting 
that unemployment will drop further next year, Marquis declared: "Now is the 
time to look at investing in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the assessments were positive. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., California's largest home 
builder, predicted higher home prices, in part due to new seismic-safety 
regulations that are likely to be imposed on builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "My prediction is a tough year in 1995," said Mark Beisswanger, president of 
Kaufman & Broad's regional division. "I expect higher prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the high cost of health care and burdensome government regulations 
threaten to stifle the improved economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the conference, VICA heaped praise and took shots at 
government officials as the association announced its choice for the three best 
and three worst government decisions this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Blackwell can choose the best- and worst-dressed people of America, 
then we've decided to have a little fun," said David Fleming, a VICA member and 
city fire commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 VICA praised the federal government for supporting the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
both of which would boost the local economy, Fleming said. But the association 
blasted the Environmental Protection Agency for proposing local air-quality 
regulations that Fleming said could cost the region $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 State lawmakers were honored for taking steps to reform the state's 
much-maligned workers' compensation system but jeered for failing to solve all 
its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bleeding has lessened but the patient is still critical," Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, VICA credited Los Angeles city officials for working quickly and 
effectively in helping quake victims recover from the disaster without imposing 
too much bureaucratic red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But it blasted the city's workers' compensation system as well, which is 
backlogged with nearly 40,000 claims, the equivalent of one for every city 
employee. The association supports Riordan's call to assign an outside 
regulator to oversee the system, which administers work-related injury claims 
from city employees.

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; NOT EVERYONE BOUGHT INTO COUNTY STRATEGY; OTHERS RUE 
INACTION; INVESTORS: ONLY SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO AND GARDEN GROVE WEREN'T IN POOL. 
A FEW CITIES HAD GROWN WARY AND BEGAN MAKING WITHDRAWALS. 
</P>

 When David F. Dixon first came to the city of Orange last spring to take over 
as city manager, he became concerned about the amount of money the city had in 
the county's investment fund. Too risky, he thought, so the city reduced its 
investment by about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the county's fund faces a cash-flow problem, he wishes he had taken 
out more of the city's money. But, he said Friday, county officials pressured 
him not to. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 20-20 hindsight, I should have done more, but the pool looked good" 
because it was yielding higher-than-average returns, Dixon said. "I was the new 
guy in the county and was told not to rock the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dixon wasn't alone in questioning the county's management of municipal 
investments. Two cities -- Garden Grove and San Juan Capistrano -- had rejected 
the allure of the high-yielding county fund and decided against investing in 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Westminster withdrew $3 million, and so did Tustin. Out of 
prudence, not panic, La Palma also began making small withdrawals in June. 
</P>
<P>
 And in recent weeks, before the news broke that the county's fund has suffered 
serious losses, Mission Viejo was considering moving at least some of its $18.7 
million to a less risky state investments fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did most cities stick with the county portfolio? Because its higher risks 
had meant higher returns, and the cities had reaped the benefits of the 
county's bullish strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as county finance officers were urging them not to panic, municipal 
treasurers and city managers nonetheless perused their own portfolios for 
reassurance. Luckily, most had diversified their investments so that only a 
part of their money was riding on the county's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike cities, the school districts do not have the discretion to drop out of 
the county's fund, since they are required by state law to deposit their money 
in the county's pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The general consensus Friday among city and school officials was to ride out 
the storm and hope that major investors -- such as the Orange County 
Transportation Authority, with $1 billion in the fund -- don't pull out. 
</P>
<P>
 Having gained by what was once a highly praised investments portfolio, many 
city officials minimized the financial downturn and reaffirmed their faith in 
county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's management of their long-term 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I read it so far, all agencies are staying put," said Glenn 
Steinbrink, Fullerton's accounting manager. "There won't be any losses as long 
as everyone stays put." 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma Mayor Wally D. Linn, a bank vice president, said his city started 
withdrawing funds when he began noticing an increase in the interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But even now, Linn said he believes "there is no need for alarm here." 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, Treasurer Donald L. Watson said he has been swamped by 
calls from brokers -- perhaps trying to cash in on Orange County's misfortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're sort of like sharks swimming in the water," Watson said. "They're 
each telling us about this great deal they've got to sell us. . . . We're not 
looking at taking any of them though. We're keeping our money in the (county) 
fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling out from the fund at this point "would be sheer folly," Watson added. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, others who had begun rethinking their own city investment strategies 
began to question whether their faith in the county had been misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said he first got an inkling that something was seriously wrong with the 
county fund on Wednesday, when he received a letter from the county urging that 
the city send a representative to a special meeting the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, hello, hello, surprise, surprise," Dixon said of the news. "I was not 
panicky, because I knew we were one of the small fish. But I am concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 And in those cities that pulled out of the fund earlier this year, there was a 
sense of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure there are probably many agencies that have benefited substantially 
by virtue of those investments," Tustin Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli said. "I am 
not going to sit here and second-guess (the county treasurer). . . . It's just 
a risk that, as a public official in the city of Tustin, I am not willing to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all 31 Orange County cities, Garden Grove and San Juan Capistrano seemed to 
be the most prudent investors: They were the only ones to say "thanks, but no 
thanks" to the seemingly attractive county plan that had yielded high returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's any city being any smarter," said Cynthia L. Pendleton, 
San Juan Capistrano's treasurer. "I think it was just a decision on how risky 
an investment you want to make. Borrowing money to invest (as the county did) 
is not what we like to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Andrade, Garden Grove's controller, said he had been hearing for months 
that the county's pool might be in trouble. His city had opted for a more 
conservative strategy that had a return within 1% of the county's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk has gotten out of control," he said, adding that cities that 
invested may encounter their own cash-flow problems as a result of their 
involvement with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county treasurer has locked them up," Andrade added. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a predicament the school district officials cannot worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've looked to them to make the right decisions, and we, as a school 
district, have benefited greatly over the years," said Michael Fine, the fiscal 
services director for the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, which has $80 
million in the county fund. "I'm confident that they will restructure the pool 
correctly. They have some very skilled people there." 
</P>
<P>
 At Saddleback Valley Unified School District, Assistant Supt. Bob Cornelius 
said any loss in the district's $44-million investment could affect the 
operating budget, which includes money for salaries, equipment and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be cautious and ride this out," Cornelius said. "We don't have any 
choice."

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; BONDHOLDERS REFRAIN FROM PANIC SELLING; REACTION: NO ONE 
IS DUMPING SECURITIES YET, BUT MANY ARE NERVOUSLY CHECKING ON SAFETY OF THEIR 
ASSETS. BUYERS KEEP HANDS OFF DESPITE MUNICIPAL BOND RALLY NATIONWIDE.

 Nervous owners of Orange County municipal bonds refrained from panic selling 
Friday but flooded phone lines of brokers and mutual funds to check on the 
safety of their holdings following disclosure of a $1.5-billion dive in the 
value of a county-managed investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, potential buyers of Orange County tax-free securities kept hands off 
even as the overall market for municipal bonds nationwide continued a weeklong 
rally. Orange County bond prices fell slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity Investments in Boston, the nation's largest mutual fund company, was 
inundated with calls from concerned investors Friday, according to Jack Haley, 
portfolio manager for the California municipal bond funds. Haley said 
Fidelity's $700-million portfolio should not suffer any loss, because it 
includes only 10 Orange County bond issues valued at $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our exposure was insured Orange County bonds, so our exposure was 
minimal," Haley said, adding that Fidelity managers may soon request a meeting 
with Orange County officials. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mutual fund operators Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc. in Boston and T. Rowe 
Price Associates in Baltimore said they did not expect their California 
tax-free bond and money-market funds to be hurt, because each has 1% or less of 
its assets invested in bonds issued by the various Orange County agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of inconceivable that the debt could go into default," said Bernie 
Schroer, California bond fund manager for Franklin Templeton Group of Funds. 
"But nobody really knows what to do right now." Schroer said the San Mateo 
firm's $13-billion California bond fund holds only $18 million worth of Orange 
County debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors buying municipal bonds directly called their brokers to express 
fears and seek counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not buy any more Orange County municipal bonds after this whole 
thing," said retiree Jack Brownstone, a bond investor who lives near Palm 
Springs. Brownstone said he plans to hang on to the $15,000 of Orange County 
bonds he owns. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bond traders and managers of tax-exempt mutual funds said few Orange County 
bonds traded Friday -- with virtually no buyers available. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just sitting tight and holding on," said Robert Gore, a bond 
trader with Crowell Weedon & Co., an investment bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside of Orange County, the market is completely at ease," said Jeremy 
Ragus, who manages the California tax-exempt bond fund of Scudder, Stevens & 
Clark Inc. in Boston. For the rest of the municipal bond market, one major 
index climbed about $12.50 for each $1,000 of the bond face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County bond prices dropped slightly, about $5 for each $1,000 in value, 
on concerns that county investment losses could harm individual government 
agencies and inhibit their ability to make payments on their bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County bond owners received more troublesome news late Friday. After 
the market closed, the Standard & Poor's Corp. credit rating agency said it had 
put Orange County bond issues on a credit watch. This move typically comes just 
before a credit rating is downgraded -- which leads to higher borrowing costs 
-- and is expected to hurt prices of Orange County bonds on Monday, bond 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch & Co., which has extended $2.5 billion in credit to Orange 
County to purchase securities, held a telephone conference with more than 30 
major bond holders to assure them that the individual bonds are secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond experts said there is no immediate impact on the values of the various 
municipal bonds sold by the scores of agencies tied to the Orange County 
investment pool or their ability to make bond payments. However, they noted, 
any panic by participants in the pool -- including the Orange County 
Transportation Authority and all the county's school districts -- could force 
county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron to sell the portfolio's 
holdings at a painful loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Many individual investors are concerned that if the county investment pool's 
losses increase, those government agencies involved may have difficulty getting 
cash to pay repay interest and principal on their debts. Still, some investors 
seemed unruffled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going back to the 1930s. Over the long term they will pay off," 
said Louis Ballas of Newport Beach, a longtime investor in Orange County 
municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 180 cities, schools and water districts, and other agencies use the 
county's investment pool -- now valued at $18.6 billion -- to invest their 
surplus funds and bond proceeds, reaping generally high returns until this year 
when rising interest rates hammered values of the complex securities known as 
derivatives that make up part of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Now critics are questioning Citron's handling of the county's investment 
portfolio, particularly his risky strategy of using derivatives, which are 
based on the value of an underlying stock, bond commodity or index. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are dealing with money from states, cities and communities, it 
should be handled conservatively," said Joe Deane, a California bond fund 
manager at Greenwich Street Advisors, a division of investment banking firm 
Smith Barney in New York.

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; OFFICIALS SAY THEY'LL MANAGE IF INVESTORS KEEP COOL; 
IMPACT: BUT WORST-CASE SCENARIO -- A RUN BY INVESTORS -- IS GRIM INDEED. THE 
CASH-FLOW CRUNCH COULD STOP PROJECT DEAD AND LEAVE CITIES STRAPPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It is a bureaucrat's worst nightmare. Stan Oftelie, executive director of the 
county transportation agency, doesn't think it will happen. He prays it won't. 
But with Orange County now in the grips of a dismal investment crisis, Oftelie 
and others can't help but shudder at a simple doomsday scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cities, school districts and other agencies who invest in the county's 
flagging investment portfolio made a run on the bank, the funds would all too 
quickly begin to dry up. The resulting cash-flow crunch could stop road and 
sewer projects right in their tracks and hurt municipal coffers in cities all 
over Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can dream up a scenario that would cause us grief," Oftelie said. "It could 
become a real liquidity issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency oversees transportation issues ranging from street widenings and 
freeway car-pool lanes, to the county's bus and shuttle systems. With $1 
billion invested in the county portfolio, substantial loses could conceivably 
impact motorists on the county's roadways and those reliant on public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such gloomy talk, Oftelie and other local government officials remain 
confident that the county investment portfolio will ultimately rebound and the 
crisis will have virtually no short-term effect. Despite the tsunami of concern 
in recent days, they say, the average taxpayer won't feel a ripple. Parks will 
be maintained, roads will be built, schools will bustle with activity, buses 
will run. 
</P>
<P>
 "If no one gets panicky, this isn't a major problem for us," predicted 
Oftelie, whose agency has assets totaling 15% of the investment funds worth. 
"This whole exercise will likely end up meaning we'll be getting a little bit 
lower investment return for the calendar year." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts aren't so certain taxpayers will be free of fallout from the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will trickle down to the individual people that live in the community," 
said Nancy Zambell, a securities industry analyst at J.W. Charles Securities in 
Boca Raton, Fla. "It's far removed from Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a few Orange County cities are already expecting more than just paper 
losses. In Villa Park, a $200,000 road repaving project will be scratched 
because of investment losses. Cypress may also have to slow street repairs, 
said Richard Storey, finance director. The 4,600 residents of Cypress have $6 
million invested in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is an adjustment it will be the street contract," Storey said. "It's 
the easiest cut to make because we won't have to lay people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local officials said they will be able to manage their cash flow needs 
without touching the slumping portfolio funds. Other are confident they can 
make due for now because their budget projections were based on a modest 
expected return of 6%. They expect the annual return this year to sink to about 
5 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The level of discomfort depended in part on the amount an agency had invested 
in the county pool. The Newport-Mesa Unified School District, for instance, has 
about $80 million in the county portfolio. While the district's budget gurus 
don't anticipate any problems in the near future, they're holding all bets 
beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to replan future years," said Michael Fine, the district's director 
of fiscal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County had the largest share of the portfolio, with 37%. The county's 
37 school districts accounted for 13%, while the Orange County Sanitation 
Districts have 6% of the holdings and Irvine Ranch Water District has 4%. Among 
cities, Irvine has 2 3/4%, Anaheim holds 2 1/4% and Santa Ana 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most bullish were well aware of the possible consequences. While most 
of the cities do not rely on their investments for day-to-day operating 
expenses, a long-term drop could serious hinder big projects -- park expansion, 
a new recreation center -- not deemed absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone knows when it will have an impact or how," said state 
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who will assume a seat in January on 
the Orange County Board of Supervisors. "But it's obvious we have a problem, a 
very serious problem." Investor Roster

SWEDISH TEACHER FIRED FOR UNDRESSING IN CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teacher who undressed in front of her adult class to demonstrate a lesson 
has resigned under pressure -- despite protests from her students. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Wachenfeldt, 44, was teaching a group of unemployed women how important 
it is to love your own body. To drive home the point, the mother of five 
undressed, a newspaper report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students wrote a letter to the school principal protesting the decision to 
fire Wachenfeldt. "It was one of our best lessons. . . . It helped boost our 
self-confidence," student Jenny Berg was quoted as saying.

 An express train headed from eastern Hungary to Budapest derailed Friday and 
slammed into a station building, killing at least 21 people. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 60 people were injured, National Police spokesman Laszlo Garamvoelgyi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at Szajol, about 40 miles southeast of the Hungarian 
capital, when the second car of an express train derailed and dragged three 
other cars off the tracks. The overturned carriages smashed into the station 
building, railway officials said.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS SOAR ON SIGNS OF INFLATION-FREE GROWTH; MARKETS: THE 
DOW GAINS 44.75 WHILE THE DOLLAR RISES AGAINST THE MARK AND THE YEN. BOND RATES 
TAKE A DIVE.

<P>
 New signs that the economy is expanding without pushing up prices on goods and 
services sent stock prices soaring and long-term bond yields tumbling on 
Friday, in what some analysts said could be a turning point in the markets' 
obsession with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond 
plummeted to 7.91% from 8.02% on Thursday, and yields also sank on long-term 
municipal and corporate bonds as investors rushed to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the classic inflation hedges -- gold and silver -- continued their 
week-long plunge as investors bailed out. A slump in oil prices further 
dampened inflation concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials rocketed 44.75 points to 3,745.62 in 
a late rally, closing the week up a net 37 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The rallies in bonds and stocks stunned many market players, because they 
followed the government's report early Friday of an unexpectedly strong gain in 
jobs in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than focus on the number of jobs created, traders said bond investors 
were cheered by another aspect of the employment report, which showed a drop in 
hourly wages and in the average workweek, both of which are anti-inflationary. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, in another report, the government's chief forecasting gauge of 
future economic activity pointed in the other direction, falling in October for 
the first time in 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conclusion, at least for today -- and it's only tentative -- is that the 
economy is going to slow to a no-boom, no-bust, sustainable, non-inflationary 
pace," said Hugh Johnson, chief market strategist at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they were encouraged that long-term bond yields fell even though 
short-term rates rose again. A renewed rise in short rates this week suggests 
that investors believe the Federal Reserve Board may raise interest rates at 
least one more time to restrain the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in long-term yields, meanwhile, may indicate that more investors 
believe the Fed is within reach of its goal of containing inflationary 
pressures while still allowing for moderate economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be brave enough to say that we might have peaked" in bond yields, 
said Andrew Brenner, senior trader at Nikko Securities Co. International. "But 
we're certainly trading well even in the face of a potential Fed (rate 
increase)." 
</P>
<P>
 In another positive sign for stock and bond markets, the dollar surged, rising 
to a three-month high against the German mark and a seven-week high against the 
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended the week in New York at 100.61 Japanese yen, up from 99.34 
late Thursday. It was the currency's first close above 100 yen since Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also closed at 1.580 German marks, the best finish against that 
currency since Aug. 31, and up from 1.573 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing strength in the dollar could lure foreign investors back to U.S. 
stocks and bonds, because their U.S. holdings automatically appreciate if the 
dollar is rising. 
</P>
<P>
 The big losers Friday were key commodities. As inflation concerns have ebbed, 
gold and silver have tumbled this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Commodity Exchange, December gold futures sank $3.10 to 
$375.50 a troy ounce. The price fell $9.10 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver prices staggered to one-year lows. March silver futures sank 22 cents 
to $4.77 an ounce on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In energy markets, crude oil futures plunged to a seven-week low after 28 
Pennsylvania counties backed away from using a new gasoline aimed at reducing 
air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of reduced demand for the cleaner-burning fuel triggered a 7% 
drop in gasoline futures and pulled crude oil futures drastically lower. 
January oil futures plummeted 83 cents on the New York Merc, to $16.99 a 
barrel, the lowest since Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the stock market, many analysts warned against too much euphoria, even 
if bond yields continue to decline. First Albany's Johnson and others said the 
market had been poised to rebound after losing substantial ground last week, 
and that technical factors, like program trading, were responsible for much of 
the market's gains Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues had a solid 3-to-2 lead on decliners on the NYSE, but volume 
was only moderate at 285 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stock investors are very, very tentative," Johnson said. "The level of 
confidence is not high." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Quaker Oats jumped 2 3/8 to 62 3/4 on rumors that Coca-Cola will tell the 
Securities and Exchange Commission that it has bought more than 5% of Quaker's 
stock. Neither Quaker nor Coca-Cola officials were available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * ITT gained 3 1/8 to 80 1/8, boosted by a PaineWebber upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel rose 1/4 to 62 7/8, recovering from two days of sharp losses amid 
concerns about problems with its Pentium computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amgen fell 1 1/4 to 56 3/4 and Synergen rose 1/64 to 9 3/64 after Amgen 
revised its antitrust application to acquire Synergen, postponing the 
acquisition until Dec. 15 from Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks closed mostly lower. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index fell 
53.86 points to 2,537.48 on renewed worries about civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 London's FTSE-100 index lost 22.3 points to 3,017.3, while Frankfurt's DAX 
index eased 8.08 points to 2,038.51. Tokyo's Nikkei index was off 15.30 points 
to 18,998.30. 
</P>
<P>
 * MORE JOBS

 General Motors is in the business of making cars. Washington's subway system 
tries to get people out of them. 
</P>
<P>
 So when GM ads went up in the Metro urging riders to "tear up your monthly 
pass" and buy an Oldsmobile Aurora, transit officials fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unconscionable that a major car manufacturer would come out with an ad 
trying to view us as a competitor," said Metro General Manager Lawrence G. 
Reuter, who noticed the ad while riding a train to work one morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the millions of daily transit users took your advice literally, both cars 
and buses would risk being stuck in commuter traffic from dawn to dusk," said 
Jack R. Gilstrap, executive vice president of the American Public Transit 
Assn., in a letter to GM President and CEO John F. Smith Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't dispute what (Reuter) says," said Gus Buenz, Oldsmobile's public 
relations director in Detroit. "We won't stumble again." Metro is limited in 
its ability to censor such material because of First Amendment concerns.

NEWS ANALYSIS; MEXICO SHOWS FOREIGN INVESTORS A SMOOTH SHIFT OF POWER; TRADE: 
SOME U.S. INVESTORS SAY THE NEW ADMINISTRATION MAY EVEN PUSH FOR THE SALE OF 
NATIONAL ENERGY AND RAIL COMPANIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While the cameras focused on the familiar faces of Cuban President Fidel 
Castro and U.S. Vice President Al Gore at Mexico's presidential inauguration 
this week, a lower-profile group of foreign dignitaries watched the event from 
miles away on closed circuit television. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 U.S. investors -- bankers, portfolio managers and heads of major 
corporations -- were invited to the inauguration as guests of a government 
eager to assure them that their investments are secure and that the transition 
between an administration they have come to trust and President Ernesto 
Zedillo's new team will be smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite some grumbling about their remote vantage point, investors here 
for the ceremony -- as well as those staying behind in the United States -- 
said they are favorably impressed by what they see of Zedillo's economic 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, well-connected investors expect him to deepen the free-market reforms 
of his predecessor, privatizing the railroads, electricity distribution and 
even part or all of Pemex, the national oil company, an almost-sacred symbol of 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo hasn't addressed such questions publicly, and it remains to be seen 
how easily such politically powerful entities as Pemex, the National Railroad 
and the Federal Electric Commissions could be turned over to the private 
sector. All would require constitutional amendments and approval by two-thirds 
of the Mexican Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be consistent with the thinking of the country's new president, 
whose inauguration speech on Thursday promised economic growth without 
inflation and pledged to keep a close rein on government spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sustained growth requires an environment of economic and financial stability 
that guarantees certainty and confidence for saving, planning, investing and 
working productively," Zedillo said. "This demands clear rules and fair 
treatment for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Endorsement by the foreign investment community is crucial to a nation whose 
economic development program hinges on continued flows of foreign capital. Yet 
the investors' presence remains a delicate issue in sovereignty-conscious 
Mexico, where many citizens are still surprised, 11 months after the North 
American Free Trade Agreement took effect, to find their country in a trade 
pact with the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Sovereignty may become even more of an issue as the new administration sells 
the few government-owned companies that remain from the hundreds auctioned off 
during the past eight years. Officially, those industries still under 
government control are termed strategic; in reality, most of have remained in 
government hands due to their political importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors and senior government officials said privately that they expect the 
railroads, electricity and oil will be sold during this administration. All 
three fall under the purview of Zedillo's most controversial cabinet appointee, 
Ignacio Pichardo, who has been accused by the former assistant attorney general 
of using his position as chairman of the ruling party to obstruct a 
high-profile murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we are going to see the oil and gas industry moving toward 
privatization," said Jack Krol, vice chairman of chemical giant DuPont Co., 
owner of oil company Conoco. "They have been thinking about it now for two or 
three years. It's now a matter of how, rather than 'Are we going to do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The previous administration of President Carlos Salinas failed to find buyers 
for several petrochemical plants, partly because they were put on the block 
during a cyclical downturn in the international industry. Krol said he expects 
the Zedillo goverment to sell off entire divisions of Petroleos Mexicanos, the 
national oil monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must have the scale to be competitive globally," he said. "There is a 
big difference in the way people are thinking today." 
</P>
<P>
 Krol added that DuPont would be an interested bidder for numerous Pemex 
assets, including petrochemical, natural gas, oil exploration and production, 
and refining. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors' main worry in Mexico isn't Zedillo's economic policies but whether 
the 42-year-old Yale-educated economist will be able to restore the political 
and social stability that they had taken for granted in Mexico until this 
year's dual political assassinations and a wave of kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, nervousness over the threat of new violence next week in the 
southern state of Chiapas was blamed for Friday's steep 53.86-point drop in the 
Mexican stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, investors seemed reassured by the familiar faces in economic posts. 
Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche and Commerce Minister Herminio Blanco were 
their nation's chief NAFTA negotiators and spent weeks promoting the agreement 
to U.S. investors and business people. Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria is 
well known to bankers for his key role in solving this country's debt crisis in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is an excellent cabinet," said Geoffrey Dennis, head of Latin 
American Research at Bear Stearns. "It is chock full of good, reform-minded 
young technocrats. We expect no significant change in policy. He has put his 
marker firmly in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis said he also was encouraged by Zedillo's inauguration speech promises 
of continuing to balance the federal budget and to fight inflation, now about 
7% a year, down from 159% six years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo told the Mexican Congress, "We will not destroy the stability that the 
people have achieved with such sacrifice."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an eight-page special advertising section titled "The Mexican 
Investor" appeared in major U.S. newspapers on inauguration day, featuring an 
interview with Zedillo and touting economic opportunities in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the foreign investors who traveled here for the inauguration were 
disappointed to be watching it from a room at the National Anthropology Museum, 
near their hotel, most understood about security concerns and the limited 
seating in the Legislative Palace, where the ceremony was held. 
</P>
<P>
 And Friday's private meeting with Zedillo must have soothed their egos.

 Whirlpool Subject of Justice Department Probe: The appliance maker's stock 
fell in heavy trading after word leaked out that it was being investigated by 
federal antitrust authorities.The leaker was its jilted former customer, Best 
Buy. County Natwest analyst Nicholas Heymann said the probe could make it 
difficult for Whirlpool to raise prices, something the company needs to do to 
protect its profits. Whirlpool spokeswoman Robin Skiles said the company 
decided to stop selling its Whirlpool brand through Best Buy because Best Buy 
operates largely as a discount warehouse operation and this conflicts with 
Whirlpool's strategy.

 Court Clears Times Mirror Settlement: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
approved Times Mirror Co.'s settlement of shareholders' lawsuits in connection 
with the proposed merger of its cable operations with Cox Communications Inc. 
The shareholder suits contended that the original merger plan unfairly reduced 
the dividend on the company's common stock. The settlement provides for a 
minimum annual dividend of 24 cents per share on Times Mirror common for at 
least three years and for the company to make an exchange offer of $350 million 
of a new issue of preferred stock for shares of its common.The dividend on the 
preferred stock will be at least 6.5% per year. The settlement, which also won 
approval Wednesday from a Delaware court, now has cleared all legal hurdles.

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; THE DOWNFALL OF A HIGH-RISK FUND; REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 
FOCUS OF CONTROVERSY OVER STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 At the end of October, Orange County Water District Treasurer Andrew Czorny 
got a directive from his board: Look into alternatives to keeping the 
district's $110-million rainy-day fund in the county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's unease over its money -- 90% of its investment portfolio -- was 
understandable. By then, the pool managed by Orange County Treasurer/Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron was earning about 6% a year, with a fantastically 
high degree of risk. Meanwhile, six-month Treasury bills, about the safest 
investments around, were offering almost as much return. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 31, Czorny asked Assistant County Treasurer Matt Raabe whether the 
county could cover a withdrawal. Raabe assured him the pool had $2 billion in 
liquid assets -- enough to cover a withdrawal by every one of the more than 70 
local agencies that voluntarily place their funds with the county. (Another 110 
have no choice but to invest through Citron's office.) 
</P>
<P>
 But this week Raabe changed his tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokerages that lent the county more than $12 billion had demanded additional 
collateral of as much as $1.6 billion, leaving the pool with what officials 
said Friday was only $350 million in liquid assets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the county announced that the $18.5-billion investment pool had 
suffered $1.5 billion in so-far unrealized losses -- by far the biggest 
investment loss disclosed by any local government anywhere during this year of 
turmoil in U.S. financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure has sharply focused public attention on Citron's investment 
strategy, which was aimed at profiting from declining or stable interest rates. 
Why, observers wondered, did Citron not change course last year -- or at least 
earlier this year, when interest rates were clearly fixed on an upward course? 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Citron's risk-oriented approach to investing public funds was no 
secret among the 187 municipalities and public bodies that entrusted their tax 
revenues and other income to him.  
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Sept. 26, in an informal report to the county Board of 
Supervisors, Citron wrote: "We continue to use reverse repurchase agreements as 
part of our investment strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Those so-called "reverse repos" -- recognizably risky transactions in which 
the fund borrowed against its holdings in hopes of multiplying its returns as 
interest rates fell -- were the secret to Citron's supercharged investment 
yields. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also bore the seeds of their own downfall, for they are too complex 
to reverse quickly in the event the market changes course. And that's what 
happened: The Federal Reserve Board has been pushing interest rates higher most 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron "had a strategy that made an awful lot of money, but he didn't modify 
his strategy," says Peer Swan, treasurer of the Irvine Ranch Water District, 
another investor in the county pool. In fact, Swan says, increases in interest 
rates after April this year may have made it impossible to unwind many of the 
more complex transactions without recording a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Put simply, a reverse repo is a deal in which the owner of a security uses it 
as collateral to borrow money and then invests the borrowed money in another 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 In times of declining or stable interest rates, the strategy is a great money 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a $1-million, five-year Treasury note paying 6%, for instance, 
uses it as collateral to borrow another $1 million, which he then invests in 
another $1 million Treasury note, also paying 6%. If he pays 4% interest on the 
loan, he has increased his investment yield from 6% to 8% -- the combined yield 
of the two $1-million notes, minus the 4% loan cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as Citron noted in September, his reverse repos added an additional 
2% to the return on the county pool. By the end of November, the pool had $12.9 
billion in outstanding reverse repos. 
</P>
<P>
 But Citron evidently could not move fast enough when interest rates began to 
turn up. 
</P>
<P>
 In that environment, the reverse-repo strategy squeezes the investor in two 
ways. The cost of the borrowed money rises, reducing the investment gain, and 
the value of the collateral drops -- provoking precisely the collateral calls 
that drained the county pool of cash this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's inability to unwind his borrowings may have been exacerbated by his 
resolutely upbeat view of the future course of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same September report, he argued that the national economy was likely 
to slow down next year; if so, interest rates would slide back down. Although 
that viewpoint was by no means uncommon in the nation's capital markets, it 
evidently kept Citron from adopting a more defensive investment posture. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron consistently bet big on lower rates. Among other securities in the 
portfolio, according to a preliminary study by Capital Market Risk Advisors, 
the New York firm hired to analyze Citron's investments, are as much as $8 
billion in "inverse floaters." These are securities designed to rise in yield 
as interest rates decline -- and decline as interest rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local governments -- along with large companies, institutional investors 
and many bond investors -- have been nipped by the upward turn in interest 
rates.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's happened in the environment of low interest rates and an 
inability to raise taxes (is) that they're looking for a way to generate 
revenue . . . by going for the higher yields," said Betsy Dotson, assistant 
director of the Government Finance Officers Assn., a nonprofit professional 
group in Washington. Sorting out the Mess 
</P>
<P>
 A risky investment strategy has thrown Orange County's once high-flying 
investment fund for local government agencies into turmoil. The fund's 
challenge: to keep agencies from pulling out, which would force fire sales of 
securities and balloon Orange County's losses. REVERSE REPOS: HEART OF THE 
PROBLEM 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County used financial instruments called reverse repurchase agreements 
to borrow against its $7.5 billion in investment holdings, leveraging the fund 
up to more than $20 billion. Here's how reverse repos work: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The owner of a security -- a $1-million, five-year Treasury note with a 6% 
coupon, for example -- pledges the note to an investment bank as collateral for 
a $1-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The investor then uses the loan to purchase another $1-million, five-year 
note earning 6%.  
</P>
<P>
 3. Assume the investor is being charged for the loan at an annual rate of 4%. 
If interest rates remain stable, then his yield on his $1 million -- originally 
only 6% -- is now 8%: 6% plus 6%, minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Here's the risk: The investor is borrowing short-term; reverse repo 
transactions generally have a term of 30, 60, or 90 days, at which point they 
are routinely rolled over. But the investor is using the money to buy long-term 
investments. If interest rates shoot up, as they have this year, he gets 
squeezed twice: 
</P>
<P>
 A. The value of his collateral -- the original $1-million note -- drops, so 
his lender demands cash or more securities to make up the difference. Since 
August, Orange County has had to add $650 million in collateral with rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 B. The rate charged by the bank on the loan rises as the loan is rolled over. 
If rates rise quickly enough, the cost of the loan may rise above the return on 
the investment. LARGEST INVESTORS 
</P>
<P>
 The five largest investors in the Orange County fund have committed more than 
$2.25 billion. Their investments, in millions of dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Transportation Authority: $1,000 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sanitation District: $450

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; THE DOWNFALL OF A HIGH-RISK FUND; WALL STREET FIRMS 
DEFEND USE OF DERIVATIVES AND DOWNPLAY RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street went on the defensive on Friday, downplaying concerns about 
massive fallout from the Orange County investment fund's troubles and defending 
the use of so-called derivative securities against another barrage of political 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley Group, each of which has lent the 
$18.5-billion Orange County fund about $2 billion with which to buy bonds on 
credit, said their loans were fully collateralized and that they had no reason 
to fear losses. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the new chairmen of the Senate and House banking committees both 
said they would hold hearings on derivative securities in light of the Orange 
County fund's losses, Wall Streeters noted that the fund's problems were 
largely a result of its wrong-way bet on interest rates -- not a surprise crash 
brought on by exotic derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 One brokerage executive argued that "it's almost irrelevant" that the fund 
owned $8.5 billion in derivative securities, because they were "garden variety" 
issues that represented the same basic bet on falling interest rates as the 
conventional longer-term bonds that comprised the rest of the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, the derivatives give you the exact same result" as the 
conventional bonds, the executive said: The securities' value plummets as 
interest rates rise. In Orange County's case, the losses were worsened because 
the fund bought more than 60% of its assets on credit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While some other instances of derivative losses this year have involved thinly 
traded securities that became virtually worthless because of interest-rate 
shifts, analysts noted that the derivatives in the Orange County fund were 
mostly created out of bonds issued by U.S. agencies, such as the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all federal agencies (behind the bonds)," said another brokerage 
executive, requesting anonymity. "This is 'money good' at maturity," assuming 
the fund can avoid selling them in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Orange County officials have argued that their portfolio's losses are 
no different from "paper" losses incurred by other bond investors this year as 
rates have risen, and that the fund simply needs to hold the securities until 
they mature to collect 100 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the extent to which the Orange County fund had purchased bonds on 
credit, and the high-risk nature of its bet -- borrowing short-term to buy 
bonds maturing as far off as 1998 -- stunned many investment pros nationwide on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some questioned why major Wall Street brokerages would facilitate such a 
strategy via credit, given that they knew that the Orange Countyfund was 
originally intended to be a short-term investment vehicle for taxpayers' 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's shocking because what we're talking about is an institutional 
money-market fund, holding cash that needs to be available on a short-term 
basis" to its investors, said one banking executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's inexcusable for Wall Street to have allowed a public entity to 
do this," another banking executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics noted that the "inverse floater" bonds that comprise the bulk of 
the Orange County fund's derivatives, while plain-vanilla as derivatives go, 
still entail more risk than conventional bonds because they are structured to 
respond more violently to interest-rate moves. 
</P>
<P>
 But brokerage executives scoffed at the idea that Wall Street should be held 
accountable for a bad investment bet made by professionals who should have had 
full knowledge of the risks involved. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, some pros noted, the Orange County fund had used the same 
leveraged strategy to boost returns in 1991, 1992 and 1993, as interest rates 
fell and bonds appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're making money using risk, people don't question it," said Janet 
Grangaard, who manages $600 million in muni bonds for the Lutheran Brotherhood 
fund group in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the magnitude of the Orange County fund's losses -- $1.5 billion 
on paper, so far -- has resurrected discussion within the brokerage industry 
and among regulators about the age-old issue of suitability: How can investors, 
large and small, be kept from hurting themselves unnecessarily with investments 
or strategies unsuitable for them? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Roberts, a Securities and Exchange Commission member, noted that the 
SEC several months ago asked six major Wall Street dealers in derivative 
securities to develop "voluntary suitability standards" that could serve as 
guidelines for investment firms and their investors. The dealers' report is due 
Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 R. Fenn Putnam, chairman of the Public Securities Assn., representing Wall 
Street bond dealers, argued that despite what is sure to be a renewed outcry in 
Congress about derivative investments, "We believe strongly that legislation 
(restricting derivatives' use) isn't the answer -- education is." 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives, he noted, have been extensively and successfully used by 
investors worldwide for years to hedge as well as make bets on financial market 
trends.

 Blues Singer's Widow Wins Royalties Suit: A jury on Friday found that the late 
blues singer Willie Dixon was duped into signing away a third of his song 
rights to his ex-manager under a 1977 contract. The Los Angeles Superior Court 
panel's decision came after several days of deliberation in the trial of a 
lawsuit brought by the legendary artist's widow, Marie, against her husband's 
former manager, Scott Cameron.Marie Dixon sued Cameron shortly after her 
husband died in 1992. She claimed her late husband, who had trouble reading and 
writing, was tricked into signing a pact he hadn't fully understood. The jury's 
verdicts mean Cameron no longer will receive royalties for the songs Dixon 
signed away, said plaintiff's lawyer Joseph Hart. Those songs stand to bring in 
millions of dollars in royalties, he said. The panel awarded Marie Dixon the 
rights to those songs and about $6,000, half the money Cameron had made off the 
tunes since the Dixons began disputing the contract.

MICROSOFT DENIES REPORTS OF GATES' BUYING INTO STUDIO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. on Friday denied a report that Chairman Bill Gates might make 
a personal investment in the new Hollywood studio headed by Steven Spielberg, 
Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates and other top Microsoft executives are in discussions to purchase 
entertainment from the studio, a Microsoft spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates and several other executives from Microsoft met with the studio's 
officials to discuss getting various forms of entertainment from the studio, 
said spokeswoman Pam Edstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in Friday's editions that Gates is in advanced discussions 
to invest in the new studio, formed last month. Microsoft officials declined 
comment when asked about it by The Times on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But after publication of the article, Edstrom told wire services, "There's no 
truth to it. None, zero, nada ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft, as part of their interest for the future of on-line services and 
the information highway, has turned to many content- and producer-type people," 
Edstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new studio is a venture among director Spielberg, former Walt Disney Co. 
studio chief Katzenberg and record executive Geffen.

 Nintendo Ordered to Pay Alpex Damage Award: In a blow to Nintendo Co., a 
federal judge in New York upheld a $208-million patent infringement award 
against it and ordered that Nintendo must also pay Alpex Computer Corp. a 
percentage of infringing revenues. U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood refused 
Nintendo's motion for a new trial. Instead, she said, Nintendo must pay the 
damage award to Alpex, a defunct Colorado company, along with 6% of Nintendo's 
infringing revenues during the period between Dec. 1, 1992, and May 31, 1994, 
and prejudgment interest. In June, a Manhattan federal jury found that Nintendo 
had copied Alpex technology in parts of its Nintendo Entertainment System.

CALIFORNIA ENERGY CALLS OFF BID FOR RIVAL MAGMA POWER; TAKEOVER: INSUFFICIENT 
NUMBER OF SAN DIEGO GEOTHERMAL COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED STOCK IN RESPONSE 
TO $38.50-PER-SHARE OFFER. HOSTILE SUITOR HINTS AT LEGAL ACTION. 
</P>

 California Energy Co. called off its hostile $924-million takeover bid for 
rival geothermal energy producer Magma Power on Friday after an insufficient 
number of Magma shareholders tendered stock in response to its $38.50-per-share 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Omaha-based California Energy, which set a deadline of midnight Friday to 
receive Magma shares, would not disclose how many shares were tendered. The 
hostile suitor also solicited consent forms to call a special shareholder 
meeting to review its offer but only 41% of Magma shareholders had agreed to 
the meeting as of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the last shot may not have been fired in the high stakes takeover battle 
involving the nation's two largest geothermal companies. In a news release, 
California Energy accused Magma executives of a "blatant breach of fiduciary 
obligations," hinting at further legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego-based Magma Power officials would not comment late Friday on the 
California Energy announcement. A spokesman said warily that the company was 
"studying" the news release. 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy shares closed up 50 cents at $16.50 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading while Magma Power shares were up 75 cents at $35.50 in 
over-the-counter trading. California Energy announced the termination after the 
markets closed Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 In its news release, California Energy said its effort to call a special 
shareholder meeting was stymied by the refusal of Magma's two largest 
shareholders to submit consent forms. Those investors were Dow Chemical, which 
owns 21% of Magma shares,, and the B.C. McCabe Foundation, which owns 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 The takeover battle began Sept. 19 when California Energy wrote Magma Power's 
board of directors offering $35 a share, or $840 million in stock and cash for 
the company. A merger would create the world's largest geothermal concern and 
give it a strong position in the newly competitive worldwide power market, 
California Energy Chairman David Sokol said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy launched its bid on Oct. 6, offering $35 cash for the first 
51% of Magma shares tendered. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Magma Power launched a strenuous effort to persuade large 
institutional stockholders to ignore California Energy's offer, saying it was 
"opportunistic" and that Magma shares soon would be worth more because of new 
projects planned in the Philippines and Indonesia. Magma said last month that 
it was holding discussion with other companies about possible business 
combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 After several analysts predicted California Energy would have to up its bid to 
$40 a share to succeed, California increased its offer in early November to 
$38.50 per share, apparently to no avail.

company said.The 500 workers at Mervyn's headquarters in Hayward, Calif., will 
be offered a chance to relocate, the company said. Dayton Hudson said the cost 
of the consolidation will result in a fourth-quarter pretax charge of about $10 
million, or 8 cents per share, but will result in significant future savings. 
The current Minneapolis credit operation also serves Target Stores, which 
Dayton Hudson owns along with Marshall Fields, Dayton's and Hudson's department

 McDonald's Reaches Settlement in Coffee Burn Lawsuit: An 81-year-old woman who 
won a nearly $2.9-million jury award after she was burned by McDonald's coffee 
has reached a settlement with the fast-food chain.Terms of the agreement were 
confidential, attorneys for Stella Liebeck and McDonald's Corp. said. Liebeck 
suffered third-degree burns on her legs, groin and buttocks in 1992 when she 
spilled coffee. She had put the cup between her legs and tried to pry the lid 
off at a McDonald's drive-through. Liebeck contended the coffee was a defective 
product because it was too hot. The coffee was 165 to 170 degrees, she said, 
while coffee brewed at home is 135 to 140 degrees.

STATE SENATE TO VOTE ON 'REAGAN FREEWAY' PLAN; TRANSPORTATION: APPROVAL IS 
EXPECTED ON THE PLAN TO RENAME THE SIMI HIGHWAY. KATZ AND CALTRANS SKIRMISH 
OVER THE ISSUE. 
</P>

 While the Assembly reconvenes Monday to the high drama of a partisan power 
struggle, one of the first orders of business in the Senate will be renaming 
the Simi Valley Freeway after former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 A Senate resolution to post the ailing ex-President's name on the 118 Freeway 
-- which runs across the northern rim of the San Fernando Valley from San 
Fernando over the Simi Hills to Moorpark -- is expected to win easy approval, 
said Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the measure's main 
author. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's appropriate to acknowledge Ronald Reagan's contribution as a 
private citizen, as governor and as President," Lockyer said Friday. "And 
naming a freeway after him is one of the ways that those honors get bestowed." 
</P>
<P>
 The seemingly non-controversial proposal follows a brief skirmish between the 
California Department of Transportation and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
who, as chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, opposes naming 
freeways for living people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd prefer the policy of naming freeways in honor of people who have died," 
Katz said. "I have nothing against Ronald Reagan, but where do you draw the 
line?" 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that Caltrans was trying to rush the freeway re-christening, Katz 
sent a letter to the department on Sept. 12, warning it against moving forward 
without first obtaining Senate approval. The Assembly had adopted its version 
of the Reagan resolution Aug. 31 but failed to get it to the Senate floor in 
time for a vote before adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz's concern and the tone of his letter -- in which he asked Caltrans to 
confirm that it " will not allow the posting of signs" before Senate approval 
-- left state transportation officials questioning the appropriateness of his 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said the assemblyman's request for assurances 
amounted to "much ado about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "He voiced the concern," Drago said. "But the fact of the matter is this is 
going through the normal process anyway and going to the Senate for a vote." 
</P>
<P>
 As for breaking with tradition and naming a freeway after a living figure, 
William G. Brennan, deputy secretary of the state Business, Transportation and 
Housing Agency, said this is one case that warrants a departure -- particularly 
in light of Reagan's recent disclosure that he has entered the early stages of 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's said that people have to wait until they die to be acknowledged or 
recognized for their achievements," Brennan said. "I just don't get offended 
about going out and naming a freeway after him now, while he can still enjoy 
it. I wish there was a bigger one and a longer one we could pick." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans estimates the cost of designating the 118 corridor as the Ronald 
Reagan Freeway at about $4,000. That should cover the price of erecting and 
maintaining new signs at each end of the freeway, Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding will come from private donations expected to be collected by a 
nonprofit entity set up by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), a co-author of the Senate 
resolution, said one benefit of renaming the freeway will be to remind people 
of the presidential library's location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give us the opportunity to highlight that the library is in Simi 
Valley," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Katz said a more appropriate decision would be to name California 23 for 
the former President, since that highway leads right to the library's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Katz said, it was suggested that the Pacific Coast Highway be 
named after Reagan, "but I couldn't see naming the state's most scenic coastal 
highway for a man who once said, 'When you've seen one redwood, you've seen 
them all.' "

HUNDREDS MOURN FOR CRASH VICTIM; FUNERAL: TEEN-AGER WHO DIED IN AN ACCIDENT ON 
HIS BIRTHDAY IS BURIED WITH A NEW BEEPER, A PRIZED POSSESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While 600 mourning family members, friends and fellow students from Crescenta 
Valley High School looked on, 15-year-old Sevag (Steve) Cholakian was buried 
Friday with a favorite possession, a beeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The beeper that Sevag received a few days before his death as a birthday 
present was lost in the accident that killed him and his friend David 
Gevorkyan, 14, on Monday when the car they were riding in hurtled 500 feet down 
an embankment in the Angeles National Forest. But a new one was placed inside 
his casket to symbolize the boy's lasting bond with his loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Take this beeper, and anytime we think of you or call you, it 
will beep,' " said Stepan Kabadian, chairman of St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic 
Church in Glendale, where an emotional memorial service was held Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Students clad in black -- some wearing specially made T-shirts bearing the 
words "in memory of David, Sevag" -- filled the church auditorium, joined by 
about a dozen uniformed members of the high school's Air Force ROTC program, to 
which both boys belonged. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still distraught over his loss, many of Sevag's friends said they 
would not forget the boy who wore a constant smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always kept me going and always helped me press on through many 
hardships," recalled Colin Russell, who said he and Sevag had been best friends 
for 10 years. The two boys had planned to join the U.S. Air Force after college 
and later forge careers in music, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going to learn how to play the guitar. He had a guitar, but he never 
got a chance to learn how to play it," Colin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sevag, David and three other students -- Malineh Martussian, 19, of Glendale, 
Suzan Guluzian, 15, of La Canada, and Polek Aladadyan, 14, of La Crescenta -- 
decided to skip school Monday to celebrate both Sevag's 15th birthday, which 
was Monday, and Suzan's 16th birthday, which was Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group drove up the Angeles Crest Highway in Martussian's car to see the 
snow in the San Gabriel Mountains. But about 11 a.m., as they were heading back 
home, the car drifted onto the dirt shoulder, skidded back across the highway, 
struck a cement lip alongside the pavement and rolled over it, plunging down 
the hillside near the Mt. Wilson turnoff road, said California Highway Patrol 
Sgt. Ralph Elvira. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that they were traveling about 45 or 46 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. 
zone, so they were not driving at an unsafe speed. She (Martussian) lost 
control, and she may have either panicked or was just not able to regain 
control of the car," Elvira said. CHP officials do not believe drugs or alcohol 
contributed to the accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to initial reports of the accident, Sevag was not ejected from the 
car but was found in the vehicle's front seat, still wearing his seat belt. 
David was thrown from the vehicle and found about 70 feet from the car, Elvira 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage was far from the road and unnoticeable to passing cars, and the 
three injured girls were rescued only after Polek spent four hours climbing the 
hill -- despite a broken pelvis -- and flagged down a motorist who called for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, friends said Martussian's family was in constant vigil at her 
bedside at County-USC Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she has been 
unconscious since the accident. Both Suzan, who was still hospitalized at 
County-USC, and Polek, who was recovering at home, were said to be improving. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley High School Principal Ken Biermann said some students have 
begun a petition drive to urge the CHP to install guard rails at hairpin curves 
along the mountain highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult when you lose any student, but these two boys were extremely 
well liked," Biermann said. "The students are trying to turn this loss into 
something positive and constructive." 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Petrossian, intercultural coordinator for the school district and a 
friend of both the Cholakian and Gevorkyan families, said both boys were 
"basically clean-cut kids" who made "a naive, foolish mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully this will be a lesson to their friends. Kids need to learn that 
life is precious, and every decision they make affects the rest of their 
lives," Petrossian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial services and burial for David are scheduled Monday at Forest Lawn 
Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills.

HUNT BREAKS UP PACK OF PREDATORY DOGS; ANTELOPE VALLEY: COUNTY OFFICIALS, 
RANCHERS USE TRUCKS AND A PLANE TO TRACK DOWN ANIMALS THAT KILLED DOZENS OF 
SHEEP. ONE IS CAUGHT, ONE IS KILLED IN PURSUIT.

 It was hours before dawn Friday, but animal control officers were already 
assembled -- weary, but armed and game to do battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had managed just a few hours of sleep since Monday, frustrated in their 
efforts to hunt down a pack of dogs that had killed dozens of local sheep. By 
week's end, the trail had gone cold -- three of the dogs had eluded captors for 
days, blending into the desert darkness at night, hiding among the dense 
underbrush during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't we just napalm them?" quipped one official early Friday. For the 
next seven hours, he and a posse of Los Angeles County animal control officers 
and local ranchers waited for a glimpse of the hounds that have been 
terrorizing livestock in this part of the northern Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 By midmorning, they finally got a break. Two of the culprits were spotted with 
the help of airborne reconnaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 A fleet of all-terrain vehicles and trucks took up the chase through the 
desert near Rosamond, trailing the fleeing canines as they high-tailed it 
across the Kern County line. Overhead, the plane kept track of the dogs, and 
the hunters believed they were finally at the end of the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "These dogs are pretty unpredictable," said Bob Ballenger, a spokesman for 
county animal control, who joined the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The final chain of events began just before sunset Thursday. Workers at the 
Nebeker ranch -- the center of the most vicious attacks -- began to patrol the 
sheep and goat pens in trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs had struck at least three times over the past week. Stakeouts by 
ranch hands and animal control officers had failed to foil the hounds, who had 
slaughtered over 30 lambs, worth thousands of dollars. So on Friday, the 
ranchers tried to scare the dogs away with the truck patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:30 a.m., the animal control officers shuffled into their headquarters, 
located a couple of miles from the ranch. After guzzling some coffee, they 
hopped in their trucks in teams of two and drove to surveillance points along 
the mostly dirt roads that surround the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the sheep pens, the dogs would have to leave their desert camouflage 
and dart across the road, where they could be seen and captured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a waiting game," said county Department of Animal Care and Control 
Officer Michael Wilson, his breath fogging in the chilly, early-morning air. 
"You can't predict what domestic dogs will do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was right. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officers shivered in their cars and waited, the dogs had already struck 
at another ranch farther north, killing several goats. 
</P>
<P>
 But as daylight began to break, the once-still patch of desert north of the 
ranch began to bustle with action as officers and ranchers in their all-terrain 
vehicles and pickups drove around trying, with little success, to flush out the 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunt changed when Michael Lamb drove up in his pickup and asked, "Why 
wasn't I invited to this hunt?" Officer Leslie Troncale, Lamb's neighbor, 
smiled, saying, "He has a plane ." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Lamb was airborne in his Cessna, with Troncale's husband, 
Craig, at his side, radioing their observations to the ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunters, learning of the attack farther north, drove to the Kern County 
line, where they met Kern County animal control officers who were now also 
hunting the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, the group got word that a homeowner just north of the Kern 
County line reported seeing three dogs running from her property with a chicken 
in their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirt and tumbleweed flew as the hunters sped off, crisscrossing a grid of 
riverbeds and ditches as the dogs scattered, the reconnaissance plane keeping 
track from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest dog, a black terrier, tried to cut across a dirt path, but dashed 
in front of a pickup and was run over and killed. Another, a tan shepherd mix, 
dove into a drainpipe to hide. The exit was blocked by animal control officers, 
who crawled in, retrieved the whimpering hound and tossed it in the lockup. 
</P>
<P>
 A third dog -- a German shepherd and pit bull mix, and the largest of the pack 
-- apparently escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we got his gang, but we didn't get the leader," said Jack 
Cramer, a 59-year-old ranch hand. The remaining dog, he said, "may or may not 
be active. Once they lose their pack, their psychology changes." 
</P>
<P>
 The hunters say they spotted a collar on the fleeing dog and saw signs that 
the dog killed in the chase had also belonged to someone. 
</P>
<P>
 That was just what Eugene Nebeker, owner of the Nebeker ranch, had expected. 
Last week, his ranchers had shot three other domestic dogs that had attacked 
his livestock. He was fuming that a pet owner's carelessness had cost him tens 
of thousands of dollars worth of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 "About two-thirds of our business has come to a screeching halt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just absolutely fed up with this situation, and I'm not going to rest 
until it's better controlled," he said. "The custom up here with too many 
people is just to let their dogs run free." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Miley, manager of the Lancaster animal control shelter, said, "If people 
only knew what their animals are capable of doing."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; X-RATED FILMMAKING BARRED ON CITY'S LAND 
</P>

 Filmmakers will no longer be allowed to shoot pornographic scenes on publicly 
owned property in Burbank after some city workers complained about unexpectedly 
finding an X-rated film crew at the city's power plant in October. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are revising the way they issue permits to filmmakers by asking 
more questions about the scenes to be shot, including whether any nudity is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until this point, we've been primarily interested in the tenant quality, 
making sure whoever uses our facility doesn't damage it," Assistant City 
Manager Steve Helvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our perspective, it's important to distinguish that we're not trying to 
make statement calls about the content of movies. We still are not interested 
in whether a movie will ultimately be PG- or R-rated. It's the manner in which 
the city of Burbank is going to be displayed." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, power plant workers said they unexpectedly walked past filming of 
the movie "Fantasy Chamber" and were stunned to see oral copulation and 
intercourse involving groups of two and three actors. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; LIGHTHEARTED CELEBRATION OF HANUKKAH

 Miniature chefs performed the Hanukkah rap while 6-year-old potato latkes 
danced to a Calypso beat Friday, as first-graders at the Valley Beth Shalom 
school gave their annual musical performance honoring the Jewish festival of 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the youngsters fidgeted with their costumes, fumbled their choreography 
and dissolved into chaos at the end of each song. But no one seemed to mind, or 
even notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they are this cute," said Kenny Ellis, the play's director, "anything 
they might actually do on stage is just the gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday marked the sixth day of Hanukkah, an eight-day festival that by 
tradition celebrates the reclamation of Jerusalem by the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 But the holiday also holds more modern meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the light of the candle as a true miracle. That light symbolizes 
goodness in the midst of darkness, and the hope that as the light increases, 
goodness will prevail," said Nili Ziv, director of Judaic studies at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "During this holiday," Ziv said, "we should be kindling the spark of goodness 
in other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the 68 first-graders who took the stage Friday kindled a spark of 
giddiness in the parents and school officials assembled around them. The 
youngsters were dressed as soldiers and jugs of oil, chefs and candles, 
dreidels and, of course, latkes, or potato pancakes. And the chefs rapped in 
their number, "What would a holiday be without food?" 
</P>
<P>
 The show opened as all 400 children of the elementary school sang a blessing 
over the lighting of the sixth candle on a large menorah. The student choir 
then took over the program, urging the audience to stand up against the mighty 
and to "help us make a better world." 
</P>
<P>
 The show ended with the entire cast singing, on tiptoe and at the top of their 
lungs, "We are the light of hope. . . . We are the light of history." L.D.

 The number of candidates expected to run for open seats on Glendale's City 
Council, school board and college board continued to grow this week as several 
veteran and first-time office-seekers entered the fray for next April's 
municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 David Weaver, who ran unsuccessfully last year to replace one of three 
retiring City Council incumbents, will challenge Mayor Eileen Givens and 
three-term Councilman Larry Zarian, who recently announced their reelection 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver, 55, a civil engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is the 
first candidate to officially enter the race against the two sitting council 
members, although John K. Beach, a two-time unsuccessful candidate, has said he 
might also run. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Musurlian, an aide to U.S. Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale), said this 
week he will seek a seat on the Glendale Board of Education, a post he sought 
unsuccessfully four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Musurlian, chairman of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce education committee, 
will either run against Sharon Beauchamp or Blanche Greenwood, who have not yet 
stated whether they will seek reelection. John Gantus, an attorney, has also 
said he will vie for a seat on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert K. Holmes, president of the Glendale Community College Board of 
Trustees, said this week he will campaign for a fourth four-year term on the 
board. Holmes, who practices law in Glendale and teaches business law at the 
13,000-student college, is the only one of the three incumbents to seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Hamilton, proprietor of a local investment management firm, said last 
week she will also run for a seat on the college board. Hamilton, who has never 
sought public office before, is a former Chamber of Commerce president. STEVE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; GROUP TO DISCUSS EATING DISORDERS

<P>
 The Pierce College WoMen's Resource Center is offering a free support group 
for men and women who suffer from eating disorders, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be held on a drop-in basis from 4:30 to 6 p.m. two days, 
Tuesday and Dec. 20, said Barbara Fish, director of the center, which serves 
men and women. Non-students are also invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be conducted by Joyce Levy-Katz, a marriage, family and child 
counselor who is volunteering her time, Fish said. For details, call the center 
at (818) 719-6437. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy-Katz said she routinely sends flyers to schools throughout the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I found was that there was a number of people at Pierce College who 
could not afford to pay for the sessions," said Levy-Katz, a recovering 
bulimic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it's like to be a student, to be trying to get your degree and at 
the same time battling with an eating disorder," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she chose the drop-in basis because people feel more comfortable with 
that format. It allows students to schedule the sessions around their classes, 
and those who don't feel comfortable can leave at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, there is a lot of shame and denial with eating disorders," she 
said. "Sometimes, they just want to leave as soon as they get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Two prior drop-in sessions drew seven and five people, respectively, Levy-Katz 
said. Two school staff members have also expressed interest in the program, 
Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to determine how many people on the Pierce campus suffer from 
eating disorders because all of the evidence to date is just anecdotal, Fish 
said. Part of the problem is that few people want to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some of these people, this is the first time that they have ever talked 
to anybody about it," Levy-Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes to continue the program into next semester. "It's just wonderful 
that the WoMen's Resource Center allowed this to happen," she said. FRANK

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ART CLASSES FOR ABUSED YOUTH FIND NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Heartworld, a nonprofit art therapy program for abused youngsters that faded 
away last year after the lease on its headquarters expired, now has a permanent 
home at the Mid Valley Youth Center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was founded by Calabasas collage artist Anne Nathan-Wlodarski two 
years ago. Using space donated by the city in a Chatsworth warehouse, 
Nathan-Wlodarski helped troubled children express themselves by teaching them 
to draw, paint and sculpt. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, the city's lease on the warehouse expired, leaving 
Heartworld without a home. But two months ago, Nathan-Wlodarski was hired by 
the Mid Valley Youth Center, a temporary home for displaced children and wards 
of the court, to provide art therapy services to the 80 young residents of the 
center and other troubled youth from around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you help a child to become creative, that child will become a better 
student. He'll use that creativity in the other subjects," Nathan-Wlodarski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She described Heartworld as a blend of psychology and art. "Some of these kids 
are incredibly talented, but you have to draw it out of them -- you have to 
help them make the effort and understand it's OK to express." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Nathan-Wlodarski coached a group of seven teen-age girls as they 
created Christmas decorations for a ceremony next Friday at the center to honor 
teen-agers who have performed valuable community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Carla, 14, from Van Nuys, made a beeline for the table in the center of 
Heartworld's new studio space in a large room on the second floor. She seized a 
purple marker and began coloring an angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I color or I draw and it calms me down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nykieysha, 14, of Los Angeles, also looks forward to the art sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked art, from the time I drew my first animal when I was a 
kid," said Nykieysha, who wants to become a veterinarian or an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 But Qwendolyn, 16, of Los Angeles, said she doesn't particularly enjoy art. 
"The things I do don't come out right. Everybody will laugh at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Wilson-Jordan, director of the youth center, said such a reaction is not 
uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these children have learned only negative ways to express themselves 
to each other, to the world. Heartworld is giving them a chance to express and 
ventilate their feelings in a very different way. It gives them something they 
can call their own." TIM MAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; DEDICATION OF GARDENS' CENTER AS PLACE OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the jumble of 40-year-old, government-built, cinder-block homes, the 
pristine white-and-green building is an almost literal lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is that those who live in the San Fernando Gardens housing complex 
will be drawn to the Multipurpose Community Center and leave speaking English 
or with their high-school equivalency diplomas or with well-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is called a multipurpose center but it really has only one purpose," 
said U.S. Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City). "It is the mechanism by which 
the people who live here can get empowered." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman was one of many officials and more than 100 residents of the Pacoima 
housing complex on hand Friday for the dedication of the sparkling new 
facility, touted as a product of intergovernmental cooperation and a place of 
hope in an impoverished, sometimes violent neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by monies from federal and local agencies totaling $876,000, the 
V-shaped, 5,330-square-foot building has been in the planning stages since the 
late 1980s. The finished product features a 100-person meeting room, a day-care 
center complete with Lego building blocks, a kitchen and office and teaching 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Lehigh Avenue complex will have access to services ranging 
from parenting and typing classes to job placement. 
</P>
<P>
 After several delays in construction, some resident leaders at San Fernando 
Gardens -- home to nearly 2,000 people in 466 units -- feared at times the 
project would never come to fruition. But everyone seemed thrilled at the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaker after speaker offered high hopes -- translated into Spanish for 
the predominantly Latino residents -- that the center would offer a step up for 
a neighborhood struggling with gangs, drugs, poverty and, for many, a new 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's truly a dream come true," said Ozie B. Gonzaque, chairperson of the 
board of commissioners of the Housing Authority of the city of Los Angeles, 
which manages the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Gardens center is the first of its kind, but Gonzaque said, 
"It's the beginning. We hope to have them all over the city." ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; UNLICENSED DRIVER GETS 6 MONTHS JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sylmar man was sentenced Friday to six months in jail for driving without a 
license after he told the court he was a "sovereign citizen" of the Republic of 
California and not subject to state or federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sanders, 37, received the maximum penalty for the misdemeanor offense 
after representing himself in a one-hour trial in San Fernando Municipal Court 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued unsuccessfully that he subscribed to the Constitution of the former 
California Republic -- an antebellum document that gave "free white males" 
status as "common-law citizens" and enabled them to "drive conveyances" without 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unpersuaded, Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt found Sanders guilty of driving without a 
license and driving an unregistered vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely a high-level eccentric," said Deputy City Atty. Norman 
Wegener, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegener said Sanders' case is not unique. He appears to belong to a loose-knit 
group of people -- many of them tax resisters -- who share a rejection of 
contemporary law and federal power. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have appeared in court for similar traffic offenses and, like Sanders, 
have received jail sentences in an effort to deter them from what Wegener 
called potentially dangerous beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination to think about what would 
happen if there was widespread driving of vehicles without any regulation or 
effort to ensure the drivers can see or even know what they are doing," Wegener 
said. "We'd have complete carnage on the highways." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was stopped in the Sylmar Square District on Aug. 25 after a Los 
Angeles police officer noticed he was driving without license plates. When the 
officer asked Sanders for his driver's license, Sanders replied that he did not 
have one and "didn't have to have one," Wegener said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was being held at Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $15,000 bail and 
could not be reached for comment. LESLIE BERGER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; REDEVELOPMENT PANEL PICKS ANGER MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On his last full day in office Friday, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky angered many of his constituents by appointing a controversial 
citizens panel to represent the community in an earthquake-recovery zone in 
Sherman Oaks and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yaroslavsky combined earthquake victims, business leaders and pro- 
and anti-redevelopment forces, the nine-member appointment to the Community 
Redevelopment Agency's Earthquake Recovery Advisory Committee quickly drew fire 
from critics who complained that the panel tilted too much toward developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zev should be absolutely ashamed of himself," said Matt Epstein, vice 
president of the 1,600-family Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "It's a bunch of 
developers and attorneys. The majority is a fan club for the CRA. I don't see 
one person, other than Scott Harvey, who has no vested interest. Everyone else 
has a conflict." But Yaroslavsky's office defended the one-year appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a good mix," said Vivian Rescalvo, Yaroslavsky's planning 
deputy. "Seven of them participated in the redevelopment plan for this area. 
Scott Harvey helped spearhead the campaign against the CRA, but later worked 
with us. We needed to have some continuity." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's selection is the latest controversy surrounding the 717-acre 
emergency redevelopment zone, which will use property taxes to provide loans to 
repair residential and commercial neighborhoods hardest hit by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone was approved by the City Council last week, following heated debate 
from residents who do not trust the CRA's ability to spend their tax dollars 
wisely or condemn private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two vocal opponents of the CRA zone, both members of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn., were appointed to the committee: Harvey, an attorney, and 
Gary Holme, president of a property management company. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee cannot set policy, but can veto elements of the redevelopment 
plan, which calls for $18 million to be spent in the zone. Only a two-thirds 
vote of the City Council can overturn the committee's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said Yaroslavsky's departure to the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors on Monday will make the committee a puppet of the CRA until a new 
City Council member is elected next July. But committee chairwoman Nancy 
Schmidt said homeowners have been fairly represented. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CSUN FILM SENIORS TO SHOW THEIR WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five films by graduating Cal State Northridge students will be screened next 
Wednesday evening at the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The screening, postponed last spring because of the Jan. 17 earthquake, is 
part of an annual program that gives budding undergraduate filmmakers from 
CSUN's department of radio, television and film the opportunity to display 
their talents before a general audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Battling for recognition with more widely known film and theater programs at 
USC and UCLA, this year's batch of student hopefuls comes from a program that, 
along with the rest of CSUN, is just recovering from the disheveled state it 
had been thrown into almost a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still in a general state of discombobulation," said Temma Kramer, the 
program's event coordinator. "It was a struggle to get editing space after the 
quake, and teaching a directing class inside of a trailer is just absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't have been able to put on a normal program in the spring," she 
said. "A number of the students had lost their apartments and were still 
wandering from friend to friend in search of a place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Kramer said, the students turned out quality products. 
</P>
<P>
 One film crew, confronted with inaccessible production equipment from the 
school and a temporary loss of location space, was actually able to turn their 
project into something better as a result of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the crew members was "displaced from his home and two others left the 
project shortly after the earthquake," said Jeffrey C. Roth, director and 
executive producer of "Domino Theories," which deals with racial and 
sociological relationships in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "But because it was such a scary experience to go through," he said, the quake 
"made the rest of us realize that life is short and that you should just go out 
there and make your dreams come true. If you have the motivation, you'll do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects to be aired Wednesday carry similar messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interpretations," for example, depicts the struggle for success of a deaf 
photographer who takes on her first job with a major advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dream All American" studies the impact of a life-changing moment on a former 
major league baseball player and ex-convict. 
</P>
<P>
 The free screening is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the academy, 5230 
Lankershim Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The other films include "Infatuation," the story of a 9-year-old boy who falls 
in love with an adult woman, and "Rough Cut Riley," a modern detective story 
about a young sleuth stuck in the 1940s. ANTONIO OLIVO

CBS JOINS OPPOSITION TO EXPANSION OF BURBANK AIRPORT; ENVIRONMENT: THE CITY OF 
LOS ANGELES ALSO FILES A LAWSUIT. THE CHALLENGES TO THE REPORT THAT CLAIMS THE 
PROJECT WILL NOT INCREASE NOISE POLLUTION CATCH SPOKESMAN VICTOR GILL OFF 
GUARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 CBS Inc. has joined a chorus of public opposition to the Burbank Airport's 
plans for building a larger terminal, claiming its popular production facility 
in Studio City loses thousands of dollars annually due to disruptive aircraft 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The network's announcement Friday came as the latest surprise this week for 
airport officials, who also learned they are being sued by the city of Los 
Angeles for the fourth time since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Both CBS and the Los Angeles are trying to stop construction of the new 
terminal, claiming airport officials failed to produce an adequate 
environmental study on the project that is required under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport's operating board -- made up of commissioners from Burbank, 
Glendale and Pasadena -- plans to quadruple the size of the terminal, and 
nearly double the number of aircraft gates, in order to accommodate a growing 
number of travelers by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board's lengthy environmental impact report has produced a swirl of 
controversy, largely because it concludes the project will not significantly 
increase noise pollution for residents nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This week's challenges to the report caught airport spokesman Victor Gill off 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "My suspicion -- and I have nothing to back this up -- is there is a 
cross-fertilization between CBS' involvement and the homeowners' groups," he 
said. "CBS Inc. has never shown its face in connection with the airport in the 
10 years I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
 The CBS Studio Center in Studio City -- where shows like "Roseanne," 
"Seinfeld" and "Grace Under Fire" are produced -- is located under the 
airport's flight path. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is far from the imaginary boundary around the airport, known as the 65 
CNEL contour, in which airport officials are required under state law to reduce 
the number of homes, schools and hospitals affected by aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio's president, Mike Klausman, acknowledged that airport officials are 
not obligated to do anything for residents or businesses located outside the 
contour. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, production at the 40-acre facility with 16 sound stages and at 
least 2,500 employees is disrupted for three to four minutes every time an 
airplane flies overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to name which shows were affected and said he did not know exactly 
how much money the studio has lost over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not opposed to the Burbank Airport expansion," Klausman said. "We're 
opposed to all the flights this way. We'd like a better allocation of the 
flight pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "To increase it would affect me even more. The question is, why can't they 
(airport officials) divide it up in a more equitable manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, about 90% of airplanes departing Burbank Airport take off to the 
south and circle east over neighborhoods such as North Hollywood, Valley 
Village, Studio City and Sherman Oaks. The Air Line Pilots Assn. supports that 
pattern, citing a number of safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Though workers at the CBS Studio Center have suffered from aircraft noise for 
years, Klausman said he never complained to airport officials because he did 
not know enough about the matter until meeting recently with homeowners' 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' announcement was made during a brief hearing Friday before Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien, who had ordered airport officials to 
redo the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The order was prompted by a lawsuit filed by attorneys for the city of Los 
Angeles and four homeowners' groups over the adequacy of the report's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials updated the report this year, but reached the same 
conclusion as before: The new terminal will not lead to a significant increase 
in aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, O'Brien said he would begin deliberations in the case to determine 
whether the airport's updated report is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' attorney, Beth Finley, acknowledging it was too late to join Los Angeles' 
suit, asked the judge to consider the studio's comments about aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien declined, saying, "This case has been going on forever. . . . It's 
just too late." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the hearing, Los Angeles filed yet another lawsuit against 
airport officials, claiming the updated environmental impact report is also 
inadequate and contains new information that does not properly analyze 
increased automobile traffic resulting from a larger terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the purpose of the suit to delay or to stop the expansion even," 
said Keith Pritsker, deputy city attorney for Los Angeles. "The city's position 
is if they're going to expand, they should fully analyze the impact of the 
expansion and, where appropriate, mitigate these impacts." 
</P>
<P>
 The airport's lawyer, Richard Simon, said he had not yet seen the suit.

KILLER OF GIRL SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON; COURTS: DAMIAN VANN 
FIRED INTO A CROWD AT A DANCE ORGANIZED BY PARENTS TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN OUT 
OF TROUBLE. 
</P>

 An Inglewood man, described by police as a "lightweight" gang member, was 
sentenced to 20 years to life in state prison Friday for the 1993 shooting 
death of a 12-year-old girl at a dance at the Boys & Girls Club in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 In sentencing Damian Vann, 19, Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg called 
the death of Tiffany Dozier "a tragic situation." Vann, the judge observed, 
"shot into a crowd of people who were running away." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred shortly before 1 a.m. on Jan. 9, 1993. Tiffany, a 
seventh grader at Maclay Middle School, was waiting for a ride home when a 
fight broke out between rival gang members. She was shot in the back of the 
head and died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance had been organized by parents to keep their children out of trouble 
and to raise money for the youth center. 
</P>
<P>
 Vann, who admitted to police that he had fired into the crowd, will begin 
serving the sentence at the California Youth Authority, then transfer by age 25 
to state prison to complete the rest of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Vann, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, was tried as an adult and 
convicted of second-degree murder in June. Deputy Dist. Atty. John Nantroup had 
sought a first-degree murder conviction, while defense attorney Michael E. 
Goodman argued for a lesser, voluntary manslaughter verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 At his sentencing in Van Nuys Superior Court, Vann's mother was the only 
person in the audience. She left the courtroom without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a probation report, Deputy Probation Officer Louis Fishstein noted that 
Vann was a solid B student and "appears to come from a good family background 
and seems to have been a responsible, reliable person" until he became a 
"passive" member of a street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 A year before the shooting, Vann had another brush with the law, and was 
placed on probation for carrying a loaded gun into a mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to understand how this average, middle-class youth would 
become involved in such a violent crime, as such behavior appears to be out of 
character," Fishstein wrote in the report.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FREE DENTAL CARE PUTS SMILES ON FACES OF 
YOUTH; HEALTH: MOBILE CLINIC FROM USC AIDS 120 SCHOOLCHILDREN FROM LOW-INCOME 
FAMILIES IN NEED OF MAJOR TREATMENT. 
</P>

 Michelle Rojas smiled widely as she slid back in the dentist's chair Friday, 
showing no fear as USC dental student Bill Contente prodded. But Michelle's 
smile revealed her whites were less than pearly. 
</P>
<P>
 How many cavities? "I guess I have three," said the 9-year-old, who had never 
before visited a dentist. But after the X-rays were complete, Contente said he 
found seven cavities -- four of them pretty big. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle, a student at Old Orchard Elementary School, was one of 120 
schoolchildren from low-income families in Santa Clarita who will be given free 
dental care this week by USC's mobile dental clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Four trailers -- complete with dental chairs, X-ray equipment and all the 
scary-looking instruments that bring kids to tears -- were parked outside St. 
Stephen's Episcopal Church early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no tears and mostly smiles outside the church as the children 
lined up to begin their dental work, many experiencing for the first time the 
apprehension inspired by the dentist's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Josue Iniguez shook his loose tooth as he waited to be X-rayed. "Maybe the 
dentist will pull it out," said the 9-year-old, also from Old Orchard 
Elementary. And Edgar Ramirez, an 8-year-old classmate, said he wasn't nervous 
about what was to come. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a veteran of the dentist's chair, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell that the children appreciate someone relieving their pain," said 
Mary Caravalho, president of the Foundation for Children's Dental Health, which 
sponsored the mobile clinic's visit to Santa Clarita for a second consecutive 
year. "They have smiles on their faces you've never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was created in 1992, Caravalho said, after volunteers "came to 
the conclusion that there was an absolute lack of dental care for low-income 
children." The foundation has received donations from Los Angeles County, 
various cities and private charities over the past two years. Proceeds pay for 
dental work that costs an average of $170 for each student. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the mobile clinic rolled into town, local dentists like Dr. Mehran 
Abbassian volunteered to screen hundreds of low-income children to assess their 
dental needs. From that group, 120 of the most severe cases were chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them, financially, are not capable of taking care of their dental 
needs," Abbassian said. "The ones that are here need the major treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case of Jacob Flick from Newhall Elementary School. The 
11-year-old has an infected tooth that recently caused swelling on one side of 
his mouth, his father, Buddy Flick, said. Without help, Flick would have been 
able to do little for his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here because I'm unemployed," said Flick, who has nine children. Last 
year he brought one of his daughters to the mobile clinic for free dental work. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic travels all over Southern California and has gone as far as Mexico, 
said Brent Fung, a student director of the program. It is supported entirely by 
donations and staffed by a rotating crew of USC dental students supervised by 
some of their instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said volunteering for the clinic is rewarding, and some have 
participated throughout their time at dental school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got involved with the program as soon as I found out about it," said Mitra 
Bolbolan, a 26-year-old dental student who has been on the mobile clinic team 
for 3 1/2 years. "It's one thing we do and don't ask for anything back. . . . 
It feels good."

RELIGION / JOHN DART; MUSICAL COMEDY ABOUT NATIVITY DEBUTS AT GLENDALE 
PRESBYTERIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does the story of Jesus' birth, the biblical foundation for religious 
Christmas observances, lend itself to musical comedy? 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Presbyterian Church thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary, Joseph and other biblical figures, depicted in a contemporary setting, 
debuted Friday night in the first of five performances in the church sanctuary 
of a gag-filled production called "In Those Days." 
</P>
<P>
 But only after a few people in the 1,100-member congregation expressed worries 
that a musical comedy about the Nativity "was going to cheapen the sacred 
story," said the Rev. Darrell Johnson, senior pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their concerns were valid. Some people wonder how humor and the sacred can go 
together," Johnson said. "But I think they understand now that this will help 
us appreciate the power (of the Christmas story) all the more." 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor praised the author, church member Dean Batali, who is also 
directing the play, for giving new life to biblical lines so familiar to 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through humor, we hear them in a new way," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Batali's script, Mary, thinking about wedding arrangements when the 
lyre-bearing angel Gabriel appears before her, asks him whether he's available 
to play the harp at her wedding before the angel gets a chance to tell her 
she's about to become pregnant with the messiah. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary, played by church member Brenna Meredith, later goes for a prenatal 
checkup at a doctor's office where the nurse misunderstands how she learned 
from Gabriel that she would have a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 NURSE: Doctor Gabriel. I don't believe I've heard of him. Does he have an 
office around here? 
</P>
<P>
 MARY: He makes house calls. 
</P>
<P>
 NURSE: All right. What did he say to you? 
</P>
<P>
 MARY: He started out by saying, 'Greetings, you who are highly favored. The 
Lord is with you.' 
</P>
<P>
 NURSE: Well, he has quite a bedside manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The script turns the Gospel of Luke's story of Zechariah, the temporarily 
voiceless father-to-be of John the Baptist, into a device for several sight 
gags, making Zechariah hold up signs to be understood. Trouble is, his spelling 
is comically atrocious. 
</P>
<P>
 The border guard at Bethlehem, stopping Joseph and Mary, heavy with child, at 
the city's edge, asks, "You got any citrus fruits or house plants?" 
</P>
<P>
 Humor has not been absent from Christmas season plays put on each year by 
Glendale Presbyterian. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, "A Town Without a Tale," about a medieval town that hadn't heard 
the Christmas story for 300 years, contained humor, Johnson said. About 1,400 
people attended that play's three performances. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's production, which includes 13 traditional and original songs, had 
previously been tested at churches. Batali said a few years ago a Christian 
theatrical company did a smaller version of his play at about 30 churches of 
various denominations in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the four-person version and with fewer songs," said Batali, who 
works as a staff assistant on the NBC sitcom "Madman of the People." 
</P>
<P>
 Preparations and rehearsals for "In Those Days" have consumed about 200 hours 
since the start of autumn, said the senior pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know, because my sixth-grade daughter has several minor roles, including 
one as a sheep," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In Those Days" will be staged 7:30 tonight, Sunday and Dec. 9 and 10 as well 
as at 4 p.m. Dec. 11. Tickets are $5, available at the door or by mail from the 
church at 125 S. Louise St., Glendale. For more information, call (818) 
242-8873.

MATER DEI PUTS A STOP TO LOS ALAMITOS; DIVISION I: LATE TOUCHDOWN PROPELS 
MONARCHS INTO SHOWDOWN WITH NO. 1 BISHOP AMAT. GRIFFINS' STREAK ENDS AT 47 
GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All the gaffes Mater Dei's John Flynn made Friday night, and there were many, 
didn't seem to matter in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 All the errant throws, all the intercepted passes and all those bonehead plays 
were washed clean with one little dump pass to Casey Rouintree. The play went 
for 11 yards -- the final three of which were airborne -- and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It finished a remarkable comeback, giving the Monarchs 28-24 victory over Los 
Alamitos. It ended the Griffins' Southern Section record 47-game unbeaten 
streak. And, most importantly, it put Mater Dei in the Division I championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (13-0) next play La Puente Bishop Amat, ranked No. 1 in the 
nation by some publications, for the title at 7:40 p.m. next Saturday at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn will be there and will hope for a better night. But he'll take Friday's 
performance. Sure the fifth-largest crowd in section history, 30,065, watched 
him stumble around Anaheim Stadium, but they also saw him come up big in the 
final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouintree hurdled three Los Alamitos defenders to put the Monarchs ahead. 
David Castleton intercepted a Kevin Feterik pass to clinch the victory. But it 
was Flynn who rallied the Monarchs from a 24-14 deficit in the final five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn completed seven of 15 passes, and two were intercepted more because of 
bad judgment than great defensive efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of put it all on my shoulders after those two picks," Flynn said. "But 
it made that touchdown pass all that much sweeter." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't look as if he would get the chance to taste it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei turned the ball over four times, three times inside the Los Alamitos 
10, and looked beaten after Joey Trampush fumbled at the end of a 72-yard run 
with 6 minutes 41 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs got the ball back at the Los Alamitos 49 with 4:43 left, and 
Flynn immediately scrambled for 28 yards. After an off-side penalty, he 
scrambled for 12 yards to the two. One play later, Steve Bodnar scored on a 
two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Richardson recovered the on-side kick with 3:42 left, and the Monarchs 
went back to work. Bodnar, who gained 178 yards, and Trampush, who gained 126, 
worked the ball to the 11 with 50 seconds left. Then Flynn dropped and dumped 
the ball over the onrushing Dax Houston. Rouintree snagged it and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 It brought to a close a unbeaten streak that began in 1991 and covered three 
championships. The Griffins in the final minutes twice this season to preserve 
the streak, but had no miracle finishes left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a bunch young guys, we have a lot to look forward to," Los Alamitos 
Coach John Barnes said. "We feel real good about ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 They would have felt a whole lot better had they held that 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 All seemed right with the Griffins in the third quarter. Feterik, who was 16 
of 25 for 328 yards, directed two scoring drives. The first was set up when 
Flynn tried to dump a pass while on the run. It was deflected and intercepted 
by Ife Ohalefe. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik completed seven passes for 25 or more yards. His passing game set up 
short touchdown runs by himself and Ryan Gragnano. 
</P>
<P>
 "We executed, but we didn't execute enough," wide receiver Brad Melsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei led, 14-10, at halftime, but both teams made mistakes that cost them 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn had a pass intercepted in the end zone on the Monarchs' first 
possession. But Los Alamitos failed in a sure-to-score situation late in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins had the ball on the four with four seconds left in the half. 
Barnes elected to go for the touchdown, but Feterik's pass was short. Tony 
Hartley made a diving catch, but referees ruled the ball had not broken the 
goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams showed their offensive intentions early. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs were content to run behind a big offensive line. They finished 
379 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins (12-1) stuck to their fly-and-fling offense. Feterik, who threw 
for 232 yards in the first half, spread the ball around to receivers Hartley, 
Melsby and Stan Guyness. 
</P>
<P>
 "'Did we put on a show?" Barnes said. "We did everything right." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything but win.

MIKE PENNER: MATER DEI PUTS A STOP TO LOS ALAMITOS; AT 47, MONARCHS HALT COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty-five. . .46. . .47. . .just how monstrous was the Incredible Expanding 
Los Alamitos Unbeaten Streak going to grow? 
</P>
<P>
 Notch No. 48 was about to be carved into the Anaheim Stadium goalposts Friday 
night, with the Griffins up by 10 and Mater Dei High down to its last 4:43. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaming red from head to toe -- faces included -- the Monarchs congregated at 
the Los Alamitos 49-yard line, somberly contemplating a streak of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Four second-half possessions for Mater Dei, four second-half giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1: Quarterback John Flynn, in the process of being dragged down for a sack 
by Los Al defensive end Chris Bagley, fails to duck and cover and instead shot 
puts a feeble wobbler that Griffin defensive back Ife Ohalefe tips and 
intercepts. Two plays later, Los Al takes the lead, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2: Flynn attempts the more traditional form of the forward pass -- 
overhand throw, tight spiral downfield -- and hits wide receiver David 
Castleton right in the hands for a potential 57-yard scoring play. Except the 
football dribbles through Castleton's normally reliable fingers, the pass falls 
incomplete and one play later, the Monarchs are forced to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3: Down 24-14 now, Flynn drives Mater Dei to the Los Al 12 and hands the 
ball to Steve Bodnar, typically a shrewd move. Bodnar had just eclipsed the 
1,700-yard mark for the season and he picks up four more on this carry . . . 
before fumbling the ball away at the Griffin eight. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4: With 6:55 to play, Monarch fullback Joey Trampush finds an opening down 
the left sideline and runs 40 yards, 50 yards, 60 yards, 70 yards -- inside the 
Griffin five when Los Al defensive back Damon Houston strips the ball from 
behind and teammate Tom Carbajal recovers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Alamitos one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 How much more torment can a high school football team withstand? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, after this kind of mental and emotional torture, the 16-, 17- 
and 18-year olds who compose Mater Dei's roster should have been drained, 
exhausted, done for the evening and the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-a-days, here the Monarchs come. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 4:22 left, Mater Dei got the ball back and Flynn took off running. 
First for 28 yards. Then 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the Monarchs were at the Griffin two-yard line and Bodnar had the 
ball in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 This time he held it as he plunged into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Al 24, Mater Dei 21, 3:44 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Onside kick. Everyone standing inside Anaheim Stadium -- and there were a load 
of them, 30,065 in all -- could see it coming. So could the Griffins as they 
watched half the Mater Dei kick team overlap behind the other half, waiting to 
hear the thump of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Shinnefield kicked it into the ground and the ball took a wicked bad 
hop, bouncing over one Griffin as if he were an Angel infielder, and into the 
arms of Mater Dei's diving Elliot Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball to Mater Dei at the Los Al 46, 3:20 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what to do with it? 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn had already had two passes intercepted, so Monarch Coach Bruce Rollinson 
went the conservative route. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a 
two-minute drill played closer to the vest than this. 
</P>
<P>
 Six handoffs in a row. First to Trampush, then Bodnar the rest of the way. Why 
not, Rollinson figured. Mater Dei's massive line was opening gaping holes in 
the Griffin defense -- and the more time the Monarchs ran off the clock, the 
less time there was for Los Al quarterback Kevin (Rallies R Us) Feterik. 
</P>
<P>
 On the seventh play, Rollinson called a pass. A very safe pass. A tight end 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, Flynn barely got it away, getting flattened just as he released it. 
The ball found its way to Casey Rouintree, who clutched it, spun away from one 
tackler and trudged into the end zone with 43 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunningly, The Streak was down to its last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik had done more with less already, pulling out last-ditch victories 
against Edison and Esperanza on back-to-back weeks, but he only got three snaps 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 One sack, one 12-yard scramble and a tipped pass that was picked off by 
Castleton with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never doubted our team," Rollinson said amid the pandemonium that followed, 
attempting to convince himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank God we pulled it out. I didn't want to go into that locker room to 
tell Trampush and Bodnar that they had played their last game." 
</P>
<P>
 No, one more. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Saturday, back at Anaheim Stadium, against former Angelus League rival 
Bishop Amat. It will be Mater Dei's second championship game appearance in as 
many years, and its third in four. 
</P>
<P>
 One streak expires, another lives on.

 It was almost surreal Friday night at the Forum, the way smoke from the 
halftime laser show hung in the air through most of the third quarter. The way 
the Lakers dominated the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pyrotechnics during intermission were merely second rate compared to 
what went on before and after. The before was the Lakers' taking control from 
the start, the after was the finishing touches on a 107-89 rout before 13,056 
as Cedric Ceballos had 25 points and a career-high 16 rebounds in only 29 
minutes and Vlade Divac added 22 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 As bad as the Lakers were in getting trashed two nights earlier at Cleveland, 
that's how good they were against the Rockets in winning for the sixth time in 
seven games. Skipping practice in between, on Thursday, seemed to work wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were well rested," said Ceballos, shooting 60% the last six games. "Since 
we didn't play at Cleveland, we kind of had three days off." 
</P>
<P>
 They might still be well rested. Almost no one had to work long hours against 
the winningest team in the league coming in, with Divac going 36 minutes to 
join Elden Campbell in holding Hakeem Olajuwon to 16 points on six-of-15 
shooting and seven rebounds, but no other Laker starter played more than 29 
minutes. It was that one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all you could ask for from a team," Coach Del Harris said after the 
Lakers improved to 9-6. "It was just an outstanding performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Said his Rocket counterpart, Rudy Tomjanovich: "It was one of those 
out-behind-the-shed (butt) kickings. They just trounced us right from the 
get-go -- from the jump ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off their most lopsided loss since April 1990 and the lowest offensive 
output of the season, both courtesy of the 117-79 rout Wednesday at Cleveland, 
the Lakers responded with one of their best halves: a 14-point lead in the 
first quarter, an 11-0 run in the second that paved the way for a 21-point 
cushion, and only three turnovers against 10 for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even through the recently ended five-game winning streak, the Lakers rarely 
looked so good for an extended stretch. The result was a 59-41 lead at 
intermission as Ceballos already had 16 points and 11 rebounds and Divac had 15 
points and six assists while teaming with Campbell to hold Olajuwon to three 
rebounds in 22 minutes of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're tired you're not always ready for the first five minutes," Divac 
said. "We jumped on them from the first minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without starting power forward Otis Thorpe, who sat out his third game 
in row because of a strained back, the Rockets didn't find any solutions in the 
third quarter. The Lakers pulled ahead by as many as 27 points, the second time 
at 88-61 at the end of the period. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Vlade Divac said he will again play for the Yugoslavian national team now that 
it has been cleared to resume competition by FIBA, the world governing body of 
basketball, but only if there is no scheduling conflict with the NBA season. 
The holdup isn't whether the Lakers will be finished in time for him to make 
the European championships that start June 21 -- only a trip to the finals 
would cause that -- but whether it comes too far after the season because he 
doesn't want to be out of shape in Athens and risk injury. "If we go far in the 
playoffs, I can play," said Divac, a member of Yugoslavia's 1988 Olympic team. 
"But if it's a long pause between the NBA season and the tournament, it doesn't 
make sense. I would like to play, but the first thing for me is to be a 
professional. I have to do everything to be a Laker." Whatever happens this 
summer, he plans to play for Yugoslavia in the Atlanta Games in 1996, saying it 
would be a thrill to play in the Olympics in his adopted country. Divac wants 
to become an American citizen, but will wait until his career is over because, 
barring a rule change, such a move would preclude him from playing for either 
Yugoslavia or the United States in international play. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Harris has climbed one spot and should soon jump two more on the all-time 
coaching victories list. Now at 341 victories with Houston, Milwaukee and the 
Lakers, he passed Bill Sharman with the second win of the season for 27th on 
the list and needs only two more to overtake Bill Russell and Hubie Brown, tied 
for 25th. "Actually, I really would like to get to 500," Harris said. "I think 
that it's quite an accomplishment in the NBA. I don't care how many losses you 
sustain along the way, if you get to 500, it's special." Harris is 341-347 all 
time. . . . The Lakers' Christmas toy drive for underprivileged children will 
take place Tuesday against the Warriors and Friday against the Clippers, both 
at the Forum. Fans are asked to bring a new unwrapped gift to be distributed to 
children in the Los Angeles area by the Feliz Navidad Project and the Magic 
Johnson Foundation. Barrels for collection will be inside every entrance.

FLYNN LEADS MATER DEI TO VICTORY; PREP FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK'S TWO TOUCHDOWN 
DRIVES IN FINAL FIVE MINUTES SAVE MONARCHS AND END LOS ALAMITOS' 47-GAME 
UNBEATEN STREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All the gaffes made by Santa Ana Mater Dei's John Flynn Friday night didn't 
seem to matter in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 All the errant throws, the two intercepted passes and mistakes were erased by 
one little dump pass to Casey Rouintree. The play went for 11 yards -- the 
final three of which were airborne -- and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It finished off a remarkable comeback and gave the Monarchs a 28-24 victory 
over Los Alamitos. It also ended the Griffins' Southern Section-record 47-game 
unbeaten streak. And, most important, it put Mater Dei in the Division I 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs will play La Puente Bishop Amat next Saturday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn will be there and will hope for a better night. The fifth-largest crowd 
in section history, 30,065, watched him stumble around Anaheim Stadium on 
Friday, then come up big in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouintree hurdled three Los Alamitos' defenders to put the Monarchs ahead. 
David Castleton intercepted a Kevin Feterik pass to clinch the victory. But it 
was Flynn who rallied the Monarchs from a 24-14 deficit in the final five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn completed seven of 15 passes. He had two passes intercepted, more 
because of bad judgment than great defensive efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of put it all on my shoulders after those two picks," Flynn said. "But 
it made that touchdown pass all that much sweeter." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't look as if he would get the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei turned the ball over four times, three times inside the 10-yard 
line, and looked beaten after Joey Trampush fumbled at the end of a 78-yard run 
with 6:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs got the ball back at the Los Alamitos' 49 with 4:43 left, and 
Flynn immediately scrambled for 28 yards and, after a five-yard penalty, 
another 12 yards to the two. One player later, Steve Bodnar scored on a 
two-yard run to make it 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Richardson recovered the onside kick with 3:42 left and the Monarchs 
went back to work. Bodnar, who gained 178 yards, and Trampush, who gained 126, 
worked the ball to the 11 with 50 seconds left. Flynn then dropped back and 
dumped the ball over defensive tackle Dax Houston. Rouintree snagged it and 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
 It brought to a close a unbeaten streak that began in 1991 and included three 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a bunch young guys, we have a lot to look forward to," Los Alamitos 
Coach John Barnes said. "We feel real good about ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 They would have felt a whole lot better had they held their 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, who completed 16 of 25 passes for 328 yards, directed two 
third-quarter scoring drives. The first was set up when Flynn tried to dump a 
pass while on the run. It was deflected and intercepted by Ife Ohalefe. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Feterik completed seven passes for 25 or more yards. His vertical game 
set up short touchdown runs by Feterik and Ryan Gragnano. 
</P>
<P>
 "'Did we put on a show?" Barnes said. "We did everything right." 
</P>
<P>
 But not in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei led, 14-10, at halftime, but both teams made mistakes that cost them 
points -- Mater Dei at the start and Los Alamitos at the end of the second 
quarter.

SEAHAWK PLAYER PROBABLY PARALYZED; FOOTBALL: THERE IS A DISPUTE OVER WHO WAS 
DRIVING THE VEHICLE THAT HIT A UTILITY POLE. DEFENSIVE LINEMAN MIKE FRIER'S 
INJURIES ARE THE MOST SERIOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A car accident involving three Seattle Seahawk football players will probably 
leave one of them paralyzed and another possibly facing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Chris Warren was arrested and could be charged with vehicular 
assault as a result of the accident Thursday night, in which defensive lineman 
Mike Frier suffered a broken and dislocated neck, leaving him without the use 
of his legs and limited use of his arms and hands. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrested Warren, they identified him as having been the driver. 
But statements Friday from the agents for Warren and the car's third occupant, 
rookie Lamar Smith, said Smith, not Warren, had been driving. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released through the Seahawks, Warren's agent and attorney, 
Rick Schaeffer, said, "Chris was not the owner of the automobile nor was he 
driving it at the time of the accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Another statement, from Eugene Parker, Smith's agent, said, "Lamar Smith was 
the driver in the accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Local news reports say passersby saw empty beer cans in the wreckage. 
Detective Jim O'Toole of the Kirkland police said he was not certain who had 
been driving and that the investigation was continuing. He also said, "There is 
reason to believe alcohol was involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren was treated at Overlake Hospital here for broken ribs and left the 
hospital early Friday. After his arrest, he was released on his own 
recognizance. He has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith suffered a broken foot and was to have been released from the hospital 
by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Frier, however, may be paralyzed for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood that he will play football again is zero," neurosurgeon 
Michael Schlitt said at a news conference. "Even if he were to make a recovery, 
I would advise him against ever playing again. The likelihood of (his) walking 
is very poor. . . . It's doubtful he will have completely normal function of 
the hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlitt added that Frier would "almost certainly be wheelchair-dependent." 
</P>
<P>
 Frier, 25, underwent 2 1/2 hours of surgery Friday, in which doctors realigned 
and fused his injured spinal column. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Flores, Seahawk coach and general manager, said he had addressed the team 
Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked for their prayers," he said. "That's all we can do at this point 
because it's not in our hands. It's a terrible thing that happened. . . . There 
is a tremendous shock in that locker room right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy: "Mike Frier is a friend of mine and a 
good football player. This is just mind-boggling and it hurts, it hurts a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Added offensive tackle Ray Roberts: "It's really tough. Some of the guys tried 
hard not to let it bother them, but it bothered them. There were some tears. 
It's been pretty emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred a few blocks from the Seahawks' Kirkland training 
complex about 8:40 on a rainy night. The driver apparently tried to pass a 
slower vehicle and swerved to avoid a median island, slamming the players' 
vehicle into a wooden power pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Mark Smith said it appeared that the car was going too fast for 
the rain-slicked road. The crash set the utility pole afire and the players had 
to be pulled from the vehicle by passersby and firefighters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the King County prosecutor's office said a vehicular assault 
charge is fairly standard whenever there is evidence of reckless driving or the 
presence of alcohol or drugs in an accident that causes serious bodily injury 
to another. Dan Donohoe said sentencing can range up to five years in prison, 
though three to nine months in jail is the norm.  
</P>
<P>
 Frier joined the Seahawks only a month ago from the Cincinnati Bengals, where 
he had been on a three-week suspension for an unexcused absence, and played in 
last Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, 27, a five-year veteran, was having his best season, having already 
gained 1,096 yards. He is the first Seahawk to have run for more than 1,000 
yards in three consecutive years, and the 27th to do so in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 24, was drafted by the Seahawks in the third round from the University 
of Houston. He has played in two games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Frier is a 6-foot-5, 299-pounder from Appalachian State in North Carolina. He 
is in his third year in the NFL. Schlitt said Frier's bulk and the muscle mass 
around his neck made spinal realignment difficult.

A LESS-THAN-GRAND ENTRANCE; DAVIS CUP: YELTSIN'S ARRIVAL STOPS MATCH AND 
APPEARS TO COST VOLKOV MOMENTUM AGAINST EDBERG AS SWEDES TAKE 2-0 LEAD OVER 
RUSSIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's top tennis fanatic, swept grandly into 
the Olympic Sports Center on Friday, three hours late, to cheer his team in its 
first Davis Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 His timing couldn't have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin stopped the show. And with it apparently stopped Alexander Volkov's 
momentum in the opening match against four-time champion Sweden. Stopped it as 
cold as the snowstorm outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov, then bidding to upset Stefan Edberg, suddenly unraveled. And at the 
end of a punishing day, the Swedes had a pair of five-set victories and a 
commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden can clinch the victory in today's doubles match when world champions 
Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman take on Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy. 
</P>
<P>
 World-class tennis is such a novelty in Moscow that the whistling, 
foot-stomping crowd of 10,000 proved as much of a burden as a boost to the 
young home team with so much to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I felt too much responsibility . . . psychological pressure playing in 
front of so many people," Kafelnikov, Russia's top player, said after losing 
the second match to Magnus Larsson. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin certainly added to the drama, and there was debate afterward in both 
dressing rooms on whether he had also contributed to his team's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what had transpired before that moment: 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, playing in his sixth Davis Cup final, confused Volkov from the start 
with a leftward spin on his serve -- something the left-handed Russian had not 
seen in their previous five meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swede easily won the first two sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators started waving little tricolor Russian flags and shouting things 
like, "Sasha, get off your butt, attack!" and "Don't retreat, all Russia is 
behind you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Thus inspired, Volkov forced a tiebreaker in the third set and defeated 
Edberg, 7-2, closing with an ace. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov won the next seven games, then lost his concentration but struggled 
ahead, 5-4, in the decisive fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
 With Yeltsin waiting to make his belated entry, Volkov served match point. 
</P>
<P>
 But, after three volleys, he netted a weak backhand and never got another 
chance. Edberg gained the next two points to tie the set at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Yeltsin flashed into the hall. The president waved, climbed into the VIP 
section and took a seat. Bodyguards cleared a path. Heads turned. Yeltsin's 
name was announced. People applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 The commotion held up play. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was resumed, Edberg won two of the next three games, capping his 
comeback with two perfect lobs from the baseline. The score was 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 
(7-2), 0-6, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov watched the winning lob helplessly from the net, tossed a ball toward 
Yeltsin's section and flung his racket at the Russian team bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Kafelnikov, waiting for his match, was appalled by Yeltsin's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it a reasonable person who in the decisive game, when the tension is so 
high, makes such an abnormal move?" Kafelnikov asked later. "He created a 
five-minute pause. The players cooled off. That probably affected Alexander." 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov, however, did not blame Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have failed to notice when the president arrived," he said. "But I 
can't say it interfered with my game." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg was grateful for the break. 
</P>
<P>
 "It actually gave me some extra time," he said. "Maybe I should thank Boris 
for coming in at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammate Larsson quipped, "I hope he comes back for the doubles tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Kafelnikov began the biggest match of his life, Yeltsin was gone. 
But the Swedes stayed on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson, hero of Sweden's semifinal upset of the United States, scored 26 aces 
and service winners in a 6-0, 6-2, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kafelnikov, 20, fell down three times, losing his confidence and his 
seven-match Davis Cup winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larsson played like a god," he said. "It's practically impossible to do 
anything against a serve like his."

CLASSIC ATTRACTS A LEGENDARY FIELD; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: KANSAS FACES 
MASSACHUSETTS, THEN UCLA FACES KENTUCKY IN INAUGURAL EVENT HONORING FORMER 
COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Has it really been two decades since John Wooden clasped his rolled-up 
program, shouted from the sidelines and dominated the game of college 
basketball as no man ever had or probably will? 
</P>
<P>
 Has it has been that long since Wooden's final UCLA team won its final game -- 
and its 10th national title in 12 years -- by beating Kentucky, 92-85, and 
sending him into retirement properly, emphatically, poetically? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it has. But while others line up to pay him homage in this anniversary 
season, Wooden, 84, has sidestepped the hosannas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the word legend ," Wooden said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 When UCLA Coach Jim Harrick asked him this year to join his staff as an 
honorary coach, Wooden politely declined, saying he was flattered but never 
would want to be put in a position where he could overshadow Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 And when his friend Randy Ryan began putting the first plans together for what 
developed into today's inaugural John R. Wooden Classic at The Pond of Anaheim, 
Wooden demurred again. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ryan, the president of the event: "When I first brought this up to him, 
told him the kinds of teams I wanted to bring in, Coach said to me, 'I have one 
question: Why would a team such as Kentucky with its great tradition and 
history of having a coach by the name of Adolph Rupp want to participate in an 
event named after me?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Coach, you just answered your own question.' And I think that 
embarrassed him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's ambitious plans called for an annual early-season event inviting only 
the elite teams and elite coaches to, in his words, make sure Wooden's name 
never was reduced to a footnote in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very reluctant at first," Wooden said. "But they sort of talked me into 
it, thinking it would be real good for basketball on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't know what a footnote is, so it doesn't really matter. All I know 
is there will be two exciting basketball games in one day, and that's pretty 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
 When he got the go-ahead, Ryan followed a simple credo: Honor him, and they 
will come. And, despite scheduling complications, four teams ranked in the top 
seven did. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game of today's doubleheader features Roy Williams' seventh-ranked 
Kansas team against No. 1 Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the marquee game, No. 5 UCLA plays No. 3 Kentucky -- the first matchup 
of the two traditional powers since Wooden's finale. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, there's not really that much significance in it," Wooden said about the 
UCLA-Kentucky echoes. "It was 20 years ago. And no one associated, no players 
or even athletic directors or coaches involved 20 years ago are around now. So, 
obviously, it couldn't have any." 
</P>
<P>
 All four coaches involved say their teams are here because of Wooden, and Ryan 
says he has assurances from coaches such as Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, Michigan's 
Steve Fisher and Louisville's Denny Crum that they will play in any future 
Wooden Classics any time they are invited. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Ryan said he wanted the event to feature high-level 
coaches as a tribute to Wooden's legacy -- which, he says, is exactly why he 
rolled the dice and went after UMass and its young coach, John Calipari, last 
year, despite the fact that the program lacks the long-term heft of the other 
three schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all have a common thread -- that's being sound fundamentally, though 
their styles of play are somewhat different," Wooden said of the four coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Roy Williams of Kansas, to me, has done a remarkable job since he's 
been at Kansas. From what I've observed of his team, I don't believe any team 
in the country plays better team basketball. Many have better personnel than 
Roy has there, but I don't believe there's anyone who has their team playing 
better team basketball -- subordinating themselves for the welfare of team. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kentucky's) Rick Pitino probably utilizes the three-point shot more than any 
other coaches I know of at the schools getting the most publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as Calipari is concerned, certainly he's brought Massachusetts up from 
a few years ago when they were hardly recognized. He had a great team last 
year, has them all back basically. He plays the same style, eastern play, 
ballhandling, but will utilize the break and pressure too. 
</P>
<P>
 "And of course, Jim (Harrick) here at UCLA is recognized throughout the 
country as one of the better coaches. He has done a good job at UCLA. Like all 
coaches, he has come in for some criticism. But these are four of the top 
coaches in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the process, Ryan said he explored the possibility of placing the 
event in a huge, 60,000-plus seat dome. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ryan said that although the financial prospects probably would have been 
far more lucrative in bigger arenas, Ryan, an Anaheim native, wanted to stage 
the event closer to Wooden and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wooden Classic, which Ryan said he hopes will eventually develop into a 
tournament with the first-day winners playing a prime-time championship game, 
has a three-year agreement with The Pond, and The Pond's 18,300 seats have been 
sold out for today's doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said he hopes to announce next year's format and schools in January. UCLA 
is playing in next year's tournament in Maui and probably is unavailable for 
the Wooden Classic. But Ryan said the event has never expected or asked that 
the Bruins participate every year or even every other year. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick, the sixth man to coach UCLA since Wooden, makes no secret of his 
pleasure to be involved in the first Wooden Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure you can do enough for the guy who was maybe the best college 
basketball ever had," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pitino: "Coach Wooden will never become a footnote. I can guarantee you 
that." Today's Schedule

PRICE'S RUNS HELP PURGE BAD MEMORY; FOOTBALL: JUNIOR RUNS FOR 237 YARDS AND 
FOUR TOUCHDOWNS AS SYLMAR BEATS CARSON IN CITY SEMIFINALS TO AVENGE LOSS TO 
COLTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Durell Price stood on the Sylmar High football field, openly 
sobbing on his brother Deon's shoulder after a one-point loss to Carson High in 
a City Section 4-A Division semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward one year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, Price personally made sure history did not repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 215-pound junior running back rushed for 237 yards and four 
touchdowns in 25 carries to lead Sylmar's 27-19 victory over Carson in front of 
a capacity crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Spartans (13-0) will face Crenshaw, a 26-19 winner over Dorsey 
on Friday, in the championship game next Saturday at El Camino College in 
Torrance. Sylmar, which is making its second appearance in the final in three 
years, defeated Carson, 17-0, in the 1992 championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, like the rest of his teammates, drew motivation from last year's 22-21 
loss to Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We practiced with 22-21 on the scoreboard all week," Price said. "I couldn't 
get it out of my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Price, also a starting middle linebacker, benefited from outstanding line play 
in addition to downfield blocks by receivers Mike Cervantes and Eddie Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it wasn't all me," said Price, who scored on runs of 51, 53, one and 48 
yards. "It was my quarterback, my line. . . . It was that seven in front of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson (4-9), which forfeited three regular-season victories for using an 
ineligible player, made a fourth-quarter run at Sylmar, but could not come up 
with the big play. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson pulled to 27-19 on a seven-yard pass from Ramon Rodgers to Llewellyn 
Miller and an extra point with 2 minutes 18 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sylmar's Galdino Cortez then recovered an onside kick and the Spartans ran 
out the clock to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sylmar dominated, outgaining Carson, 403-240, the Colts never let up. 
Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman blamed himself and his staff for not putting Carson 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "You keep letting a team in like that and you never know," Engilman said. "We 
might have gotten too conservative and that's the coaching staff's fault." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans dominated the first half from the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's Thomas Toledo recovered Jose Duarte's onside kick at the Carson 46 
and before the Colts knew what hit them, the Spartan offense was running onto 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's first series, however, sputtered. Greg Marquez was sacked for a 
five-yard loss on the first play and an illegal procedure penalty killed the 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sylmar's second series, Engilman wasted no time getting the ball into 
Price's hands. Price, who has rushed for 1,770 yards this season, set up his 
own score with three carries for 28 yards. He then broke two tackles at the 
line of scrimmage and raced down the Sylmar sideline for a 53-yard score and a 
7-0 lead.

 Gerry Dulac of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writes that Auburn football Coach 
Terry Bowden is hardly a recluse. 
</P>
<P>
 "A sign in the local bookstore, advertising a holiday home tour, says, 'See 
Coach Bowden's Home.' He has even allowed a local alternative paper, Worm Gear, 
to print directions to his house, which sits on a lake in an exclusive section 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a lot of people who drive by, but they seem to be afraid to drive 
around the circle,"' Bowden said. "Tell them I don't mind, Just don't run over 
the kids."

 Revision: As reported recently in Morning Briefing, Robert Parish, speaking of 
when he played in Boston, said, "People gave me the finger."

insulting them. They think they're going to come to college and change the face

IMAGINE VITALE AFTER A POT OF COFFEE; PREP FOOTBALL: TEXAS ANNOUNCERS GET 
NATIONAL ATTENTION AFTER THEY THROW OUT OBJECTIVITY AND GET A LITTLE TOO 
EXCITED DURING PLAYOFF GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The football game was phenomenal -- 34 points were scored in the final 2 1/2 
minutes -- and the TV announcers weren't bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The delivery of last Saturday night's John Tyler-Plano East high school 
playoff has brought national attention to mailman-anchor Denny Garver, his 
co-host, Eddy Clinton, and their guest for the evening, Lake Highlands High 
Coach Mike Zaffuto. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game got out of hand, and we got out of hand even more," Garver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound bites from the play-by-play for Plano Telecable have been rebroadcast 
from New York to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Plano East scored 27 points in the final 2 minutes 33 seconds to take the lead 
with 24 seconds remaining, then lost when its final kickoff was returned for 
the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got it again! They got it again! . . . This is unbelievable. . . . Good 
gosh a'mighty Joe Friday," Garver said after Plano East had recovered an onside 
kickoff after scoring. "Somebody give me something. I'm gonna die." 
</P>
<P>
 Garver after Plano East had scored again, taking the lead at 44-41: "Everybody 
on their cars in the radio back to Plano, you've done missed the greatest 
comeback of all times! Of all times!" 
</P>
<P>
 Zaffuto, however, had the big call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh my gosh, no! Come on! No! No! Gosh!" he said as the 
97-yard kickoff return unfolded. "God bless those kids. I am sick. I want to 
throw up."

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; POTHOLES AND POT BELLIES ON ROAD TO THE PLAYOFFS 
</P>

<P>
 Ten ways you can tell that there is only one month left in the NFL's regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Barry Foster is suddenly hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Troy Aikman suddenly isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Dennis Green says, "The areas that we still have to improve on, we still 
have to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 4. Bill Parcells is the approximate size of a mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Buddy Ryan's current team plays his former team, but Buddy has screwed both 
of them up so badly, nobody cares. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Each NFC Central team has 146 playoff possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Referees not only announce calls, they explain them. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Raider fans prepare for the playoffs by viewing videotape of prison riots. 
</P>
<P>
 9. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers begin a search for the worst football-playing 
college senior in America. 
</P>
<P>
 10. You decide that the person in your house responsible for taking out the 
garbage should be determined by a fifth tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 With one month left in what has become a delightfully unnerving season, 18 of 
the 28 teams still have a reasonable chance of playing in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a lot of teams with decent records and decent chances," 
said Green, coach of one of them, the Minnesota Vikings. "Before, you might say 
8-8 would not make it, but not this year. With free agency and the salary cap, 
it's a different league. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a wild and woolly road." 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, this map, with teams ranked by potential: NFC 
</P>
<P>
 1. San Francisco 49ers (10-2).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: First-round bye, home-field advantage throughout the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: They play at struggling San Diego on Dec. 11, and in the 
Monday night finale in Minnesota. Tough games, but this has proved to be a 
resilient team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single man in our locker room is on a mission," said Carmen Policy, 
49er president. "And I may be naive, but I don't think it's about money." 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dallas Cowboys (10-2).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: First-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: If they win this weekend in Philadelphia, the rest of their 
season will be spent checking the scoreboard to see if the 49ers lose. Which 
won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to see the 49ers again," defensive end Jim Jeffcoat said of the 
team that beat the Cowboys last month, 21-14. "And we expect to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 3. Minnesota Vikings (8-5).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: NFC Central championship, first-round game against worst 
wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: No other contender has a tougher finishing schedule, with 
games at Buffalo and Detroit before the finale against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 But no other contender has a future Hall of Fame quarterback like Warren Moon, 
desperate to reach his first Super Bowl and showing his younger teammates how. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Green Bay Packers (6-6).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Top wild-card qualifier, host to a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: A soft closing schedule will shake them from their doldrums. 
Beginning at Detroit on Sunday, they could win their last four, against the 
Lions, Chicago Bears, Atlanta Falcons and Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether all of this will stop frustrated Mike Holmgren from eventually burning 
quarterback Brett Favre with cigarette butts, nobody knows. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Chicago Bears (8-5).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Second wild-card qualifier, will play first-round game 
at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: After reeling for 10 days over Thursday night's overtime 
loss to the Vikings, their midseason magic will officially disappear with a 
loss in Green Bay next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Kramer will replace Steve Walsh at quarterback and they will win their 
final two home games, against the Rams and New England Patriots, but home-field 
chances will be blown. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Philadelphia Eagles (7-5).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Third wild-card qualifier, will play first-round game at 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: Every curve is dangerous when your players have stopped 
paying attention and your coaches have started updating their resumes. Probable 
losses this week and next, to Dallas and Pittsburgh, should leave them with 
impossible playoff road. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Detroit Lions (6-6).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Home for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: Even if they have won 61% of games after Thanksgiving under 
Coach Wayne Fontes, have they ever finished a season with four games against 
teams with at least .500 records? And played the finale in Miami? 
</P>
<P>
 8. Atlanta Falcons (6-6).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Looney bin, unless they do something with that Rison 
fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: With home games remaining against Arizona and New Orleans, 
they might have a chance if they could win Sunday in San Francisco. Yeah, as if 
Deion Sanders is going to let them. AFC 
</P>
<P>
 1. Miami Dolphins (8-4).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: First-round bye, home-field advantage throughout the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: For those who do not think these guys have enough defense or 
running ability to become the first team to play a Super Bowl game on its home 
field, we have two words: Dan Marino. And one other word: MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 Of their final four games, three are at home, and the other is at 
Indianapolis. Yes, they have the Kansas City Chiefs next week on Monday night. 
But Joe Montana probably still will be sidelined because of a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-3).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: First-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: This defense is big and fast enough to run through most 
roadblocks. By the time the Steelers visit San Diego on Christmas Eve, they 
already will have clinched a first-round bye with victories over the Cincinnati 
Bengals, Eagles and Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 3. San Diego Chargers (9-3).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: AFC West championship, host to the worst wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: Everywhere. If they defeat the Raiders on Monday night, they 
must beat the 49ers six days later. Then a week after that, their creaking 
offense must win in New York against the Jets. Then they will be fortunate to 
score one touchdown in the finale against Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean Junior Seau won't be the league's defensive player of the 
year. It just means that he can't carry Stan Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Cleveland Browns (9-3).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Top wild-card qualifier, host in a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: It was fun while it lasted. But that Lake Erie lovefest will 
end after they lose consecutive games in Dallas and Pittsburgh. At least Vinny 
Testaverde will finally make the playoffs. For at least a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 5. New York Jets (6-6).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Second wild-card qualifier, will play first-round game 
in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: They could run the table, with road games at New England and 
Houston, and home games against the Lions and Chargers. Pete Carroll, the 
rookie who will earn a few coach-of-the-year votes, has built the type of 
defense that loves December weather. 
</P>
<P>
 If only they could count on Boomer Esiason's arm working past November. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Denver Broncos (6-6).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Third wild-card qualifier, will play first-round game in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: Believe it. John Elway has that look. Even his pitiful 
defense can't stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 After defeating the Montana-less Chiefs on Sunday, they will win two of their 
final three games and sneak into the playoffs through the doggie door. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three games include visits to San Francisco and the Raiders. But one of 
those teams is in disarray. Gee, wonder which one. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Kansas City Chiefs (7-5).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: We hear the lights at Country Club Plaza are pretty this 
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: Without their driver, these guys will have trouble 
negotiating even the straightaways. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Raiders (6-6).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Anaheim Stadium next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: They have four winnable games. If only they did not have a 
team that had spent the last three months walking into doors. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Buffalo Bills (6-6).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: Anywhere. Just as long as they're finally out of our 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: Do you really want to know the details? Just be thankful 
like the rest of us, OK? 
</P>
<P>
 10. New England Patriots (6-6).  
</P>
<P>
 Probable destination: AFC East championship. Next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous curves: The ones around the middle of Parcells' sweater. 
</P>
<P>
 LAST ACT 
</P>
<P>
 The point is not whether Montana already has decided to retire after this 
season, as some reports have said and Montana has denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that he should retire. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just us saying it. Several respected scouts are also of that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite good numbers early in the season, Montana is painfully showing his 
age. His foot injury should only hasten the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching Montana on film, he's doing things he never used to do," one scout 
said. "He's missing receivers, he's making poor decisions, he's late on passes. 
He used to never be late, and now he's a half-hour late." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "He has been one of the greats. But what's happening this year 
has been sad." QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * SOME LIKE IT HOT: How does Chicago Bear special teams star Maurice Douglass 
keep his cool during Sunday's madness? He thinks back to his days as a male 
stripper. One day, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to this lady, and she had a $100 bill out," Douglass said. "When I 
bent over to have her put it in my G-string, she pulled the whole thing off. I 
was trying not to be embarrassed and lose my composure, but I wanted to grab it 
right back from her. The (bouncers) got my pants back." 
</P>
<P>
 Of stripping, Douglass said, "If you can do that, there's no end to what you 
can do as far as being in the public eye." 
</P>
<P>
 * CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION: Despite having the luxury of a domed stadium, the 
Detroit Lions spent this week practicing outside in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silverdome had been leased by Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones in 
preparation for their concert this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think the Lions would have been furious at having to prepare for an 
important home game against the Green Bay Packers on an unfamiliar surface, in 
temperatures that occasionally dropped below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 But no. Not when your quarterback is a 36-year-old Stones fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the Rolling Stones, we'll do that, if they let us backstage," Dave Krieg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD KRIEG: Can anybody else not believe that he has eight touchdown passes 
without an interception since replacing Scott Mitchell on Nov. 6? His 
quarterback rating during that time is 124.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg, one of the streakiest quarterbacks in football history, is still a bad 
game waiting to happen. Expect the angry Packer defense to make it happen on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * KNUCKLEHEAD OF THE WEEK: Last week against the Atlanta Falcons, Philadelphia 
Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham was given the option of accepting a 
penalty that would give his team third and 10, or declining it and facing 
fourth and one. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined it. 
</P>
<P>
 His coach, Rich Kotite, promptly called time and ordered a punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played football for 20 years," Cunningham said. "I know what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD CUNNINGHAM: Expect the enigmatic quarterback to be traded this spring. 
Judging from his play during the Eagles' current three-game losing streak, 
during which he has thrown for no touchdowns and three interceptions, it 
appears he has lost interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, expect his old coach, Buddy Ryan, to make a bid for him in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled to be shipped out by new owner Jeffrey Lurie are Kotite, team 
President Harry Gamble and just about anybody else around there who doesn't 
look as if he would fit into a new, aggressive, Dallas Cowboy-type operation. 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD LURIE: Whoever coaches for Lurie -- and he will make a hard run for 
Jimmy Johnson -- will have to deal with the owner's hands-on style. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Lurie took a commercial flight to Phoenix for the Eagles' game 
against the Cardinals. Because of strong head winds, the plane had to refuel in 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>

section on the results page that the Cardinals had waived guard Rich Branham. 
Lurie got off the plane, called the office and suggested the Eagles might want 
to claim him.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; MONTANA DENIES RETIREMENT STORY

 With four games remaining in the regular season and the Kansas City Chiefs 
fighting for a playoff spot, Joe Montana said this was not the proper time to 
raise the issue of his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually calm Montana became angry Friday after the New York Daily News 
reported that he had decided to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right in the middle of a race to make the playoffs and get to the Super 
Bowl," Montana said. "Why would I want to distract from that even if I had 
decided, and I haven't?" 
</P>
<P>
 Montana suffered a sprained foot in Kansas City's 10-9 loss at Seattle on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors had circulated since Monday that he had played his final game, in part 
because initial X-rays showed a fracture of the foot. Further tests showed only 
a sprain, according to Montana and the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana probably won't play Sunday when the Chiefs play host to Denver in a 
game important to both team's playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the retirement story had Montana attacking the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think first of all, you guys are going to have to start standing up to what 
you write," he said. "I think it hurts the credibility of your field. That's 
the sad part about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I have to answer to this only because somebody feels like I'm 
going to retire? It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Daily News reporter Gary Myers quoted league sources and said he stood by his 
story. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Kansas City cornerback Dale Carter has been charged with beating a season 
ticket-holder in a bar restroom while on probation for weapons and alcohol 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 If Carter is convicted, his third brush with the law in less than a year could 
land him in jail, either for assault or for violating probation. Carter's one 
year of probation in Jackson County, for his role in a Westport shooting last 
year, expires today.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SCORING RETURNS A THING OF PAST

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than half the teams in the league have returned at least one punt or 
kickoff for a touchdown, but the Raiders have not, despite having three of the 
league's most dangerous returners in Tim Brown, Rocket Ismail and Alexander 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is the AFC's second-best punt returner with a 13.2 average, although he 
has not scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail leads the AFC with 32 kickoff returns, but he is 10th in return average 
at 22.3 yards. Wright's 32.4 return average would lead the NFL, but he hasn't 
had enough returns to qualify because opponents are kicking away from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had the last Raider kickoff return for a touchdown in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strong safety Derrick Hoskins is fit enough to return to the starting lineup, 
but he will not get the call Monday at San Diego because the Raiders have 
handed the job to Patrick Bates, last year's first-round pick from Texas A&M. 
Bates has started the last three games in place of Hoskins, who injured an 
ankle in the first half at Kansas City on Nov. 6. . . . Cornerback Lionel 
Washington will sit out his third consecutive game because of a lower leg 
injury suffered against the Rams Nov. 13. LONNIE WHITE

 What has happened to defensive tackle David Rocker? 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker, who received a guaranteed contract to re-sign with the Rams this 
season, has spent the season on the bench.Even when the team has suffered 
injuries up front, it has turned to rookie free agent D'Marco Farr before 
calling on Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not angry or bitter, but if I'm not wanted here, then I think it would be 
better for me to move on next season and play elsewhere," Rocker said. "I still 
have great confidence in my ability to play, and sitting 16 games straight on 
the bench won't change those feelings." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones, listed as probable on the team's injury report, 
has been unable to practice this week because of a sprained ankle. Jones tried 
to run Friday but reported pain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first meeting with the Saints this year, New Orleans took advantage of 
Sean Gilbert's absence at defensive tackle and ran a season-high 38 times. The 
Saints, who rank last in the league running, gained 118 yards. T.J. SIMERS

NOW, RIDDICK 'TWO-PUNCH' BOWE CAN LAND A FEW LEGALLY; BOXING: HAVING HIT 
UNHERALDED LARRY DONALD TWICE IN A FRACAS AT THE FORUM, HE FACES THE PROSPECT 
OF BEING HIT BACK A FEW TIMES IN LAS VEGAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five days after Round 1, Riddick Bowe and Larry Donald have crossed a state 
line to resume a nontitle fight that started Monday and transformed the Forum 
Club into a maelstrom of cocktail napkins and finger food. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight at 6:45, on HBO, Donald gets his chance to answer Bowe's news 
conference sucker punches when the two meet in a 12-round heavyweight bout at 
Caesars Palace Sports Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 This time there will a referee, three judges and -- perhaps -- some semblance 
of decorum. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a strange week, even by boxing standards, one that left many to wonder 
what possessed Donald to take this match in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be worth the aggravation? 
</P>
<P>
 For the privilege, he is getting $490,000 to Bowe's $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald, 27, is a decided underdog, a talented but green heavyweight who didn't 
start boxing until age 19 and has fought only 16 times professionally -- all 
victories, 12 by knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe (34-1, 29 K0s) is arguably the best heavyweight in the world not 
incarcerated, a fighter boiling over from perceived wrongs done to him since 
losing his title to Evander Holyfield more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who obviously couldn't wait to start swinging, Bowe, also 27, appears to 
be in the best condition he has been in since first winning the title from 
Holyfield in 1992. He is svelte at 241 pounds, with body sculpted by Mackie 
Shilstone, the noted New Orleans fitness guru. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe appears to have finally acknowledged the cumulative effect of 
between-fight snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you can get somewhat lax, but you learn," Bowe said this week. "You 
have to treat everyone accordingly, the same." 
</P>
<P>
 "Team Donald," as the back of the entourages' black leather jackets proclaim, 
begged for this fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bowe is the best heavyweight out there," Janks Morton, Donald's trainer, 
said. "That's why we asked for him. Bowe didn't ask for Larry, Larry asked for 
Bowe." 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, did they ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Donald has been counterpunching all week. It held Donald out of 
Wednesday's news conference to protest Monday's dining-room brawl. It also 
asked for separate Thursday weigh-ins so as not to come face to face with Bowe 
again before tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe foiled those plans when he perched on a stage near the scales and waited 
for Donald to enter the pavilion, held out for eye contact, then walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Psych 101. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe's manager, Rock Newman, learned a thing or two about political 
orchestration as a member of the team that helped get Marion Barry reelected as 
Mayor of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Newman looks to get Bowe a second term as heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman has been working all the levers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe and Donald, it turns out, will not be fighting for Donald's World Boxing 
Council Americas heavyweight title because Newman reportedly refused to pay the 
WBC sanction fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there was the ring controversy. Late in the week, Robert Mittleman, one 
of Donald's managers, was incensed to learn Caesars had agreed to narrow the 
ring sides from 20 feet to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 That would seemingly give an edge to Bowe, a stand-up fighter, over Donald, a 
flashier sort who likes to hit and run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe, though, has a contract with Caesars but is reportedly being wooed by a 
major competitor down the street: the MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Might Caesars have been willing to pull a few ropes for Bowe? 
</P>
<P>
 Mittleman complained to the Nevada State Athletic Commission about the ring 
shrinkage. Rules dictate a ring must be no smaller than 16 feet or no larger 
than 24, but Team Donald smells something fishy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is he (Newman) is the manager and the promoter of the event," 
Mittleman said. "That shouldn't happen. But I'll tell you one thing, no way 
we're going to settle for a 17-foot ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Mittleman said the commission has taken the protest under advisement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe says Donald shouldn't be able to run laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't win the fight constantly running," Bowe said. "He's trained to run, 
but this isn't a track meet. He's going to fight, or he's going to be booed." 
</P>
<P>
 So why, again, does Donald want this fight? 
</P>
<P>
 Some are convinced he is climbing the heavyweight ladder too fast. Donald did 
not make his professional debut until January of 1993, not long after losing 
his quarterfinal Olympic match at the 1992 Barcelona Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought Donald was on too fast a track. 
</P>
<P>
 "My amateur coach said, 'Wait 'til you meet the big boys,' " Donald recalled. 
"I'm still waiting on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his late start, Donald senses there is little time to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to fight the best out there," he said. "If they can win, I want them 
to take the title I had, because they deserve it. But I want to fight the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald has taken the week in remarkable stride, given his amateur reputation 
as a hot-head and showoff. He stayed clear of the fallout after Monday's 
incident and insists he does not need further motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been focused for two months," Donald said. "I was way ahead of schedule. 
I'll keep my cool. I'm not going to change my game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 For this, he can probably thank Morton, Sugar Ray Leonard's one-time trainer. 
Morton believes Donald's biggest mistake as an amateur was believing he was the 
next Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Larry got to me, I got the tape out and put it on his lips," Morton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Let's just be Larry Donald.' There was one Ali. One Sugar Ray 
Leonard. One Ken Norton. One (Joe) Frazier. One (Larry) Holmes. So just be 
yourself and let's go to work and forget about these other guys." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's HBO main event will be followed by two matches promoted by Forum 
Boxing, to be televised on KCAL, Channel 9. In a 10-round welterweight bout, 
Vince Phillips (28-1, 19 KOs) of Las Vegas takes on Jose Alfredo (Shibata) 
Flores (27-2, 18 KOs), to be followed by a 12-round bout between Marco Antonio 
Barrera (33-0, 23 KOs) of Mexico City and Eddie Cook (19-2, 16 KOs) of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe, at 241 pounds, is as light as he has been for a fight since Nov. 
13, 1992, when he defeated Evander Holyfield for the heavyweight title. Bowe 
was 235 pounds for that fight.

ALABAMA, FLORIDA TO SETTLE SEC; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: WINNER GOES TO THE SUGAR 
BOWL, WHERE CRIMSON TIDE MIGHT HAVE SHOT AT NO. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One team is playing for a chance to win a national title. The other is playing 
to save face. Not a bad backdrop for the made-for-TV cash cow that is today's 
Southeastern Conference championship football game. 
</P>
<P>
 If undefeated Alabama can beat once-beaten, once-tied Florida today at the 
Georgia Dome, the third-ranked Crimson Tide positions itself nicely for yet 
another run at the top spot in the polls. Alabama has won 12 national 
championships and enough trophies to use as doorstops, but Coach Gene Stallings 
is in a collecting mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings has had his game face on since midweek. He groused about the Crimson 
Tide's lack of concentration, its uninspired workouts, his disdain for 
artificial turf and whatever else came to mind. And whenever asked, Stallings 
gently reminded everyone that his team deserved the same consideration from 
poll voters as No. 1 Nebraska and No. 2 Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Alabama (11-0) must first beat the Gators, who are still recovering 
from last Saturday's incredible fourth-quarter collapse at Florida State's Doak 
Campbell Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida took a 28-point lead into the last quarter but had to settle for a 
31-31 tie and nearly lost the game. In fact, several Gators kept referring to 
the tie as a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling was mutual back home. One headline writer at the Gainesville Sun 
called the performance "The Choke at Doak," and "A Tying Shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, several players popped off about defensive coordinator Bob Pruett's 
zone coverages and even wondered why the Gator offense went conservative in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing a mini-mutiny, Florida Coach Steve Spurrier, who runs the offense, 
stepped in and read the Gators the riot act. He announced there would be no 
more public criticism of Florida coaches. There would be no more 
second-guessing. Instead, the Gators were ordered to concentrate on Alabama and 
a chance at redemption: an automatic Sugar Bowl bid and a rematch against the 
hated Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think I'm supposed to take that tie a lot worse than I'm . . . taking 
it," Spurrier said. "(Florida State) had more yards, more first downs and they 
missed a short field goal. I know we blew a four-touchdown lead. It's happened, 
but we could have lost the game. Hopefully, we'll realize it's never over till 
it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama is well versed on the subject of comebacks. The Crimson Tide has 
trailed or been tied in the second half seven times and managed to win each 
one. Alabama followers can thank quarterback Jay Barker, who is 34-1-1 as a 
starter; running back Sherman Williams, who is the second-leading rusher in the 
SEC with 1,242 yards, and a Crimson Tide defense that gives up fewer than two 
touchdowns a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings quit trying to figure out Alabama's winning ways weeks ago. But when 
pressed, he always returns to the Crimson Tide's defense and Barker, the 
longshot Heisman Trophy candidate whose passing statistics -- 1,815 yards, 13 
touchdowns, three interceptions -- aren't nearly as impressive as his record. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't go into the game to try to throw 400 yards," Stallings said. "He 
goes into the game to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Picking a winner between Alabama and the sixth-ranked Gators (9-1-1) isn't 
easy. This is the third consecutive time the teams have met for the SEC 
championship. The Crimson Tide won the inaugural conference title game in 1992 
and went on to earn the season's No. 1 ranking. A year later, Florida won, then 
blasted West Virginia in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators average 45.2 points. The Crimson Tide gives up 13.6. The Gators 
average 315.3 yards passing. The Crimson Tide averages 174.9, 75th best in the 
NCAA. In almost every category, Florida is better than Alabama, except the one 
that counts -- the record. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching closely will be Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, whose Seminoles 
play the winner Jan. 2 in New Orleans. He rated Alabama's defense slightly 
better than Florida's, called the kicking game even and liked the Crimson 
Tide's chances if the score is close late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alabama is the master of playing up to its potential," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden didn't come right out and say it, but he seemed to lean toward the 
Gators. However, stick an asterisk next to the half-hearted prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Florida can play with that great enthusiasm, I would nearly pick them," he 
said. "That (tie) is the hardest thing, to me, they'll have to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no ties today. The SEC championship game uses a tiebreaker, 
which means that Alabama leaves here with its national title hopes intact, or 
Florida makes up for the Tallahassee gag. Either way, it should be worth the 
wait.

 Tverdovsky, 18, missed the exhibition season because of a groin injury, and 
General Manager Jack Ferreira assigned him to Brandon of the Western Hockey 
League because he is eager for the young defenseman to play as the NHL lockout 
drags on. Tverdovsky would rejoin the Ducks should the labor dispute be

WOODS NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED IN ROBBERY ON STANFORD CAMPUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanford freshman Tiger Woods, the 1994 U.S. Amateur golf champion from 
Cypress, suffered no major injuries during a robbery in a campus parking lot 
Wednesday night. Woods was robbed at knifepoint, then knocked to the pavement 
at about 11:10 p.m. outside Stanford's Stern Hall dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford police did not release the name of the victim in a university 
release, but Earl Woods, Tiger's father, confirmed that it was his son. Earl 
Woods said the suspect put a knife to his son's neck and asked for his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods wasn't carrying a wallet at the time, but Earl Woods said the suspect 
stole a gold neck chain and watch and then hit him in the face with the knife 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tiger is fine, though," Earl Woods said. "He sustained one blow and it didn't 
hurt him. In fact, he had a final exam Thursday afternoon, the day after the 
incident, and he did very well. This hasn't affected his feelings toward 
Stanford. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time." MIKE DiGIOVANNA

ANGELS GAMBLE ON GUERRERO; BASEBALL: EX-DODGER SLUGGER AGREES TO TRIPLE-A 
CONTRACT AFTER BO JACKSON TURNS DOWN DEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 The Angels, after learning that Bo Jackson has declined their invitation to 
rejoin them next season, have decided to gamble on another power-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe . . . Pedro Guerrero? 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero, 38, who spent the last two seasons playing for Sioux City, Iowa, of 
the Northern (Independent) League, has agreed to a triple-A contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Guerrero's offer does not include an invitation to the Angels' major 
league spring training camp, sources say he could be used as a replacement 
player if the strike continues into the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to speculate on that," said Ken Forsch, Angel farm director. 
"I don't know if he can still play, to tell you the truth. But I know he can 
hit, and I know he loves the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was such an impact player in his time that I think it'd be great for our 
minor league players to be around him." 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero, who has not played in the major leagues since 1992, also was being 
pursued by Al Campanis, former Dodger general manager. Campanis offered 
Guerrero a contract to join the Palm Springs team of the Western Baseball 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete thinks the world of Mr. Campanis, but it was a pretty easy choice," said 
Denise Guerrero, Pedro's wife. "Pete really wants to get back to the majors." 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero, who earned $15.6 million during the last nine years of his major 
league career, made about $20,000 a year the last two seasons with Sioux City. 
He spent 12 years in the Dodger organization before being traded Aug. 16, 1988, 
to St. Louis for pitcher John Tudor. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero was left without a job the spring of 1993 until signing with Sioux 
City, playing in a league comprising mainly Class-A and double-A competition. 
He batted .329 last season in 75 games, with eight homers and 47 runs batted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels acknowledge it's a longshot Guerrero will return to the big 
leagues, but they still could use a pinch-hitter to replace Jackson. The Angels 
were willing to offer Jackson a one-year contract for about $500,000, but 
Jackson said Friday he's not interested in returning strictly as a 
pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he is being courted by several teams, including the Cleveland 
Indians, and has rejected offers from the Japanese League. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, free-agent closer Lee Smith made a counter-proposal to the 
Angels. Brian David, Smith's agent, and Tim Mead, Angel assistant general 
manager, said they will negotiate through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels even created a spot on their 40-man roster for Smith on Friday by 
placing reliever Jeff Schwarz on waivers for the purpose of giving him his 
unconditional release.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; OWLS' CHANEY FACES NIGHTMARE

 Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins called it a cure for insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone has trouble sleeping tonight, just turn that on and watch a 
replay," Huggins said of his team's lackluster 60-41 victory over Temple on 
Friday night in the Tournament of Champions at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 LaZelle Durden scored 17 points and No. 10 Cincinnati (3-0) held the Owls 
(1-1) to 22% shooting in their worst offensive night in John Chaney's 13 
seasons as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see, we just don't have the players who can put the ball in the 
basket," said Chaney, who starts two freshmen. "I see talented young players 
that lack wisdom. Young players can't get it done. We're going to have to take 
our bruises this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bearcats will play No. 2 North Carolina, a 95-58 winner over South 
Carolina, tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati capitalized on a 21-5 run to take a 28-10 lead early in the first 
half and a defensive series in which it held Temple for 12 minutes without a 
field goal, with the Owls missing 16 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of that placated Huggins, who was upset about his team's 40% 
shooting and 16 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we got into a rhythm we had a dumb attack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 North Carolina 95, South Carolina 58 -- The Tar Heels made 15 of their 
first 17 shots and built a 40-point first-half lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them . . . the game was over and you don't tell your kids that too 
often at halftime," said South Carolina Coach Eddie Fogler of the first 
head-to-head meeting between Tar Heel Coach Dean Smith and his former player 
and assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Stackhouse finished with 22 points and Rasheed Wallace had 17 for North 
Carolina (3-0). Carey Rich led the Gamecocks (1-2) with 14. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Connecticut 105, Yale 53 -- Donny Marshall scored 25 points and Brian 
Fair added 20 to lead the Huskies (3-0) over the Elis (0-3) at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Syracuse 83, Kent 50 -- John Wallace had 21 points, 10 rebounds and six 
blocked shots and the Orangemen held Kent (0-1) to 13 points in the opening 
half in the first round of the Carrier Classic at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orangemen (2-1) advanced to the championship game against Davidson (2-1), 
an 88-77 winner over Iona in the early game. OTHER GAMES

 Bevan Thomas made two free throws and two layups in the final 1:07 to give 
Boston College (2-1) an 81-75 victory over Holy Cross (1-2) at Worcester, Mass. 
. . . Adrian Griffin scored 24 points for Seton Hall (2-1), which set a 
Meadowlands Arena record for points in a 110-72 victory over Long Island

POOR SHOOTING NETS FULLERTON FIRST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's basketball team came down with a bad case of sub-par 
shooting Friday night against Santa Clara in the opening game of the Fresno 
State tournament, and the Titans never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton shot only 27% in the first half, and managed only three baskets in 
20 attempts from its guards.After that, Santa Clara (2-0) was never in serious 
trouble and went on to an easy 79-65 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans fell to 1-1 after winning their season-opener against Cal State 
Northridge. Fullerton will meet Texas Arlington in the tournament's consolation 
game tonight at 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Clara was a lot better than Northridge," Fullerton Coach Bob Hawking 
said. "It was a completely different level. They (the Broncos) dominated the 
game. They outrebounded us, their field-goal percentage was quite a bit higher, 
and they turned the ball over less than us." 
</P>
<P>
 That, combined with Fullerton's 34% shooting for the game, made the outcome 
obvious. The closest the Titans could come was within 10 points late in the 
second half, but then the Broncos went back into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys looked like they were about a quart low," Hawking said. "And for 
this team to be competitive, they have to be at a high energy level, and we 
just didn't have that tonight. The kids competed at a higher level in the 
second half, but by then we'd dug too deep of a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few bright spots for the Titans was the play of senior center 
Winston Peterson, who scored a career-high 26 points and had a game-high 12 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Steve Nash led Santa Clara with 21 points. Guard Marlon Garnett 
had 19.

LOYOLA (3-0) WINS IN SECOND OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount, unbeaten after two games for the first time in eight 
seasons, stepped up to a higher level of competition for its third game Friday 
night and showed that it was ready for the jump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, lopsided winners over Cal State Hayward and San Jose State in their 
first two games, overcame a seven-point deficit in the last four minutes of 
regulation and finally defeated Southwestern Louisiana, 80-73, in double 
overtime before 2,224 at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Louisiana, an NCAA tournament participant two of the last three 
seasons, built a 63-56 lead before Loyola rallied for its first overtime 
victory in three seasons under Coach John Olive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last couple of years, we played some pretty tough competition down 
to the wire but didn't have the maturity to win those games," said Olive, who 
was 13-41 in his first two seasons. "We've talked a lot about being a mature 
team, and I thought the kids showed great character." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore point guard Jim Williamson, one of two Lions who played all 50 
minutes, tied the score at 65-65 and capped a 9-2 run when he made a driving 
scoop shot with 20 seconds to play in regulation, then had a 75-foot shot hit 
the front of the rim at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reginald Poole of Southwestern Louisiana (1-2) missed a baseline jumper at the 
end of the first overtime before Loyola, which made only 12 of 27 free throws 
in the first 45 minutes, made seven of eight in the second overtime and 
outscored the Ragin' Cajuns, 11-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that we're not the team of the past," said Loyola senior Wyking 
Jones, who also played 50 minutes and scored a game-high 24 points. "It shows 
that teams have to respect us a lot more."

IRVINE FADES AWAY IN OVERTIME; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ANTEATERS PLAY NO. 14 OHIO 
U. TOUGH FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN LOSE, 81-72. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There are a couple of ways to look at UC Irvine's 81-72 overtime loss to 
14th-ranked Ohio University in the first round of the Hawkeye Invitational on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Irvine forward Mark Odsather's spin: "That's a team that just lost at 
third-ranked Kentucky by four points, and we took them into overtime. This 
proves we can play with the best teams in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Coach Rod Baker's view: "There's no column for moral 
victories. There are wins and losses and in some sports ties, but there's no 
moral victories. We had a two-point lead with six seconds to go. So what? Who 
cares?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (0-2) led by nine at halftime, fell behind by four midway 
through the second half and then had two chances to put the game away in the 
final 28.7 seconds. But first point guard Raimonds Miglinieks and then freshman 
forward Kevin Simmons were too strong on the first free throw of one-and-one 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miglinieks missed, Ohio (5-1) rebounded and guard Geno Ford went for the 
victory. His three-point attempt was long and Miglinieks, who led the Anteaters 
with 17 points and five assists, ended up with the rebound. He passed to 
Simmons, who passed to guard Chris Brown, who hit Simmons under the basket. 
Simmons was fouled by Jeff Boals before he could attempt a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't concentrating, I guess," Simmons said of the missed free throw. 
"I guess I was thinking that there was only six seconds left and we were up." 
</P>
<P>
 After Simmons' errant free throw, the Bobcats worked the ball under to Gary 
Trent, who scored on a short bank shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big-time players make big-time plays," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Anteaters emotionally deflated, the Bobcats dominated the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a great 40 minutes," Brown said, "but after they tied it up, it 
seemed like everyone thought we had lost. We were completely out of sync in 
overtime, we did none of the things that we had done during regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Trent had only four points at halftime. But he scored 10 in overtime and 
finished by matching his season average with 25 points and 14 rebounds.

NCAA SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIPS; UCLA MIDFIELDER WOOLFOLK IS SEEKING SECOND TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Woolfolk, the only UCLA men's soccer player who was with the team when 
the Bruins won the 1990 NCAA championship, is an improbable fellow to have a 
chance of winning his second national title. 
</P>
<P>
 But as UCLA heads into a quarterfinal game of the NCAA tournament Sunday, when 
it plays Charleston at 1 p.m. on the North Soccer Field, that is exactly what 
Woolfolk can do. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolfolk, a senior, was the only walk-on to make the 1990 team, although he 
did not play because he was redshirted. 
</P>
<P>
 Just making the team, which also won a national championship in 1985, was a 
moral victory for Woolfolk. He was not recruited at Wilcox High School in Santa 
Clara because his teams never advanced past the first round of the playoffs. As 
a result, few college coaches saw him play. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Woolfolk's skills were solid when he tried out for UCLA in the summer 
of 1990, his fitness level was not. He never would have passed his first 
two-mile, 12-minute fitness test demanded by Coach Sigi Schmid were it not for 
former UCLA and now U.S. national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedel had completed his test when he noticed Woolfolk struggling on the 
other side of the track. Friedel sprinted across the infield and hollered: 
"Woolfolk! With me!" Together, they crossed the finish line, Woolfolk being 
timed at 11:59 to just make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 team also was loaded with superstars, three of whom -- Friedel, 
Joe-Max Moore and Cobi Jones -- played on last summer's U.S. World Cup team. 
UCLA advanced to the quarterfinals in 1991 but had a dry spell the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Should they win Sunday, the Bruins will advance to the NCAA final four, which 
will be at Davidson, N.C., Dec. 9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (17-4) defeated Alabama Birmingham, 3-2, in overtime and Southern 
Methodist, 4-2, to reach to the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In other quarterfinal games, Brown (13-3-1) will play at Rutgers (13-9-3) 
today and, on Sunday, James Madison (20-2-2) will play at Virginia (19-3-1) and 
Cal State Fullerton (14-6-2) will play at Indiana (21-2).

BURTON AGAIN BRINGS THE BEST OUT IN 49ERS; COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: LONG BEACH TO 
CALL ON HER TALENT SUNDAY IN NCAA PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An exhausted Nichelle Burton glanced at the scoreboard, her teammates and the 
crowd, and realized she faced another of those defining moments now confronting 
her daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State and Hawaii were tied at two games in a pivotal Big West 
Conference women's volleyball match Nov. 1, and Burton, a Long Beach senior 
outside hitter and the team captain, thought she'd better do something. 
</P>
<P>
 She did. Her powerful kill fired up everyone in The Gold Mine gym, except the 
stunned group across the net. Burton finished with a match-high 18 kills and 
the 49ers won. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, an All-American, came through again in what has been the most 
satisfying -- as well as emotionally and physically demanding -- season of her 
remarkable career. And if Burton can keep herself going a little longer, the 
49ers might be raising their third national-title banner. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending Division I champion 49ers (25-5) play host to Montana (25-5) at 
3 p.m. Sunday in a second-round NCAA Northwest Region match, the first one in 
The Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Burton is well prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what this is all about," she said. "I've been there and I know teams 
are going to come after us because we're Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole different game now, and that's why I've got to step it up a 
little more at times like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Step it up? As if this weren't already going to be tough enough for Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, 22, has been among the nation's elite players since becoming a starter 
as a sophomore. Her often overwhelming play is a key reason the 49ers won their 
fourth consecutive Big West title, tying the record established by Hawaii from 
1987 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 She is second in the conference in total kills with 476, third with an average 
4.45 per game and seventh in hitting percentage at .334. Long Beach is ranked 
seventh nationally by the American Volleyball Coaches Assn. and Volleyball 
Monthly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Factor in the departure of many talented seniors from last season's title 
winner and the prominent role of several young players on this season's squad 
and Burton's presence, and accomplishments, loom large indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference's coaches noticed too. Monday, they selected Burton, 6 feet 1, 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nichelle is not just an awesome player, she's a great person to play with," 
said senior defensive specialist Prentice Perkins, the only other member of the 
four conference title teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got really frustrated with what was going on in the beginning of the year 
but Nichelle never did. She helped to keep me focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing major, Perkins said, but the team's veterans were a little peeved by 
some of the newcomers' early approach to their jobs. Coach Brian Gimmillaro 
praises Burton for her handling of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's truly an amazing person," he said. "She cares about her teammates and 
is thoughtful about their feelings but, at the same time, she's able to get the 
most out of her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That type of understanding and competitiveness is difficult for anyone, and 
it's very rare to develop in someone who's only 22." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it has come easily. Responsibility can wear on people. Try be the 
driving force behind a nationally ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of pressure on me," Burton said. "Prior to this year, I've 
always been surrounded by All-Americans, players of the year. I looked up to 
them and I knew I wasn't the one who would have to put the ball away. I just 
had to do what I had to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a lot of talent, but we have a really young team and it's up to 
me and a couple of other seniors to be leaders. I'm not saying it's a bad 
feeling, it's just different, and I think I'm handling it as well as I can at 
this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Former 49er Danielle Scott feels for her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it would be really different for her this year," said Scott, the 1993 
AVCA player of the year as a senior. "Usually, we had (a lot of) really 
experienced players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different for them this year, but Nichelle is very determined. She'll do 
whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton said she has enough left for one last push. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her desire for another national title, Burton also wants to be 
national player of the year. Long Beach players have been selected four times, 
beginning with Tara Cross' consecutive awards in 1988-89. Antoinnette White won 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton said continuing the legacy would be the perfect way to finish her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to do everything all over again," Burton said, "I wouldn't do it any

weekend in the NCAA tournament, each grouped in a different regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Each had a first-round bye and will play host for a second-round match.UCLA 
(28-3) will play host to Georgia Tech (26-8) in Pauley Pavilion and USC (20-7) 
will play host to New Mexico (20-9) in the Lyon Center. Both matches begin at 7

ANTEATERS MISS CHANCE TO UPSET OHIO; BASKETBALL: AFTER TRAILING BY TWO WITH SIX 
SECONDS LEFT, 14TH-RANKED BOBCATS TIE IT AND WIN IN OVERTIME, 81-72. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There are a couple of ways to look at UC Irvine's 81-72 overtime loss to 
14th-ranked Ohio University in the first round of the Hawkeye Invitational 
Friday night at Carver-Hawkeye Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Irvine forward Mark Odsather's spin: "That's a team that just lost to 
third-ranked Kentucky, at Kentucky, by four points, and we took them into 
overtime. This proves we can play with the best teams in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Coach Rod Baker's view: "There's no column for moral 
victories. There are wins and losses and in some sports ties, but there's no 
moral victories. When a coach gets fired, they don't talk about how many moral 
victories he had. Sure, we had a two-point lead with six seconds to go. So 
what. Who cares?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (0-2) led by nine at halftime, as Ohio (5-1) shot only 32% from 
the floor in the first half. The Bobcats did not score on 11 consecutive 
possessions midway through the half, but they regrouped at intermission and 
took a four-point lead midway through the second half, 58-54. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine wouldn't fold, however, and, after a couple of flying layins by Khalid 
Channell and two Chris Brown free throws, the Anteaters had a 66-62 advantage 
with 1 minute 5 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine held a 66-64 lead and had two chances to add to it in the final 28.7 
seconds. First point guard Raimonds Miglinieks and then freshman forward Kevin 
Simmons were too strong on the first free throw of one-and-one situations. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miglinieks missed, Ohio rebounded and guard Geno Ford went for the 
victory. His three-point attempt was long and Miglinieks, who led the Anteaters 
with 17 points and five assists, ended up with the rebound. He passed to 
Simmons, who passed to Brown, who hit Simmons under the basket. Simmons was 
fouled by Jeff Boals before he could attempt a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't concentrating, I guess," Simmons said of the missed free throw. 
"I guess I was thinking that there was only six seconds left and we were up." 
</P>
<P>
 After Simmons' errant free throw, the Bobcats worked the ball under to Gary 
Trent, who scored on a short bank shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big-time players make big-time plays," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Anteaters emotionally deflated, the Bobcats dominated the overtime, 
scoring 11 points before Brown hit a three-pointer with 40 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played great," Brown said, "but after they tied it up and sent it to 
overtime, it seemed like everyone thought we had lost. We were completely out 
of sync in overtime, we did none of the things that we had done during 
regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who led the Anteaters in scoring (17.4 points per game) and the nation 
in three-point shooting (4.7 per game) last season, had his second consecutive 
off night. Brown, who was one of eight from the floor against Oklahoma in 
Irvine's opener, made only three of 10 three-point attempts and scored 13 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the only way Irvine could stay close to a top-ranked team would be 
on one of those nights when Brown made nine or 10 threes. But this is a 
different Anteater squad with more offensive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the game and our two starting perimeter shooters (Brown and 
Odsather) were a combined five for 20," Baker said. "Yeah, we played pretty 
well . . . for 39 minutes and 59 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Trent, who has already earned the nickname "Shaq of the MAC," had only four 
points at halftime. But he scored 10 in overtime and finished by matching his 
season averages with 25 points and 14 rebounds. Guards Ford and Gus Johnson 
combined for 27 points and 10 assists and 7-foot-2 center Jason Terry had 11 
points for the Bobcats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we dodged a really huge bullet," Ohio Coach Larry Hunter said. 
"At least we did what we wanted to in the last six seconds of regulation. We 
got the ball in Gary's hands. Then we gave a sigh of relief and executed in 
OT." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters cursed their luck and then executed themselves in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing," Odsather said. "We played 40 minutes of really great 
basketball. Unfortunately, this game was 45 minutes long."

FULLERTON SUFFERS SHOOTING DROUGHT, LOSES; BASKETBALL: TITANS HIT 34% FROM 
FIELD IN A 79-65 LOSS TO SANTA CLARA AT FRESNO STATE TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton came down with a bad case of sub-par shooting Friday night 
against Santa Clara in the opening game of the Fresno State Classic and the 
Titans never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any disease, it got to be contagious," Fullerton Coach Bob Hawking said. 
"We just didn't shoot well." 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost an epidemic, as far as the Titans were concerned, in the first 
half. Fullerton shot 27%, and managed only three baskets in 20 attempts from 
its guards. After that, Santa Clara was never in serious trouble and went on to 
a 79-65 victory, its second of the season without a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans fell to 1-1 after winning its season-opener against Cal State 
Northridge. In the tournament's consolation game at 6 tonight, Fullerton will 
meet Texas Arlington, which lost to Fresno State, 89-67.  
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Clara was a lot better than Northridge, though," Hawking said. "It was 
a completely different level. They dominated the game. They outrebounded us, 
their field-goal percentage was quite a bit higher and they turned the ball 
over less than us." 
</P>
<P>
 Combine that with Fullerton's 34% shooting for the game and the outcome was 
clear-cut. The closest the Titans came was 10 points late in the second half, 
but the Broncos went back into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys looked like they were about a quart low," Hawking said. "And for 
this team to be competitive, they have to be at a high energy level, and we 
just didn't have that tonight. The kids competed at a higher level in the 
second half, but by then we'd dug too deep of a hole for us . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few bright spots for the Titans was the play of senior center 
Winston Peterson, who tied his career scoring high with 26 points. Peterson 
kept the Titans in the game with strong inside play. Peterson was nine of 17 
from the field, six for eight from the line and had a game-high 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I played a lot better tonight than I did against Northridge," Peterson 
said. "But I still felt they out-hustled us to too many rebounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Guards James French, Chris St. Clair and Chris Dade each had only one basket 
in a combined 21 shots and accounted for only nine points between them. Chuck 
Overton had 12 points, but he was four for 13 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara shot 45% for the game, but Coach Dick Davey felt strong defensive 
play was the key to his team's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fullerton did about what we expected them to do," he said. "Our problem was 
that we could never get that killer instinct to put them away in the second 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Steve Nash, the Broncos' top returning player, led Santa Clara 
with 21 points. Guard Marlon Garnett, who played at Los Angeles Hamilton High, 
had 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a lot better in this game that we did in our first game this season 
against Pacific," Garnett said. "Steve and I both got some good shots tonight, 
and we both knocked them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's first half was a nightmare. The Titans went the first three 
minutes without a point and found themselves behind 7-0 before they scored on a 
rebound basket by Overton after four consecutive missed shots. Santa Clara's 
fast break was in high gear early and it took a 12-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton made only three of 12 shots in the first eight minutes while Santa 
Clara built a 17-8 command. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara did a good job of getting the ball inside and built a 19-point 
lead at 31-12 cushion with eight minutes left. The Broncos hit 11 of 18 from 
the field during that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans managed to cut the lead to 10 points at 35-25 with less than a 
minute to go in the first half, but Garnett's three-pointer put Santa Clara up 
38-25 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton never recovered and the Broncos stayed in control throughout the 
second half.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get better," Hawking said. "We're a young team and we're still finding 
ourselves. We can learn from this game. Santa Clara exposed some of our 
weaknesses at both ends of the floor."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, after learning that Bo Jackson has declined an invitation to 
rejoin them, have decided to gamble on another power hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe . . . Pedro Guerrero? 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero, 38, who has spent the last two seasons playing for Sioux City, Iowa, 
of the Northern (Independent) League, agreed to a triple-A contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his offer does not include an invitation to their major league 
spring-training camp, sources say Guerrero could be used as a replacement 
player if the strike continues into the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero, who has been out of the big leagues since 1992, spent 12 years in 
the Dodger organization before being traded to St. Louis in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, free-agent closer Lee Smith provided a counterproposal to the 
Angels. Negotiations are continuing. BOB NIGHTENGALE

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: EVEN ZIPS CAN'T RUIN OHIO'S PERFECT SEASON

</P>
<P>
 "It's too late to cancel," outgoing Ohio U. Coach Tom Lichtenberg said before 
his Bobcats met the mighty Akron Zips in history's first battle of 0-10 
schools. After all, dozens of ticket-holders would have been disappointed. 
Instead, the minitudes watched with excitement as the Bobcats came out on the 
bottom, 10-24, to win the coveted Bottom Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the school's name will be engraved on the bronze Bottom Ten dunce cap, 
which rests in perpetuity at Art's Ammo, Sushi and Tanning Parlor in Death 
Valley, Calif. In addition, Ohio U. players are expected to receive the 
customary invitation to be guest stars on the next sitcom starring Tom Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 On a positive note, Ohio State Coach John Cooper ended one of sports' most 
bizarre streaks. Until defeating Michigan, Cooper--who has also coached at 
Arizona State and Tulsa--had posted an 0-9-2 record in those schools' 
end-of-the-year traditionals.

 Houston wide receiver Webster Slaughter, removed from the Giant game by rookie 
Coach Jeff Fisher, later reinserted himself into the lineup on his own. 
Slaughter's behavior--he was also fined more than $9,000 after making some 
critical remarks--is about the only thing offensive about the Oilers these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 In two games under Fisher, Houston (1-11) has scored 20 points--the kind of 
offensive output you'd expect from a Buddy Ryan team. Then again, Fisher once 
served as defensive coordinator under Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for some good news. Atlanta receiver Andre Rison emerged from the Falcons' 
dog house to catch four passes for 92 yards. Rison, you may recall, was 
suspended for a week after being tardy to a team event for the 19th time this

NCAA SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIPS; UCLA MIDFIELDER WOOLFOLK SEEKS SECOND TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Woolfolk, the only UCLA men's soccer player who was with the team when 
the Bruins won the 1990 NCAA championship, is an improbable fellow to have a 
chance of winning his second national title. 
</P>
<P>
 But as UCLA heads into a quarterfinal game of the NCAA tournament Sunday, when 
it plays Charleston at 1 p.m. on the North Soccer Field, that is exactly what 
Woolfolk can do. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolfolk, a senior, was the only walk-on to make the 1990 team, although he 
did not play because he was redshirted. 
</P>
<P>
 Just making the team, which also won a national championship in 1985, was a 
moral victory for Woolfolk. He was not recruited at Wilcox High School in Santa 
Clara because his teams never advanced past the first round of the playoffs. As 
a result, few college coaches saw him play. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Woolfolk's skills were solid when he tried out for UCLA in the summer 
of 1990, his fitness level was not. He never would have passed his first 
two-mile, 12-minute fitness test demanded by Coach Sigi Schmid were it not for 
former UCLA and now U.S. national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedel had completed his test when he noticed Woolfolk struggling on the 
other side of the track. Friedel sprinted across the infield and hollered: 
"Woolfolk! With me!" Together, they crossed the finish line, Woolfolk being 
timed at 11:59 to just make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the character of our team that year," Woolfolk said. "This guy 
didn't even know me." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 team also was loaded with superstars, three of whom -- Friedel, 
Joe-Max Moore and Cobi Jones -- played on last summer's U.S. World Cup team. 
UCLA advanced to the quarterfinals in 1991 but had a dry spell the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Should they win on Sunday, the Bruins will advance to the NCAA final four, 
which will be held at Davidson, N.C., Dec. 9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolfolk, a left midfielder, appeared in six games in 1991 and 1992 and sat 
out most of last season because of a broken leg. He has appeared in 12 games 
this season, when most of the attention has focused on Ante Razov, who leads 
UCLA with 14 goals and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (17-4) defeated Alabama Birmingham, 3-2, in overtime and Southern 
Methodist, 4-2, to reach to the quarterfinals. Charleston (19-6-0) advanced 
with two sudden-death overtime victories, 1-0 over the South Region's 
top-seeded team, North Carolina Charlotte, and 5-4 over North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 In other quarterfinal games, Brown (13-3-1) will play at Rutgers (13-9-3) 
today and, on Sunday, James Madison (20-2-2) will play at Virginia (19-3-1) and 
Cal State Fullerton (14-6-2) will play at Indiana (21-2).

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / CITY SECTION 4-A SEMIFINAL; SYLMAR'S PRICE IS RIGHT IN 
VICTORY OVER CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK STRODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether Carson High deserved to qualify for the City Section 4-A playoffs 
became a moot question Friday night before an overflow crowd at Sylmar High. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, which entered the playoffs with a 2-8 record after forfeiting three of 
its games because of an ineligible player, was ousted after losing in the 
semifinals to fifth-ranked Sylmar, 27-19. 
</P>
<P>
 Durell Price rushed for 237 yards in 25 carries and scored four touchdowns to 
make sure Sylmar would advance to next Saturday's championship game against 
Crenshaw at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the machinations that got the Colts into the playoffs, "I just 
couldn't see a (4-A) playoffs without Carson competing in them," Sylmar Coach 
Jeff Engilman said after the Spartans raised their record to 13-0. "They 
weren't a 4-8 ballclub. They have great talent on that team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad we got a chance to decide who the better team was on the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Price scored in every quarter, and three of the touchdowns were spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 His 48-yard run down the right sideline with 7:18 to play gave Sylmar a 27-12 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means the world to me (beating Carson)," Price said. "All week long, I had 
been daydreaming about beating them and now the dream came true. It's an 
incredible feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson had beaten the Spartans, 22-21, in last year's 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We practiced all week long with the scoreboard showing, 22-21," Price said. 
"I couldn't get that score out of my head -- until now." 
</P>
<P>
 On Price's first score, a 51-yard run, he ran around right end and went 
untouched into the end zone, giving the Spartans a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second quarter, he fumbled on his own 22-yard line. The 
ball was scooped up by Carson's Eric David, who returned it 78 yards to cut the 
lead to 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Price answered with 1:52 remaining in the half when he scored on a 52-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 He added a one-yard run in the third quarter, putting Sylmar up, 20-6.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / CITY SECTION SEMIFINALS; CRENSHAW TAKES BIG RISKS BUT 
STOPS DORSEY ANYWAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a seven-point lead and the ball deep in its own territory late in the 
fourth quarter, Crenshaw High twice chose not to punt on fourth-and-one 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Daring for most, but not for the Cougars as they twice gained the needed 
yardage to help them hold on to a 26-19 victory over Dorsey in the City 4-A 
semifinal Friday night at Fremont High. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrel Payton, who gained 98 yards in 19 carries, rushed for the key first 
downs on both plays. Crenshaw (12-1), which kept the ball for seven of the 
final eight minutes, finally punted to the Dons, whose last drive ended on an 
interception by Johnny Johnson as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 After a high-scoring first half, the game turned defensive in the second half. 
Dorsey twice drove deep into Crenshaw territory only to come away empty, thanks 
to a key tackle by Kabeer Smith and an overthrown pass by Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, however, ended the scoring drought with a halfback option pass by 
Seals, who finished with 97 yards in 23 carries, to Magee, who caught five 
passes for 157 yards and two touchdowns. LONNIE WHITE

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF SEMIFINALS; NOTRE DAME MOVES TO BRINK OF SCHOOL

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL TITLE.

 Notre Dame High will play for the first Southern Section football title in 
school history after defeating Serra, 27-14, in the Division III semifinals 
Friday night at Serra High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (12-1) will play the winner of tonight's Diamond Bar-Ayala game 
for the championship next Friday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 In the victory over Serra, Chris Sailer kicked field goals of 43 and 50 yards, 
quarterback Ryan Bowne engineered three lengthy touchdown drives and the 
defense did the rest. The Knights held Serra (8-5) to only 147 yards -- all 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker David Dupetit had a game-clinching interception at the Serra 
32-yard line with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the victory sweeter, senior tackle Peter Forlano played briefly in the 
first half in his first game back since undergoing emergency brain surgery 
seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely elated," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said. "One of the 
things I like about these guys is that when the other team gets a huge play, 
our guys come back and don't let the momentum change." 
</P>
<P>
 Serra scored both its touchdowns in lightning-quick fashion. Running back 
Frank Rice ran 79 yards for a score in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the third quarter, defensive back David Burr ran 77 yards after 
picking up a fumble by Alvin Arzu, but Notre Dame still led, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra couldn't stop Bowne and Sailer. Sailer's 50-yard kick gave the Knights a 
20-14 lead with eight minutes to play. Three minutes later Bowne, who rushed 
for two touchdowns, drove the Knights 39 yards in seven plays -- the big play 
an 18-yard completion to tight end Andy Breman -- before tailback John Garcia 
went 11 yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights received the game's first break when Robert Jenkins muffed 
Sailer's punt, and Corey Franzini recovered for Notre Dame at the Serra 
seven-yard line. Five plays and a penalty later, Bowne ran five yards on a 
keeper for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sailer, who now has a state record 20 field goals this season, booted his 
43-yard field goal, the Knights had a 17-7 halftime lead.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF SEMIFINALS; ANTELOPES OUTRUN PENINSULA; SOUTHERN

1988, 28-0.

<P>
 Mr. Aw-shucks himself, Antelope Valley High Coach Brent Newcomb, came as close 
he gets to actually boasting Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 His Antelopes had just demolished Palos Verdes Peninsula, 28-0, in a Southern 
Section Division II semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the euphoria of the moment. Or the magnificent wide-open space. 
Or that brisk Antelope Valley air that can numb opposing teams and fans alike. 
But Newcomb felt good. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I don't really know how to say this . . . but . . . I'm a low-key 
guy . . . but . . . I'm not really surprised by the outcome of this game," 
Newcomb said. "I mean, there's some talent on this team. And they're young 
guys, too. We might be back to the finals next year. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley (10-2), which reached its first section final since 1988, will 
play the winner of tonight's semifinal between Hart and Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley threw only two passes (one incomplete, one intercepted) but it 
didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope tailback Jermaine Lewis gained 148 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Shrout, Antelope Valley's kicker and standout lineman, was a prime mover 
in the victory. He returned a Peninsula fumble 29 yards for a touchdown to ice 
the game in the third quarter and also kicked field goals of 50 and 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lineman's dream," he said of the touchdown, on which Panther tailback 
Petros Papadakis was stacked up at the line of scrimmage and had the ball 
ripped from his hands by Shrout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing you can prepare for," said the 6-foot-2, 235 pound senior. "I 
saw the open end zone and said, 'I've gotta go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula (11-2), which had its 10-game winning streak snapped, managed only 
106 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the toughest team I've played against -- ever," said Papadakis, who 
entered the game with 1,944 rushing yards and 22 touchdowns but gained only 66 
yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hit real hard, they're on top of the ball, they're a great team," he 
said.

 Women's volleyball: Matadors dispatch Oregon State and Sam Houston State in 
pool play of national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge, led by the hitting of Missy Clements and the blocking of 
Ana Kristich, swept Oregon State and Sam Houston State in pool play matches 
Friday in the National Invitational Volleyball Championship at Municipal 
Auditorium in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge defeated Oregon State, 17-15, 15-0, 15-11, in its first match 
before beating Sam Houston State, 15-12, 15-5, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors will conclude pool play today with matches against Connecticut 
(27-9, 0-2 in the tournament) and Minnesota (20-14, 2-0) at noon and 5 p.m. 
PST, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 If Northridge wins both matches, the Matadors will advance to the semifinals 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's victory over Oregon State avenged a four-game loss to the Beavers 
on Oct. 8 and the victory over Sam Houston State was the seventh in a row for 
the Matadors (19-8) and ninth in the past 10 matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Lian Kang Lu, Northridge's first-year coach, attributed better serving, 
improved blocking and counterattacking in the victory over Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense and blocking was much better this time than before," Lu said. 
"The first time they (played) us, they played a quick transition game against 
us because our defense was not too good. But today, it was the other way 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge had a .283 hitting percentage against Oregon State on Friday after 
being held to a .103 mark in the first meeting between the teams. In contrast, 
the Beavers hit .080 as a team compared to .219 in the first match. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors' victory in the first game proved crucial. They led, 14-11, but 
won only after Oregon State had tied the score, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Oregon State) seemed to lose a lot of confidence after the first game," Lu 
said. "That win was very important to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, Northridge's career kill leader, had 17 kills and a .371 hitting 
percentage against Oregon State and added 12 kills with a .667 percentage 
against Sam Houston State. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 10 matches, the 5-foot-11 senior outside hitter is averaging 5.83 
kills per game with a .415 hitting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristich, a teammate of Clements at La Habra High, had 14 blocks, including 
eight against Sam Houston State. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two matches, Aimee Stone had 19 kills and 25 digs, and Heather Anderson 
added 19 kills (.425 hitting percentage), 14 digs and six blocks. Northridge 
setter Kathleen Shannon had 63 assists, eight digs and six blocks. JOHN ORTEGA

SNARING RECORDS AS VALLEY RECEIVER SHOULD CATCH COMER DIVISION I RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For as long as he can remember, Brian Comer has been goal-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the task, even the seemingly unsurmountable, Comer charts a plan and 
faithfully sticks to it until hitting pay dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 If encouraged and motivated by others, it's a done deal. If rattled by 
skeptics, there's really no stopping him. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three years ago, when he was a 5-foot-11 quarterback at Chatsworth High 
with dreams of playing at a Division I school, Comer heard the put-downs. Get 
serious, they said. Guzzle some reality, they suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 But his dream would not be doused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard all the negatives about how I wasn't going to get there," Comer said. 
"I wasn't going to let anyone stop me. No matter what the obstacles, I was 
going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And by George -- and all those other fools who underestimated him -- Comer is 
practically there. Granted, it will be as a receiver instead of a quarterback, 
but let's not get technical. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy is going D-1. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Comer became the career leader at Valley College with 129 
receptions, 2,452 yards receiving and 24 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He will run a few more routes today and surely increase those numbers when the 
Monarchs (9-1) meet Rancho Santiago (9-1) in the Orange County Bowl at 1:30 
p.m. at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the last game with the run-and-shoot Monarchs for Comer, who was 
converted to receiver last season and quickly adapted. Soon after, he will take 
recruiting trips to Cal, Purdue, UNLV and Wyoming. By next fall, a major goal 
will be in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 But that bag was bottomless not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out after I graduated from high school that they are not really 
recruiting 5-11 quarterbacks," Comer said. "I had zero offers. . . . It kind of 
shattered my hopes. But I just sucked it up. I tried harder than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 After leading area City Section quarterbacks by passing for 1,125 yards during 
his senior season in 1991, Comer redshirted at Valley the following season 
because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried out for quarterback last year but realized that he might have a 
better future catching the ball. Besides, the Monarchs had just landed former 
Agoura High rifle-arm quarterback Sean Fitzgerald as a transfer from Idaho 
State and nobody short of Dan Marino was going to take the position away from 
him.  
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, now at Pittsburgh, passed for a then-school single-season record 
3,134 yards and 27 touchdowns. Comer became his favorite target. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave (Comer) the opportunity to try out at quarterback," said Jim Fenwick, 
Valley coach. "We let him work at it but we also let him work at wide receiver 
and then he saw he could make the transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Comer made 58 receptions for 904 yards and 11 touchdowns. He 
helped the Monarchs to a 9-2 record and turned hero with a phenomenal 
performance in a 21-19 victory over Moorpark in the Western State Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In that game, Comer caught three touchdown passes from Fitzgerald in the 
fourth quarter to rally the Monarchs from a 16-0 deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 The clincher came on a 16-yard pass play with three seconds left. Fitzgerald 
threw a sideline pass and Comer grabbed it at the three-yard line over the 
outstretched hands of a Moorpark defensive back and stepped into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Comer finished the game with nine receptions for 182 yards and validated, once 
and for all, the wisdom of taking up a new position. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of got me into the spotlight," Comer said. "I knew I could play 
receiver. I knew I had the ability and when you believe in yourself, you can do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 He apparently believed a whole lot this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with new quarterback Jim Arellanes, a transfer from Northern Arizona 
who has eclipsed Fitzgerald's single-season passing record with 3,483 yards, 
Comer led the Western State Conference and was third in the state with 71 
receptions and first in California in yards receiving with 1,548. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 200 or more yards in four games -- including eight receptions for 260 
yards against L.A. Southwest -- and scored 13 times to tie Valley's 
single-season touchdown record for receptions set by James Reaves in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 All plentiful enough for a spot on the J.C. Grid-Wire All-American first team 
and the WSC South Division first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, for one, knows the honors are well deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is definitely the best receiver I've played with," Arellanes said. "He has 
a nose for the ball. Play after play, week after week, I know exactly where he 
is going to be. I see something and I give him a little look. He sees something 
and he gives me a little look. There's that kind of communication." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that sense, Comer said, comes from his experience as a quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 He knows what they look for on certain plays, how to dissect defensive 
schemes, and he tries to think along with them. And, although not gifted with 
blazing speed, he has sure hands and is extremely elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing quarterback helped me tremendously," said Comer, who was the 
emergency backup to Fitzgerald last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense is based on reading the defenses. I worked well with Sean and 
with Jim because we (have been) on the same page." 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick, who said he wasn't sure how swiftly Comer would make the switch to 
receiver, has been impressed by Comer's growth at the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the opportunity to make the (routine) plays, he has made them," Fenwick 
said. "But he has also made great plays with defensive backs hanging all over 
him. He has done a tremendous job." 
</P>
<P>
 Comer wouldn't have settled for less.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF SEMIFINALS; HARVARD UNABLE TO HOLD LINE; SOUTHERN 
SECTION: ATASCADERO DOMINATES WOLVERINES UP FRONT ON THE WAY TO DIVISION IX 
FINAL, 34-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most effective offense is one in which it doesn't matter who is in it. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Atascadero High's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greyhounds, playing without their 1,800-yard rusher, rolled up 284 yards 
on the ground on the way to a 34-6 victory over Harvard-Westlake in the 
Southern Section Division IX semifinals Friday night at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 Atascadero, defending Division IX champion, played without Ryan McGaughey, who 
was hospitalized this week with meningitis. McGaughey gained 1,871 yards and 
scored 23 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
 His replacement, junior Alan Bell, gained 179 yards to lead the Greyhounds 
(9-4). It probably wouldn't have mattered who was carrying the ball because the 
Atascadero offensive line was opening huge holes and the Greyhounds' 
misdirection plays were creating confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got manhandled up front," said Harvard linebacker-quarterback Derek 
Lemkin. "It's humiliating. We've never been beaten that bad, where we just 
couldn't stop a team." 
</P>
<P>
 After holding Atascadero to one first-half touchdown, Harvard (10-2-1) could 
not stop the Greyhounds in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Atascadero scored on drives of 73, 50, 66 and 20 yards in the second half. Its 
only possession that did not end with a score in the second half was one that 
was stopped when time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every play they just punched us up front," Lemkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard displayed a solid passing attack, with Lemkin completing 16 of 36 for 
261 yards and a touchdown. Kevin Goldfein caught seven passes for 83 yards and 
Kadar Lewis caught four for 83 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the Greyhounds' advantage on the line of scrimmage, Harvard 
could not generate a running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard gained 197 yards in the first half and only 90 in the second. Harvard 
gained a total of 26 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to the game was we had a great deal of trouble running the ball," 
Harvard Coach Dave Bennett said. "They won the war of the trenches both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Atascadero will face the winner of tonight's game between Santa Ynez and 
Nordhoff in the championship game next week. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been a different game Friday had Harvard been able to convert 
the opportunities it had in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines moved the ball inside Atascadero territory on every first-half 
drive. But two possessions ended with interceptions by Atascadero's Sandy 
Layne. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard's best scoring opportunity came when it drove to the Greyhound 13, but 
a sack pushed the Wolverines back to the 21 and that drive ended when a 37-yard 
field-goal attempt missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Atascadero's lone first half score -- a four-yard run by Bell -- came at the 
end of an 80-yard drive on which Harvard could not stop the Greyhounds' 
misdirection plays.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL BOWL GAMES; RANCHO SANTIAGO MUST RUN; FULLERTON HAS 
STRUGGLED OF LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Never has Rancho Santiago needed a stronger effort from its running game than 
today, when the Dons take on Los Angeles Valley in the Simple Green Orange 
County Bowl at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1:30 p.m. game matches run-oriented Rancho Santiago, the sixth-ranked team 
in the nation, against pass-happy Los Angeles Valley, the No. 16 team in the 
country. Both are 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons won the Central Division of the Mission Conference and L.A. Valley 
was second in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago averaged 236 yards per game on the ground and would like to 
improve on that mainly because of Valley quarterback Jim Arellanes. He is 220 
of 357 for 3,483 yards, 25 touchdowns and eight interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes threw for a single-game state record 639 yards in a loss to 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to keep their quarterback sitting on the bench," Rancho Santiago 
Coach Dave Ogas said. "Hopefully it's an exciting game . . . for our offense 
and not theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Wilson is Rancho Santiago's leading rusher, with 786 yards and 12 
touchdowns. Ace Riggins added 462 yards. But if the Dons' running game falters, 
they need not panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago also has a talented quarterback in sophomore Simon Fuentes. He 
set a Rancho Santiago single-season record with 19 touchdown passes in 
completing 110 of 165 attempts for 1,755 yards. He was intercepted four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago also had an impressive defensive unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons were first in the 14-team Mission Conference, allowing 323 yards a 
game. One of the unit's specialties is rushing the quarterback. The Dons 
recorded 43 sacks this season, including 11 by Kent Miller and 10 by Dustin 
Williams. Both are defensive ends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (6-3-1) is hoping to play better in its bowl game than the Hornets 
did in their final two regular-season games. The Hornets, coached by Gene 
Murphy, play Hancock (7-3) in Santa Maria at 1 p.m. in the K-Swiss Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was tied for first with Rancho Santiago when the teams met in the 
ninth game, but the Hornets were soundly beaten, 34-7. Fullerton then had to 
hang on for a 54-42 victory over Southwestern (0-9-1) in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this game as a reward," Murphy said. "But it's also a chance to end 
on a positive note. For a lot of our sophomores, this is their final game ever 
so we'd like to end with a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's post-season appearance also marks an impressive turnaround in the 
program. Fullerton was 1-9 in 1992, then went 3-7 in Murphy's first season. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, quarterback Marc O'Brien led the offense that was seventh in the 
Mission Conference. Fullerton averaged 264 yards passing and 118 yards rushing 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets' running game was sluggish much of the season with the exception 
of freshman Mike Jacot, who had 560 yards in 85 attempts.  
</P>
<P>
 The defense was near the top of the most of the season but struggled in the 
final two weeks, falling to fourth. Fullerton gave up 233 yards passing and 126 
yards rushing a game.

HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS; BASICA KEEPS STREAK GOING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Junior Amanda Basica became the third consecutive Palos Verdes Peninsula High 
player to win the girls' Southern Section individual singles tournament with a 
6-2, 6-2 victory over Santa Barbara San Marcos junior Kara Warkentin on Friday 
at the Lindborg Racquet Club in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Basica, the tournament's top-seeded player, had her serve broken once in each 
set, but she was never pressed by the unseeded Warkentin.In the morning 
semifinals, Basica defeated fourth-seeded Monique Allegre of Camarillo, 6-3, 
6-0, and Warkentin beat Sanaz Ghazal of Temecula Valley, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Warkentin chose to try to slug it out with Basica from the baseline. It wasn't 
the best of strategies against the world's 12th-ranked player in the girls' 18 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe she might come into the net off the deep balls she hit, but 
she played the same the whole match," said Basica, who reached the section

COMMENTARY; FORGET THE NUMBERS AND LOOK AT COLLINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The numbers are all against Penn State quarterback Kerry Collins, the way the 
numbers in the polls may go against Penn State in the end. Colorado's Rashaan 
Salaam has more than 2,000 yards rushing, and the other three running backs who 
have gotten that many in a season won the Heisman Trophy. Ki-Jana Carter, from 
the same backfield as Collins, would be right there with Salaam if he had the 
carries, because Carter averages nearly eight yards per carry. Alcorn State's 
Steve McNair has thrown about 2,000 touchdown passes with an amazing amount of 
hype at his back. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that, Kerry Collins should win the Heisman Trophy a week from today, 
because sports has to be more than numbers, and because Collins has been the 
most valuable player in college this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying to you if I said I didn't think about winning the Heisman," 
Collins said yesterday. "Everybody dreams about winning the Heisman Trophy. But 
I'm the guy trying to come from back in the pack." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Salaam is already a lock, because of numbers. Maybe Carter and Collins 
will be penalized for playing on the same team. Nobody even talked about 
Collins as a serious candidate until about a month ago, and that is never good 
if you are going for the Heisman. "It took a long time for me to get in the 
mix," Collins said. "Maybe too long." 
</P>
<P>
 It does not change what he has done across 11 Saturdays, quarterbacking the 
best offense in the country, one somehow able to produce two Heisman candidates 
from the same backfield. Collins has thrown 21 touchdown passes with only seven 
interceptions, completed 67% of his passes for nearly 2,700 yards. And he has 
been bigger than those numbers. Twice this season, against Michigan and 
Illinois, both games on the road, he was asked to take his team down the field 
and keep Penn State's title shot alive. Twice he did just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive against Illinois, on a day when Penn State had fallen behind, 21-0, 
was the great fourth-quarter drama in a college season rich with fourth-quarter 
drama. Colorado beat Michigan with that miracle pass. It came at the end of the 
game, but early in the season. The Illinois game turned out to be the whole 
season for Penn State. The Nittany Lions were ranked No. 2 by then, but knew a 
loss ended any chance of No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Six minutes left against Illinois, and what looked like the whole field in 
front of Kerry Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-six yards to go in the rain, and against the wind," Collins said. "We 
were up against the best defense in the Big Ten. It's the kind of situation you 
dream about your whole life, because everything we'd worked for was on the 
line. How many times do you ever get a chance like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Collins took his time and took Penn State down the field the way great 
quarterbacks are supposed to. He completed all seven of his passes on the 
game-winning drive. For the fourth quarter, he was 13 for 15 for 122 yards, and 
Penn State got the two touchdowns that saved its season.  
</P>
<P>
 "People say they'll never forget that drive at Penn State," Collins said. He 
laughed and said, "I know I never will." 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam is a superb college back. Only Marcus Allen, Barry Sanders and Mike 
Rozier have gotten to 2,000 yards before him. So Salaam has to be the favorite 
for the Heisman and probably will win. But he should not automatically win 
because of 2,055 yards; if that is the case, he should be declared the winner 
right now and nobody has to bother to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is only numbers that decide this, then McNair should win, even coming 
from Division I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins is all right with his own stats, of course. He quarterbacked an 
offense that averaged 47 points a game. Sometimes it looked as if Penn State 
with Collins at quarterback could score points as easily and as quickly as 
Alcorn State did with McNair.  
</P>
<P>
 There should be a way for Collins to come from behind to win the Heisman 
Trophy, the way he came from behind against Illinois. For that one Saturday 
afternoon, he made 96 yards in the wind and rain feel as important as all the 
yards from Rashaan Salaam.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF SEMIFINALS; BIRMINGHAM GIVES EPSTEIN A FINAL GAME; 
CITY SECTION: BRAVES SURVIVE LOSS OF POWELL AND RALLY BY WILSON FOR 27-20 
VICTORY IN 3-A SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The roller-coaster ride that has been the postseason for the Birmingham High 
football team took several more spectacular twists and turns Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham barely squeaked into the playoffs as the 16th-seeded team in the 
City Section 3-A Division playoffs. Coach Chick Epstein announced before the 
first-round game that he will retire after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Braves survived a potentially serious injury to standout 
fullback Marvin Powell and a furious last-minute rally by host Wilson for a 
27-20 victory -- advancing to a final for the first time in Epstein's 17-year 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham will play Bell in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Courtney Blunt gained 221 yards in 25 carries and scored three 
touchdowns, but had to do most of his work without his fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was delayed for nearly 30 minutes midway through the second quarter 
when Powell was injured following a short pass reception. He was listed in 
serious condition with a neck injury at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell collided with Wilson defensive back Jaime Munoz after a 10-yard pass 
play. Powell got up and walked back to the huddle before falling to his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was accompanied to the hospital by his father, former USC and New York 
Jet tackle Marvin Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 One play after the injury, Blunt ran 48 yards to the Mules' two-yard line. 
Blunt scored two plays later to give Birmingham a 12-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best friend was down there hurt and they were laughing at him because he 
took a hard hit," Blunt said. "We had to prove we had the heart to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson scored on a one-yard sneak by quarterback Eddie Gonzales late in the 
half to take a 13-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves regained the momentum early in the second half when Jason Howard 
blocked a Wilson punt and returned it 23 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt led Birmingham (7-5-1) to a 27-13 lead early in the fourth quarter 
before the Mules (10-3) scored on a 60-yard pass play from Gonzales to Luis 
Sanchez. Wilson drove to the 15 before Roderick Courtney intercepted a pass in 
the end zone with six seconds to play.

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: BURBANK / HOOVER TOURNAMENT; ZARGARIAN SHINES FOR 
CRESCENTA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BRESNAHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shawn Zargarian stood at the free-throw line with four seconds to play in the 
final of the Burbank-Hoover tournament, heavy with the realization he had not 
made a free throw this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Zargarian had been 0 for 6, but with his Crescenta Valley High team trailing 
by one point, he made two shots to lift the Falcons to a 56-55 victory over 
Eagle Rock on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the free throws, Eagle Rock point guard Ben Hoang approached Zargarian 
and talked some trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Zargarian pushed Hoang away, and calmly made the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt good off the release," said Zargarian, whose point total consisted 
of the two clutch free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody just had confidence in me and I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley's starting lineup averages almost 6 feet 5. But the Falcons 
were almost undone by the 5-7 Hoang, who finished with 28 points for Eagle Rock 
(2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley blew an 11-point third-quarter lead and Cary Adams scored on 
a short jump shot to put Eagle Rock ahead by one with 25 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 On Crescenta Valley's final possession the Falcons managed two shots before 
Zargarian was fouled on a putback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad for Zargarian, that he was able to hit those free throws," Crescenta 
Valley Coach John Goffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoang, who scored 62 points in Eagle Rock's last two tournament games, 
credited Crescenta Valley's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took up a lot of space," Hoang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (3-0) countered with a balanced attack, receiving 18 points 
from both Blake Jacobson and Nathan Sinning. 
</P>
<P>
 And Zargarian improved to 2-8 from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe 77, Burbank 75 -- Shaka Stiner scored 21 points off the bench and 
helped Monroe to a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe trailed Burbank, 38-31, at halftime but erupted for 27 points in the 
third quarter. Stiner, who entered in the second quarter, keyed the run by 
hitting three three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Johnson added 15 points for Monroe (2-1) and Matt Baker led Burbank (1-2) 
with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis 69, Burroughs 66 -- Ted Steben made eight three-pointers and 
finished with 28 points to lead St. Francis (2-1) in the consolation final. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Boldvich led Burroughs (1-2) with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover 65, Marshall 47 -- Danny Clarke's 19 points paced Hoover (1-2) in the 
seventh-place game.

ALEMANY TAKES ITS GAME TO ANOTHER LEVEL; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: INDIANS, LOOKING 
FOR WOODBRIDGE REMATCH, RISE TO DIVISION II-AA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Alemany High girls' basketball team will climb to Division II-AA, should 
the Indians qualify for the Southern Section playoffs, Coach Melissa Hearlihy 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany, ranked second in the state, was placed in Division III-AA last month. 
The Southern Section classifications are based on enrollment, but schools have 
the option to move up one full division. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have the caliber of team we have, you need to (move up)," Hearlihy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians have four returning starters from a 30-1 team that won the 
Southern Section Division II-A championship and advanced to the State 
semifinals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge, which defeated the Indians, 46-41, in that semifinal on its way to 
the Division II state championship, has been moved to II-AA based on 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a coincidence that the teams are back together in the same playoff 
grouping, Hearlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game has been killing me," Hearlihy said of the semifinal, which Alemany 
led in the final minutes. "I've died a million deaths over that game since." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany's request for the move was due by next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it will be approved," Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley said. 
"It's automatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs: "On behalf of all the Division II teams, I 
can honestly say that this is definitely bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 By jumping to the higher division, the Indians have cleared a path for Newbury 
Park, which entered the season ranked 10th in the state, but would have played 
under Alemany's considerable shadow in Division III-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park Coach Nori Parvin received the news Friday morning in a phone 
call from Hearlihy, a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to tell me in person," Parvin said. "She wanted another chance at 
Woodbridge and to give Newbury Park a shot. It's a long season, though, and 
anything could happen between now and the playoffs."

EIGHTH IS ENOUGH FOR BEST IN AREA AT WEST REGIONAL; CROSS-COUNTRY: ARCE, 
HERNANDEZ AND OTHER TOP RUNNERS TRY TO QUALIFY FOR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 All season long, the No. 1 goal for cross-country runners such as Eleazar 
Hernandez of Camarillo, Antonio Arce of Palmdale, Amy Skieresz of Agoura and 
Kim Mortensen of Thousand Oaks has been to win whatever race they were 
competing in. 
</P>
<P>
 But simply finishing among the top eight will be today's No. 1 goal in the 
Foot Locker West regional at Woodward Park in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The top eight runners in each race will advance to next week's national 
championships at Balboa Park in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, runner-up in the Division I race of last week's State championships 
at Woodward Park, and Arce, the State Division II champion, head the list of 
local entries in the boys' race. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Fischer of Thousand Oaks, third in the State Division I final, and Keith 
O'Doherty (sixth), Agoura's John Greene (third in Division II) and Nordhoff's 
Javier Ramirez (second in Division III) could also contend for top-10 finishes, 
although they are regarded as long shots to qualify for nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Strahan of Hart is another top-10 contender if he's healthy. Strahan was 
regarded as a potential national finalist during the first half of the season, 
but a sinus infection dropped him to 11th place in the State Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he is capable of finishing in the top three with a good race," 
Camarillo Coach Mike Smith said of Hernandez. "But the main thing is to finish 
in the top eight and qualify for next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, 23rd in the West regional as a junior, echoed Smith's sentiments after 
the State final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have gone to another gear or two (in the homestretch) today, but I 
wanted to save something for next week," he said. "I hope to make it to 
nationals." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Leslie of Gallup (N.M.) High, Micah Davis of Mead High in Spokane, 
Wash., and Jason Balkman of Lynbrook High in San Jose are tabbed as potential 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie finished fifth in last year's regional, Davis was eighth and Balkman, 
who turned back Hernandez for the State Division I title, placed 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for first in the girls' meet is not expected to be close. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Rosa sophomore Julia Stamps is undefeated and has set a slew of course 
records, including a 16:58 clocking in the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational 
in October and a 17:06 effort in the State Division I final. 
</P>

LANCERS EDGE STARS IN OVERTIME; DIVISION X: ORANGE LUTHERAN EARNS FIRST 
CHAMPIONSHIP-GAME BERTH WITH 7-6 VICTORY OVER MARY STAR OF THE SEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two teams with storybook seasons. Just one would have a satisfying ending. 
</P>
<P>
 The smiles go to Orange Lutheran, which needed overtime to finally put away 
San Pedro Mary Star of the Sea, 7-6, before an estimated 2,500 at Daniels 
Field. The victory gave the Lancers (11-2), top-seeded in Division X, their 
first championship berth. Orange Lutheran will play the winner of tonight's 
Montclair Prep-Kilpatrick game next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Star, seeking to reach its first football title game since 1960, saw its 
season end at 11-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't say I got them this far," Lancer Coach Jim Kunau said. "The kids did 
it. I give credit to their defense for stopping us, but I give more credit to 
our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was defined by turnovers. Both teams had plenty of giveaways; Orange 
Lutheran lost two of three fumbles and was intercepted twice, and the Stars 
were picked off three times while losing two of five fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars had the toughest defense the Lancers have faced this year, as the 
Olympic League co-champions were limited to 239 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' Joe Juliano was responsible for 170 yards, with 88 yards passing 
and 82 yards rushing. He also had Lutheran's biggest play of the season; on the 
Lancers' first overtime possession, Juliano swept around right end for 10 yards 
and a touchdown -- the same play he ran for 39 yards and a score three weeks 
ago against Valley Christian. Matt Stratton kicked what turned out to be the 
crucial extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted it more," said Juliano, who admitted being frustrated by the Stars' 
defense. "They have the best defense I've seen -- and felt." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was the Stars' turn in overtime, tailback Danny Pulu scored on a 
five-yard run. Mary Star went for the two-point conversion, but quarterback 
Anthony DiLeva was stopped at the one-yard line by Lancer tackle Nick Griffith, 
who had blitzed on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question we would go for the win," Stars Coach Dino Andrie said. 
"I don't play for ties." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Stars brought lots of muscle and were content to beat up Orange 
Lutheran up and down the field, Andrie worried whether his defense would be 
able to handle the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very explosive and very hard to prepare for in just one week," 
Andrie said. "We had to make our adjustments, play old-fashioned football and 
hit them. Their option was my biggest concern; we couldn't afford to give them 
anything cheap. We didn't expect to shut them out, but we had to make them work 
for everything they got." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' defense limped into the game. Linebacker and captain Chris Amato 
suffered a season-ending ankle injury last week and noseguard Jake Anderson was 
nursing a separated shoulder. There was so much shifting around Kunau 
half-jokingly suggested Juliano might see time at free safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Both defenses were tested early, but the first half was scoreless because each 
team was stifled by mistakes.

DANE READJUSTS AFTER BASKETBALL IN BELGIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelly Dane of St. Margaret's High is American, but she is having a little 
difficulty readjusting to life in the United States. After living in Belgium 
for nine years, Dane returned to the States last year and is suffering from 
culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange to be back," Dane said. "School is the same everywhere, there 
are cliques and everyone is trying to follow their niche. So I'm still having a 
tough time getting back into things." 
</P>
<P>
 Dane, a 5-foot-10 forward, is off to a fast start on the court, scoring 14 
points and grabbing 11 rebounds in St. Margaret's opening victory over Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Connecticut and raised in Chicago until she was 7, Dane, now 17, moved 
to Belgium with her family when her father was sent there for work. The family 
didn't return to the United States until August, 1993, when the Danes moved to 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult to leave Belgium," Dane said. "But a lot of the people were 
there because their parents were working, so friends were always coming in and 
out of my life. I had a lot of constant friends and was always meeting new 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first few days of school back here I came home upset, because in one day I 
had met almost everyone in the school." 
</P>
<P>
 From the second grade through the end of her sophomore year, Dane attended the 
International School of Brussels, where she was introduced to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Dane, who had never played organized basketball, met Coach Ron Parham when she 
was a freshman, and he decided to give her a chance with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing two years in Brussels and one season so far in California, Dane 
believes the game was more demanding in Belgium. Parham conducted intense 
workouts and had the players learn college-sized playbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think many high school teams here have playbooks. We had a huge 
playbook; it was unbelievable," Dane said. "And if someone didn't know one of 
the plays, the whole team had to run." 
</P>
<P>
 The workouts consisted of weight training three days a week, with each player 
having a personal program. That was followed by 30 minutes of conditioning and 
then a regular practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to match up against some big girls. I mean big, with a lot of meat," 
Dane said. "Most of the games were against military schools and these girls 
were good." 
</P>
<P>
 The team played schools from all over Europe, traveling five to six hours for 
games. The team would play on Friday nights and Saturday mornings, with the 
girls staying in the homes of opposing players or in the barracks on military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really neat. You got to spend a lot more time with your teammates," 
Dane said. "We were like a family. Here, it is just short bus trips and quick 
meals. It is sad we don't have more time together. After one game we came back 
and had a huge water-balloon fight. It was a blast. It was things like that 
that brought our team closer together."

 The Moorpark College women's soccer team will play in the state final four 
tournament this weekend at Cosumnes River College in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (11-3-3) face De Anza College (16-1-1) in today's 2 p.m. 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 De Anza, the defending state champion, is the No. 1 team from the Coast 
Conference. Moorpark finished second in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark is led by forward Vanessa Macen, who has scored 12 goals, defender 
Summer Salvatera and midfielder Heather Heit. All were named to the 
all-conference team. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark goalkeeper Amy Fisher has 73 saves and six shutouts. Backup goalie 
Shannon Henry has 36 saves and four shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any one top player," Moorpark Coach Ken Dale said. "The big key 
with this team has been sticking together through thick and thin." 
</P>
<P>
 WSC champion Bakersfield (13-4-1) plays Santa Rosa (14-2-1), winner of the Bay 
Valley Conference, in the other semifinal today at 11.

BISHOP AMAT'S MCCUTCHEON TOO MUCH FOR TRABUCO HILLS; DIVISION I FOOTBALL: 
HIGHLY TOUTED BACK RUSHES FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS AND RETURNS INTERCEPTION FOR 
SCORE IN 49-22 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Chad Collins walked off the field in the aftermath of Trabuco Hills' loss 
to La Puente Bishop Amat, he recounted the importance of the final high school 
game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 In a week in which everyone talked about the other Division I semifinal -- 
even some of his teammates -- Collins spoke of the good fortune of playing the 
team ranked No. 1 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is the biggest game of my life," Collins said. "To me, this was 
the (Southern Section) championship. This is the game we had to win." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. Bishop Amat beat Trabuco Hills, 49-22, at Orange Coast College, 
even though the Mustangs scrapped right down to the end, when they attempted an 
onside kick with nine seconds left, looking for a few more meaningless points. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat (13-0), seeded No. 1 in the tournament, will play Mater Dei next 
Saturday at 7:40 p.m. in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (10-3), unseeded and not even expected to get past the first 
round, came up short in its attempt to win a Division I title following last 
year's Division VIII championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good little football team," Trabuco Hills Coach Jim Barnett said, 
"and we got beat by a good, big football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins played a pivotal role in the contest. He completed 18 of 28 passes for 
248 yards and two touchdowns, but it was his two first-quarter interceptions 
that really hurt; both were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Those, coupled with Daylon McCutcheon's three rushing touchdowns, put an end 
to Trabuco's championship hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first interception was a short pass from Collins intended for Ben Triman, 
but McCutcheon stepped in front of it and returned it 14 yards for a touchdown. 
It was McCutcheon's second such score in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Collins came right back in the next series, pulling Trabuco Hills to 7-6, 
by completing six of seven passes for 58 of the drive's 66 yards. After his 
two-yard touchdown pass to Bobby Johnson, who was called for a celebration 
penalty, Mike Junge's point-after was blocked. It was as close as the Mustangs 
got all night. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon completed a four-play, 53-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run 
on Bishop Amat's next series. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Trabuco's next play, Ramogi Huma stepped in front of another short pass 
and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown; it was Bishop Amat's fifth 
interception return for a touchdown in three playoff games. The third of Ariel 
Castro's seven point-afters made it 21-6, and McCutcheon's 28-yard score capped 
a 75-yard touchdown drive with just over six minutes left in the half, making 
the score 28-6. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon, whose four touchdowns gave him 31 on the season, added a 50-yard 
scoring run with 6:04 left in the game to make it 42-14. He finished with 17 
carries for 131 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat added to its halftime lead on the third play of the third quarter 
on a 56-yard pass play to make it 35-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills mounted a late rally, scoring with 31 seconds left in the third 
quarter when Collins hit Johnson for a 19-yard touchdown pass. The two-point 
conversion was successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs closed the scoring with nine seconds left when Collins tossed a 
long lateral to J.C. Pintsak, who threw 20 yards to Laquent Fobbs for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Collins wasn't lamenting the failure to get to the championship 
game against Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather go out this way," he said, "to the team ranked No. 1 in the 
nation."

FENWICK HOPES FOR A LAUGHER; FOOTBALL: AFTER WILD FINISH IN 1993 GAME, VALLEY 
COACH WANTS EASIER TIME IN ORANGE COUNTY BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, Valley College football Coach Jim Fenwick would prefer his team 
didn't wait until the last few seconds to win a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (9-1) will face Rancho Santiago (9-1) in the Orange County Bowl 
at Orange Coast College today at 1:30 p.m. It will be the second consecutive 
bowl game for Valley, which defeated Moorpark, 21-19, in last year's Western 
State Bowl at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 In that one, the Monarchs rallied in the fourth quarter with three touchdown 
passes from Sean Fitzgerald to Brian Comer, the last one a 16-yarder with three 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes the game fun and exciting," Fenwick said. "But it was 
nerve-racking." 
</P>
<P>
 Comer, who this season has 71 receptions and became the school's career leader 
with 129, will try to create havoc in the Rancho Santiago secondary much like 
he did against Moorpark. And quarterback Jim Arellanes will be more than happy 
to accommodate him. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have been Valley's primary weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, a transfer from Northern Arizona, was the offensive co-player of 
the year in the Western State Conference South Division after passing for 3,483 
yards -- a Valley single-season and career record -- and 25 touchdowns. He also 
set a state single-game passing record with 639 yards in a 51-37 loss to 
Bakersfield on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 With Arellanes directing the offense, Valley is averaging 475.2 yards, 15 
yards more per game than the school single-season record of 460.2 yards 
established in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 He can throw over, under and around all kinds of coverage, which should keep 
the Rancho Santiago defense puffing. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Rancho Santiago registered 43 sacks this season but the Dons, ranked 
fourth in the state, are allowing 235.6 yards passing per game. Coach Dave Ogas 
is resorting to the worn but still popular "we can only hope to contain them" 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we are going to stop them but we have to try to slow them 
down," Ogas said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been able to halt Rancho Santiago for a while. The Dons, who are 
making their first bowl appearance since 1989, have not lost since a 55-28 
setback to El Camino in the season-opener.  
</P>
<P>
 They won the Mission Conference Central Division behind a balanced attack 
(2,364 yards passing, 1,886 yards rushing) led by quarterback Simon Fuentes, 
the division offensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons are difficult to defend because of their versatility, Fenwick said. 
The Monarchs, ranked ninth in California, must pressure Fuentes if they expect 
to win the first game ever between the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is their catalyst," Fenwick said. "He executes that offense very well."

 Fuentes, a 5-foot-10 sophomore, passed for 1,755 yards and a school 
single-season record 19 touchdowns, and had a 66.7% completion rate (110 of 
165). He has thrown only four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dons choose to run, however, they rely on Ernest Wilson (786 yards in 
133 carries and 12 touchdowns). 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Ogas figures the Dons will be able to score and so will the 
Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'll be a high-scoring game," he said. "It'll be entertaining for 
the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 And also for Fenwick, as long as it doesn't come down to a last-second 
desperation pass.

MOORPARK LOOKING FOR LUCK; FOOTBALL: RAIDERS HOPE TO END TWO-GAME LOSING STREAK 
IN POSTSEASON PLAY IN STRAWBERRY BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the seventh consecutive year, the Moorpark College football team will 
appear in a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders could use a little of that lucky seven stuff right about now. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have been one of the most successful teams in the state the past 
several years, the Raiders have not played well in bowl games. They have lost 
their last two and four of six. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders (8-2) hope to change that when they meet Cerritos (7-3) in the 
Strawberry Bowl tonight at 7:15 at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, the first between the schools, will pit teams with slightly 
different offensive make-ups and solid defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, the Western State Conference North Division champion for the third 
consecutive season, depends a bit more on the pass. Cerritos, which finished 
fourth in the Mission Conference North Division, prefers to attack mostly on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looks like we match up with them pretty well defensively," said Coach Jim 
Bittner, who will be going for his 103rd victory with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't throw the ball on every down. . . . Our major problem defensively 
has been with teams with spread-out passing games." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, ranked 10th in California, is allowing 280.7 yards a game and is 
virtually impenetrable on the ground (80.1 yards allowed a game). 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't make Cerritos Coach Frank Mazzotta sleep comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons, ranked 19th, use a one-back offense with either freshman Corey 
Kelley or sophomore Charles Ephriam. Kelley has rushed for 1,007 yards and 11 
touchdowns. He is the sixth Cerritos player to rush for 1,000 or more yards in 
a season. Ephriam has rushed for 706 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been able to throw the ball consistently," Mazzotta said. "We'll 
have to throw the ball a little just to keep them (Moorpark defenders) off our 
backs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, on the other hand, definitely will throw.  
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Damian Delfino passed for a team single-season record 1,764 yards 
and 11 touchdowns to help the Raiders stay afloat after season-ending injuries 
depleted their running game, forcing Moorpark to pass more often. 
</P>
<P>
 His primary target has been wide receiver Isaiah Mustafa, who has a school 
single-season record 66 receptions and 1,086 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to stop the wideout (Mustafa)," Mazzotta said. "He's their premier 
guy but we have to be careful of their running game. . . . I've been impressed 
with how they run the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzotta said the Falcons will be without starting tackle Matt Nichols (6 feet 
5, 260 pounds) and starting free safety Ramsey Alexander.  
</P>
<P>
 Both were lost for the season because of torn knee ligaments in a 24-20 
victory over San Diego Mesa on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are kind of licking our wounds," Mazzotta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bittner, however, is the wrong guy to ask for sympathy.  
</P>
<P>
 He lost two starting running backs -- Cory Bowen and Kris Kirksey -- to 
injuries early in the season. Gary Clemons, who had rushed for 521 yards, 
suffered a season-ending broken foot last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders now rely on freshmen Reginald Wilkes (320 yards in 88 carries) and 
James DeCarriere (114 yards in 32 carries), and Bittner says they figure 
prominently in his plans today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to establish enough of a running game," Bittner said. "Then their 
safeties have to be concerned with the run and they can get hurt deep."

NBA ROUNDUP; O'NEAL, HARDAWAY LEAD MAGIC IN CHALLENGE TO KNICK THRONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Magic talked of one victory and one Friday night in Orlando, Fla., not a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's way too early to call us No. 1 in the East," Shaquille O'Neal said after 
he scored 38 points and Anfernee Hardaway had 33 to pace a 125-100 rout of 
conference champion New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando has won nine games in a row, a franchise record, including lopsided 
victories in the last 10 days over both clubs that reached the NBA finals last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one game, and all that game did was tie the season series," O'Neal 
said. "We have to take the way we are playing now and continue it to keep our 
winning streak going." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal and Hardaway were so effective that with one minute to play in the 
third quarter, New York had 68 points and they had 64. Both players sat out 
much of the fourth quarter, while reserves finished the rout. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing paced the Knicks, who never led, with 15 points and John Starks 
had 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 115, Detroit 104 -- The Bullets won their first game with Chris 
Webber in the lineup, getting 18 points and nine rebounds from him after he had 
guaranteed a victory on "The Late Show With David Letterman" on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Duckworth had 18 points and 10 rebounds for Washington, which rallied 
from a 15-point deficit to win for the first time in 20 days. Calbert Cheaney 
scored 19, and Rex Chapman and Don MacLean each had 17. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 95, Portland 91 -- David Robinson scored 32 points and Sean 
Elliott a season-high 31 as the Spurs won on the road for only the second time 
in six tries. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio scored the final four points of the game after the Trail Blazers 
scored five in a row to tie the score, 91-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 92, Chicago 81 -- Stacey Augmon scored 20 points in winning at 
Chicago, where the Bulls got only nine points from Scottie Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 107, Boston 102 -- Sun Coach Paul Westphal got his point across, 
leaving Danny Manning, Charles Barkley and Dan Majerle on the bench at the 
start to think about their defensive problems, then brought them in to overcome 
a 22-point second-quarter deficit and deal with a sensational second half by 
Dominique Wilkins at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins scored 22 of his 34 points in the second half and his last basket gave 
the Celtics a 100-97 lead, but Phoenix scored the next 10 points to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerle led the Suns with 21 points, Manning had 19 and Barkley 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 99, Sacramento 96 -- Willie Burton had 25 points and Clarence 
Weatherspoon scored 12 of his 18 points in the final quarter for the 76ers at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 115, New Jersey 97 -- Glen Rice matched his season high with 34 points 
and Kevin Willis scored a season-high 31, boosting the Heat at Miami.

MATER DEI JUST KEPT BELIEVING; MONARCHS: COMEBACKS LAST SEASON HAD PLAYERS 
CERTAIN THEY COULD DO IT AGAIN AGAINST LOS ALAMITOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei lineman Matt Motherway was convinced. Quarterback John Flynn never 
flinched. Fullback Joey Trampush kept the faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced God wanted us to play a dramatic game," Trampush said. "I just 
knew we would win. You couldn't ask for a better finish." 
</P>
<P>
 There were so many things that went wrong for Mater Dei, and to pull one out 
after trailing by 10 points with less than five minutes remaining, well, the 
Monarchs were convinced there was some divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Mater Dei had four turnovers, two in the fourth quarter. With the 
Monarchs trailing, 24-14, running back Steve Bodnar, who rushed for 178 yards, 
fumbled at the Los Alamitos eight with 10 minutes 11 seconds remaining, and 
Griffin free safety Brad Melsby recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 After a defensive stand, the Monarchs took over with 5:50 left. Then Trampush 
ran over and through the Griffins for 72 yards, only to have the ball stripped 
by Los Alamitos' Damon Houston, and Tom Carbajal recovered at the one for the 
Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
 Did anyone waver? 
</P>
<P>
 "We just stayed positive on offense," Motherway said. "We had worked too hard 
all season to let this one slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told ourselves that we could come from behind. We did it three times last 
season including one in the playoffs. Some started calling us the comeback kids 
last season . . . we kept on believing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar made the dream more believable, scoring on a two-yard run with 3:44 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Monarchs recovered an on-side kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos linebacker Mike Kahn tried to single-handedly stop the Monarchs, 
making three tackles on Bodnar in the final two minutes. The last one left the 
Monarchs with a third and nine at the Los Alamitos 11 with 50 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout, Flynn flipped a middle-screen pass to Casey Rouintree, and he 
rambled 11-yards through a tackle by Carbajal for a touchdown, and the Monarch 
fans were in, well . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was sweet redemption for Flynn, who completed seven of 15 passes for only 
82 yards. And two interceptions were turned into 14 points by the Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
 Fate was also kind to David Castleton. Early in the third quarter, he beat 
Carbajal on a post pattern, and Flynn delivered the ball right on the money. It 
could have been a 57-yard touchdown, but it slipped through Castleton's 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 But he got a second chance, and he didn't let it go after the Monarchs took a 
28-24 lead. With the Griffins hoping for a miracle and only 12 seconds 
remaining, Castleton intercepted Kevin Feterik's high pass, intended for Tony 
Hartley, and the Monarchs had earned a return trip to Anaheim Stadium next 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 So, did Monarch Coach Bruce Rollinson ever worry? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never doubted our team," Rollinson said. "We were always staying positive." 
</P>
<P>
 So the turnovers never even had the Monarchs sweating? 
</P>
<P>
 "This week, the one thing we didn't even talk about in practice: turnovers," 
Rollinson said. "That's a negative thing. It was never even mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn had only one other thing to mention about the Monarchs' comeback 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew about how good Los Al was and their 47-game unbeaten streak," Flynn 
said. "I guess we made a little history."

EL TORO LOOKING FOR RETURN TO GLORY; DIVISION V: VICTORY OVER SERVITE TONIGHT 
WOULD GIVE CHARGERS' THEIR FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP GAME BERTH SINCE 1989. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The resurrection of El Toro High football did not begin three weeks ago with 
the coin flip with Irvine that put the Chargers into the Southern Section 
playoffs, ending a three-year absence from postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the coin flip was the luck. The sweat began in the summer for the seniors 
who had listened for three years about El Toro's storied past, which includes 
three Southern Section championships and five league titles in the 1980s. How 
names like Bret and Rob Johnson, Steve Stenstrom, David Willes, Scott Miller, 
Shane Brisbin, Mike Gonzales, Steve and Dan Trickett had filled stadiums and 
provided more thrills than a free year at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 It's some legacy to live up to. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 7-4-1 Chargers have a chance do some image dusting. They may have been 
a third-place team in the Sea View League, but victories against Loara and 
Savanna leave El Toro one game shy of a berth in the Division V championship. 
It would be the Chargers' first title game since losing a 1989 Division III 
matchup to Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocking their view is 10-2 Servite, which plays El Toro tonight at Trabuco 
Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until this year I had been frustrated because growing up I had come to El 
Toro games and they were always in the playoffs," said James Lee, a senior 
All-South Coast League cornerback. "And for a while it looked like our class 
would not go." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Brian Wilson had similar feelings. "We were one game from the 
playoffs last year and felt we should have been there. This feels like the end 
of a drought." 
</P>
<P>
 But what led to El Toro's descent? 
</P>
<P>
 Some contend the building of Trabuco Hills High, which opened in 1985, 
siphoned off a big chunk of talent from El Toro, which opened in 1973. If so, 
the drain was not felt until 1991. In that season and the next two, the 
Chargers were a combined 9-18-1, and in 1992 suffered through an 0-5 league 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive coordinator and assistant coach Mark Flippin cites the cyclic nature 
of high school sports and the loss of two key players who might have gotten El 
Toro into the playoffs last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the season stated we lost linebacker Taylor Swallow because of a 
degenerative neck injury," Flippin said, "and then receiver Jeff Juliano blew 
out a knee in the first game. You just don't go out and immediately replace 
their caliber of player." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Coach Mike Milner, in his fourth year at El Toro, says the current 
group of seniors might have needed four years of growing to reach this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any school goes up and down," Milner said. "You can look at El Toro's 
tradition, the three teams who won championships; you can look at how it 
started, like any school having to learn to make the playoffs before they can 
win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Rob Johnson and the boys graduated in 1990, El Toro went through a new 
coach -- me -- and transition, not playing with the same people. Now, 
fortunately thanks to a bunch of hard working kids, we're back." 
</P>
<P>
 These seniors hold a special place in Milner's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very strongly about our senior class because emotionally I'm very 
attached to them," Milner said. "They're the ones I started with, and they've 
gotten through some hard times by their work ethic. We got a little better each 
year, and now we're at the point where we're in the playoffs. We've experienced 
some success and now they feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't the only ones working out. Junior running back Jamie Hanaway, 
after an intense weightlifting program, became El Toro's big-play guy, pounding 
out 1,040 rushing yards and eight touchdowns. "He's a physical runner," Milner 
said. "Not a breakaway back in terms of description, although he does have some 
long runs, but a slasher with good vision. And he's the type of guy you count 
on in a crucial yardage situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanaway took some of the load off Wilson, a 17-year-old senior, and he 
responded with 1,713 yards passing and 14 touchdowns (with 13 interceptions). 
Merle Sango has caught 48 of those passes for 586 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 They are part of the attack El Toro will use to challenge Servite, which has 
shut out three consecutive opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever happens tonight, the Chargers are rejuvenated. And the future 
looks bright; this season's junior varsity team was unbeaten in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens I can leave here satisfied," Wilson said. "At least we 
got things started back. Maybe we've given the younger guys reasons to be 
believers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good," said Lee, "to be the class who started the cycle over again." 
EL TORO VS. SERVITE 
</P>
<P>
 Featured Game 
</P>
<P>
 When: 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: El Toro (7-4-1); Servite (10-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Rankings: El Toro is unseeded, Servite is third-seeded in Division V. 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy: Should the Friars prevail, Servite will play for its first 
Southern Section title since 1983, and fourth in school history.

SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' TENNIS INDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONSHIPS; RIGHT ZONE ELUDES 
WACHTLER, SCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After "zoning" in the Southern Section individual doubles semifinals, Corona 
del Mar's Megan Wachtler and Alissa Scott looked to be in another time zone for 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 They split the first six games against Santa Barbara's Pilar Montgomery and 
Sarita Yardi, then lost the next nine and the match, 6-3, 6-0, Friday at the 
Lindborg Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really psyched up for the first match," Wachtler said. "We zoned. In 
the finals, we got off to a slow start and never got into it mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-seeded Wachtler and Scott upset Calabasas' top-seeded team of Shera 
Wiegler and Deborah Pepkowitz, 6-2, 6-2, in a 50-minute semifinal match that 
featured near-perfect performances from Wachtler and Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 But after more than an hour delay between matches, Wachtler came out and 
immediately had her serve broken against the third-seeded Montgomery and Yardi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of forgot we had to play another match," Wachtler said. "It got more 
frustrating, the more we tried." 
</P>
<P>
 They tried getting the ball past Yardi, a 5-foot freshman dynamo, but she 
covered the court more like a 6-footer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was zoning," Scott said. "We tried everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Yardi was nonchalant about her performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was playing well," she said. "I was relaxed for this match. I 
figured we were already in the finals. We get a trophy either way." 
</P>
<P>
 In the singles final, junior Amanda Basica became the third consecutive Palos 
Verdes Peninsula player to win the singles title by soundly defeating Santa 
Barbara San Marcos junior Kara Warkentin, 6-2, 6-2. Basica, the tournament's 
top-seeded player, reached the final as a freshman and did not play last year.

TUSTIN DEFENSE MANN-HANDLES PREP STANDOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley point guard Olujimi Mann never got into the flow. And, except 
for a few brief moments, his second-ranked team never got into the game against 
third-ranked Tustin -- losing 64-52 Friday night before a full house at Santa 
Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, in foul trouble much of the way, had trouble with Tustin's trapping 
defense and scored just six points on three of seven shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited too long to take my shots," he said. "I tried to get the other 
players into the game. It's cool to be a team player, but sometimes you have to 
take over a game. I didn't shoot enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin point guard Doug Gottlieb didn't shoot much either, but he maximized 
his shots -- scoring 15 points on five of eight shooting -- and he got his 
teammates involved with 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I passed up a lot of shots early because I wanted to get everybody going and 
run the offense," he said. "I didn't care how many points I scored." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin center David Lalazarian took advantage of Gottlieb's unselfishness to 
score 24 points, many off nifty Gottlieb passes. He also grabbed 12 rebounds 
and blocked four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "David didn't have a good first game," Gottlieb said. "We wanted to get him 
the ball early to get his confidence up. He was a man tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley (1-1) fell behind, 15-7, in the first quarter, but tied it at 
29 by halftime behind the three-point shooting of Michael Riggins (16 points). 
But Tustin scored 11 of the first 13 points of the third quarter and was never 
threatened after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ike Harmon, Valley's other big threat, scored 12 points but had a tough time 
staying with Lalazarian inside. Harmon had only six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gottlieb said shutting down Mann was the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luge is the best player I've seen -- a 6-5 point guard," Gottlieb said. "We 
centered our defense around stopping him."

SALVADORANS FEAR DEPORTATIONS; FUTURE UNCERTAIN FOR REFUGEES AFTER FEDERAL 
DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL and H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The future took an uncertain turn Friday for Elena Subialdea and other 
Salvadoran expatriates in Orange County, when U.S. immigration officials 
announced the lifting of special deferments from deportation for El Salvador 
nationals at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others who heard the news from a radio broadcast or friend, Subialdea 
reacted with shock and confusion. The 25-year-old warehouse worker, who 
recently wed her Salvadoran fiance, wondered aloud, "They can't deport all of 
us who are here, can they?" 
</P>
<P>
 The same question was being asked at the El Carbonero restaurant on South Main 
Street, a popular dining place with Salvadorans, where Subialdea had gone to 
meet her cousin for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. government says that democracy has returned to El Salvador and there 
is no more repression. But there is nothing there for us. There are no jobs and 
there is no money. The country is still in very poor shape," Subialdea said. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as 20% of El Salvador's population fled the country in the 1980s to 
the United States, Mexico and Canada, escaping a brutal civil war between a 
U.S.-backed right-wing government and a coalition of leftist guerrillas. 
Atrocities were committed by both sides against civilians, who were often 
caught in the crossfire of the warring sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadorans immigrated to the United States by the tens of thousands, entering 
the country both legally and illegally. The Immigration Act of 1990 gave 
Temporary Protected Status to Salvadoran expatriates through June 30, 1992, 
deferring them from deportation. That deadline was extended twice. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, INS officials said the deferments against deportation will be 
allowed to expire at the end of the month, declaring that the political 
situation has stabilized in El Salvador and human rights violations are no 
longer a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials said that mass deportations are not imminent, but also conceded 
that there probably will not be a mass exodus of voluntary departures. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Macias, co-owner of El Pupusodromo, another Salvadoran restaurant in 
Santa Ana, said he was not surprised by the INS announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (U.S.) government has declared El Salvador to be safe and there is 
nothing to fear. They accepted us temporarily, but now say it's time for us to 
return," Macias said. "It's sad, because for many people there is nothing to 
return to." 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo Barrera, who arrived in Orange County from El Salvador in 1985 and has 
had three children born here, was reeling from the INS announcement. Barrera, a 
truck driver, worried about having to move his family to El Salvador, "where my 
children have never lived and nothing awaits them but poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 "My two older kids hardly speak Spanish at all. How can you punish them 
because their parents came here to find a better life," Barrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Pena, who owns El Pupusodromo with Macias, said the INS decision was 
probably made easier by the current anti-immigrant mood of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in California and the rest of the country have made it clear they 
don't want immigrants here," Pena said. "They're doing this (lifting of 
deferments) to scare people into returning to El Salvador. But how can you 
change something that's been allowed for so many years?" 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty among expatriates is most intense in Greater Los Angeles, home to 
the nation's largest Salvadoran community, numbering perhaps 500,000. Many now 
fear forced repatriations -- though experts say that is extremely unlikely and 
officials went out of their way Friday to allay such concerns, stressing the 
gradual nature of any change. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no immediate, large-scale deportations," Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner told a Washington news 
conference Friday. "We don't expect anything to happen abruptly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, while allowing Salvadorans' status to lapse Dec. 31, the 
Administration also agreed to extend work permits of affected Salvadorans for 
nine months. That provides a cushion until Sept. 30 for those currently 
possessing working papers. And other legal protections are likely to extend for 
years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 In the already tense, post-Proposition 187 climate of California, however, 
Salvadorans who learned to be wary of officialdom back home were not dismissing 
the possibility that there one day could be large-scale roundups and 
deportations. Most arrived here as illegal immigrants by crossing the 
U.S.-Mexico border, many after leaving their homeland under threat and dodging 
police and immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, few relish the prospect of reverting to the shadow life of the 
undocumented, particularly with the increasing difficulty of finding work 
without papers. But even fewer seem willing to return to a nation still reeling 
economically, socially and politically from the after-effects of a long civil 
war that many believe was prolonged by massive U.S. aid to the Salvadoran 
government -- assistance prompted by Cold War geopolitical concerns that seem 
distant today. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Salvadorans in the United States, experts say, will probably file 
political asylum claims. Despite the Dec. 31 deadline, hard-won legal 
protections will continue to shield affected Salvadorans. 
</P>
<P>
 All those whose status expires later this month are eligible for special 
consideration when filing asylum claims under the terms of the 1990 settlement 
of a landmark court case alleging that U.S. officials discriminated against 
asylum-seekers from U.S.-supported regimes in El Salvador and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, social service organizations working with Salvadorans and other 
immigrants are gearing up for a deluge of new asylum applications from those 
whose status is due to lapse. While it is difficult to win political asylum 
under U.S. law -- fewer than one in 10 Salvadorans were granted asylum even 
while the civil war was raging -- activists say it is crucial that Salvadorans 
file in order to prolong the process and possibly gain permanent residence 
status at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're trying to win time," acknowledged Juan Carlos Cristales, who 
is coordinating asylum applications at El Rescate, taking statements from 
scores of applicants about their fears of returning home.

Washington contributed to this report.

POLICE ARRIVE TOO LATE TO PREVENT FATAL CRASH; TRAFFIC: MOTORCYCLIST HITS A 
STALLED CAR IN THE 20 MINUTES OFFICERS TOOK TO RESPOND TO THE FIRST 911 CALL. 
COPS DEFEND THEIR ACTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Witnesses to a fatal traffic accident said Friday that repeated emergency 
calls over 20 minutes about a stalled car in traffic failed to bring police in 
time to prevent a motorcyclist from slamming into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one minutes after the first emergency call was logged Thursday 
afternoon about a car sitting on MacArthur Boulevard and Newport Coast Drive, a 
police officer arrived to find that William R. Kral of Newport Beach had 
crashed into it, said Sgt. Dwight Henninger of the Irvine Police Department. 
Authorities received at least four emergency calls about the stalled car during 
that 20 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kral, 25, died later at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were jumping out of our clothes trying to find out where they (police) 
were," said Sonia O'Bryan, 29, who made two 911 calls from her car phone at the 
scene, and witnessed the fatal collision. "I remember thinking this is 
ridiculous. It's not like we live in the boonies." 
</P>
<P>
 But police defended their response time, saying it was well within 
departmental goals. A stalled vehicle receives one of the lowest priorities, 
according to department guidelines. The recommended response time is 60 minutes 
or less, Henninger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police were first notified by Newport Beach police about the stalled 
car at 1:17 p.m., Henninger said. An Irvine dispatcher called a traffic unit to 
the scene at 1:18 p.m., and exactly 20 minutes later the officer arrived, 
Henninger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely unfortunate what happened," Henninger said. "But I don't feel 
I need to be making excuses for us getting there within 20 minutes. People need 
to drive carefully when there's a stalled car and be responsible for their own 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Henninger also said several callers misidentified the actual site of the 
stalled car, telling dispatchers it was at MacArthur Boulevard and the Corona 
del Mar Freeway. The responding officer went there first, Henninger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Kral's accident, at least three minor accidents were caused by the 
stalled vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Smith, who passed the chaotic scene, also placed an emergency call from 
her car phone to authorities before the deadly crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very explicit," said Smith, 35, of Villa Park. "I said you've got to 
get someone out here or someone is going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Kral's helmet apparently was not strapped on.

CREMATION CLASS-ACTION SETTLED FOR $16 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim crematorium and several local mortuaries and funeral societies will 
pay more than $16 million under an agreement approved Friday to settle a 
class-action lawsuit that alleged mishandling of cremations, including the 
commingling of remains and the removal of dental gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, which ends a hotly contested case, will be shared among some 
15,000 relatives of people who were cremated at Cremar Crematorium between 1981 
and 1991 through several area mortuaries and funeral societies. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, about $6 million, or 38% of the amount, will go to 
compensate a team of attorneys that spent about 25,000 hours representing the 
relatives, meaning each claimant will receive $600 to $700, according to court 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the crematorium and other defendants said the settlement is not 
an admission of guilt or wrongdoing, but avoids many more years of costly court 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "To continue this litigation would have cost millions of dollars for my 
client," said Anthony R. Delling, who represented Sentinel Cremation Societies 
Inc., which bought Cremar in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we don't think anything improper happened, you never know what a 
jury will decide," he continued. "In any case, no matter how strong, there is 
always risk of losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Delling said his client will pay $15 million of the settlement, about 95% of 
that amount coming from insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald E. Smallwood, who approved the 
settlement after listening to sometimes tearful testimony from relatives, 
called the agreement "fair, reasonable and adequate" and said he hopes it helps 
bring "emotional closure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Grieving is a very difficult process," the judge said. "I would suggest by 
ending the litigation, we can begin the end of the grieving process." 
</P>
<P>
 Smallwood estimated a trial in the 4-year-old case could have lasted 300 to 
400 days, not to mention three to four more years for an almost certain appeal 
no matter what a jury might decide. He said the settlement represents the 
amount of insurance available, coverage that may have been jeopardized had the 
case gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 William A. Kershaw, the lead attorney for the relatives, said he hopes the 
group will come away from the painful experience with some satisfaction that 
their combined efforts helped spark reform in the funeral industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Kershaw pointed to a state Assembly bill, effective in March, that included 
such changes as requiring yearly unannounced inspections of crematory 
facilities and making it a felony to misappropriate dental gold, silver or 
jewelry. Other changes require that corpses be refrigerated before cremation, 
that more training be provided for crematorium workers and that excess cremated 
remains be put into an additional urn at no additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the defendants said they also welcomed the new laws. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 relatives filled the courtroom for the settlement hearing Friday, 
many testifying about nightmares they still have about what may have happened 
to the remains of their loved ones. While the relatives said no amount of money 
could compensate their anguish, they said they were grateful for the new laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I know when I have to deal with this again, I know everything will 
be handled properly," said Donna Griffith, whose involvement in the suit came 
through her father's cremation. 
</P>
<P>
 The class-action lawsuit was filed in 1991 by eight people who alleged that 
bodies of family members were treated improperly before cremation and that 
remains mixed with others afterward. The relatives also charged that gold 
fillings were taken and sold and bodies were subjected to "rough treatment" as 
they were "rushed through the cremation process."  
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 28,000 cremations took place at Cremar over the 10-year period, 
and about 15,000 of some 28,000 eligible relatives opted to join the action, 
Kershaw said. The judge set a Jan. 10, 1995, deadline for the eligible 
relatives to file a claim for a share of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants in the settlement approved Friday include Cremar Inc., Telophase 
Society of America, Sentinel Cremation Societies Inc., Tustin Mortuary Inc. and 
Sheffer Mortuary Inc.

STOP OR I'LL . . . BUNNY HOP!; BICYCLE COPS LEARN CURB JUMPING, OTHER TRICKS AT 
2-DAY RIDING SEMINAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Championship BMX bicycle rider Brian Lopes has given clinics before, but never 
to an audience that was packing heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As bicycle cops from throughout Southern California watched his every move 
Friday, Lopes made his stunt bicycle jump and spin through a series of tricks 
that may someday help police catch bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll show you how to bunny hop (over a curb) and take off," he told the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd never chase you," replied one officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah, we'd just shoot," another said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 During a two-day seminar that ended Friday, more than 70 police officers took 
advantage of lectures and demonstrations in what may have been the first 
symposium for police bicycle units in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was sponsored by the Orange County Sheriff's Department and the 
deputies who patrol Lake Forest in conjunction with Shimano American Corp., a 
bicycle parts manufacturer in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to get bicycles into law enforcement for years," said 
Westminster Police Sgt. Bob Amren, looking over several rows of shorts-clad 
officers on wheels. "Look at all these guys here. It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The bike cops pored over new products and learned new riding tricks. But most 
important, they shared information among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about effectiveness," said Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Duane 
Turner, one of the event's main organizers. "Sharing what we know makes us more 
effective at doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the officers were from Orange County cities, but others came from as 
far away as San Bernardino, Riverside and Pomona to learn more about law 
enforcement on two wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Amren and Turner, they were loud and enthusiastic and completely sold on 
the value of bicycle patrol units. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost (for a patrol bike) is virtually nothing, yet there's nothing we 
can't do short of a high-speed pursuit," said Turner, who works in Lake Forest. 
"Yet, we're the best community relations program going. It's like having a 
mobile foot beat." 
</P>
<P>
 National champion road cyclist Wayne Stetina, who participated in both days in 
the lectures and demonstrations, said the officers "loved this program. They 
came up afterward and had all kinds of questions."  
</P>
<P>
 Many police departments already have some specialized training for their bike 
units. Amren, for instance, is a certified instructor in law enforcement 
bicycle training. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was still much to be learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say about half of what we saw out there today is new," Amren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bike cops also learned new techniques for power sliding -- a method that 
allows cyclists to brake and skid into a U-turn at high speeds. Lopes showed 
officers how it could be done without getting off the bike by shifting weight 
at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tricks included "bunny hopping" -- jumping completely over a curb 
instead of lifting just one wheel over the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 But as one officer pointed out, when Lopes hops down a flight of stairs, it's 
a trick. For police bike units, it's part of law enforcement tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of this stuff will go a long ways in helping us do our jobs," Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amren, who once pulled over a drunk driver while on bike patrol, said his bike 
unit has never failed to catch a suspect once pursuit has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started chasing these gang members and they just stopped in the middle of 
the boulevard and sat down," he said. "We asked them why and they said, 'No way 
we're going to outrun those bikes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the demonstration, all 50 officers attending Friday's session mounted up 
on their mountain bikes and took off on a 10-mile tour of Lake Forest that 
included some off-road riding in Whiting Ranch Regional Park. With Lopes and 
Stetina leading the way, the officers practiced some of the techniques they had 
learned earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said plans are already being made for another seminar next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned a lot, but we also had a lot of fun," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PARENT VISITS CLASS TO EXPLAIN HANUKKAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parent Fran Gitsham told a classroom of fifth-graders Friday that the meaning 
of Hanukkah is to respect each others' beliefs and to "always have a good 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live a life helping others, then good things will come to you," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six years, Gitsham, a volunteer at Isojiro Oka School, has shared 
Jewish traditions, the culture and the religion with students during the week 
of Hanukkah, which celebrates religious freedom and commemorates the victory in 
165 BC of the outnumbered Maccabees over the Syrians, who had captured and 
defiled the temple in Jerusalem with Greek deities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah ends Monday at sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she was back teaching the children the history of Hanukkah and the 
symbolism of a menorah and dreidel -- a toy similar to a top. 
</P>
<P>
 She also explained her own family traditions of making latke, potato pancakes, 
and of her mother's tradition of baking mandel, a hard biscuit cookie (her 
mother now makes the treat with chocolate chips for her grandchildren). 
</P>
<P>
 Gitsham started the annual program when her daughter, Sara, now 10 and in 
fifth grade, was in kindergarten.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Gitsham said the school had a small Jewish population and 
believed it was important that children learn more about each others' cultures: 
"It's a learning experience that I hope helps them to fight prejudices when 
they get older." 
</P>
<P>
 Gitsham, her daughter and classmate, Briana Garber, also 10, gave the 
presentation. Sara said she teaches her friends about her faith because 
"everyone should know about different traditions so they'll understand more 
about the culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The two students handed out chocolate coins, or gelt , which signifies 
"sweetness and good," and showed their classmates how to play the dreidel game. 
</P>
<P>
 Briana said the lesson teaches students to be more open-minded and caring 
toward each other. She added that it is important so her classmates "don't 
judge people who are Jewish." Principal Paul Klempner said the presentation 
ties in with this year's schoolwide theme of "Building a Bridge of Compassion." 
 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can understand about a person's culture and beliefs, it allows us to 
accept each other for who we are and to build tolerance," he said. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; WOMAN, 41, ARRESTED AGAIN IN STALKING CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of stalking a Villa Park 
man who she insisted would marry her one day, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Phillips was arrested at her home Thursday and held at the Orange 
County Jail on $25,000 bail, according to Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lady has a long-term problem," Martini said, of exhibiting "bizarre 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips met the man, whom police have not identified, in the late 1980s when 
she visited his home as the date of an invited guest, Martini said.  
</P>
<P>
 She soon developed an obsession with the man, Martini said, showing up 
uninvited at his home and Huntington Beach business, calling him repeatedly and 
telling people at the home and business that the man eventually would marry 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 The man reported the harassment to police, and eventually a restraining order 
was issued against her. In November, 1993, Phillips was convicted of violating 
the court order and served nine months in County Jail for the misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the man reported to police that Phillips was again harassing him. 
Police obtained an arrest warrant for felony stalking.MARK I. PINSKY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; PLANNERS WIN APPLAUSE FOR DELAYING BYPASS VOTE 
</P>

<P>
 It took three hours of discussion and five consecutive votes for the Planning 
Commission to decide to do nothing Thursday night on the proposed toll-free 
bypass for Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vote to delay a recommendation to the City Council on the project 
actually won applause from University Hills residents in the audience who 
believe the road could create a traffic nightmare for their UC Irvine 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is studying three proposed alternate routes for 
Newport Coast Drive. A 1.5-mile section of the road is planned to become part 
of the San Joaquin Hills Toll Road, which will end free access between Irvine 
and Pacific Coast Highway on the route. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has indicated a preference for one of the routes called 
"Alternative 3," that would lead northbound traffic on Newport Coast Drive into 
the UC Irvine area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cuts directly through the campus," said UCI Academic Senate President 
James Danziger, one of about a dozen faculty members who spoke in opposition to 
the proposed route. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of homeowners in Corona del Mar and other coastal cities have filed 
suit against the Transportation Corridor Agencies to stop the conversion of 
Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a free public road that's being illegally taken," said George 
Gallagher, president of the Irvine Conservancy, which is helping fund the 
lawsuit. "It's a bypass that should never be built." 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine principal planner Mark Tomich said the county will withhold a 
significant amount of transportation funding from the city if an alternate 
route is not planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will reconsider the bypass proposals Jan. 19. The City 
Council is expected to vote on the project in February. RUSS LOAR

<P>
 A proposal to turn the College Park West neighborhood into a gated community 
has died in the face of significant costs and opposition from local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A new survey of residents in the 312-home community shows about 80% oppose the 
plan, which was proposed by residents Michael and Rosann Rosandich as a 
solution to crime and maintenance problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The College Park residents don't want to put any money out in taking care of 
the streets or the sidewalks," Rosann Rosandich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd rather stay with the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday night's council meeting, City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said 
residents would have to form a homeowners association and assume the costs of 
street and landscaping maintenance, utilities and liability insurance in 
addition to paying for guard service. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion would require ballot approval by residents and approval by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is at best a three-year process," Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have complained that their 30-year-old community is often invaded by 
transients who camp out in the neighborhood park. 
</P>
<P>
 College Park West can only be entered from the city of Long Beach, which 
borders the western edge of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But after taking a look at citywide crime statistics, Bankston said the 
community is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "College Park West is one of the safer communities in the city of Seal Beach 
to be in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rosandiches estimated that real estate values could climb by as much as 
$15,000 per home if the community was gated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Rosandich, an aerospace engineer, said the cost to residents in 
comparable gated communities is as high as $300 a month per household. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to know how feasible it was because people had talked about it 
for so long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it would not be economically feasible to do it." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY'S TRASH VOLUME UP DESPITE RECYCLING

<P>
 An improving local economy may be causing an unwanted side effect: More trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The upswing in the economy has led to an increase in consumer spending, 
according to city officials, and with it an increase in trash. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in four years, trash being collected from city residents 
will surpass the amount from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash generated by residents has jumped to 4,400 tons, up more than 200 tons 
from last year, with a month to go in 1994, said Assistant City Manager Gerard 
Goedhart. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase came despite more recycling, he said. Residential recycling is up 
3% from three years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the growing amount of trash is worrisome, Goedhart said at a council 
meeting Monday, the city will meet its goal to reduce trash taken to local 
landfills by 25% in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Goedhart said that the city could divert 37.9% of its trash away from 
landfills next year with a strong residential and commercial recycling program, 
a green waste program and lower rates for smaller trash bins. 
</P>
<P>
 While the standard container is 100 gallons, 35- and 60-gallon containers are 
available to residents who put out less trash. 
</P>
<P>
 A more stringent state requirement, however, to cut by 50% the amount of trash 
dumped into landfills by the year 2000, will be harder to meet without a green 
waste recycling program, Goedhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law passed in 1989 imposes fines of $10,000 a day on cities that do 
not meet the required trash diversion limits, unless violators can show a "good 
faith" effort to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a 500-page document Monday detailing the city's 
recycling, hazardous waste, green waste and trash collection programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The document will be submitted to county and state officials Dec. 31. BERT

 A 43-year-old woman who was arrested earlier this week on suspicion of drug 
violations died in jail Friday of unknown causes, Orange County sheriff's 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose name was withheld pending notification of family, had been 
suffering from numerous medical problems associated with drug use and had been 
placed in the Orange County Women's Jail infirmary several hours before she 
died, Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was in pretty bad shape," he said. "She had many open sores and other 
things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was arrested Wednesday by Anaheim police on suspicion of drug sales 
and held in lieu of a $10,000 bond.  
</P>
<P>
 A deputy spoke to the woman Friday night and found her to be in good spirits, 
Martini said. But when he came back about 20 minutes later on a routine check, 
the deputy found her lying in her bunk "without any vital signs."  
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't breathing anymore," Martini said.  
</P>
<P>
 A nurse at the infirmary performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but could 
not revive the inmate.THAO HUA

 Knott's Berry Farm, which bills itself as "the oldest-living theme park," will 
mark its 75th anniversary in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The park was established in 1920 on land park officials describe as "the 
birthplace of the boysenberry." 
</P>
<P>
 Among its more popular attractions is the Calico Railroad, which is "held up" 
more than 10,000 times each year by actors.  
</P>
<P>
 Guests pan for real gold dust in the mine of Knott's Ghost Town. About $70,000 
worth of the dust is panned each year, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's replica of Independence Hall is so accurate that Philadelphia's 
Bicentennial Reconstruction Committee asked for the park's plans when the 
original landmark's blueprints could not be found. Today

 Yolanda Zavala broke into tears while watching her son, David, 7, pick out 
underwear, socks, a belt and a pair of jeans Friday at a Mervyn's Department 
Store. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been dreaming of those jeans," Zavala said, wiping her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son was among 100 needy children treated to a shopping spree at the store 
in the Anaheim Plaza for Christmas. The Salvation Army, which has sponsored the 
event each year for more than a decade, and several services clubs paid for the 
merchandise -- about $100 worth of new clothes for each child. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 more children will shop at 10 other Mervyn's stores throughout 
Orange and Los Angeles counties today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really nice because this Christmas is going to be kind of tough on 
us," said Zavala, whose husband died last year. Zavala, 40, is a student who 
said she will not be able to afford Christmas gifts for her only son. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other side of the store, Desiree found a pair of jeans, a Power Ranger 
shirt, a blue party dress and tennis shoes that fit. The 8-year-old girl, who 
lives with her father, mother and eight brothers and sisters in an Anaheim 
apartment, said she was grateful for the new clothes, which may be the only 
gifts she will receive this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lashauna, 6, ran down the store aisles picking out a jacket, a pair 
of black jeans and a pink bodysuit. "I'm going to wear this to school," 
Lashauna said smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got this many clothes before," she added. "This is like a big old 
treat for me. I feel so special." 
</P>
<P>
 Event sponsors said making the children feel special was the main reason for 
the shopping sprees. After they chose their clothes, the children were treated 
to snacks, coloring books, toys and a visit with Santa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem like a lot, but all these kids come from disadvantaged homes 
and they really light up with their new clothes," said Michael Wolf, an Anaheim 
Sunrise Rotary Club member, who helped children try on and carry their clothing 
around the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the kids don't have an opportunity to make a wish list come true, and 
we try our best to make them come true," Salvation Army Lt. Ebenezer Saguil 
said. MIMI KO

 The body of an unidentified woman was discovered Friday night in the aftermath 
of an apartment fire that investigators described as suspicious in origin. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:20 p.m., firefighters were called to an apartment in the 1500 block of 
South Highland Avenue, according to Police Lt. Tony Hernandez. The blaze was 
confined to a single apartment, and firefighters quickly brought it under 
control, he said. However, large fans were needed to clear out the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the apartment, authorities found the badly burned body of a woman. 
Arson investigators were called to determine the cause of the fire. MARK I.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 3 STUDENTS TO RECEIVE ART DAVIS SCHOLARSHIPS

<P>
 Three Orange County college students will receive scholarships ranging from 
$50 to $200 from a nonprofit group seeking to promote higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the Art Davis Scholarships, sponsored by the Better Advantages for 
Students and Society, a Corona del Mar nonprofit group, will receive the awards 
at a ceremony from noon to 4 p.m. Sunday at the Holiday Inn, 17941 Karman Ave., 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners are Cyndi O'Brien, a music student at Orange Coast College; Stacy 
Holland, who is working on a master's degree in psychology at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, and Corey Schribner, a music student at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarships are presented in the name of Art Davis, a music teacher at 
Orange Coast College for the past seven years. He helped found BASS more than a 
year ago to foster interest in education and encourage college students to 
complete their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said that the idea for a scholarship was started by his students four 
years ago, who wanted to present him with a birthday gift. He said the scholars 
are selected by a three-member panel, which includes himself, based on 
interviews and a 500-word essay about their goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications forms are available at colleges and universities in Southern 
California, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for Sunday's awards ceremony are $25 each, which includes lunch and 
entertainment.BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SPECIAL-EDUCATION MANDATES CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and federal mandates involving special-education students are coming 
under fire from several school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia School District has asked the state to either increase funding or 
eliminate some of the mandates, and the Anaheim Union High School District will 
consider a similar resolution at its meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 And trustees of the Anaheim City School District may consider the resolution 
early next year, according to a district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution contends that the federal and state governments require 
districts to spend money on services such as transportation but do not 
reimburse them enough. This forces school districts to take money away from the 
rest of the students, the resolution says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This situation results in one class of students having a greater claim on the 
district's services than another class of students, to the detriment of the 
latter class of students," the resolution reads. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jim Helmsley, director of special education for a consortium of 
school districts in western Orange County, the most difficult mandate requires 
that schools reimburse parents for attorney fees when there is a disagreement 
over a special-education student's placement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The threat of having to pay attorneys' fees is driving the decision over how 
to educate a child, rather than the best interest of the child," Helmsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But organizations that work with parents of special-education students are 
concerned that the resolutions may cause the federal government to withdraw the 
little funding it does provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservatives in the new Congress are already not too hot on special 
education," said Marta Anchonod, director of programs for Team of Advocates for 
Special Kids. "If they get wind of these resolutions, they could withdraw all 
funding and water down the legislation, taking away its teeth." DANIELLE A.

<P>
 Members of the Anaheim Union are expected to fill a vacancy on the board by 
making a temporary appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy was created when trustee Lou Lopez was elected to the Anaheim City 
Council last month, two years short of the end of his term. The board will vote 
Monday on whether to appoint someone to fill the vacancy or to hold a special 
election. A special election would cost about $125,000 and could not be held 
until June. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board decides to appoint someone to complete Lopez's term, it will 
probably do so by Jan. 31. District officials are recommending that 
applications be accepted until Jan. 5. and DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<P>
 Mayor: Michael Ward 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 48

<P>
 Occupation: Manufacturer's representative 
</P>
<P>
 First elected: 1992 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: 1998 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: As with most council members, the conversion of the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station is the top issue for Ward, who fears a commercial airport 
will hurt the quality of life in Irvine. He is critical of the vote by members 
of the Board of Supervisors to withdraw from the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority by the end of the year, and he is urging them to rescind their 
decision. "If they can do that, they can keep the county from splitting apart." 
Other top issues include crime prevention and creating business opportunities.

<P>
 First elected: 1990 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: 1998 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: Believes conversion of the El Toro Marine base should provide an 
economic stimulus to the county while protecting surrounding cities like Irvine 
from adverse effects. He is also interested in exploring the privatization of 
some city services to help avoid budget shortfalls during times of limited 
revenues. "We need to find an income source for park and transportation 
projects without raising taxes."

 Councilwoman: Christina L. Shea

 Age: 43 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Businesswoman 
</P>
<P>
 First elected: 1992 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: 1996 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: Conversion of El Toro Marine base: "The issue is to maintain the 
quality of life that Irvine residents have come to enjoy in this community. We 
have to work cooperatively with the county. We have to have a seat at the table 
because we do own part of that property there." Other priorities include the 
completion of the Human Options women's shelter and marketing the city to 
prospective businesses.

<P>
 Councilman: Greg Smith 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 45 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Auto parts distributor 
</P>
<P>
 First appointed: 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: 1998 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: To preserve the quality of life in Irvine during the conversion of 
the El Toro Marine base. "We need to make sure whatever goes in is conditioned 
to Irvine and that Irvine is not conditioned to El Toro. Irvine must maintain a 
strong voice in deciding whatever goes in there." Public safety is also at the 
top of Smith's concerns. He believes privatization of some city services can 
help Irvine cope with static budget funding.

 Occupation: Community volunteer 
</P>
<P>
 First elected: 1988 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: 1996 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: Parts company with her council colleagues by placing the need for 
a long-range business and economic development plan at the top of her agenda. 
She is concerned that Irvine is not attracting enough revenue-producing 
businesses. "Office development is not the best generator of revenues." Werner 
would also like to see additional funding for police to create a 
gang-suppression unit and continued support for a battered women's shelter and 
other social services.

MAN JAILED IN ORANGE KILLING FREED PENDING INVESTIGATION

 The manager of a title insurance company arrested in a fatal shooting in 
Orange was released Friday pending investigation of what authorities called 
"some unusual circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Allen Steeps, 34, was freed on his own recognizance from Orange County 
Jail, where he had been booked Thursday night following the shooting outside 
the Pump Room bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Steeps had called them that night on his cellular phone to report 
that a man was fighting with a woman in front of the bar in the 1500 block of 
West Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Steeps told a police dispatcher he was going to shoot the man and 
was told not to. As police were on their way, police said, Steeps fired, 
killing Russell Alan Graham, 39, of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapes of the telephone call are among evidence that the district attorney is 
investigating to decide whether to file charges, Orange Police Department 
spokesman Lt. Timm Browne said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are evaluating witness statements, evidence from the scene and all the 
tape because there are some unusual circumstances they want to closely 
evaluate," Browne said.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lew Rosenblum declined to discuss what those circumstances 
might be or whether Steeps had acted in self-defense. But Rosenblum said that 
after he spoke with police Friday, "There is a question in my mind what, if 
any, crime was committed."  
</P>
<P>
 Rosenblum said the three had been drinking in the Pump Room bar, but it wasn't 
known if the men knew each other.  
</P>
<P>
 Browne said Graham was a glass cutter. According to the California Department 
of Corrections, Graham had served prison sentences for burglary, receiving 
stolen property, vehicular manslaughter, voluntary manslaughter and robbery.  
</P>
<P>
 Harold Yamanuha, owner of the Pump Room, said over the last two months Graham 
had become "somewhat of a regular" and was well-liked.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was just a good-natured guy, joking and laughing," Yamanuha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour and a half before the shooting, Yamanuha recalled, he had 
seen Graham in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave away a free Las Vegas vacation and I asked him to pick the winning 
ticket from the jar," he said.

 State consumer affairs officials said Friday they have revoked the license of 
a respiratory therapist, citing his conviction for driving into his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 18, 1992, Francois Hoa Nguyen of Laguna Hills pleaded no contest in 
Municipal Court in Westminster to assault with a deadly weapon and vehicular 
hit-and-run.He was sentenced to 180 days in jail and three years' probation and 
ordered to pay restitution to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathleen A. McCoy, executive director of the state's Respiratory Care 
Examining Committee, announced Friday that the board, which operates under the 
state Department of Consumer Affairs, had revoked Nguyen's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the committee's responsibility to protect consumers by disciplining the 
licenses of practitioners as necessary," McCoy said. "Because Nguyen's crime 
involved bodily injury, which is substantially related to the practice of 
respiratory care, the committee revoked his license." 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, Nguyen waited outside his ex-wife's home on July 
20, 1991, despite a restraining order prohibiting him from approaching her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she returned in a vehicle with her boyfriend (Nguyen) approached them 
and grabbed the boyfriend's glasses and broke them," according to the 
revocation order. "In an attempt to calm the situation, the boyfriend left the 
area. When (his ex-wife) attempted to walk away, (Nguyen) intentionally drove 
his vehicle into her . . . (Nguyen) did not stop to determine the extent of 
injuries and did not call for help." 
</P>
<P>
 She was treated at a hospital for bruises.

 Esposito doesn't expect any miracles this season. His team is young and small, 
with his threereturning starters all being sophomores. "We haven't had much 
success in the last five years, which causes many team members to leave by the 
time they become juniors," Esposito said. "They don't want to play anymore." 
Esposito, who is also the school's athletic director and football coach, has 
had three coaches in the last three years running the program, and he decided 
to take over this year to try and get it back on track. He thinks his team has 
a lot of talent; they just need to get some game experience. He says their main 
strength is their versatility. With his players ranging from 5 feet 3 to 5-7, 
he can substitute eight or nine deep and not give up much. Without any height, 
Esposito is going to run a motion offense and use the team's speed and athletic 
ability to handle such powers as Sherman Indian and La Sierra Academy. "They 
shoot well and they are big," Esposito said. "They out-physical everyone."

 McClurg comes to Calvary Chapel after being an assistant coach at Huntington 
Beach, and he isa little unsure of how his team will respond this season. 
McClurg would like his team to compete at a Sunset League level, but that is 
probably a few years off, and McClurg doesn't have any unrealistic goals this 
season. The Eagles' biggest blow comes from the graduation of Blythe Linsey, 
the county's third-leading scorer who averaged 24 points last season and was 
fifth in rebounding with an average of 14 per game. Last season's team revolved 
around 6-foot-5 Linsey and the inside game. This season, McClurg will go with a 
motion offense that will involve the entire team. With no go-to player, McClurg 
wants everyone involved in order to open up some options. Perez will start at 
center, along with Roberts, who joins the team for her first year of 
basketball. A volleyball player, her height will help fill in for the loss of 
Linsey. McClurg hopes for a lot of scoring from Bellsky, who returns after 
sitting out most of last season after hurting her ankle.

 The Warriors are very young, but Harris says they are talented. "They just 
need time to learn the game," she said. Harris knew the situation coming in 
last season. "We were basically just trying to survive." Harris, who teaches 
freshman English, went to work recruiting on campus and her lineup this year 
includes eight sophomores; four are returning starters. Mendoza, who didn't 
play last season because of a broken wrist, is the only upperclassman and 
should earn a starting position early. Harris is optimistic about her team's 
future, although she knows this season is just a starting point. "Next year we 
could do some damage." If she can keep this roster together for three years, 
Harris could have a league champion.

 The Heralds could give everyone in the league a tough time this season, 
including Cerritos Valley Christian, the favorite to win the title. Second-year 
coach Cronquist returns four starters from last season's team that finished in 
a tie for third with Orange Lutheran. Cronquist's main concern is the defense. 
"We had a difficult time defending good players last season," he said. The team 
also needs to improve its point production from its front-court players. 
Kempton averaged 17 points to lead the team and was named first-team all-league 
and second-team All-Southern Section Division IV. Menke controls the team from 
the point-guard position, where she averaged six assists and was a second-team 
all-league selection. Younger, who played basketball as a freshman, returns to 
the team as a senior and brings maturity and quickness to the backcourt. 
Cronquist plans to play an up-tempo game to offset weakness inside.

 Kempf enters his fifth season coaching at Orange Lutheran, where he has led 
the Lancers to three playoff appearances. Kempf hopes to upset Cerritos Valley 
Christian and take the league championship. The Lancers lost Kristin Weddick to 
graduation, their leading scorer last season (12.9 points). Wright, a 
first-team all-league selection, averaged 10 points and will need to pick up 
the slack in Weddick's absence. Morales and Zweib return in their starting 
positions and will help lead the Lancers in the battle for the league title. 
The Lancers rely on their speed and quickness to overcome the lack of an inside 
game and will need someone to hit the outside shot to give them more scoring 
opportunities. With their speed, the Lancers need Oesch and Wright to hit the 
boards and open up fast-break opportunities.

<P>
 The Spartans begin their first year in Southern Section competition and 
Metzger has no idea what to expect. To their benefit, they have two 5-11 girls. 
Barron and Slagle are going to need to learn the game quickly. With five 
seniors on the roster, the Spartans should have some leadership, but it 
probably won't be enough for the free-lance team to reach its .500 goal. 
Metzger is also new to the Southern Section. Orangewood Academy should do fine 
against Fairmont, also new to the section, but it also has to face quite a few 
established programs, such as La Sierra Academy, which finished third in the 
Arrowhead League last season.

 Five teams from the Olympic League went to the playoffs last season. 
Capistrano Valley Christian, which earned an at-large berth, made an impressive 
run, making it to the quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division V-AA 
playoffs, where it lost to Cambria Coast Union, 65-55. Andie Shaffner had 12 
points and 13 rebounds in the defeat. The Eagles defeated St. Margaret's, the 
Academy League's top team, 46-42, in a first-round matchup, and Avalon, 50-21 
in the second round. . . . Whittier Christian, which also received an at-large 
berth in the playoffs, made a surprising run. The Heralds were eventually 
defeated by second-seeded Sun Valley Village Christian, 60-49, in the 
quarterfinals. Village Christian made it to the State regional semifinals 
before losing. Alana Kempton, a first-team all-league selection, scored 16 
points in Whittier Christian's losing effort. The Heralds' ride began with a 
defeat of Alverno in the wild-card round, 40-27, and then an upset of Agoura 
Oak Park, the Tri-Valley League champion, 52-46, coming from 12 points down in 
the third quarter. Monique Moreno, also a first-team all-league selection, led

wild-card round, 71-62, to Cantwell Sacred Heart. Calvary Chapel, which also 
lost in the first round, fell to Riverside Notre Dame, 40-38. League champion

<P>
 Second-year Coach Marrujo is going to find it tough to match last season's 
third-place leaguefinish. With the addition of Capistrano Valley Christian to 
the league, Connelly is going to find it hard to improve on last year's three 
league victories. The Koalas return only four lettermen from last season's team 
and two starters. Connelly will miss Kirsten Cappel most, the team's leading 
scoring last season who averaged 19 points and was a first-team all-league 
selection. Cervantes, a senior, is going to have to pick up the slack and to do 
that she must improve on her eight-point average. Rana will bring the only 
other starting experience to the team. She averaged five points last season and 
was an all-league honorable mention pick. Boardman joins the team after playing 
soccer last year. Marrujo hopes at 5 feet 10, she can give the team an inside 
game. The lack of experience probably will be the team's downfall, but with the 
new league alignment, each team will face each other three times, which could 
give the Koalas a chance for some upsets along the way.

 Smith, in his second season of coaching, admits his team is in a rebuilding 
phase, but he is excited to even have a team to coach. Smith had to recruit 
girls around campus to field a team, but he thinks they are going to do better 
than expected. The team should be able to get a victory or two, but it's still 
a year or two away from major improvement. Bellsky returns to the team at guard 
after badly spraining her ankle early last season. Freshman Carmargo is "a pure 
athlete" who is learning basketball for the first time, but Smith says she 
masters a new skill every day. She played Pop Warner football when she was 
younger and she'd like to play football in high school. Smith is excited about 
her ability and expects her to start. Clements is also a newcomer Smith hopes 
to start at point guard. Smith's first goal this season is just to win a game.

1994-95 GIRLS' BASKETBALL / SMALL SCHOOLS; TRAVELING DANE STILL HASN'T 
READJUSTED TO LIFE IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Margaret's Kelly Dane is American, but she is having a little difficulty 
readjusting to life in the United States. After living in Belgium for nine 
years, Dane returned to the States last year and is suffering from a bit of 
culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange to be back," Dane said. "School is the same everywhere, there 
are cliques and everyone is trying to follow their niche. So I'm still having a 
tough time getting back into things." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Connecticut and raised in Chicago until she was 7, Dane, now 17, moved 
to Belgium with her family when her father was sent there for work. The family 
didn't return to the United States until August, 1993, when the Danes moved to 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult to leave Belgium," Dane said. "But a lot of the people were 
there because their parents were working, so friends were always coming in and 
out of my life. I had a lot of constant friends and was always meeting new 
people. My first few days of school back here I came home upset, because in one 
day I had met almost everyone in the school." 
</P>
<P>
 From the second grade through the end of her sophomore year, Dane attended the 
International School of Brussels, where she was introduced to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Dane, who had never played organized basketball, met Coach Ron Parham when she 
was a freshman, and he decided to give her a chance with the team. Parham, who 
has two sons trying to obtain basketball scholarships, used his knowledge of 
the game to improve the girls on his team. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing two years in Brussels and one season so far in California, Dane, 
5 feet 10, thinks high school basketball is the same everywhere, except for a 
few minor details. 
</P>
<P>
 Two differences, Dane said, are the intense workouts she had under Parham and 
the college-sized playbook they had to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think many high school teams here have playbooks. We had a huge 
playbook, it was unbelievable," Dane said. "And if someone didn't know one of 
the plays, the whole team had to run." 
</P>
<P>
 The workouts consisted of weight training three days a week, with each player 
having their own personal program. After training they had a half-hour of heavy 
conditioning and then on to a routine practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to match up against some big girls. I mean big, with a lot of meat," 
Dane said. "Most of the games were against military schools and these girls 
were good." 
</P>
<P>
 One difference that Dane misses is the trips. Because they played schools from 
all over Europe, the teams had to travel five to six hours for games, so the 
teams would play on Friday nights and Saturday mornings, with the girls staying 
in the homes of opposing players or in the barracks on military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really neat. You got to spend a lot more time with your teammates," 
Dane said. "We were like a family. Here, it is just short bus trips and quick 
meals. It is sad we don't have more time together. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night we had a whole barracks to ourselves. After the game we came back 
and had a huge water balloon fight. It was a blast. It was things like that 
that brought our team closer together." 
</P>
<P>
 Dane is looking forward to this season and thinks her team will be successful. 
Starting at forward, Dane is off to a fast start, scoring 14 points and 
grabbing 11 rebounds in St. Margaret's opening victory over North Hollywood 
Buckley.

 The Eagles move to the Academy League this season, which is unfortunate for 
the rest of the league. Although seven seniors graduated from last year's team, 
Shelton feels he has great athletes in the wings and should be able to win the 
league championship. The Eagles' biggest loss was forward Andrea Shaffner, who 
averaged 11 points and 10 rebounds to lead the team. They will also miss 
Lindsey Etheridge, who was fourth in the county in assists, averaging nearly 
six. Bradberry averaged 10 points last season and will need to grab some 
rebounds to make up for Shaffner's loss. Olivier will join the team after 
sitting out last season because of a ruptured Achilles' tendon she received 
playing volleyball. Crary will play off-guard and is the Eagles' main outside 
scoring threat. Shelton plays an inside game, but would love to multiply his 
options by getting some long-distance production.

 Smith isn't planning on a league championship this season, but he would like 
to see his team finish third and get a playoff berth. Pioneer Baptist, which 
won last year's league title is the favorite. It lost only one player from last 
season's squad and dominates other teams with its size. For Heritage Christian, 
Larson is the only returning starter. She averaged four points as a freshman 
and received all-league honorable mention. Smith expects much more from her and 
thinks she will be one of the top players by her senior year. Heritage 
Christian is a young team with only one senior. The girls are learning 
basketball, so Smith is teaching a lot of basics. He plans on running a slow, 
half-court offense, keying on Caparino.

 Higgins takes over at Bethel Baptist, replacing Wanda Garcia, whose teams went 
6-33 in two years. Higgins might have a little better luck because four 
starters return from last season's team. Height is the main concern for Bethel 
Baptist, which has no true center. The tallest player in the lineup is 5-foot-8 
Mullikin, who starts for the second consecutive year at post. Cantrell, Farrokh 
and Williams also return for their second season as starters. The Warriors will 
need to play tough defense to make up for their lack of size. Along with the 
experience of their starting four, the Warriors are also bringing in a 
promising group of freshmen who should be able to help them improve on last 
season's fifth-place finish.

 With the transfer of Capistrano Valley Christian into the league, it will not 
be easy for St. Margaret's to repeat as league champions. The Eagles were the 
only team St. Margaret's lost to last season. The Tartans graduated only two 
starters from last season's squad and they return seven lettermen. Trette, a 
first-team all-league selection, returns for her junior season after leading 
the team in scoring last season (11-point average). Lock will look to Trette to 
open up the inside game with her outside shooting. Freeman will need to put the 
ball up more under the basket and improve her scoring from last season, when 
she average eight points. Lock hopes his team's pressure defense will force 
turnovers and get the Tartans running in a quick transition game.

 Sass takes over the girls' team this season after posting a 95-81 record as 
Liberty Christian's boys' coach for eight years. Sass is looking for someone to 
step up and become a strong inside scorer. Vaccaro, a first-team all-league 
selection last season, averaged 10 points and 11 rebounds to lead the team. The 
team's tallest starter at 5 foot 8, Vaccaro will head a three-forward offense 
that will play a deliberate half-court game. Sass is concerned about his team's 
lack of height and speed, but he hopes to get Rule and Johnston up to par fast 
to provide height inside and some added rebounding. Liberty Christian has the 
smallest enrollment of the four-team Academy League and will find it difficult 
to keep up with newcomer Capistrano Valley Christian and league champion St. 
Margaret's. But Sass doesn't see his team being dominated by anyone and thinks 
the newly realigned league will be the most competitive it's ever been.
