NAFTA -- GLAD WE MET YA; EARLY RETURNS SHOW THE CONTROVERSIAL TRILATERAL TRADE 
PACT WORKING WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The North American Free Trade Agreement aims to eliminate continental trade 
barriers and in so doing stimulate the economies of the United States, Mexico 
and Canada. On the basis of NAFTA's first six months, it is succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-Mexico trade is now at record levels. Exports to Mexico, led by auto 
parts, telecommunications equipment and plastics, are up 17% over a year ago 
and total $24.5 billion since Jan. 1. U.S. exports over the three months ending 
with June jumped to $12.6 billion. Imports to the United States rose by 21%, to 
$23.4 billion, with oil and automobiles leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade with Canada, whose free-trade agreement with the United States predates 
NAFTA and which remains this country's biggest trading partner, rose by 10%. 
Through June, U.S. exports totaled $55.6 billion, while imports reached $61.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising volume of trade with Mexico has been accompanied by a significant 
narrowing in the U.S. trade surplus, which some find worrisome. But a 
strengthening Mexican economy means an increase in domestic job openings, and 
as demand for Mexican products continues to grow, pressures for higher wages 
should rise. Mexico's exports are in fact expanding globally, all of which 
could encourage many who now look to the north for jobs to seek opportunities 
at home instead, thus reducing migratory labor pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 During the contentious NAFTA debate the Clinton Administration claimed that 
170,000 new U.S. jobs would be created in the first year of the agreement. 
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown now more conservatively estimates that 
100,000 jobs will be linked to NAFTA by 1995. Meanwhile, through June, the 
Commerce Department says that 4,280 people were certified to get government 
help and retraining as a result of losing their jobs because of shifting trade 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, then, NAFTA at six months is looking pretty good, precisely the kind 
of win-win situation for its trading partners that its backers both here and in 
Mexico and Canada had promised. Trading Up U.S. exports to Mexico, in billions 
of dollars. '94: $12.61Source: Commerce Department

CLINTON HAD TO DO THE CUBAN ABOUT-FACE; CASTRO TRIES TO EXPORT HIS TROUBLES TO 
THE UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Old Fidel Castro has been causing headaches in Washington for 35 years. Many 
Americans therefore instinctively blame the dictator for the latest crisis in 
the Florida Straits. And even though the growing stream of refugees from Cuba 
is not on the scale of the Mariel boat lift of 1980, the upsurge has prompted 
President Clinton to make a major change in how the United States handles Cuban 
refugees -- indeed, with the precise intent of avoiding another Mariel. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the last Latin American communist head of state notwithstanding, to a 
great degree this latest refugee problem in the Caribbean is Washington's 
fault, as Castro himself delights in pointing out. During the Cold War, 
Washington wrote special exceptions into U.S. immigration laws specifically for 
refugees from the communist regime. The Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, for 
instance, allowed Cubans detained by U.S. immigration officials for illegally 
entering this country to be released, granted legal resident status and even 
provided with some social services, rather than be deported. Little wonder so 
many Cubans eagerly fled to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While such a staunchly anti-Castro immigration policy was arguably needed 
during the Cold War, now it is ridiculously out of date and counterproductive. 
After all, existing policy should be aimed at toppling Castro, instead of 
providing a crutch for that shaky regime. In fact, he might dissolve altogether 
were it not for the safety valve of immigration to the United States. 
Washington's policy also keeps drawing Cuban refugees to Florida, a state whose 
residents resent, rightly or wrongly, the growing burden. That is a key reason 
Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat who is facing a tough reelection 
campaign, this week raised such a fuss over the refugee influx, declaring a 
state of emergency and calling on Washington for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea from Chiles got the White House's attention and prompted the Clinton 
Administration to come up with a carrot-and-stick approach that should help 
slow the influx. The carrot: issuing more formal immigration visas through the 
U.S. Interests Section in Havana. The stick: ordering the Coast Guard to halt 
boats that its patrols intercept and to escort would-be refugees to detention 
centers outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration officials believe that allowing Cubans to formally apply for visas 
at the Interests Section, which functions as a U.S. embassy in Havana, may 
relieve the desperation that leads some Cubans to hijack boats or flee in 
unsafe craft. That should work, especially if preference is given to Cubans who 
have no relatives in the United States. The most driven and truly needy 
refugees seem to be those who have no family members in this country sending 
dollars back to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, such an approach might seem to play into Castro's hands, relieving 
tensions in his country and adding much-needed U.S. currency to Cuba's economy. 
But a few more dollars sent in Cuba mainly will relieve the immediate needs of 
desperate people, not, in the long run, save Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, by making it clear that Cubans who try to enter the United States 
illegally will no longer be allowed to stay almost automatically, the 
Administration will make it that much harder for Castro to export his many 
unhappy compatriots to this country. What one wants is for most, if not all, to 
remain in Cuba so their discontent will hasten that annoying dictator's 
inevitable downfall.

A JOURNEY TO PUT THE PAST BEHIND; TRADE DELEGATION SPONSORED BY VIETNAMESE 
AMERICANS PLANS CONTROVERSIAL TRIP TO HANOI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange County has an important trip to 
Vietnam scheduled to begin late next month. The delegation is interested in 
improving trade relations and is expected to meet with President Le Duc Ahn and 
other top government officials. This mission to Hanoi is potentially valuable; 
the delegation must not be discouraged by local criticism that has arisen. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the hard-line foes of normalization in the Vietnamese 
American community have been howling in protest and have a demonstration 
scheduled for today outside a chamber seminar in Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
 The trip represents the first time top Vietnamese leaders will have received a 
group organized by Vietnamese American expatriates. It should be recognized as 
a promising follow-up to the lifting of the trade embargo that President 
Clinton wisely approved earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the trip to Vietnam is not just about dialogue between partisans in a 
long Vietnamese struggle. The chamber notes that there actually will be only a 
few Vietnamese Americans in its traveling group; the others will be other 
interested bankers, developers and business people. 
</P>
<P>
 With continued worries about a Southern California economy buffeted by 
recession and structural changes, the international trade arena is seen as 
especially important. The proper context for regarding the trip is as part of 
overall trade initiatives in a changing global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, political differences within the Vietnamese American community 
have been hostile and even violent. Peaceful protest is an important part of 
the American political tradition, and those who disagree with the chamber's 
initiative are entitled to have their voices heard. However, a Times poll taken 
just after the embargo was lifted found that the majority of Vietnamese living 
in Southern California favored the end of sanctions and even full diplomatic 
relations. Clearly, the time has come to put the rancor of the past behind and 
to move forward.

CHARITABLE DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "When $25,000 Was Insignificant," Commentary, Aug. 5: 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Carole Wade's experience, it is obvious she is still more interested 
in hobnobbing with high-rollers than in finding a worthwhile charity for her 
money. Her efforts to give an "insignificant" $25,000 to a hospital (calling 
the most prestigious hospital in Los Angeles a charity is stretching the term 
anyway) were met with disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't try very hard to give the money away. Every organization I raised 
money for through the 1980s from United Way to the Cultural Foundation of the 
San Fernando Valley would have been ecstatic to receive her gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Wade, the real problem, why Los Angeles lags the nation in charitable 
giving, is not "exclusion." The reasons include our hurting, fractured and 
extraordinarily diverse economy, our lack of central leadership and our lack of 
a widespread culture of giving. Involving the children of the "old money" is 
another elitist solution that won't address our fundamental problem of getting 
a broad base of small business and personal contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wade can get over the hurt of being snubbed for a "small" contribution and 
the wrong address, she can find hundreds of truly worthwhile charities doing 
the day-to-day work necessary to keep our society together. 
</P>

<P>
 * This article would have better served the public had Wade named the hospital 
so that, in turn, we could petition that institution to lower its fees. 
Apparently it has more than enough money. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest the charity-giving public think that this is a normal procedure, I, as a 
professional in the social service field for almost 30 years, can tell you that 
no gift is insignificant ! Every penny and every dollar given to charity is 
much needed. Most service providers do not have major donors of the type 
described in the article, but rather, count on the $25 to $100 donors to be 
able to stay in existence and work to meet the needs of others. Funding is 
indeed going down, making every gift, no matter how small, that much more 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to add that Wade's inferences about the rich, exclusionist, 
Escada-ensembled donors is way too wide a generalization. These people also 
have a place in the world of charity fund-raising -- they give and they 
encourage others to give. Many work harder at fund-raising than others do at 
paid jobs. Their intentions are good. 
</P>
<P>
 In philanthropy, no one and no gift are too small or too large; all are 
significant. Each of us has a role to play in helping to alleviate pain and 
misery among our fellow human beings.

 * Your July 20 article, "Charities Find L.A. Is a Challenge," was quite 
disappointing in its content, but even more disappointing in its omission. The 
article neglected to highlight the many positive philanthropic activities that 
continue in the Los Angeles area day in and day out. In particular, the 
response from the Japanese business community of Los Angeles in terms of 
charitable contributions has accounted for badly needed moneys for special 
programs for disaster relief and substantial time volunteered to schools, civic 
associations and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 As president of Nippondenso of Los Angeles Inc. and the Japan Business Assn. 
of Southern California, I have seen firsthand the tremendous financial 
contributions, volunteer efforts, in-kind resources and emotional stock donated 
by companies and individuals to the Los Angeles Unified School District, job 
training centers, literacy programs and many other programs, as well as relief 
following a series of natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there has been little credit given to donations of companies like 
Mitsubishi, Toyota and hundreds of Japanese-American companies whose 
contributions total into the millions of dollars and help create jobs and fund 
community centers and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, there still exists a great need for continued support for the work done 
by civic and community organizations, but that work will be harder to continue 
without recognition given to those companies and associations making a 
difference in their local communities.

CALIFORNIA TRANSPLANTS TO IDAHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Idaho Trail" (Aug. 9) was quite disturbing. When did Idaho become a 
sovereign "country" with limits on immigration? What happened to freedom of 
movement in the good old U.S.A.? Tolerance? 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors, with proper "passports" should be required to take anti-venom shots, 
to avoid the verbal poison. Would Idaho residents survive a boycott of their 
famous vegetable?

<P>
 * As one who has maintained a home in both Idaho and California for many 
years, I assure you that the anguish of the native Idahoans is legitimate. Your 
article points out a perfect example of an Idahoan's concern, the 
"environmentally conscious California transplant" who complains about the 
bluegrass burn-off. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical Californian's environmentalism pales in comparison to the native 
of Idaho. Californians have learned their environmentalism from an armchair, 
watching biased "nature" programs on TV and believing everything the Sierra 
Club and others propound. The Idahoan, however, learns his environmentalism on 
the land. He lives, works and recreates there. He isn't about to ruin his back 
yard or his livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Californian goes up there with his false "environmentally correct" 
notions and tries to change everything. Such as the bluegrass burn-off, 
something that has been done by the Indians since before America was 
discovered, something that's necessary to rejuvenate the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to any cafe, market or saloon in any little town in Idaho and you'll 
probably see the sign "Idaho is what America was!" If Californians want to live 
in "what America was," they should leave their "what America has become" back 
in California.

 * The story stated "Now Coeur d'Alene has a white supremacy group." That group 
is not new to northern Idaho. I was born in Coeur d'Alene in 1963 and that 
organization (if it can be called such) was alive and active then. The article 
made it appear that this is new and due primarily to the influx of Californians 
and retired law enforcement (some indeed may be involved), but I still believe 
that people are drawn to Coeur d'Alene for its incredible beauty, and not 
racist reasons.

PARK PROGRAMS IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations to Carlyle Hall Jr., president of People for Parks, and Prof. 
Jack Foley for their insightful column "Recreation Is More Than Fun and Games" 
(Commentary, Aug. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000 full-time and 20,000 part-time employees of the City of Los Angeles 
Department of Recreation and Parks share the view that the work of the 
department not only helps "provide a satisfying life in Southern California," 
but is a deterrent to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing a direct relationship between "quantity and quality of our parks and 
recreation" and crime has been done time and time again. Recently, in Phoenix, 
a citywide late night/early morning basketball/swim program cut juvenile crime 
by 55% immediately! Over 165,000 participated during the first summer, at a 
total cost of 65 cents per participant! In Los Angeles we are looking into a 
major expansion of our midnight basketball and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's issue of "safety in Los Angeles" is clearly a top 
priority for all of us. Jackie Tatum's Department of Recreation and Parks will 
make major contributions to reduce crime through increased use of programs and 
facilities in our 375 parks. The department was allocated $126 million in 
Proposition A funds to improve 110 specific facilities citywide. I will be 
touring all 375 facilities (many times with the appropriate City Council 
member), 12-13 each session, on Monday mornings. We hope to see, firsthand, 
what additional "wish list" items are important for each facility in our 
neighborhoods. We would encourage all Angelenos to give suggestions to their 
local park director. Our goal is to compile a meaningful grass-roots list.  
</P>
<P>
 The department hopes to encourage (and acknowledge) private sector donations 
to complete many of these "wish list" items (examples range from benches, to 
expanded types of seniors' programs, to improved lighting and new sports 
facilities).

 Texaco, Norwegian Firm to Join Forces: Norway's Norsk Hydro and Texaco Inc. 
said they have signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture company to 
sell petroleum products in Norway and Denmark.Each partner would hold a 50% 
share in the new company, which encompasses only marketing activities. The new 
firm would also have a major presence in the diesel and heating fuel markets. 
"It combines Hydro's strong Scandinavian presence with Texaco's international 
experience and marketing expertise," the two companies said.

THEATER REVIEW; 'FUN STORIES' GETS POLISHED UPDATING; POMO AFRO HOMOS ABLY 
RECYCLES ITS 'FIERCE LOVE,' BUT THE PUNCH LINES STILL WORK FOR THE FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The title of the Pomo Afro Homos show at Highways, "More Fabulous Fun 
Stories," is a bit misleading. Not the "Fabulous Fun" part, but the "More." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the program, a note under the title explains this is "an updated 
version of the award-winning show 'Fierce Love: Stories From Black Gay Life.' " 
In other words, if you saw "Fierce Love" at Highways in 1991, as some of the 
group's fans surely did, this show is more or less the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, most fans won't care. Even if they've heard the punch lines, they 
can appreciate anew the artistry with which they're delivered. This San 
Francisco-based trio is in splendid form, their performances utterly polished 
and assured and ready for prime time.

 Befitting its title, "Fun Stories" is more of a comedy revue than the group's 
"Dark Fruit," seen here in 1992. The pieces here are generally shorter than in 
"Dark Fruit." A couple of them stop too soon, too abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is framed, at beginning and end, with a simple a cappella 
presentation, "We Are," which elegantly states the evening's purpose: to tell a 
few stories from black gay life -- a culture that has undergone "centuries of 
silence, milliseconds of sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this isn't one of those noble but dull evenings where a previously 
underrepresented group accentuates only the positive. The characters in this 
show aren't always exemplary, but they're almost always alive and vital. 
</P>
<P>
 They cover a wide range. In the first three sketches alone, we visit the 
"Queer Value Channel" shopping network (the ending of this one has changed 
since "Fierce Love"), a blue-collar married man who gets a little gay action on 
the side but denies that it matters, and an opera queen who's suddenly 
confronted with a vision of his African roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Freeman, one of the performers as well as the evening's director, makes 
a remarkable transformation from that blue-collar guy to what looks like a more 
autobiographical solo, "Sad Young Man," in which he relates a childhood inside 
a Model New Negro Family, a youth devoted to longing for Johnny Mathis, and 
college years in which he came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Red Bandannas" is an unorthodox but persuasive rap. "Good Hands" is an erotic 
solo from the back room of a club, sizzlingly performed by Eric Gupton. Tired 
of being the bridesmaid but never the bride? Join "The Just Us Club" -- a funny 
trio in drag. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Like Me" and a dramatized excerpt from James Baldwin are two of the 
pieces that don't seem quite finished, but Djola Bernard Branner's reminiscence 
of a friend's funeral and Freeman's "metal" dude's odyssey through gay night 
life in San Francisco provide an invigorating conclusion.

GUTTING THE MYTH OF SUBSERVIENCE; YOSHIKO SHIMADA'S VOLATILE IMAGES EXPLORE 
JAPANESE WOMEN'S ROLE IN WORLD WAR II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese artist Yoshiko Shimada is brutally honest about the past in a nation 
that has not completely come to grips with it.  
</P>
<P>
 She is a self-declared feminist in a place where many women appear to shun 
that label. She is blatantly political in a national art tradition that tends 
to value the quest for beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 And she uses jarring, uncompromising imagery in a land where subtlety and 
harmony are promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Such contradictions between Shimada's national culture and her personal 
artistic expression are precisely what makes her stand out in Japan's art world 
today. She has also seized a provocative, and timely, theme: the role Japanese 
women played in collaborating with the Imperial system that led military forces 
to subjugate Asia, turn scores of women into sex slaves and eventually bring on 
a disastrous wartime defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese women were not entirely voiceless victims of the male-dominant 
militarism," Shimada said over pizza and beer on a recent evening. "Many of 
them were enthusiastic fascists and willing to sacrifice themselves and to 
victimize others in the name of the emperor." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless women realize this, "we cannot reach true understanding of ourselves 
and will be manipulated again and again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her call comes in the form of etchings, paintings and installations that link 
"volatile imagery with consummate craft," as the Australian magazine World Art 
recently put it. She depicts women firing pistols in Manchuria. She shows them 
dressed in the white aprons of motherly love -- the uniform of the National 
Women's Defense Organization -- even as they serve soldiers tea, keep vigil 
against spies and produce sons for the national war machine. Shimada also 
portrays teen-age girls making poison balloon bombs in wartime factories, 
contrasting the purity of youth with death and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of her more jarring works, she juxtaposes two images: women kneeling 
for hours before the Imperial Palace after the wartime surrender to beg 
forgiveness for their inadequate efforts, and a woman bound in a scene of 
sadomasochistic sex. The title: "Masochists." 
</P>
<P>
 In her latest show, "Voices of Women" in a Tokyo gallery, Shimada took up the 
issue of so-called comfort women. The women, mainly recruited from Korea, were 
forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shimada did not merely deplore the practice or depict the women's 
suffering. In a live performance, she juxtaposed their photos and anguished 
recollections with readings from Japanese women who defended the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The result moved many in the audience, mostly Japanese women, to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a Japanese, I couldn't just say: I sympathize with you. It's almost 
hypocritical," she said. "I think all Japanese women have to take 
responsibility and remind ourselves that we were not victims but on the side of 
the aggressors." 
</P>
<P>
 She also wanted to provoke thought by juxtaposing the twin images of Japanese 
women as "sacred mothers" and Asian women as sex slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, many Japanese men see women not as individuals, but only through 
the images of 'mother' or 'prostitute,' " Shimada said. "Those images . . . are 
used to manipulate women, making them either domestic slaves or sex slaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimada, who dresses casually in jeans and T-shirt, her face without makeup 
and hair pulled back, did not always hold such provocative views. Born in Tokyo 
in 1959 and educated in fine art at Scripps College in Claremont, she launched 
her art career with etchings of her dreams after returning to Japan upon 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her political awakening came in 1988, when then-Emperor Hirohito became 
gravely ill. As if some national telepathy were at work, people began 
restricting their behavior -- canceling parties and school festivals, for 
instance. It seemed a rerun of the mass conformity of the 1930s and 1940s -- 
and Shimada began fearing that her nation's unreformed groupthink could lead 
Japan once more down a path of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we've learned anything from the war. It seems Japanese have the 
attitude that nothing can be done. No one is responsible. War is bad," said 
Shimada. Currently a resident of Berlin, where her husband has a professorship, 
she marvels at the way the Germans have probed their war deeds, taken 
responsibility and made amends.  
</P>
<P>
 Shimada has read voraciously about the war, a period she says schools tend to 
breeze over. But political expression -- especially feminist work -- is often 
shunned in the Japanese art world. So it was not until a 1991 visit to Boston, 
where artists talked about their "right" to expression and exercised it in 
works against the Gulf War, that she gained enough confidence to step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1991, she presented her first political work on women and war in a 
small, two-week exhibition here that mainly attracted her friends. Although she 
is still virtually ignored by Japanese art critics, she is attracting growing 
attention from art galleries here and from the international press. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 50th anniversary of World War II's end approaches next year and 
expectations mount for Japan to more directly confront its war deeds, Shimada 
may be an artist in the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is just on the brink of really making it," said Japan Times art critic 
Nancy Shalala. "Without a doubt, she is one of the most important artists 
here."

 Woodstock Jackpot: Music lovers who chose to avoid the rain and mud and watch 
Woodstock '94 at home made the 44-hour concert the biggest pay-per-view musical 
event in history. PolyGram Diversified Entertainment issued a preliminary 
report Friday claiming that 1.2% to 1.5% of U.S. households equipped with 
pay-per-view bought all or part of the event, translating to between 250,000 
and 310,000 homes. That would make the record-breaking take between $10 million 
and $15 million. Woodstock '94 beat out the previous record holder, a 1991 
concert by the squeaky-clean pop group New Kids on the Block.

 * KCBS' Jordan Resigns: KCBS-TV Channel 2 News Director Robert Jordan, who has 
come under fire by station management during the past few months for the news 
staff's coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder case, is resigning, station 
officials said. Jordan, who was appointed news director in September, 1993, is 
leaving to start up the news operation at WFTS-TV in Tampa, Fla. He became the 
eighth news director at the embattled station to leave in 11 years. No 
replacement has been named for Jordan, who will leave effective Aug. 26. KCBS 
has been criticized for sensationalizing aspects of the Simpson case and for a 
factual error in a hotly disputed story by investigative reporter Harvey Levin, 
which questioned the conduct of prosecutors in the case and resulted in the 
station running an on-air retraction. However, officials did not specify 
whether the Simpson coverage led to Jordan's resignation. PEOPLE WATCH

 An Unforgettable Mistake: While Nat King Cole himself is unforgettable, his 
birth date apparently is. The musician's widow said the birth date inscribed 
along the margin of the U.S. Postal Service's new 29-cent stamp honoring Cole 
is off by two years. Maria Cole pointed out the error Thursday when the stamp 
was unveiled at a ceremony at her home. She said her husband's birth date was 
incorrectly reported during his life, and the error stuck. "I remember years 
ago that happening, and it was never corrected," she said. Nat King Cole was 
born March 17, 1919, she said. Some reference books -- and the Postal Service 
-- set the date at 1917. A post office spokeswoman said 36 million stamps have 
been printed and will be issued Sept. 1. THE ARTS

 Getty Museum Threatens Court Action: The J. Paul Getty Museum has threatened 
court action in its five-year battle to buy Antonio Canova's neoclassical 
sculpture "The Three Graces" and export it from Britain. In a letter sent 
Friday to British National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell, Getty Museum 
Director John Walsh charges foul play in the latest deferral of the Getty's 
export license, which gives a consortium of museums a Nov. 5 deadline to meet 
the Getty's $11.6-million price and keep the sculpture in Britain. "We are 
exploring the remedies available to us and, if necessary, we will take the 
matter to the courts," the letter says, stating that the Getty expects a reply 
from Dorrell on Monday. The letter further claims that the National Heritage 
Memorial Fund is playing an inordinate role in the fund-raising campaign. In 
addition to its $4.6-million pledge to the campaign, the NHMF would have to 
loan $930,000 to the National Galleries of Scotland in order for that 
institution to meet its pledge of $1.7 million, the letter says.

 * 'Mikey' Turns 100: "The Ballad of Little Mikey," a gay musical in West 
Hollywood, celebrates its 100th performance Sunday with a party following the 7 
p.m. show and the release of a cast recording. The production began at the 
Celebration Theatre but has recently been revised in its new home at St. 
Genesius Theatre. Playwright Mark Savage said one Catholic priest has seen the 
show 45 times -- and yes, he has asked St. Genesius to bless it.

 * LACE Performance Program in Doubt: Different interpretations of city codes 
have dealt a significant setback to Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, which 
recently opened a new Hollywood Boulevard location largely funded with funds 
from the Community Redevelopment Agency. LACE originally designed its 
performance space, called the Alternative Media Gallery, for 91 seats and was 
given city permits to accommodate that number of audience members. But shortly 
before completion of construction, an inspector issued a stop-work order, 
saying the original permit should never have been issued. According to Gwen 
Darien, LACE executive director, the inspector "disagreed with the usage and 
occupancy load of the original permit," reducing it to allow a maximum of 49 
seats. LACE is appealing the decision while continuing its scheduled 
performances to smaller audiences. QUICK TAKES

MUSIC REVIEW; SALONEN LEADS BRUCKNER'S THIRD SYMPHONY AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Esa-Pekka Salonen closed his four-program Hollywood Bowl visit this summer the 
same way he closed his portion of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's spring season 
in May -- with a two-work program offering elegant brevity in the first half, 
followed by an early intermission and the swollen rhetoric of Anton Bruckner's 
Third Symphony in the post-interval. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, Salonen's willing Philharmonic colleagues again covered 
themselves with glory in a pristine, handsomely contoured, practically 
transparent performance of the D-minor Symphony. The immaculate nature of the 
playing, of course, only underscored, for the unconverted, the paucity of the 
Austrian composer's inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, faced with this genuinely admirable achievement, one could understand 
again why Bruckner's humorless, endlessly self-conscious symphonic essays 
attract conductors and listeners: They drip with aspiration and sincerity and 
the longing for spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen & Co., who take this work on their 11-city European tour next week, 
have polished their rather unsmiling performance to a shine, finding the quiet 
places and savoring them with all the naturalness they lavish upon the large 
and numerous climaxes. For some listeners, these wondrous contrasts are only 
more proof that the Third Symphony is mostly air; for others, such readings 
confirm the sublimity of the composer's text. Chacun a son gout.  
</P>
<P>
 In the short first half of this concert -- heard by a reported audience of 
9,834 -- Olli Mustonen, Salonen's 27-year-old Finnish countryman, became the 
accomplished soloist in Maurice Ravel's universally beloved Piano Concerto in 
G. Mustonen sought and found striking articulation and easy fluency in the 
familiar work -- his technique is abundant and reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this proved no definitive performance. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the overstressing of melodies and brilliant, brittle playing, both 
pianistic and orchestral, the many subtleties of the work evaporated in the 
night air. Mustonen/Salonen got its rhythmicality and much of its jazziness, 
but little of its insouciance. There is magic here, but it emerges only from an 
aura of understatement and indirection. In all, this was as un-Gallic a reading 
as one might imagine.

ART REVIEW; 'DUTCH' CHRONICLES AN AESTHETIC REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest rotation of the J. Paul Getty Museum's wonderful Old Master 
drawings collection is "16th and 17th Century Dutch Drawings." That modest 
title masks an exquisite exercise in subtle connoisseurship by co-curators 
Arianne Faber-Kolb and Stephanie Schrader . 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, it also raises absorbing issues of national artistic 
character. The 25 images on view pose an inescapable question: How could the 
drawings of the two centuries be, on the surface, so utterly different from one 
another? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer lies buried in a combination of historical circumstances not unlike 
the change the world is now going through with the end of the Cold War. The 
drawings of these two centuries represent an aesthetic revolution that will 
probably repeat itself in our own time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 16th Century, the art of the Lowlands, like that of most of Europe, was 
under the sway of Mannerism. In Holland, the hypnotically neurotic style 
produced the same elongated figures, odd perspectives and wayward allusions as 
in Italy and France. 
</P>
<P>
 The context was mythical, aristocratic and decadent -- witness Hendrick 
Goltzius' "Venus and Mars Surprised by Vulcan." But Dutch Mannerism was 
significantly earthier than others. "Embracing Couple" by Jan Hermenz. Muller 
manages to look like a real moonlight roll in the hay despite the hypothesis of 
scholars that the couple represents Mercury and Lara. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when Dutch Mannerist artists decided to get weird they could 
out-perverse anybody on the continent. Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem is 
represented by an image titled "Two Male Nudes." In these days of gay 
liberation the fact that they appear to be locked in a passionate kiss might be 
seen as striking a blow for freedom. The really odd thing, however, is that one 
of them is a grown man with the proportions of a serious iron pumper while the 
other -- although equally muscular -- is a child of 5 or 6. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on here, pedophilia among the gods? Although one would not put it 
past them, the positioning of the figures makes it impossible to say for sure. 
Mannerism delighted in this sort of ambiguous perversity. After all, the artist 
could always say they were allegorical figures representing Cupid and man's 
love of being in love. 
</P>
<P>
 The real mystery remains the question of how Dutch art fell into such a 
bizarre style. The two answers are Michelangelo and Charles V of Spain. Like 
Picasso in this century, Michelangelo gave younger artists the feeling there 
was nothing left to do. It made them a little crazy.  
</P>
<P>
 This was because, in the 16th Century, Spain was on a rapacious roll. Charles 
V sacked Rome and laid claim to the Netherlands. That made everybody a little 
crazy. In 1568, the Dutch revolted, led by William of Orange. Eleven years 
later the seven Northern provinces became a republic. Meantime Holland had 
turned into a major mercantile sea power as suggested by William van de Velde 
The Elder's "Figures on Board Small Merchant Vessels." They were rich, they 
were free to be themselves -- democratic, earthy, tolerant and humane. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 17th Century, Holland's rising power caused an aesthetic revolution 
that was as dramatic as the transformation of American art after World War II. 
The Netherlands enjoyed a bourgeois utopia in the 17th Century. It invented the 
supply-and-demand art market as we know it today. Its artists worked to please 
ordinary well-heeled burghers. Their success still shows in the rapt attention 
viewers pay this little show. 
</P>
<P>
 The genius of the Dutch Golden Age was, of course, Rembrandt Harmensz van 
Rijn. There are just four of his drawings on view but they are as astonishing 
as they are unassuming. "Sailing Boat on a Wide Expanse of Water" demonstrates 
Rembrandt's knack for unforced perfection. The placement and texture of the 
land mass and little skiff are flawless without calling attention to 
themselves. His line seems exactly calibrated to become form or atmosphere at 
his will. But here, as in the other examples, his virtuosity never calls 
attention to itself. One's mind stays on scenes that seem to reassure us of the 
perfection of ordinary life. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no insult to say that everyone else looks a bit forced by comparison. 
Jacob van Ruisdael's reputation as a forerunner of Romanticism is confirmed by 
the brooding of his "Dead Tree by a Stream at the Foot of a Hill." Leanings to 
abstract purism are adumbrated by Aelbert Cuyp's "View of the Rhine Valley." 
The scene is almost pure texture. It reminds us that Mondrian painted 
landscapes too. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed from the Mannerist yolk, Dutch artists turned to the rollicking reality 
of picturesque genre. Adriaen van Ostade's color composition "Peasant Festival 
in a Town Street" combines the intimacy of drawing with the detail of painting. 
In all of this there is a curious comparison to Chinese art. Both show 
humankind and nature as parts of one another.

'SOUND OF MUSIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Sound of Music" is "a problem" to be solved? (" 'Sound' Is Back With All 
Its Trappings," Aug. 11). The lyrics to "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning" are a 
"tired cliche"? And "My Favorite Things" contains a "lyric to choke on"? Then 
why give valuable space to something so un-hip as a musical? After all, songs 
and albums such as "Doggystyle," "Sexy MF," "Baby's Got Back," "Achy Breaky 
Heart" and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" could use some more exposure, and they are 
certain to stand the test of time a lot better than a tired old cliche like 
"The Sound of Music."

'FORREST GUMP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a world of instant gratification where one is increasingly viewed as real 
only as part of society and valued only insofar as one serves it, "Forrest 
Gump" succeeds when it reaffirms our deepest-held belief that individuals count 
and a proper (enlightened) life is possible. However, "Forrest Gump" fails when 
it portrays a man "overcoming" life's trials and tribulations -- not by 
applying his mind so much, as by being lucky.

Better yet, a personally designed limited-edition hand-painted 
bead-and-fringe-trimmed denim jacket for $400 from Neiman-Marcus . . . aargh!

IT'S SCANDALOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About a month ago, while up to our eyeballs in news coverage of the Nicole 
Brown Simpson-Ronald Lyle Goldman double murder, friends and I got to 
discussing the phenomenon of scandal that has plagued our country of late. It 
became an even more engrossing topic once we began listing the many public 
spectacles some of us Generation X-ers have witnessed in our short lifetimes. 
In no time at all, we were the proud parents of a list of 40 events that have 
captivated the United States since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Were we shocked by this seemingly high number? Well, no. While 40 is pretty 
high for any 3 1/2-year period, what did shock us was the discovery that almost 
half the events occurred in Los Angeles County. Preposterous, we thought. Sure, 
L.A. can be a pretty scandalous town at times, but it's no worse than New York 
or San Francisco. We wondered if this disproportion was due to the fact that we 
are an armpit society, or rather because we coexist with the entertainment 
industry. I vote for the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, this became most obvious on a recent trip to Philadelphia, where I 
found myself amazed at how little coverage was given to Simpson's arraignment. 
Just like the entire nation, the whole affair was broadcast live and then 
reported again on the local news and in the papers. But then it was over. Over. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is this? Why must Los Angeles be subjected to such saturation? Maybe it 
has become cliche to bash the media these days; still it's safe to say that a 
little balanced reporting goes a long, long way. I wish we had more of it. 
</P>
<P>
 As for my friends and I, we did try to create a separate list of heroes to 
help counter our scandal sheet. Unfortunately, it didn't happen as easily as 
we'd hoped (surprisingly, all our candidates were international!), and we're 
still working on it. It's been tough going, though, and we'd really appreciate 
some assistance. Funny, we've been watching the news and reading the papers for 
inspiration -- but we haven't found any yet.

FILM PROFITS DON'T DISCRIMINATE BY AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerning Susanne Gayle Harris' Aug. 12 article on age discrimination, 
"Seniors in the Industry Strategize for Hollywood Jobs": 
</P>
<P>
 Neither approach being considered by the Writers Guild Age Awareness Committee 
has much chance of working. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers are driven by the need for success and profits. Whether or not labor 
practices are unfair is an academic question. Developing programming for mature 
audiences is an admirable goal, but there's no reason why this should be done 
by older people. 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer on the aging process recently pointed out, the best way for older 
people to become ossified is to associate entirely with their peers. Carry this 
philosophy to its extreme and you could say that only cops should make cop 
shows and only doctors should film in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The way for older, creative people to get work is very simple. Producers just 
need to realize that the mature person will do it better -- whether the subject 
be babies, oversexed teen-agers or septuagenarians. 
</P>
<P>
 And they can. Mature writers have learned how to structure stories. They can 
draw on a lifetime of experience and wisdom to give their work reality, depth 
and significance. They know how to develop character. 
</P>
<P>
 And directors have encountered enough situations to know how to solve problems 
when they arise. If time or circumstances preclude creativity, they can fall 
back on technique. They know the secrets of communicating with actors and don't 
waste time and film on coverage they'll never use. 
</P>
<P>
 If producers believe that older people can do the job faster, better and 
cheaper than the kids, no one will need to worry about lack of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also refers to non-union production and the flood of film school 
students willing to work cheap. Remember that many older people actually need 
very little money -- they own their homes, their kids are through school, they 
have investments and pensions, some even draw Social Security. They are able 
and often quite willing to work for nominal salaries because they enjoy what 
they do. And, unlike the kids, who see each job as a steppingstone to 
Spielberg-class fame, they are more often disposed to do what's best for the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Before assuming an experienced filmmaker is out of their price range, 
producers should try asking. They might be pleasantly surprised.

DANCE REVIEW; FLAMENCO TROUPE PRESENTS A FLASHY PROGRAM IN BREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With her fierce intensity and seamlessly expressive technique, La Tania evokes 
the power and mystique missing from so many programs in this era of debased 
flamenco stage shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Soleares on Thursday at the Curtis Theatre in Brea, La Tania made every 
movement an expression of anguish and individuality, evoking unspoken 
narratives of inner and outer states. Dancing as a guest, she dominated a 
program by Juan Talavera's flamenco troupe, which otherwise emphasized genial 
and extroverted theatrical values, with dollops of show-biz pizazz and 
easy-sell hip-swinging. Adios , pena Andaluz.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacing, even in the Canto Jondo selections, tended to be fast. The male and 
female corps were locked in symmetrical patterns. The whole was 
over-choreographed. In their "Viva Cadiz!" duet, for instance, the gaunt, 
intense Talavera and the willowy Gabriela Garza were shadowed and framed by 
four extraneous male dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 In other departures from elusive flamenco puro standards, Antonia Lopez used a 
black sombrero to cover extravagant rolling hip-moves in "Tanguillos de Cadiz." 
Angelina Valenzuela discarded the appealing vulnerability in an early Alegrias 
for audience-courting in the Fiesta por Tangos. 
</P>
<P>
 With her hollow-toned, pulsing vocalism, guest Pepa Sevilla remained an 
expressive singer, although her explosive stage persona and dancing pushed the 
boundaries of modesty. Guest Lourdes Rodriguez, however, danced a sturdy, 
stylish Alegrias. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Sevilla, the capable singers were Charo Monge and Antonio de 
Jerez. The underutilized musicians included guitarists Benito Placios, Antonio 
Triana II, Rafael Aragon and El Coro Rociero de la Pena Andaluza ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Talavera is hoping to establish a beachhead for flamenco in Orange County. The 
Thursday program (repeated tonight) follows a series at the Curtis in May. 
Another set is promised in December, although no dates have been announced. But 
there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a modest and comfortable facility, providing intimacy with its 
199-seat capacity, the pressed-board stage muffles heel and foot stamping and 
considerably narrows the dancer's range of tonal effects. This is an issue that 
needs to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Flamenco Talavera" will be repeated tonight at 8:30 at the Curtis Theatre, 
1 Civic Center Drive, Brea. Tickets: $29.75. Information: (714) 990-7722.

TV REVIEWS; 'ENEMY WITHIN' A '90S 'SEVEN DAYS IN MAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been 30 years since the thriller "Seven Days in May" spun its suspenseful 
tale of a U.S. military coup threatening to topple a politically shaky White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Now get ready for the remake, HBO's "The Enemy Within," which effectively 
updates the novel (by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II) and screen 
adaptation (by Rod Serling) into a military coup for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the late 1990s, the Pentagon is chafing under dwindling budgets and 
lost influence, and a liberal President (Sam Waterston) with a popularity 
rating of 28% is about to veto a defense appropriation bill and redirect the 
money to social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarkable similarity between this besieged chief executive and President 
Clinton is not coincidental. It's also part of the fun. Waterston's President 
Foster even has the nation's first female chief of staff (the no-nonsense Dana 
Delany). 
</P>
<P>
 The production's star and unlikely hero is Forest Whitaker as a loyal, 
by-the-book officer to the Joint Chiefs of Staff who stumbles across plans on 
his computer for a covert military takeover of the government. The ultimate 
patriot, Whitaker grows into the ultimate whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief villain, among many jackals surrounding the President in and out of his 
Cabinet, is Jason Robards as the nefarious head of the Joint Chiefs, who makes 
a good traitor by affecting a kind of Oliver North sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 The screenplay by Darryl Ponicsan and Ron Bass, despite irrelevant domestic 
scenes that dog the plot, is essentially faithful to the ever-timely idea of 
John Frankenheimer's 1964 movie while also mirroring the world's changes since 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this conspiracy yarn may have lost its freshness, the strength of the 
movie lies in its gathering acceleration and a knockout finale in the Oval 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Enemy Within" premieres at 8 tonight on HBO. RAY LOYND

 SELECTIVE SQUEALING: To reduce traffic dangers, highway patrol agencies 
nationwide are asking motorists with cellular telephones to call in about 
reckless drivers. In California, just call 911. . . . Local California Highway 
Patrol spokesman Michael L. Lundquist says it welcomes calls about erratic 
driving. But please, don't call in speeders, he says: "That wouldn't be 
realistic, since 99.9% of the people on our freeways are already speeding. The 
calls would bog down our lines so much we wouldn't be able to take care of 
emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
 OVER REACHING OUT: The Seal Beach City Council's new budget keeps intact an 
11% tax on residents' monthly telephone, electric and gas bills. The tax is the 
highest in Orange County. . . . The one dissenting vote came from Councilman 
William J. Doane, who represents the Leisure World retirement community. He 
says the tax strikes at the heart of "the one thing Leisure World residents 
enjoy so much" -- long-distance calls to their children across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 SAY CHEESE: As a Hillary Clinton look-alike, Teresa Barnwell of Costa Mesa has 
appeared in a "Tonight Show" skit with Jay Leno. But her most revealing Hillary 
gig appears in a national magazine ad for Joe Boxer underwear in which she and 
"Bill" show their undies -- yellow boxers with large happy faces. . . . 
Barnwell, a Democrat, admits she's nervous about it. "The President's had such 
a rough time lately, and here we are with our pants down. I hope the Clintons 
have a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 BONUS DUTY: The Newport Beach-based consul general for the Marshall Islands 
republic in the Central Pacific has a new role -- helping out youngsters with 
their homework. . . . Taraur Ria, its educational attache, has worked out a 
plan with the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. Schools will call him if 
any of the more than 200 children from the Marshall Islands have homework 
trouble. Ria will then work with the students and parents. Says district Supt. 
Mac Bernd: "It's just a fantastic idea."

CLINTON HALTS SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR CUBANS; REFUGEES: DECADES-OLD PROGRAM 
FAVORING IMMIGRANTS IS REVERSED. SWEEPING NEW U.S. POLICY CALLED PERMANENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an announcement that stunned Cubans and their relatives in this country, 
President Clinton said Friday that refugees from Fidel Castro's communist 
nation will no longer receive preferential treatment from the United States or 
special help in resettling in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made clear that the new plan for detaining Cubans arriving by the 
hundreds in boats is instead a sweeping new policy, rather than a temporary 
arrangement, that permanently reverses nearly 30 years of precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to avoid a repeat of the 1980 Mariel boat lift, which saw 125,000 
Cubans enter the country in a seaborne exodus, Clinton said that Castro is 
again trying to export his nation's political and economic crises to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This action is a cold-blooded attempt to maintain the Castro grip on Cuba and 
to divert attention from his failed communist policies," Clinton said at an 
afternoon press conference at the White House. "Let me be clear: the Cuban 
government will not succeed in any attempt to dictate American immigration 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton vowed that there would be no repeat of the 1980 experience -- in which 
throngs of people, including some with criminal records, mental problems or 
contagious diseases -- were turned loose from Cuban shores aboard boats bound 
for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 120,000 people sent to this country as a deliberate attempt . . . to 
export all the problems of Cuba to the United States," Clinton said. "We tried 
it that way once. It was wrong then and it's wrong now, and I'm not going to 
let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida authorities welcomed the Clinton announcement but refugee advocates 
and some Republicans deplored it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban Americans received the news with mixed emotions. Some worried that their 
friends and relatives still in Cuba would have no hope of reaching this 
country. Others were gratified that Castro's effort to rid himself of political 
foes was being thwarted and that the Mariel boat lift, which caused a backlash 
against Cuban Americans, will not be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton did not mention it, the 1980 Mariel refugee flood was one of 
the central issues in his defeat that year in a bid for reelection as governor 
of Arkansas. Hundreds of Marielistas temporarily housed at Ft. Chafee, Ark., 
rioted and many escaped, provoking widespread citizen outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton at the time blamed federal authorities for not giving him enough money 
or troops to properly police the Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 7,000 Cubans have landed in Florida this year, nearly twice the 
total for all of 1993. In August alone, the Coast Guard has rescued more than 
2,700 Cuban refugees from the Florida Straits, including 547 Cubans on 
Wednesday, the biggest single day since the 1980 exodus. Friday's total by 5 
p.m. PDT was 454. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro has not publicly urged his citizens to flee but Florida and federal 
officials accuse him of tacitly encouraging the exodus to lessen political 
pressure on his regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that additional Coast Guard and Navy ships would 
be sent to patrol the waters between Cuba and the South Florida coastline. Some 
vessels would be diverted from duty off Haiti and from anti-drug missions, 
Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, Cubans reaching American soil or picked up at sea were rapidly 
released into American society after only cursory screening under terms of a 
1966 law, the Cuban Adjustment Act. Many were released to family or friends in 
Miami while their applications for permanent residency were considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Cubans who make it to the United States will be housed 
indefinitely at the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Krome Detention 
Center just west of Miami while their residency applications are considered. It 
is anticipated that some eventually will be granted residency, but the process 
will be protracted and the outcome uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubans plucked from the sea will be taken to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba, for detention. About 14,000 Haitian refugees are already housed at 
Guantanamo in a makeshift tent city. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are seeking facilities in third countries for the Cubans, as they 
have for Haitians. Several Caribbean nations tentatively have agreed to house 
the refugees, but no facilities are yet in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said that no Cubans would be sent back to Cuba against 
their will. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said the Administration is determined not to let Castro have "a safety 
valve" on public unrest stemming from Cuba's deteriorating economy. She said 
that Cubans who want to come to the United States should apply through a 
processing system in place in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's goal, Reno said, is to stand up to Castro and "not let 
him dupe us as he did in 1980." At that time, she was chief prosecutor in 
Florida's Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's action came just hours after Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles declared a 
state of emergency and threatened to call out the National Guard to help stem 
the influx of Cuban refugees, who have been landing in Florida at the rate of 
about 500 a day all week. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles said that Florida could not stand a repeat of the 1980 experience and 
said that Clinton's action should encourage Cubans to remain home and work for 
the downfall of the Castro government. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Catholic Conference, however, said that it was "surprised and 
concerned" by Clinton's policy reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned that more than half of those fleeing are families with young 
children and elderly members and we want to continue to insure their safety," 
said John Swenson of the conference's Office of Refugee Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Five members of Congress, representing districts in Florida and New Jersey 
with Cuban American constituencies, criticized Clinton and demanded that the 
United States unilaterally impose a naval blockade on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Haiti's ports are blockaded and overt and covert aid is being provided 
pro-democracy forces in Haiti, so too must it be in Cuba," said Florida 
Republican Lincoln Diaz-Balart. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) also took issue with the Clinton 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton should call on Fidel Castro to step down immediately," Dole 
said in a press release issued even before the President spoke. "President 
Clinton should make it clear to Fidel Castro that sending the occupants of 
Cuban prisons, insane asylums and hospitals to Florida will be considered an 
act of aggression against the U.S. -- and the U.S. will respond appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
 In his press conference, Clinton firmly rejected a suggestion that he open a 
political dialogue with Castro, as he and other American leaders have with 
heads of other communist governments. He also ruled out lifting the U.S. 
economic embargo against Havana, which has been in place since shortly after 
Castro seized power in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real problem is the stubborn refusal of the Castro regime to have an open 
democracy and an open economy, and I think the policies we are following will 
hasten the day when that occurs," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also firmly warned Cuban-Americans against using their own boats to rescue 
Cuban immigrants. Many Cubans who fled during the Mariel boat lift were picked 
up by friends and relatives in Florida who went out to sea to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States will detain, investigate and, if necessary, prosecute 
Americans who take to the sea to pick up Cubans," Clinton said. "Vessels used 
in such activities will be seized." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, Cable News Network reported that Clinton has ordered four new 
steps intended to increase the pressure on Castro's regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The network said that the State Department will announce soon that it will 
seek U.N. condemnation of alleged human rights abuses in Cuba. The 
Administration was also reported to be planning to cut in half the amount of 
cash that Cuban Americans can send home to relatives, from $300 a quarter to 
$150, to boost anti-Castro broadcasts to Cuba and to reduce the number of 
authorized charter flights from the United States to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN also said that Clinton was discussing the policy changes with Chiles and a 
group of Cuban American leaders at the White House on Friday night.

WENDELL JAMES FRANKLIN, 78; PIONEERING HOLLYWOOD EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wendell James Franklin, a pioneering Hollywood executive who in 1960 became 
the first African American member of the Directors Guild of America, has died. 
He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin died of cancer in Los Angeles on July 22, Joe Bleeden, a friend for 
40 years, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin began his entertainment career as a parking attendant at NBC. Within 
a dozen years, he had become the second African American stage director in 
network television. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin was stage manager for several live shows including "The Jerry Lewis 
Show," "The Nat King Cole Show," "Queen for a Day" and "This Is Your Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the popular television shows he helped direct were "McMillan and Wife," 
"Green Hornet" and the 1969-71 "Bill Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin worked for all the major film studios, and was assistant director of 
such hits as "The Greatest Story Ever Told," "Funny Girl" and "McHale's Navy." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Greatest Story," about the life of Christ, in 1965, Franklin received a 
plaque from the Los Angeles City Council and the People's Independent Church of 
Christ recognizing his efforts to promote harmonious race relations within the 
movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin was also honored over the years by the Los Angeles Human Relations 
Commission, San Francisco International Film Festival and Black Filmmaker Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 He served on the Los Angeles County Housing Commission and was president of 
the Beverly Hills NAACP. During World War II, he served in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include a son, Wendell Valentine Franklin.

FOG HELPS FIREFIGHTERS CONTAIN SAN LUIS OBISPO BLAZE

<P>
 A shroud of fog enveloped a nearby 76-square-mile burn area and helped 
firefighters declare the fire 100% contained, or surrounded, Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Full control of the 48,351-acre blaze was expected at dawn Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arson fire, which started Sunday, has destroyed 37 homes, 31 outbuildings 
and 35 vehicles. Damage was estimated at more than $10 million and the 
firefighting cost was expected to top $5 million, said Cindy Wesney, a 
California Department of Forestry spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 firefighters remained on the lines Friday. The fire was 
deliberately set in the Devils Gap area off California 41. Gov. Pete Wilson 
announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the 
arsonist, Wesney said. There have been no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, near Loyalton on the California-Nevada border north of Lake Tahoe, 
a rural subdivision escaped devastation for a second time when a fire that had 
been turned away less than 24 hours before turned around and roared back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did exactly what we feared most," resident Terri Kludt said. "It was 
terrifying all day yesterday. . . . But, now, we were in it today." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were urged to evacuate, but an estimated 1,100 firefighters aided by 
air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers prevented the Cottonwood fire from 
engulfing the 150-home Sierra Brooks subdivision.

 A forklift operator punctured a barrel of acid, creating fumes that caused 
minor injuries to 23 warehouse workers and three firefighters. About 11 gallons 
of cresylic acid spilled from the 15-gallon drum on Thursday. The odorless 
acid, used in plastics and disinfectants, is fatal if inhaled in large doses, 
officials said.

 Nearly three days after the music stopped at Woodstock '94, a woman was 
arrested for refusing to leave the concert site.

leave the concert grounds Wednesday afternoon, state police said. The concert 
ended early Monday morning. 
</P>

 She was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest, and spent a night 
in the Ulster County Jail before being released Thursday, police said.

SWIMMING; PHELPS, 14, WATCHES STAR RISE WITH SWIFT 200 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitney Phelps established herself as one of America's rising female swimming 
stars Friday by winning the 200-meter butterfly in 2 minutes 11.04 seconds at 
the National Swimming Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old's time was the third best in the world this year.Only Limin 
Liu and Zhu Hong, both of China, have gone faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps, of Towsend, Md., won her championship in a final that included four 
former national champions. Sarah Anderson, who had the fastest qualifying time 
but was last after the first 50 meters, finished second in 2:12.83 and Michelle 
Griglione, the recent Goodwill Games champion who won the event in this year's 
spring nationals was third in 2:13.00. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that I had a chance to win. I didn't think about the competition," 
Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners on the final day to qualify for next month's World Championships 
at Rome included Olympic silver medalist Greg Burgess, 200 individual medley, 
2:00.90; Amy Van Dyken, 50 freestyle, 25.37; three-time national mile champion 
Carlton Bruner, 1,500 freestyle, 15:12.37, and Barbara Bedford, 200 backstroke, 
2:11.29. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet ends today with the women's 1,500 freestyle and the men's 800 
freestyle -- two non-Olympic events excluded from the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Thompson, who set the American record of 25.20 at the 1992 Olympic 
trials, was third in the 50 freestyle in 25.91 as she failed to win her third 
national championship of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Carvin also failed to become a triple winner. The winner of the 200- and 
400-freestyle events finished second to Bruner in 15:15.54 in 1,500 freestyle.

MORNING BRIEFING: BOWL DEFEAT HAS HURRICANES SEEING RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not easy being a Miami Hurricane. You go 9-3 and fans talk about the 
season as a disaster. Of course, that 29-0 loss to Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl 
might have something to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk at this time of the year is normally of an encore. Not in 1994. It's 
of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miami's dead? Come play us then," defensive tackle Warren Sapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 A rugged schedule includes games at Arizona State, West Virginia and Syracuse. 
Florida State, Washington and Boston College will be among the challengers at 
the Orange Bowl, where the Hurricanes have 57 consecutive victories, matching 
Alabama's NCAA record for the longest home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 So when ESPN commentator Lee Corso predicted that Miami would lose to Arizona 
State, Washington and Florida State, Coach Dennis Erickson had a response ready 
for a booster club meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way Arizona State is going to beat us," he said. "Washington 
beating us in the Orange Bowl? Are you kidding? And there is no way Florida 
State is going to come down here and beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about clipping and saving that comment. You can always look on 
Florida State's bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: A.C. Green has the longest streak of consecutive appearances 
among current NBA players, but who is the current leader for consecutive 
starts? 
</P>
<P>
 Racket racket: Should anyone have been surprised when Jim Courier announced 
earlier this week that he was taking a hiatus from tennis? Not anyone who 
remembered the sight of one of the game's most talented players -- No. 1 only 
13 months ago -- reading a novel during changeovers of his match at the 
$3-million ATP World Championships last November, one of the most lucrative 
tournaments on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beside the feeling that we've been down this burnout road with tennis players 
before, the most disturbing facet of Courier's decision is that he's among the 
players who have tried hard to be more than a tennis robot," Johnette Howard 
writes in the Washington Post. "For the last three years especially, Courier 
was actively searching for something beyond tennis. And it seemed important to 
him to make choices that reeked integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He eschewed the air-conditioned luxury hotel suites the other tennis pros 
chose at the Barcelona Olympics and stayed in the athletes' village to get what 
he called 'the full experience' of the Games. After winning his second French 
Open title, he surprised and charmed the Parisian crowd by delivering portions 
of his victory speech in French. He grew sick of the road, but tried to make 
the best of it by making time to see the sights in Rome or London or Khartoum 
when tennis took him there. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far back as 1991, Courier's traveling coach, Brad Stine, was counseling 
Courier to take a two- or three-month break before his Angst consumed him. 
Stine, who was fired earlier this year, had Courier pegged, it seems. And 
Courier just didn't want to hear it anymore. Maybe now he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice knowing you: When Jim Hess accepted the job as football coach at New 
Mexico State five years ago, one reason was a promise from the administration 
to pump additional money into the recruiting budget. He should have read the 
small print. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they'd raise the budget a couple of hundred thousand dollars 
each year," Hess said. "But they didn't tell me I'd have to play Florida and 
Arizona to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 He does, consecutively, on the road to open this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: John Stockton, with 363. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Jimmy Johnson, on Fox-TV colleague Terry Bradshaw: "Terry talks 
before he thinks, but I don't think it would make any difference if he thought 
first." SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

GONZALES WINS DECISION OVER DE LA HOYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "His Torch Burns Out" (Aug 10): 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 Olympics, I twice wrote to Oscar De La Hoya, inviting him to be 
a guest speaker in my introductory course to Chicano Studies, but I did not get 
the courtesy of a response. 
</P>
<P>
 After the '84 Olympics, I wrote Paul Gonzales and his response was, "Yes, I 
would love to be a speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 That De La Hoya has been jeered during introductions to his recent boxing 
matches should surprise only outsiders. In character and style, Gonzales 
outranks De La Hoya.

GOLF ROUNDUP; LOWERY USES SANDY ROUTE TO TAKE THE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Showing little fear of sand and little regard for his better-known 
competitors, Steve Lowery carded seven birdies in a bogey-free round Friday to 
take the lead at the halfway point of the International at Castle Rock, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, whose best finish in seven seasons on the PGA Tour was a second at San 
Diego earlier this year, earned 14 points and had a two-round total of 21 
points under the modified Stableford system, which awards points for birdies 
and eagles and subtracts them for bogeys and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery birdied all four of the par fives. On three of them, he hit his second 
shot into sand bordering the green and got up and down for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say sand play is the strength of my game," Lowery said, "but it 
was good today. I was fortunate that on all of those bunker shots, I had room 
to land the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Equaling Lowery's 14 as the day's best score was Dave Stockton Jr., who was at 
20 along with Mike Reid. Keith Clearwater had 19 points, Tom Lehman 17 and Tom 
Kite 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale Irwin, who holed out a pitching wedge at the par-four 15th for an eagle 
worth five points, was in a group at 15. 
</P>
<P>
 First-round leader Bruce Lietzke, who began the day with 16 points, was at 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal vaulted into contention with an eagle and 
two birdies -- worth nine points -- in a span of four holes to finish at 13 
along with 1986 International champion Ken Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those missing the cut were John Daly and John Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the scoring system, a player receives eight points for a double eagle, 
five for eagle, two for birdie, minus one for bogey and minus three for double 
bogey or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Rhyan shot a six-under-par 66 to take a one-stroke lead after the first 
round of the Burnet Senior Classic at Coon Rapids, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Weiskopf and George Archer were one stroke back. Dave Stockton, Bob E. 
Smith and Jim Dent were two behind the leader. Jim Albus, Larry Gilbert and Bob 
Brue each shot 69 at the 6,909-yard Bunker Hills Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhyan, an eighth-year senior still looking for his first tour victory, hadn't 
led after any round since shooting a 65 on the first day of the NYNEX 
Commemorative in June of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're getting four or five under and then you give two back, you think 
maybe that your nerves can't handle it any more," he said. "I'm going to be 60 
in November and I wonder." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Peterson-Parker shot an even-par 72 and is tied at 137 with Kathryn 
Marshall, Janice Gibson, Michelle Estill, Dale Eggeling and Jane Geddes in the 
second-round of the lightning-delayed LPGA Chicago Challenge at Naperville, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven players were still on the White Eagle golf course when play was delayed 
by lightning and later suspended because of the threat of a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall had the day's best round with a bogey-free 66 in the windy 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Shipman (69), Barb Mucha (70), Cathy Johnston-Forbes (70), Margaret Platt 
Platt (70), Michelle McGann (71) and Susie Redman (71) were two back at 139.

<P>
 With USC tailbacks Shawn Walters, David Dotson, Leonard Green and Rodney 
Sermons temporarily sidelined because of injuries, freshman Delon Washington 
seized the opportunity to shine in Friday afternoon's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 LaVale Woods, a freshman redshirt last season because of a knee injury, also 
played well. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington had several nice runs against the Trojans' first defense. A 10.33 
sprinter, Washington rushed for 1,579 yards, averaging 6.9 yards per carry, as 
a Dallas prep player last year.

 Early last summer, USC journalism student/football player Tony Gnau landed a 
summer internship with Chicago television station WBBM. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, he spent most of the time in the station's newsroom, learning 
about the daily gathering of TV news. But the station became shorthanded in 
late-summer and sports reporter Gnau was suddenly dispatched to ballparks and 
training camps for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great, all of a sudden I was interviewing people on camera every day 
like Ryne Sandberg, Mark Grace and Rick Wilkins of the Cubs; Tim Raines, Alex 
Fernandez and Gene Lamont of the White Sox, and Mark Carrier and Curtis Conway 
of the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I even interviewed Tommy Lasorda."

 Gnau, a scout team senior, says he wants to work for a Chicago or Los Angeles 
television station after graduating.

LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL; NORTHRIDGE WINS, 17-7, WILL GO TO WORLD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Northridge scored 10 runs in the sixth inning Friday night to defeat Waianae, 
Hawaii, 17-7, before 8,800 and qualify for the Little League World Series in 
Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Cunningham, the Northridge catcher, led off the sixth with a home run and 
added a grand slam later in the inning. Northridge pounded 18 hits and every 
starter had at least one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to take this team out," said Peter Tuber, the winning pitcher. "That 
last inning, we were pumped." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber, grandson of former Dodger and National League batting champion Pete 
Reiser, came on in relief of Justin Gentile in the first inning with the bases 
loaded, two out and Hawaii leading, 4-3. He got a strikeout and went on to 
strike out 11 en route to his third victory in the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (17-0, 5-0 in regional play) will play Central Region champion 
Brooklyn, Minn., at 4 p.m. PDT Monday in Williamsport. Northridge, which has 
outscored opponents, 221-41, is the third team in a row from Southern 
California to represent the Western Region at the World Series. Long Beach is 
two-time World Series champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Matt Fisher homered, doubled and singled for Northridge, and center 
fielder Nathaniel Dunlap homered and singled twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii took a 6-3 lead in the second inning, but the Northridge players 
believed it would only be a matter of time before they got to Hawaii starter 
Christen Asinsin.

 "We had to come back and we knew we could," Cunningham said. "Their pitcher 
was throwing so many pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Asinsin, who had pitched a day earlier in a victory over Utah, threw 126 
pitches before leaving with one out in the sixth and Northridge leading, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge went ahead, 7-6, in the third, but a solo home run by Fred Taitin 
in the fifth tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we were going to Williamsport when that ball went over the fence," 
Cunningham said of his leadoff home run in the sixth.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; WALKER'S STRENGTH UP, FORTUNES DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Rob Walker is stronger, throwing the ball better than ever but the 
probability of his playing has greatly diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, a junior who has started six games for UCLA, is listed as third on the 
depth chart, behind starter Wayne Cook and Ryan Fien, returning from a redshirt 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a lot of time on a weight program and worked to use my legs instead 
of just throwing with my arm," Walker said. "I think that's been my problem all 
along, using too much of my arm in throwing the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 His detractors have pointed to his lack of arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
 This time a year ago, he was competing for the starting job with Cook and 
Fien, based on five starts as a freshman when Cook was injured. When Fien was 
injured, Walker became second string, throwing two touchdown passes in a 40-27 
victory over Washington State when Cook was injured, then starting and 
struggling the next week in a 9-3 loss to Arizona State while playing with a 
knee that later required surgery because of cartilage damage. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Walker's role was defined from the first day of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He handles it, knowing there is little he can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have to do now is to pick up as much mentally in practice as I can," 
he said. "I know I won't get the repetitions that Wayne and Ryan get, but I 
have to be ready. I know what can happen around here. I know what happened two 
years ago with John Barnes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two seasons ago, after Cook, Walker and Fien were injured, Barnes became a 
one-game Bruin legend, leading them to a 38-37 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, who had often talked of a desire to try professional football, got 
that chance -- in a way. He recently returned to the United States after a 
season playing in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 4-7, but we made the playoffs," Barnes said of his Turin team. "It 
was a lot of fun there. There was only one American on a team, and the crowds 
were small. But you had plenty of coaches. As soon as a fan saw you play and 
learned a little about the game, he would become a coach in the stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes recently took a job selling medical supplies in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the top three tailbacks -- Sharmon Shah, Derek Ayers and Skip Hicks -- 
injured, a new name was added to the mix, by necessity. Freshman Shaun 
Williams, who has stood out as a safety in early drills, moved over to offense 
for a few plays Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams played both ways at Crespi High, rushing for 1,835 yards and 23 
touchdowns as a senior, and also making 100 tackles and three interceptions.

 Florida made school history by becoming the first Gator team to be ranked No. 
1 in the USA TODAY/CNN poll. USC and UCLA held down the 14th and 15th spots 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators apparently welcome the poll, which gave them a slight edge over 
last season's No. 1 team, Florida State, with 17 first-place votes to the 
Seminoles' 13. Florida had 1,416 total points to Florida State's 1,402. The 
teams will meet on Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you come to college for," Gator defensive back Larry Kennedy 
said. "To be No. 1. That's what we all dream about." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Steve Spurrier likes his team's chances, saying, "I don't know if we can 
hold it, but I would think our team is about as good as anyone around." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska (1,375) was No. 3 while Notre Dame (1,362) and Michigan (1,302) were 
fourth and fifth. The Irish and Wolverines play on Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (1,037) was the highest ranked Pac-10 school at No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had 692 points and UCLA had 677.

 Chris Jacke's 36-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter gave the Green Bay 
Packers a 13-10 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Friday night at the 
Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers (2-1) spoiled the Saints' first exhibition home game this season 
with Jacke's second field goal of the game. It came after Tommy Barnhardt's 
34-yard punt put Green Bay on New Orleans' 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Brunell, Green Bay's quarterback in the fourth quarter, scrambled 12 
yards in the 28-yard drive before Jacke kicked the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ram Jim Everett, making his first start in the Superdome as a member of 
the Saints (0-3), gave New Orleans a 7-0 lead seven plays into the game. 
Everett passed for 56 yards in the 63-yard drive before Derek Brown scored from 
one-yard out. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett completed 10 of 16 for 102 yards, had one interception and was sacked 
once in the first half.

 The Browns (3-0) ensured their best exhibition season record in four years 
under Coach Bill Belichick. They last went 4-0 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta (2-2) committed five turnovers and 16 penalties, ruining reasonably 
good performances by quarterback Jeff George (114 yards, one touchdown) and 
running back Erric Pegram (20 carries, 84 yards).

DEL MAR; TRAINER GILCHRIST HOPES TO GO THREE FOR (ALL) THREE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Greg Gilchrist was sitting in a viewing stand along the backstretch at 
the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, leaning forward and squinting for a look at five 
horses charging in his direction from the six-furlong chute. As they went past 
him, No. 5 was in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't stick," Gilchrist said, more to himself than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilchrist watched the field as it ultimately disappeared behind the tote board 
on the front straightaway. The cheers of the crowd would tell him nothing, but 
he already knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sold that horse a week ago," he said. "I had six horses down here when the 
meet started. I had one claimed, I sent one home and I sold that one. I'm down 
to three." 
</P>
<P>
 Barn U, tucked against the track and a maintenance yard at the west end of the 
backstretch, is becoming a lonely place. That's the Southern California home of 
Gilchrist's stable, which is headquartered at whatever Northern California 
track is active. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of Gilchrist's horses are entered to run Sunday, one in the featured 
Del Mar Oaks, another in a $100,000 match race, and the third, the baby of the 
trio, in a maiden race for 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be very profitable," he said. "Or it could be a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused and caught himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really," he said, "it's kind of a convenience having them all go at once. 
I'll probably pack up Monday and head home." 
</P>
<P>
 And this convenience is also an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of his horses to run will be Mamselle Bebette, in a match race 
against Soviet Problem between the fifth and sixth races. Then Tac Squad, the 
maiden, is to run in the sixth race. Gilchrist's third entrant will be Work The 
Crowd in the Oaks, the $175,000 Grade I feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron has the mounts on Gilchrist's horses in the two high-profile 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't ridden much for Greg but I like what I've seen," McCarron said. 
"His horses impress me a great deal. I know he does very well up north." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilchrist is not the sort to stray too far from home for too long. He was born 
in Ft. Dick, population 75, near Crescent City. He learned horses and racing on 
what might be called the fair circuit. His horses take him across the country 
these days, but not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't ever left California without being glad to be back," he said. The 
same applies to his home in Castro Valley, east of the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
 To Gilchrist, the week before a weekend such as this has probably been quieter 
than most. His horses, two of them at least, are entered in major events, but 
still there are only three here to command his time. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Gilchrist describe these horses, they are the beauty, the beast and 
the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem, the 4-year-old sprinter, is a menacing presence in Barn U. She 
has powerful haunches and a broad chest. She would as soon nip her trainer as a 
bag of oats. 
</P>
<P>
 Work The Crowd, Sardula's main adversary in the Oaks for 3-year-old fillies, 
is long and lean with gracefully shaped legs. She is as charming as Soviet 
Problem is fractious. 
</P>
<P>
 "A novice could look at the two of them and tell which was which," Gilchrist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tac Squad, being a mere 2-year-old, was not subjected to a personality 
profile. She will definitely be deferring to her elders on Sunday, at least 
when it comes to the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Soviet Problem's nature perfectly suits the game she plays, the 
frenzied sprinting game, and Work The Crowd's nature her game, the 
lie-back-and-let's-see-what-happens distance game. One lives life on the edge 
and the other is serenely patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "You train them totally differently," Gilchrist said. "You run Soviet Problem 
short and sharp. Work The Crowd trains harder, getting more strenuous gallops." 
</P>
<P>
 For Soviet Problem, it will be a matter of going head to head against Mamselle 
Bebette from the moment the gate opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to tell Chris to get out and go," Gilchrist said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a different sort of race for Work The Crowd, what with five other 
horses going the 1 1/8 miles. With Twice The Vice, Pharma, Wood Of Bin and 
Malli Star entered along with Sardula and Work The Crowd, there is not a weak 
horse in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to have to contend with some 50-1 shot getting in the way," 
Gilchrist said. "The jocks have a lot of time to get where they want to be and 
they'll be watching one another all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilchrist stood up and stretched, dusting off his jeans. The horse he had been 
watching, the one he had sold, finished fourth among five. It hadn't stuck. 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lykatill Hil, ridden by Gary Stevens, caught Tossofthecoin at the sixteenth 
pole to win the $61,400 Windy Sands Handicap by 1 3/4 lengths before 14,076 at 
Del Mar. The 4-year-old gelding by Pilgrim was timed in 1:34 2/5 for the mile 
and paid $9.00. Tossofthecoin returned $3.00 and $2.40 and Slerp paid $3.40. 
Lykatill Hil earned $34,400 to push his career earnings to $366,700.. . . 
Today's feature is the $100,000 Pat O'Brien Breeders' Cup Handicap, but the 
best race on the card might be the second. The presence of horses such as 
Sardula and Work The Crowd scared some outstanding 3-year-old fillies out of 
Sunday's Del Mar Oaks and into the $60,000 Sandy Blue Handicap. The even-money 
morning-line favorite is Dancing Mirage, a close third to Work The Crowd in the 
San Clemente Handicap. . . . D'Hallevant is the 6-5 morning-line favorite in 
the Pat O'Brien, but Minjinsky is close behind at 9-5. . . . Brocco, the 1993 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner, will make his first start since the Kentucky 
Derby in the $200,000 Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup on Sept. 11. Brocco beat 
Tabasco Cat in the Santa Anita Derby April 9, but finished fourth in Kentucky 
as the second choice.

 Two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus C. Pauling, a leader in the fight against 
nuclear weapons and an advocate of vitamin C to prevent cancer, the common cold 
and other diseases, died Friday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling died at his ranch in the Big Sur area about 7:20 p.m., according to 
the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto. He had been 
in frail health for several months, according to the institute.

 Pauling was the only person ever to win two unshared Nobel Prizes.

 "Life has always been something of a puzzle, which I'm always trying to figure 
out," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1954 for his research on the 
nature of the chemical bond that holds molecules together and its use in 
understanding the structure of such complex substances as protein and 
antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
 He published several books and more than 1,000 scientific papers, continuing 
to put out about a dozen a year well into his 90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has made greater and more varied contributions to modern chemistry" 
than Pauling, said Purdue University professors Herbert C. Brown and Derek A. 
Davenport and Cornell University professor R. Hoffmann in their letter 
nominating him for the Priestly Medal. Pauling won that honor from the American 
Chemical Society in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the double-helix structure of the DNA 
molecule, described Pauling as the "father of molecular biology" and credited 
him for making possible Crick's own pioneering work in genetics. Crick and 
James Watson formulated their model of DNA -- the genetic blueprint common to 
all living things -- in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was his example in building models of molecules and dealing with those 
models creatively that helped us in the discovery of the double helix," Crick 
said at a fete for Pauling on his 85th birthday in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling, the son of a Portland, Ore., pharmacist, graduated from Oregon State 
College (now Oregon State University), obtained a Ph.D. from Caltech and later 
studied under famed physicist Niels Bohr. 
</P>
<P>
 After the development of the atomic bomb, Pauling became a peace advocate and 
campaigned against nuclear weapons. In 1958, he presented a petition to the 
United Nations opposing nuclear weapons tests, a document signed by more than 
11,000 scientists worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 10, 1963, the effective date for the U.S.-Soviet test ban treaty, he 
was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It) was a spectacular recognition of Dr. Pauling's long and strenuous 
efforts to bring before the people of the world the dangers of nuclear war and 
the importance of a test ban agreement," Lee A. Dubridge, president of the 
California Institute of Technology, said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling, an outgoing man with bright blue eyes, often wore a floppy beret on 
his white hair and displayed a wry wit. He said once that the government's 
recommended daily allowance of vitamin C "only keeps you from dying of scurvy." 
</P>
<P>
 It was his theories about vitamin C that made Pauling controversial during the 
past 20 years. He maintained that large doses of ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, 
can protect people from diseases ranging from the common cold to cancer and 
extend the life span by decades. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Pauling established the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and 
Medicine in Palo Alto, which continues research on the beneficial effects of 
vitamin C and other nutrients, on the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling himself took 18,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day; the RDA for adults 
is 60 milligrams. But time and disease caught up with him when he was diagnosed 
with prostate cancer in December, 1991.

JOY, SADNESS FOR LAST REFUGEES TO REACH U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He had thought about it for years, but in the end success came down to a 
matter of scant hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Brenan, who crossed the Florida Straits on a makeshift raft with his 
wife, two sons and his brother-in-law, smiled broadly Friday as he realized 
that he was one of the last people to get to American shores before the 
open-door policy for Cuban refugees slammed shut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a brand new person," the 38-year-old auto mechanic said after 
taking his first shower in America and donning clean clothes. "I'm very happy 
that my sons will have what I didn't have my whole life -- freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 As Brenan and his family ate black beans and rice and began to make plans for 
life in America, hundreds of other families that weathered the same 
shark-infested waters faced a fate much less certain. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, hundreds of families like the Brenans passed through the Transit 
Center for Cuban Refugees on this tiny Florida Key, just a stone's throw from 
Key West. For two years, the center, operated by a Cuban American businessman, 
has fed and clothed refugees who escaped from Cuba and made the perilous voyage 
to America, and then help match them up with relatives, friends or social 
services in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 But only two families made it to the center Friday. Those picked up by Coast 
Guard cutters after the Clinton Administration's new Cuban refugee policy was 
announced late Thursday by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno were taken to an Immigration 
and Naturalization Service detention center. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees picked up later, after President Clinton announced additional 
refinements in the Administration's plan Friday afternoon, were being taken to 
the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the last human refugees we expect to see here" at the Coast Guard 
facility, said Petty Officer Gene Maestas. "The rest are being taken to 
Guantanamo Bay, like the President said." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayelin Ortega, who had spent the night at the refugee center hoping to be 
reunited with her husband's brothers, burst into tears when she learned of the 
President's new policy. She worried that her brothers-in-law and all the other 
Cubans who left their homeland believing that America's arms were wide open 
would arrive too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cubans are risking their own lives and the lives of their children to escape 
Fidel," she said. "There's plenty of room in the United States. How can the 
government send them back to Cuba?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband's brothers, who were too young to travel to the United States 
during the Mariel boat lift 14 years earlier, left Cuba on Monday night, even 
earlier than the Brenans did. But by the flukes of the sea and rescue missions, 
the Brenans made it just before the policy change. 
</P>
<P>
 While rejoicing in his family's fortune, Brenan expressed dismay over what the 
new policy would mean to his countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to suggest to Clinton to take into consideration the suffering 
the Cuban people are going through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other family at the refugee center expressed a similar sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy that the United States has opened its arms to us," said Jose 
Ramon Ortega, 51. "We only wish Clinton would send the other refugees to any 
free country instead of sending them back to Cuba," where they will be detained 
on the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega -- no relation to Mayelin Ortega -- his wife, four grown children and 
son-in-law talked vividly about their long struggle to get from Cuba to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months ago, they sat down together in their family home in Mariel and 
decided they wanted to leave. Three separate times they had built rafts, only 
to have to let them go into the sea when they were caught by authorities while 
trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, Ortega's sons said, they had to steal inner tubes and save their 
money to buy the plywood and ropes necessary to construct the rough-hewed 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Tuesday evening, the family successfully cast off from Cuban 
shores on three rafts that were attached. 
</P>
<P>
 The voyage was treacherous, they explained. Just hours after they set out, 
their food went overboard and they lost their bearings, so for 48 hours they 
bobbed in the waves and watched sharks swim past. 
</P>
<P>
 When after two days an airplane circled over head, they feared that it was 
Cuban, sent to sink their raft. Everyone cried and some screamed hysterically. 
Only later did they realize that the plane was there to assist in their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if they feel like they are finally free -- several of them shouted 
in unison: "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want to do is to breathe this free air and express openly all the 
things I have not been able to express for so many years," said Barbara 
Santana, 52, Ortega's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 She recounted the troubles her family had faced in Cuba because they were 
known as a family that wanted to leave. Most of their belongings were stolen. 
Ortega was fired from his job as a truck driver for failing to cooperate with 
the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The repression got worse and worse," she said. "It got to the point where you 
could not walk out of your house to sit under a tree without being hassled by 
people from the government about where you were going. There is no freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Her only regret, she said, is that she had to leave her oldest son behind 
because his children are so young. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not want to put the children in danger of losing their lives in the 
high sea," she said, crying. 
</P>
<P>
 But after regaining her composure, she added: "I have a daughter here who I 
have not seen since 1988, and a grandchild I have never met. This is our new 
life." Cuban Refugee Arrivals

SUPPORT BUILDS FOR SCALED-BACK CRIME MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans on Friday worked on the outlines of a compromise 
that would allow a scaled-back version of President Clinton's long-stalled 
crime bill to finally pass the House with broad bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the compromise does not go far enough to please the two main forces 
that have been stalling the bill -- the House GOP leadership and a group of 
about 40 Democrats opposed to gun controls -- it appeared to be attracting more 
than enough Republican support to ensure its passage as early as this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving toward (an) agreement. . . . I am happy with the tone of it," 
said Rep. Michael N. Castle (R-Del.), one of the Republican negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing confidence that the crime bill was finally "back on track" after 
its near-derailment in the House last week, Clinton told a White House news 
conference Friday that he supported the emerging deal, which would cut nearly 
$3.5 billion from the original $33-billion bill and, with minor modifications, 
preserve a 10-year ban on several types of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Clinton announced the compromise, Democratic leaders warned that 
the deal could still fall through because of unresolved differences with 
Republicans over how the cuts would be allocated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're close and closing, but we're not there yet," said another of the 
negotiators, Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), as the bill's sponsors met 
throughout the day with the leaders of about 40 moderate Republicans who have 
said they may support the bill with the kind of changes Clinton was offering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have problems with the across-the-board reductions," said Rep. Peter 
G. Torkildsen (R-Mass.), referring to Clinton's offer to cut every program in 
the omnibus bill by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 He indicated that the Republican group led by Castle was satisfied with the 
overall cuts, but wanted them reallocated to preserve the original bill's $10.5 
billion for new prison construction and $8.8 billion for more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official, however, said there was "no way" Clinton could 
accept that proposal because it would mean cutting considerably more than 10% 
from the $7.4 billion that the bill had set aside for after-school sports 
leagues, drug counseling and other crime prevention programs favored by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the negotiations appeared likely to stretch into the night -- and 
perhaps continue today -- both sides agreed that they were getting close to 
resolving, on a surprisingly bipartisan note, one of the most bitterly partisan 
legislative battles of Clinton's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 As the negotiators split into working groups in an effort to come up with an 
agreement that would keep the bill from unraveling, the changes being discussed 
included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tougher requirements for released sexual offenders, who under the original 
bill would have been required to notify police of their whereabouts every year 
for the first 10 years after their release from prison. Under the compromise, 
the notification requirement would be increased to once every three months for 
life, and police also would be required to notify community residents when a 
released sexual offender moved into their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * The elimination of a much-criticized $10-million grant that House Judiciary 
Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) inserted in the original bill to 
establish a criminal justice program at Lamar University, his Beaumont, Tex., 
alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 * A minor modification in the assault-weapons ban that outlaws the manufacture 
and sale of 19 types of semiautomatic assault weapons for 10 years. Under the 
original bill, the ban would cover not only the 19 specific weapons, but all 
"copycat" models subsequently sold. The copycat provisions would remain in the 
compromise bill, but Congress would have the authority to review the 
regulations and determine which models would be covered in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Other features left unchanged in the bill include the expanded death penalties 
for federal crimes, language to help protect women from spousal abuse and the 
so-called three-strikes-and-you're-out provision mandating life imprisonment 
for three-time felons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principles of the bill remain intact," Clinton said at his news 
conference. "It's the biggest increase in police in the history of the country. 
It's the toughest increase in punishment in the history of the country. It's 
the biggest increase in prevention programs in the country," he said, adding 
that Congress should now "pass it without delay." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the compromise appeared likely to win enough Republican support to 
pass the House without difficulties, its future was clouded by new threats from 
GOP lawmakers to oppose the bill when it is sent back to the Senate for final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Warning that the cuts accepted by GOP House moderates were not enough for 
them, Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) both 
threatened to oppose the bill unless its crime prevention spending is reduced 
by considerably more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 10% cut across the board is a 100% non-starter in the Senate," Dole said, 
adding that "the focus should be on cutting pork, not police." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Dole's warning, Gramm threatened to use Senate procedural maneuvers to 
delay the bill if additional cuts aren't made. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other Republican Senate sources said they doubted that the GOP 
leaders would find enough support to delay the bill any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither side has come out of this battle looking very good," one GOP source 
said, referring to the bruising House debate over the measure, which opinion 
polls consistently show most voters want to see passed before November's 
midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each side has pretty much exhausted itself," he added, "and now all we want 
to do is pass this bill and go home."

COURT ORDERS LONGER SENTENCES FOR KOON, POWELL; LAW: APPEALS PANEL UPHOLDS 
CONVICTIONS IN RODNEY KING CASE, BUT IT DENOUNCES TERMS IMPOSED BY JUDGE 
DAVIES. DECISION WILL PROBABLY MORE THAN DOUBLE JAIL TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stunning decision that reopens the Rodney G. King beating saga, a federal 
appellate court ruled Friday that U.S. District Judge John G. Davies improperly 
sentenced the two convicted Los Angeles police officers and ordered him to give 
them longer prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected assertions by the two officers 
that they were improperly convicted, crediting Davies with "impeccable 
fairness" in managing the explosive civil rights case that unfolded in his 
courtroom last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Betty B. Fletcher, writing for the unanimous three-judge panel that 
was hearing the case for the full court, excoriated Davies for making a series 
of serious errors in sentencing Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon. The 
judges ordered Davies to resentence the officers, who have served nearly a year 
of their 30-month sentences. Defense attorneys said the hearing is likely to 
take place in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sentences imposed by the District Court are inconsistent with the 
structure and policies of the sentencing guidelines and the federal sentencing 
statutes," Fletcher wrote in an extraordinarily detailed opinion that filled 
two volumes. Fletcher, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, was joined 
by James R. Browning, a 1961 appointee of President John F. Kennedy, and James 
M. Fitzgerald, who was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 In sometimes blistering language, the appellate court ruled that Davies had 
improperly departed from federal sentencing guidelines when he lowered the 
sentences based on his findings that the officers would be vulnerable to abuse 
in prison, that they would pose no danger to the public, that the successive 
state and federal prosecutions had cast a "specter of unfairness" across the 
federal case, and that their illegal conduct was provoked by King's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies cited those factors in departing dramatically from sentences that would 
otherwise have been prescribed by the federal guidelines. Combined, those 
issues led Davies to cut the officers' sentences by more than half, from at 
least 70 months to 30 months. Friday's ruling could force him to increase the 
sentences back to 70 months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal civil rights trial was argued in the shadow of the 1992 riots and 
ended in a city that was nervous about the prospect of another eruption of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Announced on a misty Saturday morning, the guilty verdicts against Koon and 
Powell -- along with not guilty verdicts for Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. 
Briseno -- were derided by some police officers and their supporters, but were 
greeted by celebrations in many areas of Los Angeles. For many, that joy was 
later undercut by Davies' decision to impose sentences that were shorter than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers heard news of their latest setback Friday morning at the federal 
institution in Dublin, Calif., where they have been held since late 1993. Their 
first word came from a radio report, and they nervously called their lawyers to 
check the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's shaky," lawyer Michael P. Stone said of his client, Powell, who 
delivered the majority of the blows during the March 3, 1991, incident. "His 
voice is shaking, and he's upset. Larry was putting a lot of faith in the 
appeal of the convictions, which I was worried about." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said the double disappointment of losing the appeal of the conviction 
and then facing the possibility of a far longer sentence was a cruel blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting a double-whammy today," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Salzman, the lawyer who represented Koon, said his client also was stunned 
by the decision. But Koon, a veteran police sergeant who was in charge during 
the beating, weathered two criminal trials and a civil case with barely any 
hint of emotion. Friday was no different, Salzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's taking it rather well, but he's certainly disappointed," Salzman said. 
"This is difficult news." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's decision means each officer could face sentences closer to the nine 
years sought by federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that the court obviously understood and agreed with our 
arguments," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven D. Clymer, one of two lead 
prosecutors in the federal trial. "It's a major victory for us." 
</P>
<P>
 For critics of Davies who saw the sentences as unfairly lenient, the 9th 
Circuit's action also was welcome news. Edi M.O. Faal, the lawyer who 
represented Damian M. Williams on charges that he attacked people during the 
first hours of the 1992 riots, said he was relieved the court recognized that 
the officers were being given preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Others echoed that view and praised the appellate judges for ordering a 
resentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've said repeatedly that the judge erred," said Jose DeSosa, president of 
the California State Conference of the NAACP. "I'm thankful to see the 
appellate court has upheld that they were found guilty and the sentence was too 
lenient." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Ripston, director of the ACLU, said the ruling corrected mistakes that 
Davies made. "I think it's hard for anyone to decide what the sentence should 
be, but I think the process was totally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl F. Gates, the retired police chief who criticized the officers for their 
role in the King beating but opposed the federal government's decision to 
prosecute them, was angered by the ruling Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disgusting," Gates said. "These two guys have been put through absolute 
hell. And to have this added to it is indication something is seriously wrong 
with our system. No justice, no justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the officers had asked the 9th Circuit Court to overturn the 
officers' convictions, primarily on two grounds: that the use of videotaped 
testimony by Briseno was improper and that Briseno and a key prosecution expert 
both were tainted by exposure to compelled statements that the accused officers 
gave to police investigators after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts called those significant appellate issues, and lawyers for Koon 
and Powell argued the points in legal filings and in their appearance before 
the 9th Circuit Court this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno did not take the stand during the federal trial, but prosecutors 
introduced an edited videotape of his state court testimony. During the state 
trial, Briseno criticized his colleagues, saying, among other things, that he 
had seen Powell strike King "above the shoulders" with his baton. Powell 
maintained that he never hit King in the head, an assertion that was challenged 
by prosecutors and some witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 When Briseno decided not to testify in the federal trial, prosecutors 
introduced an edited videotape of his testimony in the state case -- a move 
that lawyers for Koon and Powell said was improper for a number of reasons. 
Among other things, they argued that they did not have the chance to 
cross-examine the videotape, that introducing it so close to the end of the 
trial gave it undue weight, and that Briseno was allowed to testify about 
opinions on which he was not an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate judges disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of cross-examination, the panel found that lawyers for Koon and 
Powell "had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine Briseno in the state 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the judges ruled in favor of the prosecution on the other issues 
regarding the Briseno tape, finding that Davies had appropriately allowed the 
tape to be played for jurors. The appellate panel also rejected a number of 
lesser issues, finding, for instance, that the federal trial did not violate 
the defendants' rights not to be subjected to double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Having reviewed those and other defense issues, the appellate panel found that 
the officers received a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a careful review of the record and the relevant authorities, we are 
convinced that the district judge correctly resolved each of the legal issues 
raised by appellants as to the guilt phase of the proceedings," the judges 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sort of knocked over," said lawyer Harland W. Braun, who represented 
Briseno in the federal trial. He called the opinion "neither intellectually 
courageous nor politically astute." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many legal observers, Braun had expected the convictions to be upheld. 
But he and some others were surprised by the panel's decision to order new 
sentencing of the officers. "I had thought they would affirm everything and be 
done with it," Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the same appellate panel that praised Davies' handling of the trial 
sharply criticized him for the way he imposed the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 In comments from the bench and in a 54-page sentencing memorandum, Davies 
found that federal sentencing guidelines called for a sentence of 70 to 87 
months for the two convicted officers. But Davies then ruled that the case was 
so unusual in several respects that a series of downward departures were 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 His reasons for granting those departures were criticized at the time -- 
Loyola law professor Laurie Levenson, who attended the federal trial, said 
Davies had "gone out on a limb with those findings." The appellate court 
overruled him on every one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This opinion constitutes a ringing endorsement of Judge Davies' trial rulings 
and a scathing indictment of his unduly lenient sentencing decisions," said 
Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor. "The opinion makes it absolutely clear 
there is no justification for any downward departure." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons Davies cited for lowering the sentences was that Koon and 
Powell would be subject to "additional punishment" that flowed from their 
convictions. He said this "punishment" included two types: the additional 
administrative proceedings to which they would be subjected by the LAPD and the 
anticipated abuse in prison because of their particular vulnerability as police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personal and professional consequences that stem from a criminal conviction 
are not appropriate grounds for departing, nor are they appropriately 
considered as part of a larger complex of factors," Fletcher wrote for the 
panel, adding that many people who are sent to prison suffer consequences 
beyond their incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals may lose their jobs or be foreclosed from serving in future 
professions; their marriages are destroyed; they may be plunged into poverty," 
Fletcher wrote. "Some individuals may be deported, while those who have been 
convicted of drug or racketeering offenses may lose their homes and their 
investments to the federal government in forfeiture proceedings. World-class 
figure skaters may lose the right to compete in international competition." 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of the officers' vulnerability to prison abuse, the appellate 
judges also disagreed with Davies. Some courts have reduced sentences in cases 
where defendants were particularly vulnerable because of their size, but the 
appellate court found that the issues were different in this case, where the 
vulnerability stems from the positions that the officers held and the notoriety 
of their offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing would prevent this rationale from being applied to numerous groups -- 
such as gang members who may face increased abuse from members of a rival gang, 
police informants or child abusers -- all of whom face an increased risk of 
abuse in prison," the court found. 
</P>
<P>
 In crafting his sentencing memorandum, Davies had relied on a combination of 
several factors -- vulnerability to abuse in prison, the successive state and 
federal prosecutions and the prospect of further punishments -- to reduce the 
sentences by a total of three levels under the sentencing guidelines. But it 
was a fourth issue that Davies said justified the largest downward departure in 
the sentences: King's role in provoking the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 King was drunk on the night of the incident, he was speeding on the highway, 
he evaded officers' attempts to pull him over and he resisted arrest once he 
pulled his car to a stop on a darkened street corner in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty with Davies' reasoning, however, was that the judge also found 
that King had stopped provoking the officers before the illegal portion of the 
beating began, more than a minute into the incident. Thus, Davies' ruling 
seemed to suggest that King provoked only legal blows -- raising the question 
of how he could then reduce the sentences based on King's provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors hammered on that inconsistency in their sentencing appeal, and 
also noted that police officers receive special training to deal with 
provocative suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate panel agreed, finding that King's actions provoked the initial 
confrontation with the officers but were not responsible for the blows that 
Davies determined were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time Powell struck, and Koon permitted to be struck, those blows for 
which (the officers) were criminally liable, King no longer presented a danger 
and was no longer persisting in misconduct," the opinion states. 
</P>
<P>
 By striking down virtually all of Davies' reasons for lowering the sentence, 
the appellate court gave him little room for discretion when the issue returns 
to his courtroom. First, however, the officers can ask the three judges to 
reconsider their decision. Failing that, they could ask the full 9th Circuit to 
review the case, and could appeal to the United States Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 With each stage, the likelihood of their prevailing becomes more remote, and 
both sides said Friday that they expect the matter to return to Davies' court 
by the end of the year. That will set up an awkward hearing, as Davies may be 
forced to impose the appellate judges' wishes even though they are clearly not 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "His job is to comply," Levenson said. "I don't think he will take it 
personally. I think he will do what he has to do."

CLINTON'S MOVE EVOKES SHOCK, ANGER IN MIAMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The well-trod welcome mat got yanked up Friday from South Florida's beaches, 
and in its place the U.S. government stuck up a freshly painted sign: No More 
Cubans. And on the streets of Miami, the emotions bubbling to the surface were 
chiefly shock, surprise and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a monumental change in immigration policy," Lisandro Perez, director 
of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said of 
the Clinton Administration's announcement that after almost 30 years of special 
treatment, Cuban migrants will be treated the same as those from other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Haitianization of the Cuban exodus," Perez said. "You put them 
somewhere until you decide what to do with them. Now Cubans will be treated 
like Haitians." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the sea change in longstanding U.S. refugee policy toward Cubans -- 
approved by the U.S. Congress in 1966 and accepted as a fact of life by South 
Florida's exile community -- may not sink in until Miami's Cuban American 
community sees its effects in news photographs, which will show their 
compatriots detained on a U.S. naval base in the same country they attempted to 
flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pictures may soon be coming. The first Cubans intercepted at sea were to 
be on their way late Friday, aboard one of two Navy vessels assigned to shuttle 
service from the Florida Straits to the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the change in U.S. policy, President Clinton said that he hopes 
"most Cuban Americans would support what we're trying to do and will want us to 
be firm." He added: "I will be surprised if this policy does not have broad 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 Early indications were that many in this city, home to tens of thousands of 
onetime refugees from the Caribbean and Latin America, do support the decision 
to deny Cubans automatic entry to the United States. Chief among those 
supporters are many Haitians, who for years have charged that U.S. immigration 
policy unfairly favored Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban refugees "have been swimming in pools in hotels while Haitians have been 
under the hot sun in tents," said Haitian activist Roger Biamby. "It is obvious 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Cubans here, the policy switch created ambivalence. No one wants a 
repeat of the chaotic 1980 Mariel boat lift, when 125,000 refugees, including 
many dangerous prisoners and mental patients, overwhelmed South Florida and its 
social services. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither do Cuban Americans relish seeing their brothers turned away when 
they are attempting to flee the harsh economic and political reality of their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 demonstrators gathered Friday afternoon outside a city auditorium 
where refugee processing had been going on. Some carried signs denouncing the 
new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A slap in the face of the Cuban people," said Jose Basulto, a founder of 
Brothers to the Rescue, a group of volunteer pilots who fly the Florida Straits 
in search of rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cubans are angry at Clinton over this," said Tomas Garcia Fuste, a popular 
Spanish-language radio talk show host. He spent much of Friday afternoon saying 
to those in Cuba who pick up his broadcasts over station CMQ: "With all 
sincerity, I am asking you: stay home. Because if you come here, they will put 
you in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the problems unleashed by Fidel Castro when he allowed Cubans to leave the 
island in small boats and rafts, Garcia Fuste said: "This is a big hot potato 
for everybody. We understand that the government needed to do something, 
because Castro had created disorder here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the Clinton Administration wants to put us in the same boat as the 
Haitians, then they have to make the embargo against Cuba the same as Haiti. 
Make it tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Also arguing for tighter sanctions on Cuba was Arturo Cobo, the volcanic 
director of the Transit Home for Cuban Refugees in Key West, who in the last 
two weeks has given thousands of exiles food and clothing before seeing them 
climb on buses for Miami. "If he wants to treat us like he treats the Haitians, 
why not blockade Cuba?" he roared. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Solis, the Transit Home vice director, argued that the sudden reversal 
of policy is not fair. "You can't change your mind when someone else's life is 
at stake," he said. "We cannot accept this treatment for Cuban refugees." 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Odio, Miami's city manager, said the policy change signals that "Fidel 
Castro has won. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what he was looking for. Who is being punished here? The 
innocent rafters who are seeking only freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Odio predicted that Miami's streets soon will be full of demonstrators 
protesting the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 What no one here seems to know yet is what will happen to any of the Cuban 
refugees, held at Guantanamo or at the Krome Avenue Detention Center west of 
Miami, who are deemed ineligible for U.S. residency. The Administration has 
said that third countries are being sought to take refugees. But no Cuban has 
ever been repatriated involuntarily to Cuba from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they will have to negotiate," Perez said. "And I think Castro hopes 
to talk. I know that doesn't sound good to a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think a lot of Cubans here will eventually give this change some 
guarded support. It's OK when people were escaping but we don't like it when we 
seem to be playing Castro's game. And when he allows them to leave, then it's 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cutting off the refugee flow creates a problem for Fidel. Now he has a 
political problem in addition to his economic problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Medea Benjamin, director of Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based group which 
sponsors educational trips to Cuba and favors normal relations with the Castro 
regime, called the Clinton policy ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 She said: "It is crazy that the U.S. thinks the solution is to hold them in 
Guantanamo, which is held illegally by this country to begin with. The only 
rational way out of this is to lift the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are creating disaster there through the blockade. Why are we making 
ordinary Cubans suffer? This is playing with people's lives."

MISSION: BRING SPY PLANE IN FROM COLD; AVIATION: RETRIEVAL TEAM PLANS TO FLY 
HOME B-29 THAT WENT DOWN IN GREENLAND IN 1947. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of the first top-secret missions of the Cold War as the United 
States and Soviet Union, their World War II alliance destroyed by distrust, 
began spying on each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission ended with the crash-landing of an Air Force B-29 Superfortress on 
a perpetually frozen lake in an uncharted section of Greenland on Feb. 21, 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 47 years later, the ill-fated spy plane called the Kee Bird -- 
well-preserved by the extreme Arctic temperatures -- may finally be coming in 
from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 A retrieval team headed by three men from Southern California is at the Kee 
Bird crash site 250 miles north of Thule, Greenland. Within weeks, the team 
hopes to fly the big plane home after outfitting it with new engines, 
propellers and instrumentation. The Kee Bird's public debut is tentatively set 
for the Reno National Championship Air Races in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible return of the Kee Bird is an event much anticipated in the world 
of vintage airplane buffs who are passionately dedicated to keeping alive the 
memory of these magnificent aircraft and the brave men who flew them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something larger than life," said Wayman Dunlap, editor and publisher 
of Pacific Flyer Aviation News in Oceanside. "It means a lot more than just a 
bunch of sheet (metal). If they can bring the Kee Bird back, it'll be a 
national treasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Stranded for three brutal days in the darkness of the polar winter, the 11-man 
crew of the bomber was rescued in an effort so daring that it earned the 
captain of the rescue plane a personal commendation from President Harry S. 
Truman. Newspapers and newsreels told the harrowing tale of the crash and 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Military brass warned all those involved in the flight and rescue never to 
reveal that the plane had been looking for evidence that the Soviets were 
building military bases near the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
 The fliers returned to Ladd Field in Fairbanks, Alaska, and were back flying 
other weather and reconnaissance missions within days. But their plane was left 
behind, out of fuel and with busted wheels and bent propellers but otherwise in 
mint condition, captured forever in an aspic of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 4,000 B-29s built by Boeing during World War II, only one, named Fifi and 
now in the possession of the Texas-based Confederate Air Force, is in flying 
condition. The Kee Bird, named for a mythical Arctic bird that stays in the 
cold weather while smarter birds fly south for the winter, would be the second. 
</P>
<P>
 The rediscovery of the plane was something of a historical fluke. In 1985, 
Giles Kershaw, a British pilot making an Arctic exploration flight, looked down 
from his DC-3 and saw the Kee Bird sitting where the crew had left it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who were excited by Kershaw's discovery were Tom Hess, an ex-Army 
pilot who owns Roadway Construction of Newport Beach, a trucking, grading and 
excavation firm; Darryl Greenamyer, a retired Lockheed test pilot living in 
Rancho Santa Fe, and Ascher Ward, a carpet store owner and airplane restoration 
specialist who lives in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The three formed a partnership to retrieve the Kee Bird, renovate it and then 
sell it to a museum or private interest. The cost of the project is estimated 
at $500,000, but Ward estimates that the sale price could be $1 million or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the right party, a million dollars is not an unrealistic amount," Ward 
said. Even Japanese investors have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest of the five Kee Bird crew members who hitched a ride this week on 
an Air Force transport from McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey to Thule to 
oversee the retrieval is more sentimental than financial. A sixth crew member 
died recently at age 76 but, in accordance with his final wishes, his ashes 
will be spread near the Kee Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of their talk will be of the Kee Bird's pilot, Lt. Vern Arnett, who died 
a year after the Kee Bird crash when he crash-landed another B-29 and froze to 
death while attempting to go for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arnett is the reason we're alive today," said John Lesman, the Kee Bird's 
flight engineer. "The way he put the Kee Bird down on that lake was 
magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesman, 70, is a retired Air Force colonel living in Miami. He was a new 
lieutenant when the Kee Bird took off from Ladd Field on its spy mission. 
Within hours the plane was trapped in a heavy polar cloud cover that made it 
impossible to see enough stars to use celestial navigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book "World In Peril," Ken White, whose father, Maj. Maynard White, was 
commander of the spy mission -- code-named "Project Nanook" -- suggests that 
the Kee Bird may have been lured off course by bogus radio signals from the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 For hours the plane circled, unsure of its location, unable to break through 
the clouds. With the plane desperately low on fuel, the pilot's last message to 
Ladd Field was: "We're heading into the sun and we're going to set her down." 
</P>
<P>
 What Arnett thought was a patch of snow was a frozen lake. The Kee Bird hit 
tail-first, skidded for 800 feet and came to rest near the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, there was no fire and the plane did not spin or flip. The first 
crewman out of the plane, Staff Sgt. Paul McNamara, knelt on the ice, made the 
sign of the cross and offered a prayer of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the crew knew where the Kee Bird had landed. "No one even considered 
Greenland," White wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 At nightfall, as the crew prepared for temperatures that sunk to 50 below 
zero, navigators were able to see enough stars to figure longitude and latitude 
and relay that information to Ladd Field, 1,500 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The radio operator asked me: 'What are you guys doing in Greenland?' " Lesman 
said. "I told him: 'We came down to shoot a few polar bears.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Air Force prides itself on its determination and ability to 
rescue downed fliers, the Kee Bird rescue was unprecedented. Never had a rescue 
been attempted where the weather was so brutal and the distance between the 
downed fliers and the nearest base was so vast. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight rescue planes searched for the Kee Bird in relay teams during daylight. 
When the plane was spotted, crates full of supplies, including a nudie calendar 
from a Fairbanks bar, were dropped by parachute. 
</P>
<P>
 Several rescue plans were considered, including an experimental glider that 
could be snagged by a plane making a low pass over the lake. That plan was 
scrapped in favor of landing a C-54 transport. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not known whether the transport could land on the ice without 
cracking it or skidding into rough terrain. On his second approach, the C-54 
pilot decided to risk a dicey landing on a runway illuminated by flares. 
</P>
<P>
 "He touched his wheels and completed the landing, but overshot and ran into 
soft snow and rougher terrain," White wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Kee Bird crew members scrambled aboard. All sensitive equipment aboard the Kee 
Bird was destroyed lest it fall into enemy hands. All supplies and 
nonessentials were left behind to keep down the weight of the C-54. One of the 
few things the Kee Bird crew made sure to bring back was the pinup calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockets were attached to the C-54 to give it additional power for takeoff. It 
started slowly down the ice runway. At about 50 m.p.h., the rockets were fired 
and the lumbering transport became airborne to cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of hated to get rescued that quickly," said Kee Bird crewman Robert 
(Lucky) Luedke, now 71 and the owner of a Denver demolition company. "I had 
gone to Alaska for excitement and I was having it." 
</P>
<P>
 Attachment to the B-29 is intense among veterans and airplane buffs. The big 
bomber with a wingspan of 141 feet and the flying range of 4,000 miles was the 
most technologically advanced and militarily fearsome warplane of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is generally agreed by military historians that the B-29 ended the war 
against the Japanese," said Randy Sohn, a retired commercial airline pilot and 
bomber checkout pilot for the Confederate Air Force, which has 136 World War II 
aircraft in its collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Squadrons of B-29s -- each plane carrying 10 tons of bombs -- struck Japanese 
cities and military installations from bases in India, China and the Marianas 
beginning in early 1944. The Enola Gay, which dropped the atomic bomb on 
Hiroshima, and the Bockscar, which dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, were 
B-29s. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of bringing the Kee Bird back is daunting: Four new engines and new 
propellers have had to be mounted, new instrumentation has been installed, and 
the fuel system has been converted to injection to eliminate the risk of fire. 
An 8,000-foot runway has been constructed on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation has been secured from the Air Force and the Danish government, 
which controls Greenland. Greenamyer and Hess -- Ward stayed home -- are trying 
to make the most of the short Greenland summer when temperatures grudgingly 
creep a few degrees above freezing.  
</P>
<P>
 If Greenamyer's team succeeds in getting the Kee Bird operable, the plan is to 
fly it to Thule Air Base for more extensive repairs and then to a U.S. air base 
in Idaho or Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 If needed, "Lucky" Luedke, despite his years, is ready to do his part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be the flight engineer again and sit in the same seat as when we 
landed it," he said. "I love that plane." On Frozen Ground 
</P>
<P>
 A B-29 called the Kee Bird crash-landed on a frozen lake 250 miles north of 
Thule, Greenland, on Feb. 21, 1947, while on a mission from Fairbanks, Alaska, 
to see if the Soviets were putting military bases above the Arctic Circle.

COLUMN ONE; REAL ISSUE FOR MEXICO IS ECONOMY; A DESIRE FOR GREATER ECONOMIC 
OPPORTUNITY IS DRIVING DEMANDS FOR CHANGE IN THE MOST OPEN ELECTION IN 65 
YEARS. THE STAKES ARE HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Antonio Perez stands in the field he planted with frijoles , or beans, and 
watches as grasshoppers eat away at the now stunted and torn plants. They have 
wiped out his crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Grasshoppers -- a biblical plague, but one largely controlled by pesticides in 
modern times. Was there no pesticide for Perez? "The government didn't get 
money to me for pesticide," says Perez, a gray-haired, pleasant man in his 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Maria Jesus Perez, who lives on the 15-acre farm with her son, his 
wife, Graciella, and their five children, explains, "It is the way God wanted 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 In another field, Perez's corn crop survives. And he may get some money from 
ProCampo, the Mexican government's welfare system for farmers. Then again, he 
may return next year to Chicago, where he has already lived several times, 
working in a plant nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of Antonio Perez is a prime illustration of what is wrong with the 
Mexican economy -- and of the direct U.S. stake in the fortunes of Perez and 
his neighbors. In a decade, the state of Zacatecas, in central Mexico, has sent 
more than 200,000 people to the United States, principally to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 This lack of economic opportunity -- in Zacatecas and so much of Mexico -- is 
what has driven the nation to the brink of change this weekend, as voters go to 
the polls in its most wide-open election in 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country racked by an uprising in Chiapas, the assassination of a 
presidential candidate and the kidnapings of business executives and their 
families, the big economic questions can be boiled down to a simple few for 
typical Mexicans like Antonio Perez: 
</P>
<P>
 Will loans be made available to irrigate and improve the land? Will food 
processing plants and other factories spring up to employ Perez and his 
neighbors so they can make a living in Mexico rather than the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 And in the cities, will wages -- now the $6-a-day minimum for many workers -- 
catch up to the price of chicken, now $1.06 a pound in a Guadalajara 
supermarket? 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Perez might shrug his shoulders at such questions. Indeed, many U.S. 
analysts wonder if Mexico can ever hope to lift its standard of living, and 
dubious foreign investors are waiting to see if the election results spell 
stability in this country of about 90 million people, half of them under 20 and 
more than a third of them poor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the urge for reform is very strong. And across the political spectrum, 
Mexico's leadership ranks are confident that, this time, their country's 
attempted dash from the Third World to the First -- to true industrial status 
-- will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 One embodiment of that vision is a company named Cerrey S.A. in the 
industrious northern city of Monterrey -- a maker of boilers for electric power 
plants that almost failed in the recessionary 1980s but instead transformed 
itself into an exporter to Sweden, France, Saudi Arabia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That's no small feat in a country short on good roads and transport and 
lacking the kind of export financing that U.S., Japanese and European 
governments give to their companies. Cerrey's response has been to focus on 
specialized markets -- selling power components to industrial companies that 
generate their own electricity -- and to use computers as a competitive 
equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, located on a paved but dusty road potholed by heavy trucks 
rumbling over it, boasts top-flight computer-aided design technology that 
custom-designs equipment for Cerrey's demanding overseas customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A company like this needs a lot of investment in new methods," says President 
Ramon Torres, a chemical engineer with degrees from the University of Nuevo 
Leon and the University of Texas. He gestures across a room filled with 23 
computer work stations and then walks a visitor across the plant site to 
prefabricated classrooms where Cerrey employees are trained to work with the 
software of several countries. 
</P>
<P>
 That training -- raising Mexican employees with high school educations to 
world-class technical proficiency -- is the very essence of economic 
development and the hope of this ambitious and needy land. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic growth and development are imperative for Mexico, which needs to 
create 1 million jobs a year just to keep pace with the young people pouring 
into its labor force. And it needs to find work -- and education -- for the one 
Mexican worker in three currently unemployed or underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 The faces of underemployment are the men and children hawking chewing gum and 
novelties on the streets of Mexico City, moving amid cars stalled in traffic 
jams. In the capital, there is an abundance of unskilled labor available for 
menial tasks; Mexico City's population has swollen to 22 million in recent 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax system is partly to blame for sucking people to the cities. The 
federal government collects all tax revenue in Mexico and sends a portion back 
to the 31 state governors, who in turn concentrate their public spending in the 
principal cities. Thus, Guadalajara has grown to 6 million people, Monterrey to 
4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, workers can be had for a pittance. But food, clothing and 
supplies cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 Fertilizer costs the equivalent of $242 a ton -- more than Antonio Perez can 
comprehend. Boys' back-to-school slacks at $15 a pair or girls' pleated skirts 
at $25 apiece may look reasonable to U.S. shoppers but are out of reach for 
many Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying cause of this mismatch between paychecks and groceries is that 
Mexico does not produce enough -- and thus has a limited ability to hire and 
pay its people. Mexican industry has surprisingly low output for such a 
populous country. Even the largest companies, such as Monterrey's big 
conglomerates Grupo Alfa and Vitro S.A., are no match in output or technology 
for companies of Europe, Japan or even South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? For three decades, during which world markets surged with historic 
growth, Mexico's companies produced for a closed home market, with government 
protection against cheaper foreign goods. The companies made high profits, and 
those of Mexico's educated elite who worked for them -- or for the government 
that regulated and rewarded them -- made high incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the companies could not compete anywhere else, and their limited 
operations made opportunity and good incomes scarce for most Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 One result: high prices and soaring inflation whenever demand for goods from 
Mexican industry or consumers heated up, as in the oil boom of the 1970s. 
Ultimately, the country was caught up in a tornado of inflation that reached 
159% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought forth the rigorous stabilization policies of the government of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, which have brought inflation down to 
roughly 7% this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Salinas moved, too, to break down the protective barriers. He opened Mexico to 
trade with the United States -- a historic reversal codified in the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that went into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, NAFTA has greatly increased the two-way flow of goods, with 
slightly more U.S. exports coming to Mexico -- which this year will rival Japan 
as the United States' second-largest market after Canada -- than the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, NAFTA has meant pain, especially for small businesses coping with 
the surge of U.S. merchandise and marketing know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mexico's exports are also growing, and in any event the country benefits 
from its U.S. imports. Says Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche, "Eighty 
percent of the goods we import from the U.S. are machinery and other products 
to help modernize Mexican industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Cerrey illustrates the trend: Those 23 computer work stations came from 
Intergraph Corp. of Huntsville, Ala., at a price dwarfed by the value of the 
boilers that the Monterrey company now ships to four continents. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra, who earned a doctorate at Yale after attending the National Autonomous 
University of Mexico, sees Mexico's big companies restructuring to become 
competitive -- indeed, Alfa, Vitro and others are doing just that -- and 
smaller firms gaining prowess by working as suppliers to larger businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The government gives a hand, but not a shelter. "I can take you to Puebla 
(east of Mexico City) where there are a lot of small companies producing 
jackets," Serra says, describing a host of firms that once saw their profits 
eaten up by local middlemen. "Now we have organized them to share the cost of 
finance and marketing and to contract directly to supply custom designs to Polo 
and Members Only." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet success stories will be few as long as small- and medium-sized companies 
face a virtually insurmountable obstacle: lack of credit. The longest loan a 
business can get is 90 days. The interest runs 25% to 30%, with fees to the 
bank on top of that. 
</P>
<P>
 If the new Mexican economy is to have any chance, those interest rates will 
have to come down. One way to bring them down is to control inflation. And with 
that aim, this summer Mexico took a power-ceding step surprising for a 
one-party state. 
</P>
<P>
 It amended the constitution to make its central bank -- the Bank of Mexico -- 
independent of politics. The model is Germany's Bundesbank. "We have the same 
mission -- to keep prices stable and inflation down," says Francisco Gil Diaz, 
deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 With inflation under control, Mexico's leaders are turning their focus to the 
bricks and mortar of the new economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, private industry and the government are pouring money into building 
Mexico's infrastructure -- its roads and ports, and also its phone lines and 
computing capacity -- which will form the foundation of its bid for First World 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monterrey, local investors put up $3 million to erect a 700,000-square-foot 
trade and convention center called CinterMex. "It's a place exhibitors from 
abroad can bring their products and save Monterrey's 7,000 manufacturers the 
expense of traveling," says the center's director, Jesus Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 A gleaming glass structure, CinterMex symbolizes the old and new in Mexican 
industry. It is built on the grounds of the old Fundador steel mill, which 
failed in 1983. The mill's rusting steel furnaces still stand in a grassy area 
that is being turned into a park. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the formerly government-owned telephone system, Telefonos de Mexico 
-- whose stock trades prominently on the New York Stock Exchange -- is 
modernizing the communications system. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years from now, Telefonos, which is partly owned by Southwestern Bell, 
will lose its monopoly and face competition, just as AT&T does from MCI and 
Sprint. Meanwhile, cellular companies, one affiliated with Bell Atlantic, are 
rapidly starting operations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. retailers Wal-Mart, Kmart and J.C. Penney are spreading fast in Mexico, 
where Sears has had a presence for decades. This is good for consumers, of 
course, but this opening cuts two ways: "There's a price to pay -- our local 
merchants are going to have to change," says Benjamin Clariond, the mayor of 
Monterrey and former head of a family construction business. 
</P>
<P>
 Such transition can be painful. But when will it halt the erosion in workers' 
wages and bring the benefits of an open economy to Mexico's tens of millions of 
increasingly impatient poor? 
</P>
<P>
 That will happen when it leads to an upgrading of jobs. In Mexico City, Grupo 
Gutsa, a hotel company owned by the Gutierrez family, is instituting 
computerized inventory control through a joint venture with Labatt's Food 
Service of San Antonio, which supplies 2,000 hotels and restaurants in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a Mexican revolution. The computerized system has achieved 
tremendous cost savings by organizing the former chaos of 80 food vendors 
making daily deliveries to Gutierrez hotels under the watch of 20 inventory 
clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to the unneeded clerks? "I need them as salespeople for Labatt 
Mexico's inventory control system," says Al Silva, a Texan and Labatt executive 
who works with Bernardo Gutierrez, executive director of the Mexican venture. 
</P>
<P>
 But Silva got a surprise when he said he needed salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that was a lowly position with no pay or status," Silva says. "And 
I was puzzled until I realized that in Mexican thinking, salesperson, or 
vendedor , is seen as a lowly order taker, a Willy Loman who delivers goods and 
picks up a receipt."  
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't want a vendedor ," Gutierrez interjects. "I want a marketing 
ejecutivo -- somebody who can explain the business to a customer. I'd pay 
$30,000 a year for such a person." 
</P>
<P>
 And so will many others, as Mexico's economy develops. But to upgrade the work 
force will demand gains in education in a country in which only eight years of 
schooling is compulsory and many don't complete even that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to spend 8% of our economic output on education, compared to 
today's 3.6%," says Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a Mexico City economist who 
advises international industry. "But when we do, our work force and economy 
will improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Mexico's modernization and the growth of its consumer market will 
take many years. If turmoil grows in the wake of contested election results, 
development will be delayed. Still, a lot of business people are preparing for 
the consumer market now. 
</P>
<P>
 Bancrocer, a medium-sized bank with 400 branches in major cities, plans to 
open hundreds of small, 600-square-foot consumer banks in poor urban 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vision is that people in these colonias or barrios will have savings to 
deposit and needs for mortgage loans," says Miguel Alvarez, a vice president 
and director of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the line will be short for mortgages -- just now becoming available 
after 10 years -- as long as rates remain at 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, stocks in consumer businesses -- retail stores and the like -- will 
rise quickly on the Mexico Stock Exchange if Sunday's election is carried off 
peacefully, predicts Eduardo Cepeda, who heads the Mexico City office of J. P. 
Morgan & Co., the legendary New York City investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
 That Mexican stock market already has received a lot of U.S. mutual fund 
investment among the $21.8 billion in foreign investment it has taken in in the 
last three years -- a huge bet by the average U.S. saver in Mexico's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the U.S. stake in Mexico goes well beyond investments. Socially and 
economically, it goes to the issue of immigration. If Mexico fails to thrive, 
its people will turn north for work in even greater numbers, exacerbating 
tensions along the border and in major cities like Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And the United States has deeper, broader interests in Mexico's success. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Japan and South Korea's Asian model of development -- closed 
economies and confrontational trade policies -- Mexico could become a 
confirming example of the Western model, an open country developing 
economically while nurturing a growing democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have greater citizen participation and higher incomes," 
predicts economist Ramirez de la O. 
</P>
<P>
 Change is coming to all of Mexico, even to ancient Zacatecas, 375 miles 
northwest of Mexico City. The region grew to prominence in the 1500s, mining 
the silver that made Spain rich. Today, Zacatecas is a place of budding 
tourism, centered on the old mines and struggling ejido farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ejidos are land that was given to farm-worker families with the breakup of 
haciendas , or plantations, in the years after Mexico's 1910 revolution. There 
were conditions on the gift that proved far-reaching: The land could not be 
sold or pledged as collateral for loans. That limited the buildup of capital 
and practically ensured uneconomic farming as ejido plots became subdivided 
with succeeding generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salinas administration changed the ejido law, allowing land to be sold and 
pledged for loans. It was a step that helped cause the uprising in the southern 
state of Chiapas earlier this year -- its leaders accused the government of 
trying to con the peasants out of their land -- but which actually holds out 
possibilities for modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, for example, 150 families in the La Encarnacion ejido, where 
Antonio Perez lives. The land is potentially good. Perez says he wouldn't sell 
but would like to borrow to improve his land. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Mexico's new president and his economic administrators are smart, they 
will see to it that loans exist to help Perez and his neighbors. Because unless 
Mexico modernizes its agriculture, other problems could arise, especially in 
relations with its NAFTA partner , the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof . Rodolfo Garcia Zamora of Zacatecas Autonomous University, an authority 
on agriculture, senses the danger in anti-immigrant rhetoric by U.S. 
politicians -- let alone new steel fences and beefed-up border patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to think now of how to reduce the number of Mexicans who emigrate; we 
need to make the jobs here, not in the United States," Garcia says. "I believe 
we need a national economic effort to modernize agriculture, with jobs for 
everyone, on the land and in food processing." 
</P>
<P>
 The future he sees is bracing, not gloomy. "The NAFTA is a challenge for us," 
Garcia says. "We have 10 to 15 years to change agriculture inside NAFTA, so we 
have to make a greater transformation than has ever been attempted before." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sunday's presidential election is only one of the profound changes 
that will affect Mexico -- and the United States. The Mexican Economy 
</P>
<P>
 The woes of the 1970s and 1980s have stalled Mexico's efforts to achieve true 
industrial status. Sunday's landmark presidential election occurs as major 
progress has been made in the battle against inflation, foreign investment is 
rising and the economy is growing. But chronic joblessness and widespread 
poverty have prevented the development of a robust consumer economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment has shown no improvement in nearly a decade ... 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 22.84% 
</P>
<P>
 ... and the economy's growth has been sluggish. (Gross domestic product in 
billions of 1985 dollars) 
</P>
<P>
 1994*: $215.31 
</P>
<P>
 * Projected 
</P>
<P>
 But triple-digit inflation is a thing of the past ... 
</P>
<P>
 1994*: 6.91% 
</P>
<P>
 * Projected 
</P>
<P>
 ... and foreign investors are back. (Direct foreign investment, in billions of

</P>
<P>

CLINTON HALTS SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR CUBANS; REFUGEES: DETAINMENT IN GUANTANAMO 
AND FLORIDA ORDERED. THE DECISION PERMANENTLY REVERSES 30-YEAR POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an announcement that stunned Cubans and their relatives in this country, 
President Clinton said Friday that refugees from Fidel Castro's communist 
nation will no longer receive preferential treatment from the United States or 
special help in resettling in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I have ordered that illegal refugees from Cuba will not be allowed to 
enter the United States," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered the Coast Guard -- backed by the Navy -- to interdict refugees at 
sea and take them to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Refugees who 
make it across the Florida Straits will be detained while their cases are 
reviewed for eligibility to remain in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made it clear that the plan is a sweeping new policy, rather than a 
temporary arrangement, that permanently reverses nearly 30 years of precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to avoid a repeat of the 1980 Mariel boat lift, which saw 125,000 
Cubans enter the country in a seaborne exodus, Clinton said that Castro is 
again trying to export his nation's political and economic crises to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This action is a cold-blooded attempt to maintain the Castro grip on Cuba and 
to divert attention from his failed communist policies," Clinton said at an 
afternoon press conference at the White House. "Let me be clear: The Cuban 
government will not succeed in any attempt to dictate American immigration 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton vowed that there would be no repeat of the 1980 experience -- in which 
throngs of people, including some with criminal records, mental problems or 
contagious diseases -- were turned loose from Cuban shores aboard boats bound 
for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 120,000 people sent to this country as a deliberate attempt . . . to 
export all the problems of Cuba to the United States," Clinton said. "We tried 
it that way once. It was wrong then and it's wrong now, and I'm not going to 
let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida authorities welcomed the Clinton announcement but refugee advocates 
and some Republicans deplored it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban Americans received the news with mixed emotions. Some worried that their 
friends and relatives still in Cuba would have no hope of reaching this 
country. Others were gratified that Castro's effort to rid himself of political 
foes was being thwarted and that the Mariel boat lift, which caused a backlash 
against Cuban Americans, will not be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton did not mention it, the 1980 Mariel refugee flood was one of 
the central issues in his defeat that year in a bid for reelection as governor 
of Arkansas. Hundreds of Marielistas temporarily housed at Ft. Chafee, Ark., 
rioted and many escaped, provoking widespread citizen outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton at the time blamed federal authorities for not giving him enough money 
or troops to properly police the Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 7,000 Cubans have landed in Florida this year, nearly twice the 
total for all of 1993. In August alone, the Coast Guard has rescued more than 
3,500 Cuban refugees from the Florida Straits, including 745 who were picked up 
Friday, the biggest single day total since the 1980 exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro has not publicly urged his citizens to flee but Florida and federal 
officials accuse him of tacitly encouraging the exodus to lessen political 
pressure on his regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is expected to announce today a series of additional steps to 
intensify diplomatic and economic pressure on the Castro regime, including 
sharply reducing the $300-per-quarter limit on the amount of money that Cuban 
Americans can send to relatives in Cuba and limiting the number of charter 
flights between the United States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the United States is expected to ask the U.N. Security Council 
later this month to formally condemn the Castro regime for alleged human rights 
abuses. And U.S. authorities plan to increase the number of anti-Castro radio 
broadcasts beamed to Cuba -- possibly with the aid of military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that Clinton outlined the package during a meeting 
late Friday with Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles and a group of 10 Cuban American 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration strategists said the limit on remittances, as funds sent to 
relatives by Cuban Americans are called, could further damage the weak Cuban 
economy. Officials said Clinton still had not decided how sharply to reduce the 
$300-a-quarter ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 American ships will patrol the waters between Cuba and the South Florida 
coastline. Some vessels will be diverted from duty off Haiti and from anti-drug 
missions, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, Cubans reaching American soil or picked up at sea were rapidly 
released into American society after only cursory screening under terms of a 
1966 law, the Cuban Adjustment Act. Many were released to family or friends in 
Miami while their applications for permanent residency were considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Cubans who make it to the United States will be housed 
indefinitely at the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Krome Detention 
Center just west of Miami while their residency applications are considered. It 
is anticipated that some eventually will be granted residency, but the process 
will be protracted and the outcome uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubans plucked from the sea will be taken to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba, for detention. About 14,000 Haitian refugees are already housed at 
Guantanamo in a makeshift tent city. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are seeking facilities in third countries for the Cubans, as they 
have for Haitians. Several Caribbean nations tentatively have agreed to house 
the refugees, but no facilities are yet in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said that no Cubans would be sent back to Cuba against 
their will. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said the Administration is determined not to let Castro have "a safety 
valve" on public unrest stemming from Cuba's deteriorating economy. She said 
that Cubans who want to come to the United States should apply through a 
processing system in place in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said the Administration's goal is to stand up to Castro and "not let him 
dupe us as he did in 1980." At that time, she was chief prosecutor in Florida's 
Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's action came just hours after Chiles declared a state of emergency 
and threatened to call out the National Guard to help stem the influx of 
refugees, who have been landing in Florida at the rate of about 500 a day all 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Catholic Conference, however, said that it was "surprised and 
concerned" by Clinton's policy reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned that more than half of those fleeing are families with young 
children and elderly members and we want to continue to ensure their safety," 
said John Swenson of the conference's Office of Refugee Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Five members of Congress, representing districts in Florida and New Jersey 
with Cuban American constituencies, criticized Clinton and demanded that the 
United States unilaterally impose a naval blockade on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Haiti's ports are blockaded and overt and covert aid is being provided 
pro-democracy forces in Haiti, so too must it be in Cuba," said Florida 
Republican Lincoln Diaz-Balart. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) also took issue with the Clinton 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton should call on Fidel Castro to step down immediately," Dole 
said in a press release issued even before the President spoke. "President 
Clinton should make it clear to Fidel Castro that sending the occupants of 
Cuban prisons, insane asylums and hospitals to Florida will be considered an 
act of aggression against the U.S. -- and the U.S. will respond appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
 In his press conference, Clinton firmly rejected a suggestion that he open a 
political dialogue with Castro, as he and other American leaders have with 
heads of other communist governments. He also ruled out lifting the U.S. 
economic embargo against Havana, which has been in place since shortly after 
Castro seized power in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real problem is the stubborn refusal of the Castro regime to have an open 
democracy and an open economy, and I think the policies we are following will 
hasten the day when that occurs," Clinton said.

'MAINSTREAM' SENATE GROUP OFFERS NEW HEALTH CARE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to fend off growing pressure to put off health care reform 
indefinitely, a bipartisan Senate group Friday offered a new plan that depends 
on major savings from Medicare and Medicaid for subsidies to help poor people 
buy health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal -- which avoids the controversial employer mandate supported by 
President Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders -- was hammered out by 
the self-styled "mainstream" group after days of closed-door meetings aimed at 
breaking the partisan gridlock that has stalled action on the health care issue 
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to achieve health care reform is to take it step by step," said 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a new member of the mainstream group, at the 
press conference called to unveil principles of the group's proposal, which 
relies on insurance reforms and other voluntary measures to expand coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and the others, a floating group of about 20 Democrats and 
Republicans, hope that their plan will become a rallying point. "One side wants 
too much, the other wants nothing," Feinstein said in an interview. "Our aim is 
to bring the two leaders (Democratic and Republican) together and say: 'We can 
do something now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The top officials -- Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) listened to presentations by the group Friday but were 
carefully noncommittal. Mitchell's plan, which includes mandated insurance by 
all employers in the year 2002 if 95% of Americans have not been covered as a 
result of voluntary measures by the end of the century, is still the bill being 
debated in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole suggested that it may be desirable to give up the effort to reform the 
nation's health care system and wait until next year. "I think it's getting to 
be a little late in the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference Friday, President Clinton urged Congress to keep working 
on health care reform, but he seemed skeptical of the mainstream group's 
approach. "The so-called 'something less' approach often does more harm than 
good. . . . When you just try to patchwork this, often you lead to more people 
without insurance and higher insurance rates," he said. Nevertheless, he called 
for continued efforts to pass a bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't move now, there's a chance that it won't happen at all," Clinton 
said, reflecting the Administration's concern that any remaining momentum for 
reform may subside if Democrats fare poorly in November's congressional 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream group offered an eight-page statement of general principles and 
basic plans, but is awaiting detailed information about costs from the 
Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
 But their proposal seems certain to stir up considerable opposition from 
senior citizens groups, hospitals and physicians. It would depend on $400 
billion in savings during a 10-year period, with $260 billion from Medicare, 
the medical program for people over age 65 and the disabled, and $140 billion 
from Medicaid, the health program for the poor. These two programs are already 
criticized by doctors and hospitals for restrictive fee schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 The money saved from trimming Medicare and Medicaid growth would be used to 
provide subsidies to buy health insurance. Premiums would be free for people 
with incomes below the poverty line, which is now $14,800 for a family of four, 
and partial subsidies would be available for those with incomes up to 200% of 
the poverty level. For pregnant women and children under age 18, subsidies 
would be provided at incomes up to 240% of the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
 All employers would be required to distribute information to workers and offer 
a choice of three health plans. Companies would not be required to pay for part 
of the premiums but could arrange for payroll deductions at a worker's request. 
If a worker met income guidelines, he or she would be eligible for a subsidy. 
Otherwise, the cost of the premium could be fully tax-deductible for the 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 A firm with fewer than 100 workers could join a voluntary purchasing 
cooperative instead of offering three plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms with more than 100 workers could continue to self-insure, a system now 
used by the vast majority of larger companies, which take the risk of paying 
their own health bills and use insurance companies as administrators to put 
together networks of doctors and hospitals. The mainstream plan, therefore, 
would mean minimal changes in the operations of health insurance plans for 
bigger companies that currently provide coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for another $100 billion in revenues to be used for 
reduction of the federal budget deficit. This money would be raised by 
increasing the cigarette tax by 45 cents a pack, increasing the premium for 
Medicare Part B for individuals with incomes over $75,000 and couples with 
incomes over $100,000 and limiting businesses' tax deductibility for 
higher-cost health plans. It also would extend the Medicare payroll tax, 1.45% 
of income, to all state and local workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The key insurance reform features would forbid insurers from denying or 
limiting coverage based on health status. Renewal would be guaranteed and 
workers could take insurance from one job to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a woman has breast cancer, she is not canceled from her policy and she 
doesn't have to sell her home for treatment," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of its unveiling, the mainstream effort was denounced Friday by 
Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO, who said any bill that "fails to 
provide universal coverage and an employer mandate . . . is not genuine reform 
and will not solve the critical and fundamental problems of our health care 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier Friday, one of the group's charter members, Sen. Bill Bradley 
(D-N.J.), defected, saying the emerging plan would not accomplish true reform 
because it shies away from expanding health coverage and lacks adequate 
cost-containment measures. But even as Bradley departed, he was replaced by a 
new member, Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), who said that the Democratic 
leadership bill is not worth amending. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream group emphasized its flexible and optimistic approach to one of 
the toughest and most complex issues faced by Congress. The proposal is "a bill 
that can pass this year," predicted Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.).

 LATEST BLOW: As expected, 20th Century Insurance Co. in Woodland Hills got hit 
hard again Friday -- this time, on the stock market (D1). The company's shares 
dropped 22% the day after the state Supreme Court ordered it to pay $119 
million in Proposition 103 customer refunds. . . . The plunge continued a 
trend: The stock this year has fallen from $27.38 per share to $12.75 at 
Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 DIAL CHP: The California Highway Patrol encourages motorists with cellular 
telephones to call in about reckless drivers. Just dial 911 and follow the car 
until an officer spots it. But don't bother calling about speeders, says David 
King, a CHP spokesman in Woodland Hills. . . . "There are so many of them," he 
said. "We'd be chasing people around all day and not getting anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 RADIO FAME: Gary Owens again has the last laugh. Owens (above), of Encino, the 
former "Laugh-In" announcer, will be inducted this fall into the Radio Hall of 
Fame in Chicago. . . . It hasn't always been this easy. "My first boss said I 
was the worst DJ he had ever heard," says Owens, who started at KOIL in Omaha, 
Neb., in the late '50s. "Years later, he phoned to apologize." 
</P>
<P>
 NO SHOW: He hoped for a long career. Instead, the Antelope Valley's Steve 
Chilcott became the answer to a trivia question. He's the only player selected 
first in baseball's amateur draft to retire without ever playing in the big 
leagues. Chilcott, a catcher, wrecked his shoulder in the minors in 1967 (C12). 
. . . Now a construction supervisor, he saw others make it and "wondered what 
would have or could have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 IN TOP FORM: The Dodgers' Mike Piazza and Eric Karros showed Friday that the 
weeklong strike hasn't hurt their stroke. So what if their hits came in 
fast-pitch softball against a team of 9- to 10-year-old girls from Santa 
Clarita? . . . In the end, however, the girls, who trailed 3-1 after two 
innings, won by forfeit. Michael Arkush

RAMS OWNER A NO-SHOW AT BOOSTER EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday, Orange County Rams fans got all gussied up to court Rams owner Georgia 
Frontiere. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the county's mayors turned out at the Rams season kickoff 
luncheon wearing "Keep Our Rams in Orange County" T-shirts. There were fat 
bundles of We-love-you-Georgia letters. The young son of a former Ram who died 
of cancer even flew in from San Antonio, Tex., to present her an award. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, Frontiere, who was a no-show, spurned Orange County's most ardent 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's discouraging," said Ned Snavely, general manager of the Anaheim Marriott 
who hosted the lunch. "But I think it's indicative of the attitude of the team. 
. . . You do all this and they snub . . . you." 
</P>
<P>
 Rams President John Shaw, who also did not attend, later said Frontiere, who 
has come to the luncheon in the past, was "out of town." Regardless, he said, 
the event was for the football team, not for wooing the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams, a group of businessmen and politicians battling to keep the 
team in Orange County, and the booster club "are two independent 
organizations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an event that we contracted with the booster club," he said. "No one 
really informed us that this would be a platform for Save the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 But that made no difference to the 1,200 fans, politicians and business 
leaders gathered at the kickoff luncheon or the 200 who braved the hot sun for 
a pre-luncheon pep rally in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it was an annual booster event. But this year was special, fans said. 
How could they show Frontiere how much they care if she's not there? 
</P>
<P>
 "She goes to all her society functions," said Carroll Connet, a 12-year season 
ticket-holder from Orange who has chatted with Frontiere at past luncheons. 
"She's always on the society page. You don't see her up there on the sports 
page with her team." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere's absence was particularly disappointing for Johnnie Johnson, the 
Rams former All Pro free safety, and Christopher Collins, 11, son of Kirk 
Collins, a Rams defensive back who abruptly died of cancer in 1984 while 
leading the league in interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time Collins died, Johnson launched a college fund for Christopher, 
then 6 months old. Frontiere gave the seed money, about $40,000, to start the 
fund and paid for Collins' memorial service, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when Johnson started the Kirk Collins Memorial Scholarship Fund, to 
keep Collins' name alive and provide educational assistance for disadvantaged 
youths, Frontiere again contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 So Johnson said he thought Friday would be the perfect time to fly Christopher 
and his mother, Ruby, from Texas to give Frontiere a lifetime achievement award 
from the scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Collins' young son ended up giving the award to Rams offensive 
lineman Jackie Slater, who read a brief telegram from Frontiere. The telegram 
said Frontiere regretted she could not attend but was called out of town on 
personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruby," her message said, "we cherish the memory of your husband, and we will 
never forget him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson and other Save the Rams members said although Frontiere didn't 
attend, the event helped prove to the assembled politicians, business leaders 
and players that the Rams are wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Disneyland President Jack B. Lindquist, the group's co-chairman, said 
the sizable turnout -- though not much different than past years -- proves the 
argument that there isn't a market for pro football in Orange County "is just a 
lot of bull." 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, current Rams players, scattered among tables full of boosters, 
were more pragmatic. The team mantra, underlined by Coach Chuck Knox, was that 
the players couldn't do anything to change what was essentially a business 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't let this become disconcerting to us on the playing field," said 
Knox, who has a year remaining on his contract. "We don't have any choice in 
the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Homeco, 24, a third-year middle linebacker, said many of the players 
have long been anticipating a possible move. "I've been renting for fear 
something like this would happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by adoring fans, Slater, 40, a 19-year Rams veteran, said he 
appreciated the local effort to try and keep the team in town. But, he said, 
the fans, "like us players, have to understand this is going to . . . come down 
to hard-line bargaining. It's an economical decision. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the youngest fans, wearing souvenir T-shirts that dangled to their 
ankles, understood. Many said they were snatching as many autographs as they 
could before the team left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might not be able to get them next year," said an 8-year-old named Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way out of the luncheon, Steve Kissen, 45, a Lake Forest tax 
consultant, said after that he was sure Frontiere was moving the team. "If she 
was interested at all she would have been here today," he said.

CULTURE; LEWD PAINTING OF REVOLUTIONARY DRAWS OUTRAGE IN S. AMERICA; SOME 
INTELLECTUALS WARN THAT THE FLAP OVER THE PORTRAIT OF INDEPENDENCE LEADER SIMON 
BOLIVAR MAY FUEL CENSORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simon Bolivar, the great general who led the South American war of 
independence from Spain, is portrayed by a Chilean painter as an enigmatic 
figure with feminine breasts, lace stockings and no pants. This "Liberator" 
sits on a stylized steed, making a lewd gesture with his extended middle 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting by Juan Davila has provoked public outrage in several South 
American countries, protests from offended governments, an official apology 
from Chile and a lively public debate over freedom of artistic expression. Some 
intellectuals warn that the flap may fuel the fires of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivar was commander in chief of the patriotic forces that freed Venezuela, 
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia from Spanish rule in the early 1800s. His 
memory is revered throughout Latin America, and portraits of him have generally 
depicted a dignified, manly hero. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davila's recent rendition shows a fellow of ambiguous sex, wearing a black 
lace stocking below a naked, fulsome hip. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not have caused such an uproar had it not been reproduced on 500 
postcards that circulated in Chile and abroad in an art-promotion project 
financed by Chile's Fondart, a government fund under the Education Ministry. 
The works of three other Chilean artists were reproduced on cards that went out 
in the same "postal exhibition." 
</P>
<P>
 Fondart officials have said the project grant was awarded without censorship 
of the pictures. Critics argue that public funds should not have been used to 
promote so offensive a picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Davila, who lives in Australia, has not surfaced since the controversy 
exploded more than a week ago. But Chilean critics and artists who know his 
work say the Bolivar painting uses symbolism to criticize the predominance of 
patriarchal figures in standard versions of Latin American history. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can doubt that, from the first school books, history is written in the 
masculine," wrote Chilean art critic Justo Pastor Mellado. "Where the hero 
should show his hairy chest, Davila reproduces the cleavage of feminine 
breasts. . . . What should be seen, behind that opening, is the presence of the 
hidden women of our independence." 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest reactions to the painting came from Caracas, Venezuela, where 
Bolivar was born. Venezuela sent a formal protest to the Chilean government 
over what the Venezuelan Embassy here called a "campaign that is being 
orchestrated against the prestige of the most sacred figure of our 
nationality." 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia and Ecuador also made formal protests to Chile. "This painting is a 
blasphemy from the historical point of view, pornographic as art and 
incomprehensibly defamatory," the Colombian ambassador said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of controversy, the Chilean Foreign Ministry issued an apologetic 
statement Tuesday acknowledging that the "clearly disrespectful content" of the 
painting "deeply wounds the sensibilities of all who value the contribution of 
the remarkable Venezuelan to the freedom of Latin America." The ministry 
presented Chile's excuses to Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador for "this 
lamentable incident," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day, a group of protesters in Caracas burned a Chilean flag outside 
Chile's embassy. The demonstrators demanded that Davila's painting be brought 
to Venezuela to be burned. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in Chile openly advocates suppression of artworks by public burning, 
but defenders of artistic freedom worry about more subtle forms of censorship, 
especially by institutions that finance the arts. In fact, the chairman of the 
Chilean Senate has recommended that Fondart funds go only to institutions and 
not directly to artists. Writer Raquel Olea said in a newspaper column Friday 
that such proposals "put Chilean intellectuals and artists on alert."

POLITICS; ENCLAVE PRESENTS RUSSIA WITH ITS OWN HAITI; MOSCOW LAYS CLAIM TO 
UNRULY REPUBLIC OF CHECHNYA. BUT IT CANNOT CONTROL ITS REBELLIOUS LEADER. 
RECENT WAFFLING ON WHETHER TO INVADE NEARLY LED TO BLOODSHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Early this month, Russian diplomats in Washington made a discreet but 
disturbing inquiry: If you Americans are going to invade Haiti, they asked, 
would you mind if Russia invaded its own southern corner -- an unruly little 
place called Chechnya? 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration replied that yes, we do mind, according to two 
specialists familiar with the exchange, and the Russians backed off. But not 
before Moscow's open support for a rebel group in Chechnya brought the Caucasus 
Mountains to the brink of bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya is Russia's Haiti -- a mountainous, ethnic enclave half the Caribbean 
nation's size but more dangerous. Moscow considers the oil-producing Muslim 
republic and its 1.2 million people part of Russia -- as does the rest of the 
world -- but cannot control its dictator, a former Soviet bomber pilot named 
Dzhokar Dudayev, who declared independence in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin has lived with three unpleasant 
choices: Topple Dudayev and risk guerrilla war against his many loyalists 
across the Caucasus. Let Chechnya go and thus embolden other ethnic republics 
to secede as well. Or forget the place -- and the embarrassment of not ruling 
the whole Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin suddenly remembered Chechnya late last month. A mass kidnaping by 
a Chechen gang and a failed rescue attempt left five people dead in a southern 
Russian resort. Accusing Dudayev of inciting terrorism and beheading his foes, 
Yeltsin's aides embraced a Chechen Provisional Council that favors rejoining 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 2, after Russia had halted flights over Chechnya and sealed the 
border, the opposition council, apparently expecting help from the Russian 
army, announced it was seizing power and calling new elections. The coup turned 
out to be wishful thinking, undermined by Yeltsin's decision not to invade. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a prudent choice. Recent polls show that fewer than 10% of all Russians 
want to force Chechnya back into the fold, perhaps because its warring clans 
and gunslinger ethos were never tamed by 70 years of Soviet rule. Russians 
stereotype Chechens as ruthless gangsters who might, if pushed, strike back at 
Russia's nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we used force in Chechnya, it would spark an uprising in the Caucasus and 
lead to such turmoil, so much bloodshed, that no one would forgive us 
afterward," Yeltsin said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added with a smile, "The role of the opposition (in Chechnya) is 
growing, and I would not say we have no influence there." 
</P>
<P>
 That influence, however, is limited. The 22-member council is shunned by the 
bulk of Dudayev's political foes, who all favor some degree of autonomy from 
Moscow. Council leader Umar Avturkhanov, who is mayor and former police chief 
of Znamenskoye, is popular only in his home district, where rubles shipped from 
Moscow pay public workers' wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatening a holy war "that will eclipse Afghanistan," Dudayev drafted tens 
of thousands of men into his army this week to resist any invasion. But he has 
refrained from moving against Avturkhanov, who claims to have won over a tank 
battalion, two mountain cavalry squadrons and a suicide squad of terrorists 
from Dudayev's army. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chechen leader is more wary of his best-known compatriot, Ruslan I. 
Khasbulatov, who came home this summer aiming to unite Chechnya's fractious 
opposition. Authorities first put up roadblocks to bar him from towns where he 
planned to hold rallies, then accused him of treason and took away his 
citizenship. According to one report -- denied by the authorities -- a 
condemned killer was freed from jail to get rid of Khasbulatov. 
</P>
<P>
 If Moscow's air and land blockades eventually force Dudayev down and help 
Khasbulatov maneuver to the top, it could only mean more bad news for Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Khasbulatov, the wily pipe-smoking Chechen, who led Moscow's Soviet-era 
Parliament to months of belligerent resistance against his reforms -- until 
Yeltsin ordered tanks to blow up the building last October. A Troubled Region 
</P>
<P>
 The republic of Chechnya and its leader are posing a sticky problem for 
Russia. Moscow's support for an opposition group almost led to bloody conflict 
recently.

RTC INVESTIGATOR CLAIMS SUSPENSION IS 'RETRIBUTION'; WHITEWATER: ONE OF THREE 
AGENTS PLACED ON LEAVE CONTENDS THE AGENCY ACTED IN RESPONSE TO THEIR PROBE OF 
A FAILED THRIFT LINKED TO THE CLINTONS.

<P>
 A senior investigator charged Friday that top officials at the Resolution 
Trust Corp. have engaged in a "program of retribution" against the agency's 
field personnel who have investigated a failed Arkansas savings and loan owned 
by a friend of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 L. Richard Iorio, a supervisor in the criminal investigations office of the 
RTC's Kansas City regional office, complained through his attorney that the 
agency's decision to place Iorio and two other investigators on administrative 
leave will interfere with the ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Jack Ryan, acting chief executive of the RTC, Iorio's attorney 
wrote that the agency's decision to suspend the three while conducting an 
internal inquiry of their actions could send the "strong chilling message that 
those who investigate (Whitewater-related cases) may face allegations of 
wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 Iorio, fellow supervisor Lee Ausen and investigator Jean Lewis were placed on 
leave Aug. 15 by the RTC, the agency charged with cleaning up the 1980s' S&L 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC attorney April Breslaw testified during recent congressional Whitewater 
hearings that Lewis secretly tape-recorded her conversations during a February 
meeting in Kansas City as part of what Breslaw implied was a conspiracy by the 
investigators to compromise her attempts to determine the scope and direction 
of their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC spokesman Steve Katsanos said this week that the charges were serious 
enough to warrant an investigation by the RTC. If the three violated RTC 
policies, they could be subject to termination. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC's Kansas City field office was investigating Madison Guaranty Savings 
and Loan, an Arkansas thrift owned by James B. McDougal, partner of then-Gov. 
Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the Whitewater real 
estate venture. Until last October, Lewis was the lead investigator on the case 
and filed two criminal referrals to the Justice Department naming the Clintons 
and President Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign as possible beneficiaries 
of criminal acts at Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Iorio's attorney said his client agreed with Lewis that, as 
early as February, he and his staff were warned that certain key RTC managers 
would take a "dim view" of their investigation of Madison Guaranty. The letter 
demanded that the internal RTC inquiry of the three Kansas City officials be 
transferred to an independent inspector general.

CITING RUSSIA IN NUCLEAR SMUGGLING COULD BACKFIRE, EXPERTS CAUTION; GERMANY: 
AFTER SEIZURES OF PLUTONIUM, ANY FINGER-POINTING COULD CAUSE MOSCOW TO WITHHOLD 
COOPERATION ON SECURITY. 
</P>

<P>
 As a top German official headed here with evidence of nuclear smuggling from 
Russia, specialists in both countries warned Friday that harsh finger-pointing 
at Moscow could undermine international efforts to secure its vast stockpiles 
of bomb-making materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizure of more than 10 ounces of deadly plutonium in a suitcase flown 
from Moscow to Munich last week set off alarms in Germany about the disarray of 
Russia's nuclear Establishment, which lacks a full inventory of its 
weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alarm itself raised a new threat, officials and nuclear specialists 
here and in the West say. They noted that public blame of Russia's lax security 
has irritated the military and civilian bureaucrats who control the stockpile 
and resist any scrutiny by outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's readiness to help find the origin of the plutonium, the largest 
quantity of weapons-grade nuclear contraband ever seized, will be tested after 
a team led by Germany's intelligence coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer, arrives in 
Moscow today with data from the lab that analyzed it. 
</P>
<P>
 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the team of senior intelligence officials 
and nuclear scientists will urge Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin to tighten 
controls and reassure the Germans, whose police have seized three smaller 
shipments of stolen nuclear material since May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to tell our Russian friends, 'You must guarantee that these 
possibilities for theft are reduced as much as possible,' " Kohl said on German 
television. "We are not talking about car theft here. We're talking about 
dangers that are far different." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kohl has made his country Russia's 
biggest aid donor and last month helped bring Yeltsin into the exclusive club 
grouping leaders of the seven richest industrial nations. The Bonn-Moscow 
partnership is viewed as an anchor of stability in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they have done on a range of other contentious issues from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to the expansion of NATO, Russia and Germany showed this 
week how troubled a partnership it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The sniping started Monday, in edgy Cold War rhetoric. The Germans announced 
they had laboratory evidence of Russian manufacture for the plutonium-239 in 
the suitcase. "Pure fabrication," the Russians shot back, arguing that the 
German effort was aimed at boosting Kohl's party in the Oct. 16 elections and 
justifying foreign control over Russia's nuclear power industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service insisted that "not a single gram" 
of plutonium-239 was missing. German commentators said the denials recalled 
Chernobyl, the 1986 nuclear reactor disaster that Moscow covered up for 16 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Unnamed "nuclear experts" told Russia's Interfax news agency that "it is no 
coincidence" that all these "so-called nuclear smuggling incidents" are 
reported from Germany, where "a strong black market in radioactive materials" 
invites contraband from the world over. 
</P>
<P>
 German police, it turned out, knew that plutonium smugglers were aboard the 
flight from Moscow to Munich on Aug. 10. When Moscow vented outrage at not 
being informed at the time, Schmidbauer said the Germans suspected that 
unnamed, high-ranking Russians were involved and didn't want to tip them off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way this conflict is developing is dangerous and un-constructive," said 
Vladimir M. Kuznetsov, a former member of Yeltsin's nuclear regulatory agency. 
"Our nuclear safety system is virtually nonexistent, full of holes that cannot 
be patched without open, honest cooperation from the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, European scientists involved in the complex lab work of tracing the 
four smuggled batches cannot learn for sure where they originated and who stole 
them without active cooperation by Russian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the scientists' best guess is that at least two shipments -- the 
plutonium-239 seized in Munich and a six-gram batch taken from the garage of a 
German salesman -- came not from nuclear warheads but from Russian enrichment 
or reprocessing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not clear is whether the thieves breached military or civilian 
security in Russia and who the intended buyers were. In any case, German 
authorities said the larger plutonium batch was of sufficient purity and about 
1/20th the quantity required to build a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Kohl stressed the urgency of Russian action against smugglers, the 
Clinton Administration cautioned against jumping to conclusions about 
incomplete evidence.  
</P>
<P>
 After Secretary of State Warren Christopher met Friday in Brussels with his 
British, French and German counterparts, a British spokesman said they reached 
a consensus to avoid a confrontation that might stiffen resistance to Yeltsin 
in the Russian bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that can be done now is moral suasion . . . telling Yeltsin, 'This is 
your business,' " said Heinrich Vogel, a political scientist and Russian 
specialist in Cologne, Germany, who warned that too much pressure would invite 
"a conditioned reflex of keeping out the West." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian army, Atomic Energy Ministry and counterintelligence service are 
already suspicious of a multimillion-dollar U.S. program to assist them. The 
money would help store plutonium from warheads dismantled under disarmament 
treaties and help count bomb-making material scattered in research institutes, 
weapons labs, civilian power plants and nuclear waste dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 One objection is that U.S. inspectors would be present at Russian storage 
facilities, another that American companies would get most of the contracts to 
build them. As a result, the program is moving slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulatory agency set up by Yeltsin has also been trying to impose order 
over the nuclear stockpile, which since the Soviet Union broke up nearly three 
years ago is no longer managed or guarded by a single authority. One Russian 
official said there had been no comprehensive inspection of the stockpile in at 
least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian authorities can be made aware of the enormity of the problem," 
said Uwe Nerlich, deputy director of Munich's Ebenhausen Institute. "Kohl and 
Yeltsin will talk, and Clinton and Yeltsin will talk. That will be a first 
step. The question is what they can do even with the best of intentions."

U.S. OFFICIALS DEFEND DETENTION OF CUBAN REFUGEES AS MINOR POLICY SHIFT; 
IMMIGRATION: ATTY. GEN. RENO INSISTS THE 1966 ADJUSTMENT ACT IS NOT BEING 
REVOKED. INSTEAD, THE GOVERNMENT IS CHANGING HOW THE LAW IS APPLIED, WHICH WILL 
SLOW PROCESSING. 
</P>

<P>
 Justice Department officials Friday defended the legal basis for changing U.S. 
immigration policies toward Cuba and made clear that they are trying to stop 
all refugees except the 3,000 who immigrate legitimately each year through an 
American consular office in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno insisted that the Clinton Administration is not revoking 
the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act by which Congress granted favored treatment to 
refugees from the regime of Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno and others said the new policy simply changes the way the act is applied 
-- holding would-be immigrants in detention centers while their cases are 
pending, rather than releasing them immediately into American society, as had 
been the case under the old policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has the authority to detain anybody who illegally enters this 
country and we are exercising that authority again for the purpose of making 
sure that Castro knows he's got to solve his problems at home," Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under provisions of the Cuban Adjustment Act, a Cuban native or citizen could 
almost automatically get permanent-resident status in the United States a year 
after reaching U.S. shores. Although the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
had to approve an immigrant's "green card" application, this occurred routinely 
if the immigrant had no criminal record or serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after that, the refugee could expect to get U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who continue trying to reach U.S. shores in rickety boats, officials 
offered no promises of speedy processing -- only the specter of months in 
detention at the U.S. Navy's Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba if they are 
intercepted by Coast Guard patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller number who manage to reach Florida will face a similar period in 
detention centers there, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Cuban immigrants risked the dangerous 90-mile trip across the 
Florida Straits -- rather than simply seeking refuge at Guantanamo -- mainly 
because the congressional act requires Cubans to reach the United States to 
obtain permanent-resident status. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Marks, an official of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in New 
York, agreed with Reno that President Clinton's new policy does not violate the 
1966 adjustment act. Marks explained that benefits flow from the act once a 
Cuban immigrant is officially admitted into the United States by the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the new policy, which requires detention of refugees for an 
indeterminate time, prevents a Cuban immigrant from being admitted during that 
period, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno stressed that the most secure procedure for would-be immigrants is to 
contact the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, a quasi-embassy that Castro 
permits the U.S. government to maintain. That office will continue to process 
legal applications for immigration to the United States and will be expanded if 
necessary, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The special advantage for Cuban refugees stemmed from the mid-1960s, when 
Congress, eager to encourage defections from Castro's Communist regime, granted 
Cuban refugees immediate entry, virtually assuring that they would be able 
eventually to apply for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, the Pentagon said it is preparing to build additional detention 
camps at Guantanamo to house any Cuban refugees picked up by the Coast Guard 
under the President's new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Defense Department officials said the U.S. Atlantic Command 
based in Norfolk, Va., is reviewing the situation to decide whether to send 
more naval vessels to the area to help shuttle refugees from Coast Guard patrol 
boats to Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy base already is providing detention facilities for some 14,700 
Haitians who were picked up at sea and given "safe-haven" status. The camps for 
Cubans, to be built two miles from the Haitian shelters, would be designed to 
hold up to 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials said the Administration also had begun negotiations with 
several Caribbean countries to see if they would be willing to serve as safe 
havens for additional Cuban refugees -- as some have in the case of the 
Haitians -- but they declined to name those involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have asserted before that the naval base at Guantanamo can hold no 
more than 23,000 refugees, but some indicated on Friday that it could be 
enlarged to accommodate as many as 25,000, if the water-supply system could be 
enlarged. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that, given the time needed for transit by sea, the 
Cubans who were picked up Friday probably would not get to Guantanamo Bay until 
sometime Sunday. They said some 2,000 new refugees could be accommodated there 
without adding to the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear Friday whether the military would have to send 
additional troops to help bolster security at Guantanamo Bay once the Cubans 
arrive. There already have been three disturbances by Haitians, who have become 
increasingly restless. 
</P>
<P>
 Although defense officials insisted that the Pentagon would have no problem 
supplying additional warships, it was plain that the Navy would have to do some 
juggling to find the necessary amphibious vessels without straining the task 
force operating around Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has three amphibious ships in the area -- the Wasp, the 
Nashville and the Whidbey Island. Navy officials said the Whidbey Island would 
be available immediately but the other two are in the task force near Haiti and 
would have to transfer some equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wasp and the Nashville both are carrying contingents of Marines, who are 
on the ships to evacuate U.S. citizens from Haiti, should that become 
necessary. If the Navy ordered the Nashville to Cuba, the Wasp would remain off 
Haiti.

INNER TUBES THE WAY OUT FOR ONE OF LUCKY ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDITH STANLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Luis Figuredo Alejo, 34, arrived Friday at the processing center for Cuban 
refugees in downtown Miami, making him eligible for immediate resettlement 
because he arrived before the Administration imposed a detention policy. He had 
left Cuba on inner tubes Tuesday night. Through an interpreter, he told his 
story to Times researcher Edith Stanley:  
</P>
<P>
 "I am from Santa Domingo in Villa Clara, Cuba. I was a plumber, but there was 
not enough work. I couldn't make a living. I have no family in Miami. I have 17 
sisters and brothers in Cuba and a mother and father. I left my wife and 
11-year-old son behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have wanted to come to the United States since I was 17. I was harassed by 
the government for ideological differences. I wanted to listen to Beatles 
music. I wanted to wear long hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1980 I tried to come out with the Mariel boat lift. I wrote a letter to 
Raul Castro pleading my case. They denied my request because they said I was 
under military age and had not served military service. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1981 I was drafted into the Army. I tried to make them think I was nuts. I 
threatened a captain with a loaded rifle. They didn't consider me nuts but beat 
the hell out of me. After several more incidents, they put me in a hospital. 
They finally let me out of the Army for psychological reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I came out of the army I went to school, where they tried to 
re-indoctrinate me to the Communist system. I refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1993 I couldn't take it any more. I got a raft made of two rubber tires 
and tried to make it off the island. I was captured by Cuban authorities. When 
their boat pulled beside my raft they tried to turn the raft over. Then they 
took me on board and the crew hit, pushed, and pulled my hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was held for 19 days in jail, but my lawyer got me off. He told the judge 
if there is no sail and no motor then I could have been fishing. He said I 
couldn't leave the island without a sail or motor. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a person has tried to leave, and even if they are found not guilty, 
there is a stigma. I could not find a job. The only way I could survive was to 
work with the black market, which is widespread for food and commodities. It is 
the best way to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Aug. 16th, a friend came to me because he knew I dealt with the black 
market. The friend wanted to know where to get an inner tube. When he told me 
what he wanted it for I said if you want to go, we go tonight. I had stolen two 
inner tubes from the government and had them hidden. At 11:30 or midnight on 
the 16th, four of us met at my house. We said we will go tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my wife and she said, 'Row, and you will make it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife said she would not come because she's the only child and she doesn't 
want to leave her mother behind. My son loves his mother and will stay with 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 He took from a plastic bag his only possession, a worn color snapshot of 
himself kneeling beside his smiling blonde son. Tears came to his eyes as he 
shared the photo.  
</P>
<P>
 "We put the two tubes together with canvas cloth and left that night. All we 
had for power was oars. We brought supplies for four or five days. The only 
time I was scared was when we were in the port of Havana and a large ship was 
coming in. We were afraid the ship would run over us. He couldn't possibly see 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rowed eight hours and apparently caught the current. A fishing boat 
escaping with refugees found us about 27 miles out. They took us aboard. On the 
way over we passed a lot of others who could not get on board because they had 
reached the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 40 miles out the Coast Guard rescued us. When we got to Key West they 
treated us very well. I am more than lucky to have arrived. I could have 
drowned. I could have been put in detention."

REPORT FAULTS GOVERNMENT'S 'REINVENTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's "reinventing government" initiative has generated 
high-profile displays of government waste and numerous meetings with federal 
employees to promote efficiency but little real change, according to a 
first-anniversary appraisal of the program by the Brookings Institution, a 
liberal think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more positive note, discussion of the plan, championed by Vice President 
Al Gore, has forced federal officials to make efficiency a higher priority, the 
report says. The plan has "launched a broad reform movement in the right 
direction and it has been asking the right questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Gore pledged when they launched the program last fall to cut 
252,000 jobs, or 12% of the federal work force, and to save $108 billion in the 
next six years. 
</P>
<P>
 But by ignoring the need for congressional cooperation and by focusing on the 
elimination of jobs to cut red tape, the initiative has alienated many of the 
bureaucrats who will determine its success or failure, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 The "strategy for public support -- shrinking the federal government -- risks 
undercutting its efforts to transform the government's inner workings by 
alienating public employees," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The study commended the initiative, however, for forcing federal workers to 
seriously consider how to improve efficiency. The program, officially called 
the National Performance Review, "has the potential, together with the New Deal 
and the Hoover commissions, to be one of the three most important 
administrative initiatives of the 20th Century," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics and some career bureaucrats had scoffed at the initiative, saying it 
was akin to governmental reform programs developed during previous 
administrations. But Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison and the study's author, said: "This is real. It's happening 
on the front lines." 
</P>
<P>
 In its first year, the effort has generated 384 recommendations to cut red 
tape. The initiative has eliminated the SF-171 -- a much-loathed federal job 
application form -- updated the government's contracting rules and started to 
break Washington's bureaucratic "culture," according to the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative also set up more than 100 reinvention laboratories across the 
country to test management innovations at a lower level.

CONGRESSMAN CHARGED WITH SEX CRIMES; INDICTMENT: REP. MEL REYNOLDS OF CHICAGO 
IS ACCUSED OF HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH AN UNDERAGE CAMPAIGN WORKER. HE HAS DENIED 
ANY WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds (D-Ill.) was indicted Friday on charges that he had sex 
with an underage campaign volunteer, induced her to recant her accusations and 
to leave the state, lied to investigators and tried to influence witnesses to 
lie to the county grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds also is reportedly facing separate investigations into his handling 
of campaign finances in 1992. Marc Kurstin, the manager of a currency exchange 
here, confirmed published accounts that the Reynolds campaign cashed thousands 
of dollars' worth of checks in small amounts from individual contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds had no comment on Friday, but has heatedly denied any wrongdoing, 
replying in detail to specific charges -- both sexual and financial -- in 
interviews with local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward M. Genson and Terence P. Gillespie, Reynolds' attorneys, said Friday in 
a statement that "the charges are utterly lacking in any substance," adding 
that "we are extremely confident that the congressman will be fully 
vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old Reynolds, a former Rhodes scholar who ousted a 12-year 
incumbent to gain his house seat in 1992, had been enjoying a highly visible 
first term. He appeared on "Nightline" to discuss gun control and briefed 
President Clinton on his travels to Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 A protege of fellow Chicago Rep. Dan Rostenkowski -- himself under indictment 
on unrelated charges -- Reynolds was the only freshman appointed to the 
prestigious House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He is seeking reelection from a district that includes parts of the city's 
South Side and southern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's indictment centers on an alleged consensual affair which the accuser 
said began during Reynolds' campaign in June of 1992 and continued into 1993, 
when she turned 17, according to Cook County State's Atty. Jack O'Malley, who 
spoke at a press conference at a South Side courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The accuser, now in a witness protection program, approached police early in 
June. "One of her concerns frankly was whether or not she could obtain 
justice," O'Malley said. "She was making those allegations against a very 
powerful man." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that month and in July, O'Malley contended, Reynolds persuaded the 
accuser to sign a letter recanting her charges. O'Malley said he then asked her 
to get him a lewd photograph of a 15-year-old girl, and had her hide out of 
state from investigators. The accuser later changed her mind again and said her 
original account was true. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Sun-Times reported last week that Reynolds distributed copies of 
the accuser's retraction during interviews lasting several hours at the 
newspaper's office. 
</P>
<P>
 At his own press conference last week, Reynolds said he never had sex with his 
accuser and that she was "troubled." He said that the investigation was 
racially motivated -- he is African American -- and also stemmed from the 
disgruntlement of former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is wrong," O'Malley said in response. 
</P>
<P>
 In returning the indictment, the Cook County Grand Jury decided that Reynolds 
should face 20 charges, including two counts of criminal sexual assault under 
an Illinois law that prohibits an adult from engaging in sex with a person 
under the age of 18 who is in their "trust, authority or supervision." A 
conviction on that charge would bring a mandatory prison sentence of four to 15 
years, O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other charges are eight counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, one 
count of solicitation of child pornography, three counts of child pornography, 
five counts of obstructing justice and one count of communicating with 
witnesses in an attempt to dissuade them from testifying truthfully before the 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Convictions on those charges could be satisfied by probation, O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds was in Washington on Friday, O'Malley said. Law enforcement officials 
said they had expected him to be in Chicago. The terms of his surrender will be 
negotiated at a bond hearing scheduled for Monday. "Out of respect for the 
office of congressman," O'Malley said, "we will not arrest him." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds was born in Mound Bayou, Miss., and moved to Chicago with his family 
when he was 9. He studied at Yale University, graduated from the University of 
Illinois and studied law at Oxford University. He worked for Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) in his failed presidential campaign in 1980 and in the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson's 1984 campaign as the candidate's traveling assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 He defeated Rep. Gus Savage in the 1992 primary election -- after two earlier 
unsuccessful challenges -- by appealing to moderates who had grown disenchanted 
with the incumbent's criticism of whites and, increasingly, Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds capitalized on a redrawn district, with nearly half its residents 
living outside the city. The population is 68% black, 27% white and 7% Latino. 
It encompasses poor, working-class and affluent neighborhoods.

 On the eve of a crucial directors' meeting that may determine his future at 
the NAACP, Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. appeared Friday at a news 
conference here in an effort to defuse allegations by a second female employee 
of job-related impropriety.  
</P>
<P>
 Chavis stood beside Susan Tisdale of Cleveland at the news conference. Tisdale 
told reporters that she had experienced job-related problems with Chavis while 
employed as an assistant to his wife at the National Assn. for the Advancement 
of Colored People. She refused to offer details and insisted that the problems 
no longer trouble her. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Baltimore Sun reported Thursday that the NAACP had received a letter 
from her lawyer charging sexual harassment by Chavis and wrongful termination. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employment concerns I had with Dr. Chavis and the NAACP have been 
mutually and fully resolved without any monetary compensation or promise of 
monetary compensation," said Tisdale, whose husband, Brent Tisdale, also 
attended the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis looked on as Tisdale read a five-page statement. She declined to answer 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 For Chavis, the news conference offered a final opportunity to put his spin on 
today's board meeting as he fights to retain his office in the wake of the 
scandal that erupted when the NAACP board learned he had used organization 
money to pay off another former employee who alleged that she had suffered 
sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Mary E. Stansel, who served as Chavis' aide for about five weeks, 
filed suit against the NAACP and its executive director, citing a breach of 
contract in their failure to pay her $250,000 of a secretly brokered settlement 
to avoid charges of sexual discrimination and wrongful termination. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Chavis promised to help her find an $80,000-a-year job in the 
Washington area and to give her $84,000 -- including $64,000 of the NAACP's 
money -- as part of a promised $332,000 settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 64 board members were outraged that Chavis acted without their 
knowledge and are expected to seek his dismissal during the closed session 
today at the group's headquarters. Chavis has argued that it was within his 
authority as chief executive to settle employment complaints without notifying 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy further complicates Chavis' efforts to keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no dispute between Ms. Tisdale and I," Chavis said testily when 
asked if he had a problem with female employees. "There was a misunderstanding 
between Ms. Tisdale and myself about employment. As a result of discussions 
we've had, we've resolved those. There is no sexual harassment and no sexual 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 That conclusion, however, seems to contradict legal papers contained in a 
confidential report prepared by Chavis' attorneys and given to board members 
last week in preparation of the meeting. In the papers, attorneys representing 
Tisdale argue that "she was subject to advances by Dr. Chavis and as a result 
she was suffering from emotional duress." The papers note that Tisdale 
requested $100,000 in compensation from Chavis and he refused to settle with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, Tisdale said she has known Chavis and his family for 
about two years, noting that when the Chavis family lived in Cleveland, "our 
children played together and our families socialized regularly." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she accepted a job at the NAACP in January and lived briefly at the 
Chavis house -- with his wife, Martha, and their two children -- before her 
family relocated to Baltimore. After working several months at the NAACP 
headquarters as an assistant to Martha Chavis, who is the unpaid director of a 
program called Women In the NAACP, Tisdale said "employment concerns 
developed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore Sun reported Friday that the legal papers show that she wrote to 
Chavis and demanded reassignment to another job within the NAACP after she was 
fired by Martha Chavis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given that you cannot provide me with a safe working environment because Mrs. 
Chavis has unlawfully forced me out of my position as executive secretary for 
WIN based on non-business-related reasons, I respectfully request to be 
reassigned to another position in the building," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Tisdale and Chavis chastised board members for disclosing to reporters 
the legal documents, which had not been filed and were still being negotiated 
by lawyers. They also denounced the media for pursuing the matter while Chavis 
is struggling to keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nature of the concern was a private matter," Tisdale said, noting she had 
tried to settle the matter quietly with the help of lawyers because of her 
friendship with the Chavis family. "Regretfully, due to this campaign to 
destroy the career of Dr. Chavis and oust him as executive director of the 
NAACP, this has now become a public situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis accused "a small . . . number of persons within the NAACP, as well as 
some more substantial forces outside the NAACP and outside the African American 
community" with "an orchestrated campaign to defame the NAACP, to defame me and 
to defame my leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would expose the conspirators to his board and that it would be up 
to the board to deal with it. "We in the NAACP are under attack," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Chavis admitted that he has been hurt by steady pounding from news reports and 
his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are the subject of daily news coverage, most of which is inaccurate 
and based on false information, it does take its toll," he said. "But . . . I 
have no intention of resigning from the NAACP."

 Determined to end a brutal ethnic war, Sri Lanka's new prime minister created 
a Ministry of Ethnic Affairs on Friday and promised talks with separatists and 
minority leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have stretched our hand of friendship and hope that the Tamil Tigers . . . 
will take it and come for discussion with us and re-enter the democratic 
process," Chandrika Kumaratunga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga was named prime minister Thursday. Her top priority is ending the 
11-year guerrilla war that has left 34,000 people dead and forced the 
government to spend 20% of its annual budget on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels are demanding a Tamil homeland in the Indian Ocean republic, where 
Sinhalese Buddhists are a majority and Hindu Tamils 7% of the 17 million 
population.  
</P>
<P>
 To make peace, Kumaratunga will have to negotiate with the defeated United 
National Party. Its leader, Dingiri Banda Wijetunga, is the country's president 
and heads the Defense Ministry.

PERES URGES PLO TO TIGHTEN SECURITY; MIDEAST: TO MARK ANNIVERSARY OF ACCORD, 
ISRAEL SENDS FOREIGN MINISTER TO GAZA, RELEASES PRISONERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Israel observed the first anniversary of its accord with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization by releasing hundreds more Palestinian prisoners Friday 
and sending Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to the Gaza Strip to warn PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat that he must prevent Palestinian attacks against 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement that Peres and PLO officials secretly initialed in Oslo a year 
ago "changed the whole realities and destinies of the Middle East," Peres said 
at a news conference with Arafat. "It was an opening through which a strong 
current of peace began to flow." 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview with Israel Radio before he flew by helicopter to Gaza, 
becoming the first senior Israeli official to meet with Arafat in Gaza since 
Israel handed over control of daily life there to the Palestinians, Peres 
complained about the PLO security record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't demand 100% success" by Palestinian police in preventing attacks 
against Israelis, Peres said. "We expect an effort of 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli government has been pressuring Arafat to crack down on militant 
Islamic groups in the Gaza Strip since Sunday, when one Israeli was shot dead 
and six others were wounded in two drive-by shootings. Hamas, a militant 
Islamic group opposed to the PLO peace accord with Israel, claimed 
responsibility for the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Arafat and Peres on Thursday sought to minimize the differences between 
the PLO and Israel over how to combat attacks against Israelis and over how 
quickly Arafat should move to secure the Palestine National Council's 
revocation of elements of the Palestinian National Covenant that call for the 
destruction of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has pledged to seek annulment of parts of the charter but has been 
reluctant to convene the council because he is not assured of obtaining the 
two-thirds vote necessary to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud opposition in Israel's Parliament, 
on Friday declared the PLO agreement a failure because of ongoing attacks 
against Israelis and failure to annul the covenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement has proven to be a one-sided agreement, in which Israel alone 
is honoring her commitments while the PLO is consistently breaching all its 
commitments," Netanyahu asserted in an interview on Israel Radio. "I don't 
propose we return to Gaza. Gaza is behind us. The question here is, where are 
we going?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Peres confirmed that Israel next week will hand over responsibility 
for education throughout the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority. They said 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will continue to work toward agreement on 
handing over other elements of civil affairs to the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of Palestinian prisoners still in Israeli jails remains one obstacle. 
Israel released 249 more but demanded that they be confined to Jericho, the 
only place in the West Bank where the Palestinian Authority is in full control 
of civil life. 
</P>
<P>
 Saeb Erekat, in charge of municipal affairs for the authority, said that 
Jericho's infrastructure cannot absorb all the prisoners Israel is dumping 
there. Jericho is already housing 280 freed prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 And the newly free prisoners had their own gripes. Moayed Dbaik, 20, of 
Nablus, interviewed by Reuters while sweating in a sweltering, tin-roofed 
building at the Arab Development Society farm complex, said: "Prison was even 
better than this. Animals would refuse to live in a place like this."

REBELS KILL 7 IN TAJIK BORDER ATTACK ON RUSSIAN SOLDIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 250 Muslim militants stormed across the border from Afghanistan and 
attacked Russian troops in the biggest border clash this year in Tajikistan's 
civil war, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian soldiers drove back the rebels after five hours of fierce fighting 
that left seven Russians and about 50 militants dead, Russia's Foreign Ministry 
said in Moscow.Fourteen Russian troops were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian forces supporting the government in the former Soviet republic will 
continue to take "decisive action," the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tajik government defeated a loose coalition of pro-democratic forces and 
Islamic fundamentalists in a bloody civil war in 1992 that claimed at least 
20,000 lives. Muslim rebels hoping to topple the pro-Communist government 
periodically cross the border into Tajikistan from bases in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian troops were sent to Tajikistan last year to stop what Moscow calls a 
flood of drugs, weapons and Islamic fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Asian nation was relatively calm through the first part of this 
year, but rebels recently stepped up their hit-and-run attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest battle, the rebels heavily shelled the Russian border guards 
overnight from outposts in Afghanistan, then launched a pre-dawn attack across 
the border, said Valentin Malyutin, a spokesman for Russia's border guards in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia on Friday demanded that the Afghan government take urgent steps to stop 
attacks from its side of the border. Afghanistan has denied supporting the 
Tajik rebels but concedes it has little control over the rugged frontier 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Friday's attack apparently was staged by Kori Hamidullo, a 
Tajik rebel commander who headed a similar attack last year on the same border 
outpost in which 25 Russians were killed.

EX-GENERALS ACQUITTED IN POLISH PRIEST'S DEATH; COURTS: OUTRAGE FOLLOWS VERDICT 
IN 1984 SLAYING OF PRO-SOLIDARITY CLERIC, WHICH MARKED TURNING POINT IN 
MOVEMENT'S STRUGGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two top generals in the former Polish secret police were acquitted Friday of 
plotting the murder of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the popular pro-Solidarity 
priest whose brutal death 10 years ago was a seminal event in Poland's struggle 
for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of courtroom onlookers, many wearing pins bearing the charismatic 
priest's photograph, raised their fists and shouted in anger as presiding Judge 
Jaroslaw Goral announced the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a disgrace! A betrayal!" screamed Krystyna Gozdziewska, a member of 
the Warsaw parish where Popieluszko's fiery anti-Communist sermons attracted 
international attention. "It is a shameful day for Poland." 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing months of the two-year trial, the Warsaw regional court agreed 
to reduce the charges against the former generals, Wladyslaw Ciaston and Zenon 
Platek, from masterminding the murder to simply inciting it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecution was unable to meet even the lesser burden of proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution tried to find out the truth, but the trial showed that the 
prosecution had no chance," an apologetic Goral told the courtroom after 
ordering it cleared of protesters. "Just like in a different situation, Father 
Popieluszko didn't have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Popieluszko was kidnaped, tortured and murdered Oct. 19, 1984, while on his 
way home to Warsaw from a church service out of town. Police divers found his 
bound, gagged and beaten body 11 days later in a Vistula River reservoir, a 
noose around his neck and a sack weighted with stones tied to his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder shocked the nation -- several hundred thousand mourners attended 
his funeral -- and instantly breathed new life into the then-underground 
Solidarity movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The death gave a martyr to the outlawed union, which anointed the 
frail-looking priest its patron and tightened its ties with the Roman Catholic 
Church. For years, defiant Poles displayed his photograph in their windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the murder of Father Jerzy, events happened that could not be stopped," 
said attorney Krzysztof Piesiewicz, who represented the Popieluszko family at 
the trial. "The government couldn't keep certain things secret anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In his autobiography, Polish President Lech Walesa, who led the Solidarity 
movement, said the killing helped persuade "the more reasonable part of the 
government machinery" to renounce violence, thus paving the way for 
Solidarity's eventual rise to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father Popieluszko's death helped compromise take the place of struggle, and 
put Poland on the right road," Walesa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciaston and Platek, both of whom refused to testify during the trial, spoke 
bitterly of their ordeal, claiming they were the victims of a political witch 
hunt. The generals were arrested in 1990 and imprisoned for two years before 
being freed at the start of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the very beginning, this process was intended to divert the attention of 
a society disappointed by the changes taking place after 1989," Ciaston said. 
"You can ask Solidarity if they thought the changes they brought about would 
lead to 3 million unemployed." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, once high-ranking Communist officials in the Interior Ministry, 
claimed credit for the arrest and murder convictions of four low-level security 
officials who carried out the killing. The showy public trial in 1985 was 
intended to demonstrate the Communist regime's resolve to punish the killers, 
two of whom have since been released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciaston and Platek were implicated in the murder plot during the 1985 trial, 
but Communist authorities did not pursue the trail of responsibility any 
further. Both men soon lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until the end of Communist rule in 1989 that a case was made 
against them. By then, much of the evidence was missing or altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so upset I can barely speak," said Tadeusz Klimek, a retired steel 
worker and volunteer bodyguard to Popieluszko who fought back tears outside the 
courtroom. "Father Jerzy did so much for Poland, but with decisions like this, 
I am just worried that his sacrifice might have been in vain."

BOSNIAN SERBS TRAIN BIG GUNS ON RELIEF PLANES OVER SARAJEVO, U.N. SAYS; 
BALKANS: AIRLIFT IS SUSPENDED. ATTACKS ON PEACEKEEPERS CONTINUE, WITH FRENCH 
SOLDIER SLAIN BY A SNIPER. 
</P>

<P>
 The weapons exclusion zone decreed around this city in February is so 
routinely violated now that Bosnian Serbs have been observed training 
antiaircraft guns on humanitarian relief planes from inside a U.N. artillery 
impoundment site, a U.N. spokesman conceded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlift of food and medicine to the Bosnian capital was suspended late 
Thursday after a 120-millimeter mortar round fired from another location within 
the exclusion zone landed on the tarmac of the U.N.-controlled airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further sign that the relative peace of the past six months has 
deteriorated, a French peacekeeper was shot to death Friday morning while on 
patrol in central Sarajevo -- the first sniping casualty since last weekend's 
agreement by the warring factions to cease targeting people in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest admissions that rebel forces have heavy weapons in offensive 
positions and virtual free run of U.N. weapons containment sites have made a 
mockery of the cease-fire proclaimed here in February. It was backed by NATO 
threats to launch air strikes against offending forces. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military observers reported in a confidential cable to mission 
headquarters that they witnessed Bosnian Serb gunmen on Wednesday manning three 
40-millimeter antiaircraft guns "being trained on aircraft approaching and 
departing Sarajevo airport." They described the weapons as "set up and prepared 
for action," in clear violation of the weapons exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 No U.N. soldiers were in sight of the depot in Bosnian Serb-held Ilidza, and 
monitors were unable to gain entrance or make contact with rebel commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at the same weapons depot, supposedly under the watch of Ukrainian 
peacekeepers, that Bosnian Serb gunmen seized a tank, two armored personnel 
carriers and an antiaircraft gun two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That event prompted an air strike by North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces 
that destroyed a World War II-era mounted gun the rebels had also deployed into 
the exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But from within another of the 10 U.N.-monitored weapons sites, in the suburb 
of Bare, Bosnian Serb rebels fired on Bosnian government troops last week, 
confirming that many of the tanks and guns that were supposed to have been 
rendered inoperable in detention are combat-ready and within the rebels' easy 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total situation is not very satisfactory," U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob Annink 
said of the latest cease-fire and exclusion zone violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission wants the number of containment sites reduced and the heavy 
weapons consolidated for more effective monitoring, Annink said. "But this has 
to be negotiated," he added, conceding that the Bosnian Serbs have refused to 
allow any change that would hamper access to their impounded guns. 
</P>
<P>
 All heavy weapons within a 12-mile radius of Sarajevo were to have been 
surrendered or withdrawn by Feb. 21, according to the NATO ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an attempt to avoid firing on Bosnian Serb positions and compromising 
the neutrality of the U.N. peacekeeping force, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, 
commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia, declared more than 100 tanks, guns and 
other heavy weapons still inside the cordon to be under the "effective control" 
of his monitoring forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO ultimatum was then further diluted by the U.N. mission here to allow 
Bosnian Serb rebels to "repair and maintain" weapons they were said to have 
surrendered but in many cases simply allowed U.N. troops to observe from 
nearby. That concession has allowed the rebels to gradually take over control 
of the weapons and restore them to working order. 
</P>
<P>
 A European officer at the mission command post here also conceded that a 
U.N.-mediated agreement aimed at tracking down and punishing snipers has not 
yet been put into force because Bosnian Serb gunmen refuse to grant U.N. 
patrols access to the high-rise apartment buildings of the Grbavica 
neighborhood from which the rebels are known to shelter snipers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-year-old French soldier patrolling the front line between Grbavica and 
downtown Sarajevo died of his wounds a few hours after being "deliberately 
targeted," said another mission spokesman, Maj. Dacre Holloway. He said the 
location and identity of the sniper could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 U.N. troops have been killed on duty since the mission deployed 
to Croatia in early 1992. It has since expanded its involvement to include 
Bosnia and Macedonia. More than 1,000 soldiers have been wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting toll and the increasing frustration with the lack of progress in 
negotiating an end to the conflict have stepped up pressure in European 
countries with troops in the Balkans to withdraw their forces and lift an arms 
embargo shackling the Bosnian government, effectively leaving the conflict to 
be resolved on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Fikret Abdic, the embattled rebel Muslim leader, surrendered Friday 
to forces loyal to the Bosnian government in the northwest enclave of Bihac, 
the United Nations' Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdic, a former member of the Bosnian presidency, split with Sarajevo last 
year over his willingness to deal with nearby Serbs. He proclaimed the land he 
controlled the autonomous province of Western Bosnia. But Abdic had seen 
two-thirds of his fighting brigades knocked out by government troops. Earlier 
this week, he rejected Sarajevo's ultimatum to surrender within a week.

 The night before, the sky had blazed with lightning and the rain had fallen 
hard enough to bounce off the rocks. A new breed of angry young thugs had gone 
marauding. Friday morning, it rains again, a mountain rain with a chill to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The people rise from the ground to count their losses, if they still have 
anything left to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 So begins another day: The blue 1 1/2-ton trucks start down the narrow, 
potholed roads on their twice-a-day rounds to gather up the bodies. With a 
rattle and a roar, army flatbeds strike out in convoy with quivering rubber 
containers of chlorinated water. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors rise to new columns of the sick, still without the proper antibiotics 
to treat the rising epidemic of dysentery. Relief workers ponder the same 
difficult questions: What is the mood in the camps? Will it be safe to deliver 
food? Should they wait until the people are hungrier and perhaps more docile? 
Should they risk another riot and try to distribute plastic sheeting? Or wait 
and hope someone will send in troops to maintain order? 
</P>
<P>
 It is crazy, unfathomable, numbing. This is now what passes for normal for 
850,000 Rwandan refugees and for the legion of relief workers who have gathered 
here in the belief that suffering is not a spectator activity. 
</P>
<P>
 All across Africa, other refugees awoke Friday to the 20th Century's version 
of the Stone Age. Half the world's refugees are huddled in misery on this 
continent. But these refugees in Goma -- because of their numbers, because of 
the slaughter they wrought on their way here, because of their apocalyptic 
encounters with disease -- have become extraordinary in the eyes of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps there is another reason for the world's uneasy fascination with 
Goma. These people, with their lice and dysentery, their bare feet and wet 
coughs and bent backs and orphaned children and oozing clothes, represent a 
scary sermon. This is where hatred will get you. 
</P>
<P>
 Just up the road -- a day's walk, or three or four -- each of these families 
has a home. Rwanda was a country that did not suffer Africa's periodic droughts 
and famine. It was crowded because it was lush. Rwanda fed itself from terraced 
farms on dramatic green mountains. It exported tea and coffee -- and wouldn't 
you know it, frost in Brazil has made 1994 a banner year for coffee growers 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that quality of life can be measured in the beauty of one's 
surroundings, Rwandans were even rich. The trees were hung with flowers and 
shaded roads and paths. The weather was mild, seldom hot. The soil was hard but 
fertile, and the rains brought happiness, not misery. And who in Rwanda could 
not lift their eyes to the glorious vistas of African mountains and tropical 
clouds, misty skies and banana groves?  
</P>
<P>
 But hatred was more vital than any of this. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the power now," says Alexis Karera. 
</P>
<P>
 Karera is a Hutu. The "they" who now hold power are the Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Karera had a nice home with a concrete floor, a wife and children, 
just a two-day walk from Goma. All of it is a memory now. 
</P>
<P>
 With the death of Rwanda's Hutu president in April, Hutus turned on the 
country's Tutsi minority, killing hundreds of thousands. But in mere months, 
the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front routed the mostly Hutu government's 
army and took "the power." 
</P>
<P>
 So Karera is a refugee now, living here with neighbors, dozens of them, 
crammed together in a space smaller than half of his old bean field. His wife 
has died. He is vague about his children's fate. Perhaps they were abandoned in 
the hope that an orphanage would offer them a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with most of the refugees here, Karera has ignored the calls to go home. 
Hatred brought on Rwanda's civil war. The fear of retribution now holds him 
here, where he is lucky to have an 8-by-10-foot sheet of plastic over his head. 
And under this damp shelter, sour hatred ferments anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees announced 
for the first time that it had detected a sharp decline in the number of 
refugees willing to take the risk of returning home. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, relief agencies said that more than 4,000 Tutsis who had settled in 
this area -- as far back as 1959 -- after fleeing as refugees from earlier 
ethnic strife in Rwanda have now gone home. Perhaps one of them has moved into 
Karera's old farm house and is tending his bean field. Other Tutsis who fled to 
Tanzania and Burundi are also flocking home from old refugee camps. After all, 
they now have the power. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's homestead time for the Tutsi. They can go up there and grab 20 acres of 
bananas. It's a little land rush," said Rob Denny, a relief worker with the 
International Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Goma, deaths in the Hutu camps are rising again. After reaching a low 
of about 500 a day last week, the toll from disease has now risen to 600 a day. 
Dysentery is the leading killer. Unlike cholera, shigella dysentery cannot be 
treated with just food and water. Expensive antibiotics are required, and of 
course there is nowhere near enough of those. 
</P>
<P>
 So the ill are given a place to lie and are kept hydrated with water and 
minerals. The strong will pull through. But the arrival of the rainy season 
last week, on top of more than a month of camp life, has weakened almost 
everyone. And the rains are likely to go on for six months more. Relief 
officials said they estimate that 40,000 people have died here in just over a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of it all, however, hatred thrives. 
</P>
<P>
 With no Tutsis on which to focus their anger, the refugee Hutus are turning on 
each other. "There are troubles every day. In the last few nights, bands of 
young thugs have emerged and are terrorizing the camps," said Ray Wilkinson, a 
U.N. spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the refugees fled village by village, and each village reassembled 
here with its same social structure of elders and mayors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is troubling now," Wilkinson said, "is that these young thugs could 
prove a challenge to the only order there was in the camps. It's open season on 
these people. And now that we know that they are going to be here for a very 
long time, what are we going to do about this?"

ZAIRE MAY CLOSE ITS RWANDA BORDER; AFRICA: GOVERNMENT AIMS TO HEAD OFF A CRISIS 
NEAR BUKAVU SIMILAR TO GOMA. SOURCES SAY ACTION COULD COME SUNDAY. 
</P>

 Fearing that another Goma is about to consume their country, Zairian 
authorities threatened to close the border from Rwanda and to try to halt an 
ever-growing tide of refugees, the U.N. refugee office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, about 136,000 Rwandans have moved across the Rusizi River from Rwanda 
into Bukavu, Zaire -- with only 56,000 of them now contained in camps and the 
rest clogging this onetime resort city. Raw sewage is running in the streets, 
and diseases are spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that 200,000 
more Rwandans are massed just across the border, with roads leading in this 
direction crowded with tens of thousands more. In total, perhaps 1 million 
people are within walking distance of this Zairian border town. 
</P>
<P>
 Goma, to the north, was besieged by perhaps 1 million Rwandan refugees last 
month in one of the greatest refugee catastrophes of modern times. At least 
40,000 died there. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly when the border would close remained uncertain Friday night. Jerry van 
Mourik, a worker with the refugee agency who was posted on the Rwandan side of 
the border, said "heavily armed" Zairian troops were moving into position on 
the opposite river bank with orders to block the two bridges at noon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 That would roughly coincide with a midnight Sunday withdrawal of French troops 
from the "safety zone" that they established for Hutus in that southwestern 
part of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been notified that they are thinking of closing the border," said 
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. agency. "They told us if they were headed 
for another Goma-type situation, they would close the border for security 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials said they were of mixed mind about a border closing. On one 
hand, the United Nations maintains that nations should not refuse refugees 
entry. On the other hand, Janowski said, "They're much better off and safer in 
this case on the other side of the border." 
</P>
<P>
 Some relief officials said they were worried about how Zaire could shut off 
the flow of such a great press of people, who already face what the United 
Nations has called "a psychosis of entrapment." 
</P>
<P>
 Would the refugees take to the water and try to swim? Would the Zairian 
soldiers open fire? 
</P>
<P>
 At the border, relief officials said they counted 30 refugees a minute 
crossing the bridge, possibly 15,000 during the day, up from perhaps 6,000 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees, Hutus running from the possibility that Rwanda's new 
Tutsi-dominated government may exact retribution for the slaughter of hundreds 
of thousands of Tutsis by Hutus, have been stampeded by the imminent departure 
of French troops who have been protecting them in southern Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, a joint statement by President Francois Mitterrand and Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur repeated that the French would stick to their 
scheduled departure at midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears are likely to be heightened further, the Reuters news agency reported 
Friday, if word spreads of a report by some non-governmental groups saying they 
have uncovered evidence of Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) fighters massacring 
returning Hutu refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizations -- the Dutch disaster relief agency Novib, two Zairian 
groups and a Rwandan collective -- say their report is based on interviews with 
four wounded Rwandans who say they survived mass executions in the Virunga 
wildlife park that separates northwest Rwanda from Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 With nowhere else to go in this terraced, hillside city, refugees are jamming 
onto Bukavu's traffic circles, packing into parks and gardens and into the 
front yards of local residents. Trees continue to fall all over town, and those 
too big to chop down are being whittled away at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Water supply, traffic and sanitation are plainly at a crisis point, and 
certain to worsen.

CHINA, VIETNAM HOLD FORMAL TALKS ON LONGTIME LAND AND SEA DISPUTES; ASIA: OIL 
DRILLING RIGHTS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA ARE MAIN ISSUE. DIALOGUE MAY HELP EASE 
ANCIENT CONFLICT. 
</P>

<P>
 The narrow valley that cuts through the sheer cliffs and rugged limestone 
outcroppings on the border separating China and Vietnam is known today on both 
sides of the frontier as Friendship Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 But for centuries, China's most important southern pass, only 100 miles 
northeast of Hanoi, carried more belligerent names, such as Conquering 
Barbarian Pass and Conquering South Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the traditional route for invading Chinese armies. No other place 
better symbolizes the long-standing enmity between China and Vietnam, which has 
never forgiven 1,000 years of Chinese rule that ended in 939 A.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese and Vietnamese officials met in Hanoi this week to discuss their land 
and sea boundaries, agreeing to disagree but to keep on talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "These talks have brought about better understanding of each other's 
positions," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan told reporters. "However, 
it is impossible to reach agreement on such complicated questions within one or 
two negotiations. The two sides agreed to continue their study and 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Few specifics were reported as to points that the two sides discussed. But 
China's official news agency reported that the parties "reached some common 
views," including not using force to settle their dispute and keeping up a 
dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 They apparently reached no consensus on what was clearly their hottest topic: 
their feud over oil drilling rights in the South China Sea. Both countries 
claim the same stretch of water. Both have hired American oil companies to 
exploit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there may have been few immediate results, the meeting was 
significant, if only because it was the first time that the two Communist 
countries have held formal negotiations on the difficult question of maritime 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord recently listed the dispute 
between China and Vietnam over the South China Sea as one of the three main 
threats to peace in Asia, along with the nuclear threat in North Korea and 
civil war in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby Southeast Asian countries see the negotiations as a ray of hope in the 
effort to resolve one of Asia's most intractable problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the talks took place against a backdrop of mutual suspicion and mistrust, 
which have marked relations between Asia's traditional enemies for centuries. 
Two previous negotiations, in 1974 and 1977, called to discuss land border 
issues both ended in failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the difficulty are fears in Vietnam that whoever tries to succeed 
China's ailing, 89-year-old leader, Deng Xiaoping, may need a military 
adventure to win the support of the powerful Chinese army factions that are the 
heart of the country's power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what happens after Deng dies that worries us most," said a military 
official in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 They remember that in 1979, only one year after he was recognized as the 
successor to Mao Tse-tung, Deng launched a brief, bloody war against Vietnam -- 
China's traditional foe -- that helped him consolidate his power. Never mind 
that the invasion was a military failure, thwarted by Vietnamese forces here in 
Lang Son, that cost the lives of several thousand Chinese soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese fears of Chinese ambitions in the region have been stoked by recent 
front-page articles in the Chinese People's Daily newspaper praising the heroic 
dedication of Chinese soldiers "serving the sacred territory of our great 
motherland" in garrisons stationed on the disputed Spratly Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nghia Le Xuan, chairman of the Vietnam Border Committee charged 
with negotiating territorial disputes with the visiting Chinese, the Vietnam 
government is also alarmed by the recent publication in China of several books 
detailing proposed strategic battle plans for the capture of the Spratlys -- 
which the Chinese call the Nansha Islands -- and even the invasion of the 
Vietnamese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Vietnam and China, the chain of minute atolls and spits of land 
that make up the Spratly Islands is also claimed by four other countries -- 
Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei. 
</P>
<P>
 Although marked as "classified," the books detailing the Chinese strategies 
are readily available in bookstores in Guangzhou (formerly Canton) and other 
southern Chinese cities where the feeling of Chinese manifest destiny is 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials, meanwhile, contend that Vietnam's fears are unfounded. To 
demonstrate their good faith, the Chinese have proposed to temporarily "shelve" 
territorial disputes in the South China Sea so that the mineral resources can 
be developed jointly and cooperatively. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign military experts contend that, in fact, China does not yet have the 
long-range military resources needed to enforce its claims in the Spratlys and 
adjacent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese claims on the Spratlys, some diplomats contend, are part of a complex 
lobbying effort by factions of the military to upgrade its equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Important senior officers in the Chinese military have argued in recent years 
for the creation of a "blue water" navy, including aircraft carriers and 
long-range naval aircraft to defend their vast claims in the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 On the agenda for negotiators, led on the Chinese side by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Tang Jiaxue and one the Vietnamese side by Deputy Foreign Minister Vo 
Quang, were three areas of dispute -- the 690-mile land border, territorial 
disputes in the Gulf of Tonkin and issues involving the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the land border, both sides have agreed in principle to observe the 
boundaries set in an 1897 treaty signed between the Qing Dynasty and the French 
colonial government in Vietnam. But according to the Vietnamese there are 236 
places on the border where China has crossed the 1897 line, including territory 
never returned after the 1979 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks on the Gulf of Tonkin are still at a preliminary stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The most bitter dispute centered on the South China Sea. Here the two sides 
cannot even agree on a name. The Chinese call the body of water Nan Hai (South 
Sea), and the Vietnamese term it Bien Dong (East Sea). The two names clearly 
reflect the different geographic perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the Vietnamese are infuriated with the Chinese for granting an 
oil exploration concession to Colorado-based Crestone Energy Corp., in an area 
they claim is on their continental shelf. The Chinese call the area Wan'An. To 
the Vietnamese it is known as Tu'Chinh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese claim that the territory belongs to them on the basis of their 
claim to the nearby Spratlys. They claim that Vietnam, in fact, has violated 
Chinese territory by granting an adjacent area for exploration to Mobil Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chinese officials say they are willing to compromise and work jointly with 
Vietnam to develop the 25,155-square kilometer body of water 168 miles off the 
Vietnamese coast. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the Vietnamese have reacted icily to the Chinese proposal to share the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese say they want to 'shelve' the dispute," Nghia snapped, "but they 
are aimed at our continental shelf."

CANDIDATES PLEDGE TO KEEP INSURANCE REBATE RULES; PROP. 103: DEMOCRAT TORRES 
SAYS HE WOULD UPHOLD ALL GARAMENDI'S REGULATIONS. GOP'S QUACKENBUSH ENVISIONS 
'SOME FLEXIBILITY' ON RATE INCREASES. 
</P>

<P>
 Both the Democratic and Republican candidates for insurance commissioner 
pledged categorically Friday to enforce the Proposition 103 rebate regulations 
adopted by the present commissioner, Democrat John Garamendi, and upheld 
unanimously by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledges are important because if a new commissioner were to change the 
regulations, it could legally reopen the rebate issue and allow the insurers 
who have not paid rebates to initiate an entire new round of litigation. The 
first round has lasted six years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not surprising that state Sen. Art Torres, the Democratic candidate, 
made the pledge, because he has been a frequent critic of the insurance 
industry and a sympathizer with Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pledge by Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush, the Republican 
candidate, came from a self-proclaimed "free market" advocate who has 
questioned the heavy regulation called for under Proposition 103 and frequently 
expressed sympathy with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of this week's Supreme Court decision, Quackenbush said Friday: 
"Free market is one thing but enforcing the law as passed by the voters is 
another. I have to enforce Proposition 103. There is no choice in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Deukmejian-Wilson high court with some jurists on it who were not perhaps 
sympathetic with the public policy enunciated in Proposition 103 has 
nonetheless unanimously upheld these rebates," Quackenbush said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have no choice but to enforce them, and if I don't I certainly won't be 
reelected to this position or any other position." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Quackenbush said he would keep the Garamendi regulations for the 
rebates, $800 million of which have been paid and $1 billion more of which may 
be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, for this particular issue, I think the (Garamendi) regulations are as 
good as they can get," the Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, in a warning to the insurance industry: "This is the law of the 
land, and as much as they hate to comply with it, they're going to have to. . . 
. Any insurer who believes they will get a better deal by waiting for John 
Garamendi's successor is mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Quackenbush added, he maintains "some flexibility" on changing 
regulations Garamendi has promulgated for future insurance company rate 
increases, another key feature of Proposition 103. Quackenbush indicated that 
he reserves the right to consider his free market principles on deciding new 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Torres said: "I will abide by the decision of the court and 
continue the approach which brought us to this point, which is Garamendi's 
insistence on the validity of these regulations. We can't afford to change the 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any departure from this decision is in violation of the trust of the voters 
and that's how I view it. There's a trust that's been created here and 
validated by the court, and that trust cannot be violated." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres made no distinction between accepting Garamendi's rebate and rate 
approval regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Garamendi reacted: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that Mr. Quackenbush has followed Sen. Torres' lead and agreed to 
carry out my regulations to provide the consumers the full rebate allowed under 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that Mr. Quackenbush would agree with Mr. Torres that the prior 
approval regulations are equally important and valid and will be carried out. 
Unfortunately, he seems to be dancing around that issue."

JUDGE BARS STATE'S PLANNED WELFARE CUT; BUDGET: RULING IS EXPECTED TO DELAY FOR 
MONTHS A MOVE AIMED AT EASING CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL WOES. WILSON SAYS HE WILL 
APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that state officials say will worsen the state's financial 
condition, a San Francisco Superior Court on Friday barred Gov. Pete Wilson 
from making a 2.3% welfare reduction due to take place Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Judge Stuart Pollak affects 2.7 million poor Californians, who 
would have had their maximum monthly benefit for a family of three cut from 
$607 to $593, the fourth such reduction in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson lashed out at advocates for the poor, saying he would immediately 
appeal Pollak's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, these self-proclaimed, unelected welfare advocates are attempting 
to govern California from the courtroom," Wilson said in a statement. "This 
constant, senseless litigation threatens important strides to end welfare as we 
know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollak, acting on a petition filed by the Western Center for Law & Poverty 
Inc., ruled that it was not legal for the state to cut benefits provided by the 
Aid to Families With Dependent Children program without proper federal 
authorization. The program is financed by the federal and state governments. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the Bush Administration had granted approval for the cuts, but 
that last month the authorization was invalidated by a panel of the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate panel found that the federal government 
had failed to consider the impact the reductions would have on poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollak said his preliminary injunction blocking implementation of the cuts 
Sept. 1 would remain in effect until the state is able to obtain new approval 
for the reductions from the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollak's ruling is expected to delay at least for several months a reduction 
that was intended by the Legislature and Wilson to help the state's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts were expected to save the state about $67 million a year, or $5.6 
million a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cuts would have been devastating for poor families," said Claire 
Pastore, a Western Center lawyer. "We've got people who are already having to 
choose between food and medicine because of earlier cuts. For clients who have 
been cut and cut and cut this is a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing last month's federal appellate court decision, Pastore filed the 
lawsuit against the state on behalf of Georgette and John Welch -- both of whom 
are disabled as a result of job injuries -- and their two young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the Welchs typify the kind of welfare families that would have been 
hurt by the reductions.  
</P>
<P>
 The state, which has cut benefits for three years in a row and was attempting 
to reduce them for a fourth year, was required in 1992 to seek federal 
authorization for the reductions because they brought California welfare 
benefits below a federally established level. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration gave its approval not only for a 1.3% reduction that 
went into effect that year but for future cuts totaling 5%. In 1993, the state 
reduced benefits an additional 2.7%.  
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court held that the Bush Administration had violated federal law 
in granting the authorization because it had failed to consider the hardship 
the cuts would impose on some families. 
</P>
<P>
 It said families with disabled adults or the so-called child-only cases, in 
which only the children are eligible for aid, would be hit particularly hard 
because they could not work to make up for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the court said they were "at increased risk of homelessness, 
inadequate nutrition and a variety of emotional and physical problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The court did not order benefits restored and left room for the state to 
reapply for federal authorization. It made it clear, however, that the federal 
government would have to take the appellate court's findings into 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said the state will reapply for the federal authorization, and in 
doing so, it will exempt families with disabled adults -- about 10% of the 
welfare caseload -- and certain child-only cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastore argued that the state could not legally impose new cuts until the 
federal government acts on Wilson's application.

CARBON MONOXIDE CITED IN DEATHS OF 3 OIL RIG WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three workers killed in a Ventura County oil rig accident last week died after 
inhaling toxic levels of carbon monoxide gas, the Ventura County coroner's 
office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators originally suspected that the workers were killed by breathing 
lethal doses of hydrogen sulfide, a colorless gas sometimes found in oil 
fields.But the coroner's report appears to debunk that theory and shifts 
queries to the possible source of the carbon monoxide, said Mike Furrow, vice 
president of Pride Petroleum, which employed the three men who died. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil field deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning are extremely rare, he said. 
Only one small truck engine was running around the wellhead at the time of the 
accident, Furrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbon monoxide is emitted from car tailpipes and other sources of fire. It 
can attain lethal levels in enclosed spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials and petroleum executives are continuing their investigations 
into the Aug. 10 accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Furrow said the coroner's findings will shift the focus of his company's 
investigation to the possible source of the carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
 The small truck engine running at the time of the accident was owned by 
Schlumberger Well Services, Furrow said. But it is rare for emissions from a 
single engine to cause problems because carbon monoxide dissipates quickly in 
open-air pits, such as the one in which the victims were working, he said.

ACLU ARM SLAMS NAVY'S POLICY ON GAYS; MILITARY: SOUTHLAND FOUNDATION CONTENDS 
THAT HOMOSEXUALS ARE TREATED MORE SEVERELY THAN RAPISTS AND CHILD MOLESTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ACLU Foundation of Southern California charged Friday that the Navy 
penalizes homosexual activity by officers and sailors more harshly than it 
punishes service members found to be engaging in child molestation, rape or 
incest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon W. Davidson, senior staff counsel for the organization, said that the 
practice is unfair, and called on the Navy to stop prosecuting gays and 
lesbians for consensual sexual activity. He said that the foundation is trying 
to determine whether other services follow similar practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson made public a memo written by Navy Capt. Fred R. Becker Jr., legal 
counsel to the Bureau of Naval Personnel, which concedes that a Navy dentist 
who pleaded guilty to committing sodomy on his 16-year-old son last year is 
being kept on duty under a rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, there currently are more than half a dozen cases pending 
of homosexual officers and enlisted men who have been ordered discharged from 
the Navy simply for declaring that they are gay -- without even having been 
charged with actual homosexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation made its complaint in the face of the Defense Department's new 
"Don't ask, don't tell" policy on homosexuality in the military, under which 
gays and lesbians are permitted to remain in the service as long as they keep 
their sexual orientation secret. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to Adm. H. C. McKinney, chief of naval personnel, Becker noted that 
some of the homosexuals whom the Navy has discharged are suing the Pentagon for 
taking action against them and are likely to use the incident involving the 
dentist to bolster their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ability to successfully (sic) defend these cases will be severely 
compromised when counsel discover that we not only (medically) treat molesters 
that (sic) engage in homosexual conduct . . . but also retain them on active 
duty for full careers," Becker wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials confirmed the contents of the Becker memo on Friday but 
disputed the ACLU Foundation's conclusion that the practice is widespread. 
"This is a unique case," a senior official told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the dentist was convicted and sentenced initially to prison and 
eventual discharge but that a final decision is being deferred until the 
officer and his children can complete counseling and treatment under the Navy's 
Family Advocacy Program. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that the dentist no longer is practicing but had been assigned 
to administrative tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the case involving the dentist also has prompted the Navy 
to review its overall policies on the Family Advocacy Program. They said the 
policy of postponing the imposition of such a sentence was designed to ensure 
that violators get treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said the ACLU Foundation, an arm of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, learned of the case after reading about it in The Washington Blade, a 
newspaper aimed at homosexuals, last May 27.

We've received numerous shots of professionally painted signs that contain the 
same unfortunate spelling error, one that invariably has a sexual connotation. 
Walt Willis of Woodland Hills sent along the latest example, which he spotted 
in a bank building in Encino. In stilted bureaucratese, it refers to certain 
regulations in "public areas." But it omitted one letter in the word "public." 
Do the sign makers ever read their own work?

 The Spruce Goose has flown the dome. Port Disney was abandoned. In search of a 
new tourist attraction, the Long Beach Planning Commission has approved a 
proposal for a 210-foot-tall bungee tower in a parking lot near the ocean. Cost 
of the five-second drop would be $85 per screaming customer. The tower, by the 
way, will be next door to Long Beach's most famous ship, which we imagine will 
be renamed the Queen Bungee.

AL MARTINEZ: A COUPLE OF DAYS IN COMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life is so sweet and full of friendliness in Compton these days that a guy has 
to work hard to start a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 In L.A. it's easy, because all of our post-riot, pulling-together euphoria has 
vanished like smoke in the wind, and raising hell is about the best thing we 
do. Not so in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 They're still troubled by that videotaped beating of a Latino kid by a black 
cop and making every effort to be kind to everyone, just to show they're not as 
full of tension as the tape might indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 I noticed it first at a gas station along Rosecrans Avenue when I got into an 
argument with an attendant over a pump I didn't think was working right. 
</P>
<P>
 He let me holler and stamp my feet for a while, then left his little booth, 
walked to the pump and showed me where I hadn't lifted a lever to activate the 
thing. He even pumped the gasoline for me. 
</P>
<P>
 All the time he called me sir and never raised his voice and said he was sorry 
there had been confusion. My own kids aren't that polite. 
</P>
<P>
 I got the same kind of response from people I badgered to answer questions 
about the mood in the city, and from those I stopped on the street to ask dumb 
directions, just to test their patience. 
</P>
<P>
 No one told me to shove off, or words to that effect, and no one took the 
opportunity to beat me and steal my wallet. "We're all too busy reaching out," 
a Catholic priest told me later, and he didn't mean reaching out to punch 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Compton is a little hunk o' Paradise. Two cops were shot to death 
last year during a routine traffic stop, an ex-mayor has been indicted on 
charges of taking bribes and 17-year-old Felipe Soltero is still smarting after 
a beating at the hands of Officer Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident is particularly unsettling because it was videotaped by a 
neighbor and clearly shows Jackson laying into a defenseless, much-smaller 
Soltero. The tape revived memories of the beating of Rodney G. King by four 
L.A. policemen three years ago, and the chaos that followed. The memory rests 
heavily on our conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatings like that strike at a community's soul. You look to police officers 
for help and patience and maybe a little good judgment, not for the kind of 
force a guy would use against a marauding grizzly. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't really matter what Soltero did before the tape was running. Unless 
he had a shotgun to Jackson's head, the beating was excessive. "You don't treat 
a kid that way," a neighbor said, and he's right. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard that sentiment repeated several times in different ways, which 
manifests the very level of concern that's responsible for an attitude of 
healing when trouble comes to town. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman, Capt. Steve Roller, pointed out, and rightly so, that 
there are enough investigations going on to choke a bureaucrat and any blame in 
the beating incident ought to be left up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he went on to say that the media stirred the whole thing out of 
proportion, and there wouldn't have been all that fuss if they had just stayed 
the hell out of it. What's a little beating between a cop and a kid anyhow? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That priest I was talking about calls the assault flat-out police brutality, 
but insists it wasn't racially motivated. Presumably, he meant that Jackson 
would have beaten Soltero no matter what race or color he was. 
</P>
<P>
 But, still, the Rev. Clif Marquis -- Father Clif to everyone -- has organized 
a rally for tomorrow in the Courthouse Plaza that will emphasize the city's 
unity in the wake of divisions crystallized by the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Compton a city of neighborhoods where all kinds of people live 
together in peace, and the image of a police baton held over a teen-ager lying 
on the ground shouldn't be its eternal logo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working hard so the situation won't turn ugly," Father Clif said. "We 
don't want to end up burying our children." 
</P>
<P>
 I spent two days wandering through Compton and found a town so serene it was 
damned near asleep. Summer days were made for just such a place. Women walked 
their babies on tree-shaded streets and men washed their cars in the driveways 
of well-kept homes. 
</P>
<P>
 They mowed their lawns, shopped for groceries, went to lunch, bought clothes, 
paid their bills, filled their gas tanks, picnicked in a park and stopped for a 
cold beer in a quiet bar. 
</P>
<P>
 I sensed the "reaching out" Father Clif was talking about, and the kindness 
that came of it, and tested it one last time. As I left Compton, I honked madly 
at a guy crossing the street against the light. He stopped in the middle of the 
street, turned and very deliberately gave me the finger. But even then he was 
smiling.

<P>
 The Rev. Monsignor John Quatannens, longtime pastor of St. Boniface Church in 
Anaheim, died Friday. He was 85.

Force during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, he was appointed pastor at St. Boniface, and he served there until

CONROY 'PADDLING' BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been following Assemblyman Conroy's "paddling" bill. I am astounded 
that such a bill would receive the attention (it) has. 
</P>
<P>
 While most Californians are justifiably outraged with the increase of 
graffiti, we must not use our outrage and frustration to sanction actions that 
would otherwise be considered child abuse. Like all forms of discipline of 
children we must design a response that will teach respect for personal and 
public property, and actually change behavior rather than just punishing 
behavior. We must address the causes of the problem as well as the solution. 
There are many nonviolent strategies that could be employed to accomplish this 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments made by boxer Tony (The Tiger) Lopez in support are irresponsible 
at best. He is obviously not an expert on child abuse or even child-rearing. 
</P>
<P>
 I often speak in high schools and colleges about child abuse and child abuse 
prevention. The subject of spanking children almost always comes up. A small 
number of students believe that spanking children under certain circumstances 
is an acceptable form of discipline. However, when I asked them if they could 
find a nonviolent way to accomplish the same result, which would they choose, 
without exception they choose the nonviolent way. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible to successfully raise children without hitting them.

ADDITION OF OWNERS TO TABLE PRAISED; BASEBALL: BUT THE DODGERS' O'MALLEY URGES 
THAT SELIG CHOOSE A GROUP OF "COOL HEADS" TO JOIN NEGOTIATIONS NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dodger Owner Peter O'Malley said Friday that the decision to have five owners 
join negotiator Richard Ravitch at the bargaining table was an opportunity for 
something positive to happen in the baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, "It would be a mistake to pick extremists from either end 
(of the ownership spectrum)." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley would not identify the extremists, but said there are some owners 
whose selection by acting Commissioner Bud Selig would not help the process. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 8 of the players' strike, he cited the significant financial losses on 
both sides and said it was time for a concerted effort aimed at resolving the 
differences. He said that he hoped Selig's selection included a "broad outlook 
of new and old ownership ... cool heads, far-thinking people. It's time for 
diplomacy and understanding, not a lot of shouting across the table." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said he would participate if asked but would support whomever is 
picked. He said he continues to support the owners' salary-cap proposal but 
that it would be inappropriate to comment on strategy or speculate as to what 
might happen, adhering to Selig's dictate restricting comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Milwaukee, Selig said he has not settled on the group that will 
join Ravitch when bargaining with the players union resumes on Tuesday or 
Wednesday in New York. Sources said he will select a pool of 10-12 owners, with 
no more than five attending any negotiating session at the request of federal 
mediators. 
</P>
<P>
 The list, they said, would be completed over the weekend, with Boston Red Sox 
Owner John Harrington and Philadelphia Phillie executive David Montgomery, 
probably representing the big markets, and General Manager Andy MacPhail of the 
Minnesota Twins representing the small markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others frequently mentioned Friday: Fred Wilpon of the New York Mets, 
Claude Brochu of the Montreal Expos, John Ellis of the Seattle Mariners, Jerry 
Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig, who considers himself a consensus builder, said he was not specifically 
asked by the mediators to select representatives of the big, middle and small 
markets, but was doing it anyway, spanning ownership's approach to revenue 
sharing and the salary-cap proposal that the union has said it will not accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be as fair as I can," he said. "All points of view will be represented." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is all window dressing, with the owners unwilling to compromise on 
their salary-cap proposal, remains to be seen. Selig and Ravitch stressed again 
Friday that the proposal has not been modified, nor is it likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said the selection of owners 
could be significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically, it matters in the sense that a representative sampling of 
clubs would include small markets, big markets so to speak, those who aren't 
interested in busting the union, those who are, those for whom salary caps are 
a religious proposition and those for whom (they are) not," Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspicion already is growing that the one thing they will have in common 
is their ability to sing as a chorus."

O.C. THEATER; 'LADY': DARKER SHADE OF SIMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One easily forgets when looking at Neil Simon's later plays, with more serious 
subjects and treatments, that during his early sitcom heyday he wrote a very 
sober play called "The Gingerbread Lady." A well-turned production at the 
Theatre District provides a stunning reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe "sober" isn't quite the right word for this play. 
</P>
<P>
 Evy Meara is a 43-year-old nightclub singer whose career became a tippling 
tailspin ending in a sanitarium dry-out and a coincidental 40-pound weight 
loss. As the play opens, she's returning to her Manhattan apartment and the 
loving arms of her best friend Jimmy, a homosexual actor who, at 37, still 
thinks stardom is awaiting him, and her buddy Toby, who is 40 and still 
clinging to the youthful image of beauty she believes is her only weapon in her 
battle with life. 
</P>
<P>
 They are her emotional crutches, and she is theirs. Add Evy's teen-age 
daughter, who drops in for good, bringing her own insecure baggage. None is 
concerned as much about Evy as they are about their own little problems. 
</P>
<P>
 They give Evy dozens of reasons for taking that next first drink. Which she 
does. It's all very un-Simon. There are, of course, the usual Simon one-liners 
woven into the dark fabric, but this time they come out of theatrical 
characters who would speak in one-liners, and they're funnier because of it. 
Director Mario Lescot gives the humor free rein but never lets it get in the 
way of a sense of reality that was unusual for Simon in this period. Lescot's 
balance between the two is careful and expertly handled. He knows where the 
subtle shadings are and how to blend and tint them.  
</P>
<P>
 Lescot has cast the production impeccably. His Evy, Marta DuBois, has the 
control not to overemphasize Evy's show-biz aura. What she does emphasize is 
Evy's vulnerable humanity. DuBois' insights into Evy's past success, her 
addiction and her lack of strength in the face of temptation -- both from drink 
and from her abusive ex-lover -- are profound, truthful and lit by an inner 
fire. She's also very funny tossing off those requisite gags. 
</P>
<P>
 David Nelson, as Jimmy, is touching, funny and has a bittersweet charm in his 
naive approach to his little defeats and his honest adoration of Evy. He also 
has the sense not to fall into the stereotype trap, maintaining a gentle aura 
that defines Jimmy's true worth as a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 As Evy's well-married girlfriend Toby, Nancy Petersen embodies glamour in 
looks and attitude. She's class all the way. That is, until she shatters the 
image in one of the production's funniest scenes, sobbing uncontrollably while 
she lists in detail a lifetime of sexual conquests. It's a neat trick, and she 
pulls it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Learned gives daughter Polly a rewarding curiosity and an affection, 
hidden beneath her nice sharp edge of teen-age rebellion, that marks Polly 
definitely as Evy's kid. Polly remembers a childhood gingerbread house, which 
like her mother's life, is now only crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The craggy virility that keeps beckoning Evy to her ex-lover, Lou, runs like a 
river through Victor Santana's volatile performance, but it is well-matched by 
a sense of macho insecurity. In the smaller role of a delivery boy from the 
local grocery, John Bowerman shows what a good actor can do with very little. 
</P>
<P>
 Evy's apartment living room and kitchen, by Two Blue Chairs Inc., look like a 
real New York apartment, one that Evy would nest in, and it is lighted as a 
real flat would be, both ingredients that add to the honesty of a fine revival.

MUSIC REVIEW; PIANIST SULLIVAN SKIPS BEATS AND IS UNABLE TO BEAT HEAT

 Closing the 20th season of the Seal Beach Chamber Music Festival, Mark Hallum 
Sullivan struggled through much of his difficult recital Thursday, though 
technical demands of the music were clearly not his obstacle. Instead, 
sweltering heat in the McGaugh Elementary School Auditorium seemed to turn both 
playing and concentration into slippery affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Attired in full tuxedo (in contrast to many of the regulars in this audience, 
who dressed casually and knew to arm themselves with hand-held fans), Sullivan 
mustered the opening piece -- Mozart's Rondo in A minor, K. 511 -- with only 
minimal slips. 
</P>
<P>
 Using pedal judiciously for quiet clarity, he minimized the dramatic aspects 
of the composition in favor of elegance and intimate communication. The 
$100,000 Fazioli grand piano on loan for the evening responded with remarkable 
evenness of tone, if not the timbral lushness of some of its German and 
Austrian competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the real trouble started. Beethoven's late Sonata in A, Opus 101, 
requires maturity of both technique and insight. Sullivan, a USC doctoral 
candidate and part-time faculty member, completely broke down twice, yet some 
of the most challenging sections, including the thorny conclusion of the final 
movement, emerged neatly paced and intelligently woven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stops appeared to be almost random, as if a sudden hitch in the mental 
process had caused the pianist to halt, hand in midair, once after perhaps the 
first 10 seconds of the work -- which he then began anew -- and again in the 
early part of the fugue. If he had not been in a sweat before, he certainly 
must have been now. 
</P>
<P>
 During intermission, some pitying soul finally placed a fan near the piano. 
Sullivan returned, without a jacket and tie, to offer Ravel's "Valses nobles et 
sentimentales," in a secure and richly colored performance. He ended the 
evening with glimpses into a purposeful and powerful conception of Scriabin's 
Fourth Sonata, interrupted by yet another memory glitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan will repeat this program next month as the last required recital for 
his degree. The right combination of preparation and air conditioning should 
suffice.

FLASHINESS TRIPS UP FLAMENCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With her fierce intensity and seamlessly expressive technique, La Tania evokes 
the power and mystique missing from so many programs in this era of debased 
flamenco stage shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Soleares on Thursday at the Curtis Theatre, La Tania made every movement 
an expression of anguish and individuality, evoking unspoken narratives of 
inner and outer states. Dancing as a guest, she dominated a program by Juan 
Talavera's flamenco troupe, which otherwise emphasized genial and extroverted 
theatrical values, with dollops of show-biz pizazz and easy-sell hip-swinging. 
Adios , pena Andaluz.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacing, even in the Canto Jondo selections, tended to be fast. The male and 
female corps were locked in symmetrical patterns. The whole was 
over-choreographed. In their "Viva Cadiz!" duet, for instance, the gaunt, 
intense Talavera and the willowy Gabriela Garza were shadowed and framed by 
four extraneous male dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 In other departures from elusive flamenco puro standards, Antonia Lopez used a 
black sombrero to cover extravagant rolling hip-moves in "Tanguillos de Cadiz." 
Angelina Valenzuela discarded the appealing vulnerability in an early Alegrias 
for audience-courting in the Fiesta por Tangos. 
</P>
<P>
 With her hollow-toned, pulsing vocalism, guest Pepa Sevilla remained an 
expressive singer, although her explosive stage persona and dancing pushed the 
boundaries of modesty. Guest Lourdes Rodriguez, however, danced a sturdy, 
stylish Alegrias. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Sevilla, the capable singers were Charo Monge and Antonio de 
Jerez. The underutilized musicians included guitarists Benito Placios, Antonio 
Triana II, Rafael Aragon and El Coro Rociero de la Pena Andaluza ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Talavera is hoping to establish a beachhead for flamenco in Orange County. The 
Thursday program (repeated tonight) follows a series at the Curtis in May. 
Another set is promised in December, although no dates have been announced. But 
there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a comfortable facility, providing intimacy with its 199-seat 
capacity, the pressed-board stage muffles heel and foot stamping and 
considerably narrows the dancer's range of tonal effects.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Flamenco Talavera" will be repeated tonight at the Curtis Theatre, 1 Civic 
Center Drive, Brea. 8:30 p.m. $29.75. (714) 990-7722.

THANKS, NANCY, FOR SWEET SWEETWATER MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Does anybody remember Sweetwater?" asks Nancy Nevins ("It All Started With 
Three Days of Peace and Music," Aug. 11).Of course we do! There are some of us 
around who saw the group at the Bank, or the Bitter End West, with people like 
Taj Mahal and Papa John Phillips. How great to have grown up in an era when a 
genre-bending band like Sweetwater could get record deals -- and airplay! 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad that Sweetwater was there to open our ears to different sounds and to 
inspire us to make music ourselves, though I'm sorry that we've lost Sweetwater 
members Alan, Albert and August. Thanks, Nancy, for still being around.

ACCURACY IN A 'WAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed watching "Encore! The Three Tenors" immensely, but I'd like to point 
out some facts about the song "My Way," which was dedicated to Frank Sinatra: 
</P>
<P>
 The music was written about 25 years ago by Frenchmen Jacques Revaux and 
Claude Francois, with words by Gillis Thibault and Francois (who, 
unfortunately, died more than a decade ago in a bathtub accident when a hair 
dryer fell into the water). The English words were written later by Paul Anka. 
The original name of the song is "Comme d'Habitude," which simply translates 
into "As Usual."

BEST WESTERN NEVER TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading the article on Dan Gordon and what befell his script for the 
film "Wyatt Earp" ("Leave 'Wyatt Earp' Off His Tombstone," Aug. 5), I am left 
with two conclusions.One, that filmgoers lost out on what would have been an 
excellent or at least fascinating film. Two, that Lawrence Kasdan's overhaul of 
the script, however well-intentioned it may have been, was a fatal error. 
</P>
<P>
 And while we're at it, here's a really radical idea: Get Gordon's script and 
make the film as he envisioned it. We're seriously overdue for a good Western.

MASTERS OF ILLUSION; DESIGNING TO MINIMIZE SPACE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trick, they say, to designing houses today is to pack it all in so 
artfully that you hardly notice the tight fit, or, as one architect put it, "so 
it doesn't look like you've crammed 10 pounds of building into a five-pound 
bag."  
</P>
<P>
 The day of the rambling ranch house on a quarter-acre parcel is long gone. For 
architects designing housing for the small lots now the norm here and elsewhere 
in Southern California, that means an increasingly important trick of the trade 
is the ability to fool the eye into seeing more space than exists -- inside and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Illusion is so important that Costa Mesa architect Richard Lewis includes a 
handbook on visual illusion on a short list of the three key pieces of 
reference material no architect should be without. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis specializes in high-end custom homes but says that the principles 
explored when he and other architects do projects where budgets are relatively 
unlimited quickly find their way into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes what solves space problems in a $2-million house can work as well in 
one that costs $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Custom homes are the R&D lab of the industry," says Lewis, whose 
award-winning designs range from commercial buildings and multimillion-dollar 
custom homes to 900-square-foot "snowbird" retreats in the desert outside of 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer in San Francisco, Lewis won a Gold Nugget, the top award 
of the Pacific Coast Building Conference, for his "small" custom home design: a 
5,924-square-foot Lido Isle contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
 That home and other Orange County projects also awarded Gold Nuggets 
demonstrate how the use of illusion extends from a waterfront custom home in 
Newport Beach to production housing at Newport Coast to a high-density 
apartment complex in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Each project created housing for different uses and with very different 
budgets, but each faced space constraints.  
</P>
<P>
 The trilevel house that Lewis designed for Tom and Joan Riach is situated on a 
5,500-square-foot bay-front lot that is only 39 feet wide on the street and 44 
feet wide on the water. The width of the 100-foot-long house ranges from a 28 
feet at street side to 34 feet overlooking Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same space-stretching techniques used by Lewis were used by 
architects at McLarand, Vasquez & Partners in its winning designs for a 
$700,000 semi-custom Italianate villa at its Santa Lucia development in Newport 
Coast. The firm used them again in its design for the San Paulo apartment 
complex in Irvine, where a mix of flats and multistory apartments are fitted 
into a high-density design that mimics a Mediterranean village. And those 
stretching tools were called upon again by architects at Richardson Nagy Martin 
in a tract of homes priced from $270,000 to $400,000 in Newport Ridge in which 
neighbors borrow space from one another to enlarge the usable yard area and to 
expand the view from the inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 The architecture of most housing being built in Orange County in the 1990s has 
been shaped by these principles. Walls between rooms are likely to have the 
center cut out of them to allow an uninterrupted sight line; yards are arranged 
on only one side of a house to give them more bulk; roof lines and facades are 
staggered to keep them from closing in visually; tall windows and light wells 
open up a home to the sky -- that rare place where space doesn't come at such a 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry to the Riach home on Lido Isle has something in common with most 
Orange County tract houses of the past two decades -- it takes a back seat to 
the garage doors, which monopolize the street view of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The entryway is on the south side of the house about 60 feet from the street. 
Side yards, which would have accentuated the narrowness of the rooms, are 
almost nonexistent. Lewis designed to provide a feeling of spaciousness in 
areas where none existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Riach residence is loaded with illusions," he said. "They are what give 
us the ability to expand space. We trick the eye to make things seem big and 
wide open, and we do it at all (price) levels. The architect who doesn't 
understand and use visual illusion is a handicapped architect." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Riach house is narrow, it is deep and Lewis needed to separate 
the rooms while still opening up the interior so each room would not feel 
enclosed. He did it by using a minimum of interior walls and by incorporating a 
three-level rotunda, capped by a circular skylight, for the entry. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rotunda, located almost in the middle of the house, is open, its 
curving walls provide separation between the family room at the narrowest end 
of the ground floor and the dining and great rooms at the wide end fronting on 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The basement level is the most traditional section of the house, with most 
walls set at sharp right angles. Because it is below ground level there was 
little Lewis could do on the side walls to open things up, so he carried the 
20-foot diameter shaft of the rotunda down into the basement. Light pouring in 
from the glass dome fills and brightens all three levels while the curving wall 
softens the otherwise angular form of the basement level. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, where the bedrooms and study are located, Lewis placed the master 
suite at the wide end of the house and the study and second and third bedrooms 
at the narrow end. He used an open bridge spanning the family room to connect 
the two halves, and left the entire center section open -- turning the family 
room into an airy two-story zone flooded with light from the rotunda's dome. 
</P>
<P>
 On both floors, there is an unbroken line of sight from one end of the house 
to the other -- which lets the eye "borrow" space from room to room and makes 
each section of the house in turn seem wider than it really is. Instead of 
being stopped by solid, right-angle walls, the eye slides off of rounded and 
slanted wall sections, some little more than stubs that jut out just enough to 
delineate a space but don't physically separate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The eye fixes on hard, right-angled surfaces and corners. They provide a 
point of reference that sets up limits and lets us measure how big or small 
something is," Lewis said. "But the eye slides off of curves" and lets the mind 
experience space that really isn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis broke up the mass of the building by setting the second floor back from 
the street and indenting each of the three garage doors into its own separate 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the south side of the house, where the entrance is located, Lewis 
incorporated several curving or sharply angled walls to break up the 100-foot 
depth. The practice is called "articulating" a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 From the street, looking along the south side, it appears as if there are 
three separate structures on the lot rather than a single, monolithic hulk. 
"You want to break up the expanse of wall as much as possible," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because there wasn't much lot to begin with, Lewis pushed the structure as far 
to the north side of the property as the building code allowed and minimized 
windows on that side, saving the south side for a series of small landscaped 
patio areas that tuck into the obliquely angled indentations. 
</P>
<P>
 A final "trick" went into the design of the entry approach to the house -- a 
path that is almost 50 feet long and is squeezed between the two-story home and 
its two-story neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 When the eye looks down a long narrow vista -- a railroad track or highway, 
for instance -- perspective makes it seem to narrow in the distance until it 
disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis turned that around and angled the south wall of the house so that the 
space available for the walk flairs out from the entry gate, widening as it 
flows back along the garage toward the entry. Visitors feel as if they are 
walking into an ever increasing space instead of into an alley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Architects at Richardson Nagy Martin in Newport Beach used many of the same 
tricks in its production homes in Newport Ridge.  
</P>
<P>
 The tract plan utilizes the so-called Z-lot concept to borrow space from each 
neighboring lot. The borrowed space comes from the opposite side yard, and, as 
Lewis did with the Riach home, RNM's architects use only high windows on those 
walls and orient the views from the house to the other, wider side yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The borrowed space -- usually a strip five to eight feet long and half the 
depth of the lot, can't be built on -- no pools or permanent gazebos, but it 
can be landscaped. The purpose, said RNM principal Les Persohn, is to increase 
the view corridors to make the houses and their narrow 45-foot lots seem more 
spacious. 
</P>
<P>
 The designs won Gold Nuggets for best single-family detached homes on small 
lots and best overall detached residential project.  
</P>
<P>
 The constraints of designing for a production builder mean that designs like 
RNM's for the Montserrat and Sancerre tracts in Newport Ridge must hew to 
tighter budgets and eschew such things as sliding glass walls and 20-foot 
glass-capped rotundas. However, the stacked windows that open up tall living 
room and dining room walls to the outside create a similar effect.

 "The tall windows draw the eye to the volume in a room with high ceilings, and 
accentuate it," Persohn said. "They also let light flood the room, and that 
enlarges the space." 
</P>
<P>
 There are glass-filled cutouts in second-story bridges in several floor plans; 
cutouts or open railings on staircases; wall niches and pot shelves that add 
depth and texture to what otherwise would be long, enclosing expanses of 
painted wallboard. All these things have been borrowed from custom home designs 
and brought into tract homes to fool the eye into seeing more than is really 
there, Persohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one model, RNM bolstered the perception of space in the homes by piercing a 
wall dividing the living and family rooms with cutouts that let the eye travel 
all the way through the house and out into the rear yard. 
</P>
<P>
 In other models, architects used short wall sections set at 45-degree angles 
to the rest of the interior layout to guide the eye out of an entry alcove and 
into the most panoramic view possible for the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 With production housing, efforts to enhance the sense of space begin long 
before the prospective buyer makes it to the front door. Because there are many 
homes close together in most tracts, the appearance of space must start at the 
curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started working in from the street. We unified all of the front yard 
landscaping so that it flows together" and there are no visible property lines 
to chop up the street scene and show how narrow the lots really are, Persohn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second stories of the homes don't sit out atop the garages, which was 
typical throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Instead, the top floor is pulled 
back so that the garage presents its own, single-story roof line to the street. 
"It makes the houses look less imposing and makes the small front yards seem 
larger," Persohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The architects also incorporated front garden walls and entry gates to create 
private front courtyards in each house that add to the overall living space. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Using outside space to make the living space seem larger was a technique used 
by McLarand, Vasquez in two dramatically different projects -- the Santa Lucia 
semi-custom development at Newport Coast, and the San Paulo apartments in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Lucia -- where lots are small but interiors exceed 3,000 square feet, 
not much trickery was needed to make the homes seem more expansive. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the architects used tall ceilings and curving walls and walls with 
see-through cutouts to enhance the spaciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 And they designed the driveways of the model homes with paving that is 
duplicated in the entry walk and porch -- making the otherwise utilitarian 
drives seem like part of a huge courtyard and adding hundreds of square feet to 
the apparent size of each lot. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Paulo, where few residents have any yard at all, the buildings are 
designed around large courtyards to give most of the apartments windows in the 
front and rear. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra light and additional view into the courtyard at the San Paulo 
apartments use the same space-expanding principles as do the rotunda skylight 
and unobstructed through-the-whole-house views of the bay at the custom home on 
Lido Isle.  
</P>
<P>
 And, just as a staggered roof line reduces bulk and adds interest to the 
detached housing projects in Newport Coast, so it does at the apartment 
complex.

<P>
 Once upon a time, California residential architecture was considered the 
cutting edge, the avant-garde, of residential design. California designs were 
as much in demand around the world as American cars. That was long ago. Today 
the "American dream" is a nightmare. Although a home purchase is the single 
largest investment the average American will make, new homes fail to meet the 
minimum daily requirements of today's lifestyle and are totally inadequate for 
tomorrow's. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we buy poorly designed, poorly planned homes? Why are we so oblivious 
to what our homes look like or how they function for us? Why have we forgotten 
that architecture is one of the arts? Why aren't we more demanding? 
</P>
<P>
 The great Austrian-born architect Richard Neutra led the first California 
design revolution in 1929, when he built Lovell House in Los Angeles. "A 
continuos flow of space is suggested by the vast sheets of glass and thin 
supports" is the way Neutra described it. He experimented with a light steel 
frame that permitted large glass areas and introduced the sliding glass door. 
</P>
<P>
 His innovative concepts regarding the relationship between indoor and outdoor 
space pushed the envelope of residential design and changed the American 
lifestyle forever. 
</P>
<P>
 People discovered their home need not be confined within the boundaries of the 
perimeter walls, and they discovered the back yard. New industries were 
spawned: Everyone wanted back-yard patios, back-yard barbecues, swimming pools, 
indoor-outdoor landscaping, sliding glass doors. The California lifestyle 
became the dream, and the greatest land rush in California history began. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1945 through the '50s, California design fever swept the country. Schools 
of architecture rediscovered Neutra, Frank Lloyd Wright and the Bauhaus School 
of Design. Students were taught principles of 
design-composition-color-materials.  
</P>
<P>
 Great painters such as Mondrian were reinventing geometric shapes and 
proportions and the dynamism of composition. Sculptors such as Alexander Calder 
taught architects to "Free your minds so that you may feel in terms of space 
and volume what the eye cannot see." What an exciting time: We had discovered 
the thrill of design.  
</P>
<P>
 We celebrated Neutra's 100th birthday in 1992, but we have very little to 
celebrate; design and philosophy have remained frozen. The Lovell House looks 
innovative, super modern , in fact, by today's standards.  
</P>
<P>
 If you drive down a street of "custom homes" in Orange County, you will find a 
strange mixture of English half-timbered, French chateau, Cape Cod, 
Mediterranean (Italian, Spanish or Moorish) and assorted castles without moats. 
</P>
<P>
 It is much simpler for the buyers who want to buy a tract house. These buyers 
get to select from the thousands of monotonous rows of stucco boxes with 
various shades of pink tile roofs that blanket the hillsides like a garish 
quilt. We call it the "Taco Bell syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 California builders have perfected mediocrity. The scale of this thoughtless 
repetition is numbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's buyer is better educated, more knowledgeable and uses the home in more 
ways than ever before. Many people are spending more time at home working, and 
more will be. The "super information highway" is upon us. What planning is 
there to accommodate it? Developers are instead still building traditionally 
dysfunctional floor plans. Television has been the prime source of home 
entertainment for more than 45 years, and yet people moving into their dream 
home still have the same question: "Where do we put the TV?" 
</P>
<P>
 They should be asking where to put the home office, fax machines, computers, 
audio-visual and exercise equipment. A now-famous writer had his word processor 
in the laundry room when he began to write. There is no attempt to produce a 
plan that recognizes contemporary lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 California design has been in gridlock for more than three decades. 
Fraudulent, poorly executed designs are not in keeping with California's rich 
heritage of creative design. The relationship between contemporary lifestyle 
and design must be recognized. We must free our minds and emancipate 
residential design -- break the lethargy. Let us rediscover the thrill of 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The art of architecture is deeply rooted in its past, and only by studying the 
past can we design for the future, if in between we understand the present. 
</P>
<P>
 We have many talented architects; let's give them a chance. Neutra once asked, 
"Is planning possible; can destiny be designed?" The answer must be . . . yes!

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; YARD TREE SELDOM MAKES THE CUT 
</P>

 Q. We have a huge cut-leaf maple tree in our back yard that needs to be cut 
down because it's so large. We'd like to try to use the wood to make a cabinet, 
bed or some other piece of furniture rather than just burn it in the fireplace. 
What's the process? 
</P>
<P>
 R.W.,Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's not going to be easy to carry out your plan, especially in this part 
of the country, says Jim Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 There really aren't lumber mills around here, and there aren't many facilities 
around to break up the wood for you. You might be able to find someone with a 
band saw who can do the job. The wood would have to be cut into pieces and 
dried, or the logs can be dried out and then cut.  
</P>
<P>
 Mills are able to give the wood a "straight line rip," which gives a straight 
edge from which to make boards. New lumber is generally not cut to exact 
dimensions. For instance, if you want one-inch planks, it might be cut at 1 1/8 
inches. This allows the pieces to be "dressed" or finished on an electric 
planer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I'd like to cover the translucent plastic panels of our shower stall with 
cloth curtains, yet I'm not sure how to secure them at the bottom. I'd like to 
do this without drilling holes into the aluminum frame or the panels. Any 
ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 C.L.C, Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A. Probably the best way to fasten them would be to use Velcro strips, says 
Santa Ana interior designer Carol Dean.  
</P>
<P>
 Or you may be better off attaching small curtain rods to the frame with screws 
and stretching the fabric across them. That will ensure that they don't get 
tossed around, and it will probably give you a neater look. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. I almost fainted last week when, while cleaning my rings and jewelry over 
the sink, a couple of items fell and almost dropped into the garbage disposal. 
I'm going to be more careful in the future, but I'd like to know if there's a 
trap or an easy access into the disposal if something falls into it. 
</P>
<P>
 G.D., San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
 A. The best way to get something out is to use your hands, especially if 
they're small, says Manny Gwartz of B.J. Discount Plumbing and Heating Supply 
in Garden Grove. Make sure you unplug the unit from under the sink, and then 
reach around to see if you can pull it up. If not, you'll have to remove the 
top flange, the bottom trap, and the drain from the air gap if you have a 
dishwasher. Then turn the unit upside down and let it fall out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q . We recently bought a house with stucco walls that are covered with ivy. It 
has been extremely tough to remove. What's the best way to get rid of it 
without damaging the stucco? 
</P>
<P>
 W.C., Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 A. You'll probably want to start by getting some good gloves and a wire brush, 
says Jim Craig of Decratrend Paints in Anaheim. Pull and scrape off what you 
can, then rent a water blaster. These can shoot water at around 3,000 pounds 
per square inch, and are effective at removing anything on the exterior of your 
home, including bubbled and chipped paint if you're preparing the exterior for 
a paint job. You have to be careful, though, not to remove the stucco itself. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. I'm having a problem with water spots on the glass of windows that have 
screens. I've tried a number of products, including vinegar and ammonia, but 
nothing has worked. What else can I try? 
</P>
<P>
 J.U., Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 A. This happens sometimes on windows that have been hit by sprinkler water, 
says Tammy Griffith of B & D Glass in Orange. Many people don't regularly clean 
the exterior side of their windows and, over time, they get hit by sprinkler 
water and water deposits develop. Try spraying them again with a vinegar and 
water solution or one of the foaming glass cleaners on the market. Then take a 
new, sharp razor blade and try scraping the spots off.

 Who says functional furniture can't be fun? Not Dan Janotta and Marian 
Drahnak, the husband-and-wife team that created the Hawaiian Shirt Lamp and the 
Walking Window Display Case, pieces in their Janotta furniture line. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by soaring prices and what they see as a lack of quality in 
furniture today, Janotta and Drahnak decided to come up with designs of their 
own, which are based on items like rocking horses, Hawaiian shirts and 
toasters.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaiian Shirt Lamp ($200) is made of solid mahogany, with a fishing lure 
for a pull switch. Janotta and Drahnak choose only colorful, uniquely patterned 
shirts for the lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 An open window is the idea behind the Walking Window Display Case ($1,700), 
which is a shelving unit that could also be used as a room divider. The shelves 
are attached to the frame in much the same way that blinds hang in a window. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the wood elements are maple and coated with an environmentally safe 
varnish. The legs and curtain rod are made of steel that has a satin silver 
powder coating. The plumb bob-shaped base is a necessary counterweight to 
balance the upper frame. The imported lace curtain is included. 
</P>
<P>
 Janotta and Drahnak -- whose pieces are shown in art galleries in Los Angeles, 
San Diego, San Francisco and Ft. Lauderdale -- opened their own studio in 
February in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Janotta, 39, a senior architect for Johnson, Sand and Pereira Associates in 
Los Angeles, was a member of the team that designed the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.

 Do you have deep scratches in your baby grand? A leg or two broken on your 
dining room table? Is the furniture too big to lug out the door? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a problem for Roger Pigott, also known as the Finish Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have larger pieces that you can't or don't want to move, Pigott, 33, 
of Poway, will come to your house to repair, touch up and finish your 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Pigott, who averages between three and eight house calls a day, including an 
18-chair job in Laguna Beach recently, specializes in repairing high-gloss 
lacquer finishes, such as those found on pianos and entertainment centers. 
</P>
<P>
 He started his mobile service for offices about 1 1/2 years ago, but his 
home-repair business has taken off, so he's concentrating on that end of the 
market. He also does work for antique and consignment shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from El Segundo, Pigott has been in the repair business for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 His minimum varies depending on the distance, but the customer "gets an hour 
of advice or work, their choice," he says. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Traditional styling takes on a fresh look when paired with leather. A chair 
and ottoman from Natuzzi are made of a super-soft leather that looks and feels 
as smooth as butter. The chair and ottoman are typical of Natuzzi's lilt on 
furniture, using traditional themes and mixing them with leather in unexpected 
colors -- such as banana yellow, butternut and lime green. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquale Natuzzi, who is based in Italy, is the company's owner and principal 
designer. The company is the world's largest leather furniture manufacturer and 
offers more than 400 designs in leather. 
</P>
<P>
 The chair and ottoman, priced about $1,000, are available in Orange County at 
Moda Italia in Huntington Beach and at Plummers stores.

UTILITIES; COLD, HARD FACTS ABOUT HEAT PUMP INCLUDE ITS FINE ECONOMIC CLIMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The climate in many newer homes is governed by an electric heat pump instead 
of a furnace or central air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to electric heating, heat pumps are economical: For each kilowatt of 
electricity consumed, a heat pump typically produces from 1 1/2 to three times 
as much heat as conventional electric baseboard units. 
</P>
<P>
 And because a heat pump can cool as well as heat, the cost of owning two 
separate units is saved. The pumps pay off best in the Sun Belt, where winters 
are mild. Most heat pumps cost about the same to buy and run as a central air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 A heat pump is a mechanical refrigeration system, perhaps best described as a 
reversible air conditioner. Like a central air conditioner, heat pumps require 
a system of air ducts throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The main components are an indoor unit and an outdoor unit, each containing a 
hollow metal coil and a compressor to which both coils are attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressurized refrigerant liquid cooled to a sub-zero temperature flows through 
the system. In summer, the refrigerant absorbs heat from the air surrounding 
the indoor coil and carries it to the outdoor coil, where it is released. In 
winter, reversing the flow of refrigerant draws heat from the outside air and 
carries it indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 As outdoor temperatures cool below freezing, most heat pumps lose efficiency 
because the air contains less heat to absorb. To compensate, supplementary 
electric heating elements switch on when the unit does not have enough heating 
capacity to satisfy the needs of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 It is inefficient to lower the night temperature setting on most heat pumps. 
Extra warming needed in the morning may cause the system to draw on 
supplementary heating elements. 
</P>
<P>
 If you own a heat pump, have it serviced annually by a qualified contractor, 
preferably the installer. Routinely vacuum the indoor coil if it is accessible; 
change the filter (also indoors), and wash the outdoor coil by spraying it with 
a garden hose. Never operate a heat pump without the filter in place; dust 
coating the coil reduces the heating and cooling efficiency and in extreme 
cases can cause the compressor to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, you may need to lubricate the fan motor or adjust the blower and 
drive belt. Check the owner's manual for your model and call for professional 
service if you do not understand what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Following are some common heat pump maladies and cures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Frost forming on the outdoor coil in winter and on the indoor coil in summer 
is normal during certain combinations of temperature and humidity. Keep the 
unit clean and change the filter at least once a month during the height of 
heating and cooling seasons. Avoid replacing the filter with one that is denser 
than the original; this can strain the unit and lengthen the defrost cycle. 
Call for service if the problem persists or if ice forms instead of frost. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cool air blowing from ducts during heating also is normal. Actually the air 
is sufficiently warm to heat the room (usually air from a heat pump is about 10 
degrees warmer than room temperature), but as with air from a fan, it feels 
cool against the skin because it is moving. If heat is inadequate in very cold 
weather, make sure the supplementary heating element is working. If not, call 
for service. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a heat pump cycles on and off frequently, check the thermostat; it may be 
broken or incorrectly set. The owner's manual should contain instructions for 
setting the thermostat.

PETS; BEFORE YOUR HOME GOES TO THE DOGS -- OR CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before your pet comes home for the first time, make sure your home welcomes 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to do the same things you'd do with small children coming 
into your house," says Michael Walters, public information officer for the 
American Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You definitely want to move the Ming vase," jokes Janet Hornreich of the 
Companion Animals Section of the Humane Society of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seriously, consider what type of lifestyle you lead when you choose a pet," 
she says. "If you have a house filled with beautiful statuettes and furniture, 
you might not want a puppy. You might want an older pet. Owning a pet is a big 
commitment and often means a change in lifestyle. Consider the activity level 
of the animal you're getting and be aware of what you're willing to sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you decide, the experts agree, both you and your animal will be 
happier and healthier if you take some of the following precautions, 
particularly when the animal is young. As your dog or cat matures and comes to 
understand the behavior expected of it, you may be able to bring the Ming vase 
or other valuables out from their hiding places. Meanwhile, look around your 
house for potential problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lock up poisons and cleaning solutions under the sink. Otherwise, curious 
animals may ingest them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Secure your trash, particularly if it contains tempting leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Train a cat to stay off countertops by using a water squirt gun or placing 
some two-sided tape on the countertops, Hornreich says. "Cats stick to the tape 
and this scares them, so they won't be as likely to jump up," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure wiring is bundled up, out of sight or at least not hanging 
temptingly from the sockets, Walters says. Cats and dogs love to chew on 
electrical cords, which can electrocute them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your beautiful houseplants may have to be cultivated elsewhere. Many common 
plants can be poisonous to a pet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Move ceramic or glass picture frames, as well as breakable figurines, to 
high shelves. If you keep sweets in candy dishes, your pet probably won't be 
able to resist. Hornreich says chocolate can be harmful to a small animal's 
system, so move it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Close the window. Cats, especially, have been known to leap to their deaths 
from as low as a second-floor window, Walters says. Dogs jump less frequently, 
but they're not immune to airborne curiosity. If you have open windows, make 
sure your screens can't be easily pushed from the window frame. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never leave your pet on a balcony, and never chain the animal to the edge of 
the deck. Many dogs and cats have hanged themselves when they've fallen from 
balconies and been suspended by a leash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep a collar and identification tag on your pet, and make certain you close 
the door each time you enter or leave your home, Hornreich recommends. Dogs and 
cats have a tendency to dash out at the slightest opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out if your veterinarian has an emergency number and keep it posted in 
case you need it. Most pet owners never experience any kind of disaster with 
their animals. Still, it's a good idea to be prepared.

WALLS; DO-IT-YOURSELFERS GET THE HANG OF NATURE, COUNTRY AND DENIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 70% of all wall coverings sold in the United States and Canada are hung 
by do-it-yourselfers. And a prime time for such projects, it seems, is once the 
kids are back in school. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the Wallcoverings Assn. has planned a month of activities 
through Sept. 30, including in-store promotions and clinics to help consumers 
select patterns and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry introduces new patterns monthly, with each sample book taking 
about nine months from conception to delivery. Typically, each book is in 
circulation for about three years. A popular pattern might last longer, either 
reissued in a new color or in the same color in a new book. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall coverings are selected to coordinate with other home furnishings, so 
wallpaper designers have to keep up with the trends, says Jeanne Byington of 
New York, speaking for the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, interest in nature has led to wall coverings with an environmental 
theme. And even after years of popularity, the country look has yet to peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denim is coming on strong," says Elinor Shebar, director of design for 
Village Wallcoverings in New York. "We'll be seeing stone-washed denim, blue 
and red denim and a denim border coupled with stripes." 
</P>
<P>
 One change from traditional children's room patterns is the new Children for 
the Earth collection from Roysons Corp. of Rockaway, N.J. It includes 18 
designs focused on nature. An endangered species pattern, for example, depicts 
baby pandas, polar bears, Siberian tigers and elephants. Another pattern, Keep 
It Wild, is animals in a rain forest, available by the roll or as a 7-by-9-foot 
mural. 
</P>
<P>
 The Storyland collection from Motif Designs in New Rochelle, N.Y., pairs an 
environmental theme with adventure narratives. On one pattern, sea lions and 
Eskimos are afloat on icebergs. On another, climbers scale mountain peaks, and 
a third shows what designer Ristomatti Ratia refers to as fisherkids casting 
their lines. 
</P>
<P>
 A Poets Journal wallpaper border from Sanitas Wallcoverings might appeal to a 
preteen girl who loves to read. The border, which accompanies a wall covering 
with a repeat floral motif, has individual squares with a floral spray and a 
verse by a well-known poet. Sanitas is a subsidiary of GenCorp, Hackensack, 
N.J., and the border is in the company's Ribbons & Bows Volume 2 collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who yearn for small-town life at the turn of the century might enjoy the 
Old Farmer's Almanac collection from Seabrook Designs of Memphis. One of the 
designs duplicates pages from an old almanac. There are also novelty borders. 
One of the most popular depicts laundry day on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of the new collections are a reprise of current decorating themes. 
Among them are the Edwardian look in Village Wallcoverings' Eaton Square II 
book and the classic French looks in Stroheim & Romann's Classic Gallery II 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparel look is also reprised in Menswear Patchwork, with paisley and 
foulard tie motifs. It's in the J.G. Hook Bed & Breakfast collection from 
Fashon, a subsidiary of GenCorp. 
</P>
<P>
 Using wallpaper as a basis for a room scheme gets progressively easier with 
matching and coordinating fabrics and ready-made bedding and window treatments 
on the rise. Nearly all of the new collections include fabric. Many also have 
bedding and window treatments -- and crib accessories for juvenile designs -- 
to order. Prices for the wall coverings are about $20 a single roll, borders 
$15 to $23 for five-yard lengths and fabric about $30 a yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry term for this coordination is cross-merchandising. While helpful, 
there's a danger of the consumer getting carried away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get to the point where you expect everything to match," says Edna Stern 
Finegold, executive vice president of Jolie Papier in Glendale, N.Y. "Remember 
when shoes had to match your pocketbook and both were dyed to match your dress? 
</P>
<P>
 "We should watch that the mix and match trend doesn't go too far."

GARDENING; TRY TO REMEMBER THE PRIME OF SEPTEMBER AND PREPARE NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE COOK, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>

<P>
 Garden got you down? Weeds taking over, pests eating it up, heat too intense, 
not enough water? You could go on vacation -- if you could bear returning to 
even more chaos in the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 August garden blues are a common phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 August is the time for garden-store owners to take a vacation. It's not just 
the heat; it's nature itself. Flowers are fewer in August than at any other 
time of the season, and summer storms will tear down carefully staked tomatoes 
and peppers or flatten waving pillars of cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news about August is that it's close to September, which is a great 
time for the garden. To get the most out of next month's sublime interval, the 
gardener can perform certain tasks now to launch the renewal process. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for annual flowers -- petunias, verbenas, geraniums, 
salvias to name a few -- to get leggy and meager of bloom in August. If you 
left them alone, they'd probably make a comeback, but working with them a 
little now will produce a better effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The top growth of annuals can be chopped back hard without harm; this needs to 
be done now to get rid of the legginess and force production of new blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Use scissors to trim off all the gangly growth, shaping the plant into a 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the plants have been pruned back and shaped, feed them with a mild 
nitrogen fertilizer, such as diluted fish emulsion, available at home and 
garden stores, or a pre-mixed organic fertilizer. New growth will begin 
immediately, and within a few days much of the stalky look that results from 
severe pruning will be filled in with young foliage. Blooms will begin to 
appear in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging baskets often look overgrown and unattractive by now. Impatiens in the 
garden maintain an appealingly compact, bushy look, yet they can get rangy in a 
hanging basket, especially if they have been under-watered. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other annuals that are being restored, they can be trimmed to about 
one-half to one-third their overall size. These, too, should be fed with a mild 
fertilizer. Impatiens will grow year round if they are protected from the cold.

GANG YOUTH DENIES SEEING WOODS ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Clemente gang member testified Friday that he hurled a pipe toward a 
group of teen-agers in self-defense and never saw what happened to Steve Woods, 
the 17-year-old student who was speared through the head with a paint roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Perez Bonilla, 18, is on trial for the Woods murder. On Friday, Bonilla 
spoke for the first time about the melee in a beach parking lot that ended with 
the San Clemente teen-ager's fatal injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla said he had been involved in a fistfight with another teen-ager just 
moments before Woods was speared, and believed the teen who lost the fight had 
rounded up some friends who were coming back for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed the pipe. I thought they were going to do something to us," Bonilla 
told a Superior Court judge. "I got frightened and I got scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla and five other young men -- all described by prosecutors as gang 
members or associates -- are charged with killing Woods, a San Clemente High 
School student who died 25 days after suffering the bizarre injury on Oct. 15, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla and a co-defendant, Hector Penuelas, 17, also of San Clemente, went on 
trial this week in Santa Ana. Bonilla took the witness stand Friday afternoon 
as the defense portion of the non-jury case got underway. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and awaits 
sentencing while the remaining three defendants await trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer has not disclosed which defendant may have 
wielded the paint roller rod, but has accused Bonilla and Penuelas of joining 
the attack on Woods and his friends at Calafia County Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A caravan of three cars, including the vehicle in which Woods was a passenger, 
were showered with bottles, rocks, beer cans, a tennis racquet, blocks of wood 
and several other items including the paint roller that lodged in Woods' head. 
Paer said he suspects that the paint roller that killed Woods was in a truck 
driven by one of the other defendants awaiting trial, who worked as a painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla testified Friday that the dispute began several days earlier when one 
of Woods' friends, Sterling Breckenridge, had angered Bonilla by staring him 
down and making an obscene hand gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 Breckenridge, Woods and several other friends had gone to the park to drink 
beer and hang out when Breckenridge drove by Bonilla and his friends and asked 
whether they knew about any parties later that evening. Bonilla testified he 
approached Breckenridge's vehicle and pushed him in the head while Bonilla's 
friend punched Breckenridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Breckenridge testified earlier in the week that after getting punched, he 
drove his vehicle back to his buddies and warned them to get out of the park. 
The park has only one exit, however, and the route required the teens to drive 
past Bonilla and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla, who testified Friday he is a gang member, said he watched 
Breckenridge drive back to his friends and assumed the youths were returning to 
pick a fight. Bonilla said the cars were moving quickly toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I thought they were going to do something to us," he said, adding 
that he grabbed a pipe for protection. As Woods' car drove by, he hurled the 
pipe. He said he ran toward the trees, never witnessing the fatal attack on 
Woods.

COUNTY'S COMPUTER USED TO HOST BETTING GAME; TECHNOLOGY: SEVEN MARTIN MARIETTA 
WORKERS ARE DISCIPLINED FOR ROLES IN A FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE LOGGED IN WITH 
SOCIAL SERVICE RECORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN and KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven Martin Marietta employees were disciplined for wagering on a fantasy 
football league run for several years on county computers. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and a spokesman for the company, which holds a contract to 
operate some of the largest computer systems in county government, said this 
week that the football wagering did not cost the county money in computer or 
staff time, but did violate Martin Marietta's policy that prohibits the use of 
contract equipment for personal tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something they should not have done and, they are not doing any more," 
said Neil Lincoln, public affairs officer for Martin Marietta, a 
communications, electronics and defense corporation headquartered in Bethesda, 
Md. "Martin Marietta prides itself on ethical behavior. We hold our employees 
to very high standards. The use of a company computer or a customer computer 
for personal use is simply not appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln refused to say what type of discipline the employees -- one of whom 
was a supervisor -- received earlier this year. No one was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a big blip on the screen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County General Services Director Bert Scott, whose department includes data 
operations, characterized the incident as "not a big deal" and "no different 
from any other office pool." 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as computer time, it involved absolutely zero money," Scott said. "Our 
people reviewed it and zero was billed. The (computer) time spent was not even 
measurable." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said the improper use of the system was limited to local Martin Marietta 
employees, and the computer files only involved football information. Scott 
estimated that the football operation had been running for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, Martin Marietta has been under contract to the county to manage 
the Santa Ana-based Data Center where computer systems process such county 
government functions as payroll, tax assessments and data for the county Social 
Services Agency. About 120 Martin Marietta employees work under the contract at 
the county Data Center. 
</P>
<P>
 While installing a computer security system in January, county employees 
discovered files filled with statistics and rosters for the fantasy football 
league. County managers then notified Martin Marietta, and company officials 
ordered an end to the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Fantasy football, like rotisserie baseball, is a popular pastime among sports 
fans. Team "owners" pay a fee to join the league, then "draft" National 
Football League players for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 After actual NFL games each week, a "commissioner" compiles individual 
players' statistics into the fantasy team results. At season's end, the winner 
collects the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Martin Marietta league was run by one employee who entered the data, after 
work hours, to county computers, using an access code connected to the county's 
Social Services agency, officials said. Six other employees "owned" teams in 
the league and knew it was being run on the computer, Lincoln said. 
</P>
<P>
 No county money was lost in connection with fantasy football, Lincoln said, 
because the "commissioner" logged onto the computer using an account that is 
not billed according to the amount of computer time used. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they were doing is not right, but there probably isn't a computer of any 
size anywhere in America that doesn't have a rotisserie baseball or fantasy 
football league running on it somewhere," Lincoln said. "Is that the right 
thing to do? No. And when you find out about it, you stop it."

GETTING JAZZED ABOUT RADIO; DISC JOCKEY HOPEFULS LEARN THEIR CHOPS AT 
SADDLEBACK'S STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Cheryl Bess leaned toward the microphone to let radio listeners know whose 
horn was blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "From David Sanborn to Norman Brown, keeping you jazzed, KSBR-FM," Bess said 
coolly while preparing for the next round of songs in a small booth at 
Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess, 25, hopes to follow in the path of KSBR-FM alumni who dot the Southern 
California radio landscape with success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deejays on the air are students, but they sound like professionals," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And some have gone on to become successful professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 A short list includes Juan Andres deHaseth, president and owner of Radio 
LABIO, the nation's first Spanish-language talk radio network, based in Los 
Angeles; Jay Lawrence, an Orange County reporter for KFI-AM; Bruce Pulley, who 
handles the morning slot at alternative rock station XHRM-FM in San Diego, and 
Carrie Dunne, who plays country songs for KIK-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Wedel, program director for Saddleback College's radio station, said 
KSBR-FM's contemporary jazz format might not make student disc jockeys' hearts 
pound, but it gives them the training to walk into any broadcast booth and fit 
into a station's format. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, musical tastes tend to reflect age. Bess said she prefers songs by 
Soundgarden, Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails but has grown found of Harry Connick 
Jr. and about 40% of the station's programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are at a station to be a performer, it doesn't matter what kind of 
music you're playing," said Wedel, who has seen disc jockey hopefuls by the 
hundreds come through the station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 to 50 disc jockeys work at the student station. Some are volunteers 
who work late nights and pre-dawn hours. Most of the disc jockeys are students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They either get course credit or the satisfaction of knowing that they are 
getting famous," Wedel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedel became the station's program director about seven years ago and still 
has the polished baritone voice of an on-air personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio attracted him when he was studying political science in the mid-1970s at 
Pomona College. He started doing free-lance work for the college's radio 
station, then came to Saddleback College, providing local news coverage and 
stories for California Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he has an office where he is surrounded by more than 5,000 vinyl records 
stacked on shelves (albums that are not yet on compact disc). A jug of water 
and a half-empty bottle of aspirin share space with books on jazz performer 
Miles Davis and other greats. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedel said the radio industry continues to lure new talent, despite the fact 
that careers often start with long hours and low pay. He said that students who 
go on to jobs in radio usually have two things: drive and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 DeHaseth, of Laguna Beach, who entered the college's radio program at age 49 
after selling a successful cosmetics business, said his wife prodded him to 
try. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'You've always wanted to use your voice and be in the 
communications field, here's your chance,' " deHaseth said. "And now, I'm in 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Radio LABIO, an acronym for Latin American Broadcast Industry Organization, 
reaches about 300,000 to 350,000 listeners, deHaseth said. The station was 
started less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dunne, who holds a bachelor's degree in communication studies and mass media 
from UCLA, said she picked up valuable training at KSBR-FM a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They let you get in there and they let you do it," Dunne said. "It really 
gave me that extra hands-on (experience) that I needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Saunders, 32, is a disc jockey at the college on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders was working at a Jack in the Box in San Juan Capistrano a decade ago 
when a disc jockey from a Los Angeles rock station pulled up to the 
drive-through for a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc jockey, Richard Blade from KROQ-FM, whom Saunders recognized, 
suggested that Saunders give radio a try after hearing his voice over the 
drive-through speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a dream of mine for a long time," Saunders said. "This is a good 
launching board."

DISTRICT, TEACHERS ANNOUNCE DEADLOCK; EDUCATION: TALKS BREAK DOWN AS L.A. 
UNIFIED REJECTS UNION DEMAND FOR 10% PAY RESTORATION, AND STICKS TO ORIGINAL 7% 
OFFER. FACT-FINDING WILL BE NEXT STEP IN EFFORT TO AVERT A STRIKE.

<P>
 Labor tensions between the Los Angeles Unified School District and its 
teachers union intensified Friday when the district rejected a union 
counteroffer demanding a full 10% pay restoration and both sides announced a 
deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson said the Board of Education is sticking to its original 
offer of a 7% salary return because the cash-strapped school district "has 
thoroughly scoured every area of the budget" and cannot find more money for 
teachers' pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board is not prepared to make high-risk decisions that could put 
the district's financial stability at stake by agreeing to fully restore 
salaries, school board President Mark Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher union President Helen Bernstein was blunt in her assessment of the 
day's developments. "Print the picket signs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With three weeks before the start of most schools Sept. 12, the nation's 
second-largest school district finds itself mired in the uncertainty of whether 
there will be a chaotic teachers strike soon after 640,000 students return to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second consecutive year that the union has leveled a strike threat 
because of a salary dispute. In the wake of severe budget reductions, the 
teachers have suffered a 10% cut for the last two years. In the midst of 
recession in 1993, teachers agreed to the cuts, hopeful that the school board 
would restore their pay this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the district offered to give teachers back 7% of their salaries 
this year -- of which 4% would be guaranteed in future contracts and 3% would 
be a one-time-only payment. In addition, the district points out that teachers 
will be receiving pay for five more days next year to make up for time lost 
after the January earthquake, making their checks 9.5% higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders interpret the numbers differently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They call it a solid 2% restoration. They say that another 2% is contingent on 
reaching an agreement with other district unions to use $42 million in health 
benefits savings for salaries. And an additional 3% is one-time-only money that 
is not guaranteed in the future. Leaders said they are insulted that the 
district would try to entice teachers to consider earthquake makeup days as 
part of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein has vowed to put the district's offer to a vote during the first 
week of school, and both sides have agreed to pressurized negotiations aimed at 
solving their differences before then. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown of talks Friday and the formal declaration of an impasse -- a 
legal action that must be taken before a strike vote can be taken -- clears the 
way for both sides to take the next step in the negotiations process, mediation 
and fact-finding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To save time, both sides agreed to skip mediation. But as of Friday, they had 
not reached agreement on a fact-finder, a person who makes non-binding 
recommendations to both sides about the offer in dispute. One candidate for the 
job is Thomas Roberts, a star in the labor dispute resolution business who has 
presided over high-profile major league baseball cases. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer and gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown weighed into the 
dispute this week in a letter offering her assistance to both sides to help 
avert a strike. She said she had been briefed about the potential for a strike 
by teachers union officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a former Los Angeles school board member, told the district "it may be 
prudent" to further reduce its insurance liability and workers' compensation 
funds to come up with $30 million to $40 million -- a move that the union has 
been pushing. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Slavkin has asked Brown to clarify her position on this issue. 
District auditors have said such an action, although not illegal, is a 
high-risk accounting move that could harm the district's solid credit ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if Kathleen Brown, as a constitutional officer of the state of 
California, says, 'I can assure the board that this is a prudent thing to do 
and that it doesn't assume undue risk,' . . . that would be pretty strong 
footing for the board to make a decision," Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had not received a response from her Friday. Her office could not 
be reached for comment Friday night.

CITYSCAPES / NICHOLAS RICCARDI: REFORMED CON ARTIST MAKING A PITCH ON HOW TO 
AVOID SCAMS; 'IF YOU GET SCAMMED AND STAY SILENT, THAT MEANS THEY CAN SCAM YOUR 
FAMILY . . . AND YOUR NEIGHBORS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the dozen or so people in the basement meeting room of the First 
African Methodist Episcopal Church on Harvard Boulevard are taking notes as the 
speaker begins to dissect "the pitch," line by line: 
</P>
<P>
 The caller informs you that you have won one of four prizes in a sweepstakes. 
You're guaranteed at least a $2,000 shopping spree at the mall of your choice, 
and you could win $40,000. How does it feel to be a winner? All you've got to 
do is buy some products. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop right there," says the sandy-haired man as two members of the audience 
act out the dialogue. That's the con, the man says. 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. He wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls himself John T. He is a former con artist who says he made millions 
in telemarketing fraud before reforming and becoming an anti-fraud expert. 
These days he goes through his old tricks for audiences from San Diego to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 His mission: to educate people -- particularly senior citizens, who are most 
vulnerable to scams -- about how to protect themselves against con artists. His 
motto: "The best way to teach you how to outwit a con artist is to teach you 
how to be one." His warning, verified by a federal fraud investigator: Southern 
California is the No. 1 scam target in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where the money is," says John T., who was raised in Santa Ana and 
lives in Seal Beach. "Plus, people in California are more likely to take a risk 
than someone in 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois or Ohio," and thus more susceptible to get-rich-quick pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 John T.'s visit to First AME, Los Angeles' most prestigious black church, is 
his first stop in the vicinity, but he promises to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time I come back here I want the room filled!" he tells the tiny 
audience. Historically, South-Central Los Angeles in particular has been a gold 
mine for fraud artists. Crooks, John T. says, covet the savings of many senior 
citizens who stockpile money to help extended families. As a result, the con 
artist causes more pain: "Proportionally, a (South-Central) retiree who is 
helping to support an extended family who loses $30 is the same as a retiree in 
Laguna Beach losing $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John T. plays well in churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his talk deals with his own life: his time on Southland streets as a 
juvenile delinquent; his training and career as what two investigators call one 
of the nation's most notorious con artists, and his conversion in Alcoholics 
Anonymous.  
</P>
<P>
 His voice takes on a subtle Southern twang as he details his fall and rise, 
his tone softening as he talks about the "good Christian family" that took him 
in, hardening when he refers to the alcohol and drugs that numbed his 
conscience, thundering when he tells his audience: "Now, I don't want you to 
enter another drawing or sweepstakes again, because that's where it all 
starts!" 
</P>
<P>
 John T. says he started in the con business after he left Southern California 
in 1978 at the age of 20 and answered an ad in a Las Vegas newspaper for a 
salesman. Soon, he says, he was one of 50 con artists working out of a "boiler 
room," pulling in what he estimates at $23 million a year for the organization, 
keeping hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself. He says he moved around 
the country, selling counterfeit art in New York City, marketing nonexistent 
oil wells in Miami Beach, and running sweepstakes scams in San Diego, where he 
was ultimately busted in March, 1987, for offering contest "winners" a way 
around having to pay a tax on their soon-to-be-shipped prizes -- buying $400 
worth of promotional items. Postal Inspector David Westberg confirmed the San 
Diego scam's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his defense, John T. blamed his troubles on alcohol and entered AA. 
He credits his high-priced attorney with getting him a mere 70-day prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was incarcerated, John T. realized something. "The woman who said she 
loved me, she didn't visit me," he says. Nor did his con artist friends. "Only 
these people from AA came, and they gave me a Bible, and I read it, and 
something sank in." 
</P>
<P>
 After staying with his AA sponsor in San Diego, John T. moved to Lancaster and 
worked as a chemical dependency counselor, attended UCLA and graduated in 1992 
with a bachelor's degree in psychology (he had never finished high school). He 
was also reunited with his family, and says they are now closer than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 His 12-step recovery was still in progress, though, and in 1989 he was stuck 
on Step 9, where one is supposed to make amends with those one has wronged. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I make amends?" he asked his sponsor. "I don't even know all the 
people I've wronged." 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsor told him to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, John T. got a call from Douglas P. Shadel, a fraud investigator 
with the state of Washington who was trying to start an anti-fraud 
organization. He needed help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the First AME basement, John T. passes around copies of one of the products 
of his partnership with Shadel -- the book "Schemes & Scams," which they wrote. 
He urges his audience to tell their friends and family about fraud prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get scammed and stay silent, that means they can scam your family, 
your friends and your neighbors," he says. "If you get scammed and tell 
everyone, you're going to help put them out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to defend yourself, John T. says. Never buy anything over the phone. 
Never buy anything being sold door to door, and especially beware of 
contractors going door to door offering rebated work, a scam prevalent in 
metropolitan areas such as central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who hear John T.'s pitch are glad they came. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel protected," says Debra Jackson, 30, a South-Central resident. "I feel 
like I'm a victim all the time." She says she has been scammed into buying 
insurance and paying upfront for a car that didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Many at this week's session expressed frustration at the low turnout. Joan 
Bennett, a customer service representative for Delta Airlines, speculates that 
people do not want to be seen at the workshop "because you feel they'll think 
you're a victim." 
</P>
<P>
 John T. hopes the stigma surrounding fraud cases will fade as people realize 
they are not to blame.  
</P>
<P>
 His eyes are set on the day he can stop crusading and start a normal life -- 
he hopes that by 1996 he will have atoned for what he did and have set up a 
network of anti-fraud workers that will continue while he pursues a doctorate 
in psychology. But for now he's got amends to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no excuse for what I've done," he tells his audience. "That's one of 
the reasons I give these workshops."

A DIFFERENT KIND OF COURT TV; HIGH-TECH SYSTEM MAY HELP SIMPSON JURORS SEE 
EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much of America will be glued to the tube during the O.J. Simpson murder 
trial, so why should the people in the courtroom be any different? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the big screen is coming to the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Lance 
A. Ito. Make that two really big screens -- 67-inchers, to be exact -- onto 
which visual evidence will be beamed for the benefit of jurors and courtroom 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultra-tech, interactive Evidence Presentation System was loaned to the 
court by a Los Angeles company called Trial Presentation Technologies, which is 
hoping to get business from free publicity during the trial, which is to begin 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the prosecution nor the defense has yet promised to use the new 
equipment, which has only been used before in civil cases and will have its 
criminal case premiere during a less-celebrated murder case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 If attorneys in the Simpson case decide to use the system, they can take 
advantage of features including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Instant translation of a court reporter's coded shorthand into plain 
English, which would appear on courtroom computer screens as the reporter 
typed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 67-inch screens -- one for the jury, one for the spectators -- capable 
of displaying evidence including documents, photographs, charts, videos or even 
animation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer monitors on the witness stand, on the judge's bench, and on the 
defense and prosecution tables, that would be used to view the evidence and the 
instant testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technological wizardry that can superimpose documents on moving pictures. 
Portions of the documents also can be instantly enlarged or shrunk before the 
jury's eyes or circled with a colored light pen by a witness sitting 10 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two consulting companies, also working for free, will be available to advise 
the lawyers on the pros and cons of the technology -- including whether it 
would be appropriate to display gory crime scene pictures on such huge screens. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not "cyber-justice," to crib a term Superior Court Judge George Trammell 
used Friday while describing the technology to reporters, but it is a tool for 
helping jurors understand sometimes complicated or hard-to-see evidence as it 
is presented, rather than some time later during deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell, the court's in-house computer technology supervisor, has been 
helping set up court computer systems for about three years and has been using 
some Evidence Presentation System equipment in his courtroom since June. 
</P>
<P>
 He persuaded Ito to take advantage of the technology for the widely watched 
Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Huenke, managing partner of TPT, said the equipment -- which alone 
would cost as much as $150,000 -- will be installed before the trial's 
scheduled Sept. 19 start and will be available to both sides, even if they 
choose not to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Childs, speaking on behalf of Deputy Dist. Attys. Marcia Clark, Bill 
Hodgman and Lisa Kahn, said the prosecutors had not had a chance to examine the 
TPT system and so did not know if they would take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The same was the case for Robert L. Shapiro, lead attorney for Simpson, who 
has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 slayings in Brentwood of his ex-wife 
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 His decision, Shapiro said, will depend on "the type of evidence we use and 
how we're going to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 John Swenson, a Los Angeles attorney who is not involved in the Simpson case, 
has used the technology twice in civil proceedings. He said it "leads to a 
better administration of the system of justice" because jurors can see evidence 
such as documents with their own eyes, up close, as it is being presented and 
testified to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally they wouldn't see a document until deliberations," Swenson said, 
adding that by that time -- in some cases months later -- they may have 
forgotten what the testimony pertaining to it was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 The same would be true of photographs and charts, which are now often 
displayed on a bulletin board just inches away from witness who are testifying, 
but several feet from some jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new evidence display methods will require that charts, photographs and 
other materials be "imaged" and computerized by a TPT technician, who will work 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are some materials that one side does not want the other to see until 
the jury does, consultants outside the court will have to prepare them for the 
computer and they will be entered "under tight security," Trammell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with so much high technology in the courtroom, the potential for human 
error remains. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the chance of some forbidden document making an unscheduled 
appearance on the big screen, Judge Ito will be equipped with a "kill switch" 
that would shut off the equipment instantly. State of the Art A high-tech 
computer system will be available in the courtroom during the O.J. Simpson 
murder trial. The system, with computer monitors at various locations and 
large-screen displays for he jury and spectators, is being installed by a Los 
Angeles firm for the duration of the trial. Documents, charts, photographs, 
videos and animations can be shown on the computer monitors and the larger 
screens. Here is a look at how the system can be used. * Judge: Reviews 
transcripts or evidence before they are seen by jury and spectators. * Jury and 
spectators: View evidence and other items on high-resolution, wide-screen 
monitors. * Court Reporter: Electronically translates stenographer's notes into 
English for showing on the monitors. * Witness: Sees evidence while the same 
material is shown in other parts of the courtroom. Can also make notes on the 
monitor using a "light pen" that will be visible to others in the courtroom. * 
Technology: Evidence is displayed from the main computer after it is admitted 
by the judge, who can order any monitors turned off at any time. * Attorneys: 
View transcripts or search for earlier testimony. While at podium, they can 
annotated evidence with "light pen". Source: Trial Presentation Technologies

CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS BACK LAPD OFFICIAL; POLICE: POLITICIANS SUPPORT ASSISTANT 
CHIEF PARKS' EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY DEPARTMENT. UNION HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF HIS 
APPROACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members voiced their support for the Los Angeles Police 
Department's second-highest ranking officer Friday, joining a fractious debate 
that has divided the city's police ranks along racial lines and prompted some 
minority officers to attack their own union. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference, a group of council members criticized the Los 
Angeles Police Protective League for filing a labor action against Assistant 
Chief Bernard C. Parks, one of the department's best known and most respected 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has formed a special committee to investigate complaints by its 
members against Parks and has accused him of tampering with promotions in the 
LAPD's Narcotics Group in order to boost the number of women and minorities who 
work for that unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks has aggressively sought to increase minority representation at the LAPD 
and canceled a recent set of promotions in the narcotics unit, but he has said 
he took that action because the testing procedures were improper. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's move against Parks has sparked a heated debate within the Police 
Department, and council members Friday joined with minority officers who have 
risen to the assistant chief's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This action on the part of the league is an affront to goals established by 
both the courts and the council," said Councilwoman Rita Walters, who was 
accompanied by four other council members and a representative of a fifth. "I 
want to also express real concern that the league's accusations will create 
further dissension within the ranks of the LAPD at a time we are seeking to 
increase the numbers of women and minorities."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, a member of the council's Public Safety 
Committee, agreed. "We must support the efforts of Chief Parks and others who 
are fighting for basic fairness, diversity and the proper administration of 
promotional exams." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks declined to comment on the issue in detail Friday, saying only: "I'm 
very appreciative of the council's support of the department's efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 League officials attended the news conference and afterward accused council 
members of misrepresenting the dispute. The real argument, according to league 
general counsel Hank Hernandez, is not over minority representation at the 
LAPD, but over Parks' handling of the narcotics promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez stressed that union officials were not arguing against the principle 
that women and minorities should be better represented in the department ranks. 
In fact, Hernandez said, the union has long been a champion of minority 
officers seeking to improve the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the league that is dividing the department along racial lines," 
Hernandez said. "It is people like Chief Parks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez called on the City Council to conduct an investigation of the recent 
narcotics promotions and asked Mayor Richard Riordan to get involved in the 
process as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In criticizing Parks, one league official this week said he feared that the 
assistant chief was preparing to launch a program of "ethnic cleansing," a 
remark that deeply angered Parks as well as the lawmakers who appeared at 
Friday's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response (from the council members) comes to items like calling this 
ethnic cleansing," said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. "Regardless of whether an 
error was or was not made in a particular case, that's an outrageous remark." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they did not address that specific comment, league officials used 
milder rhetoric during their news conference. They said they were not trying to 
launch a personal attack on Parks, and Hernandez at one point said league 
officials wanted to "extend a hand of cooperation" to the assistant chief. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, however, leaders of the Oscar Joel Bryant Foundation, the largest 
African American police officers association, said the league's actions 
demonstrated the union's determination to represent the interests of white male 
members over those of female and minority members. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is the best that the Protective League can do for its minority 
members, then it is time for minority members to pull out of the Protective 
League and represent ourselves," Leonard Ross, president of the 600-member 
foundation, said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Otis Dobine, president of the Assn. of Black Law Enforcement Executives, 
echoed that view, accusing the league of failing to represent its female and 
minority members and calling on union leaders to halt their criticism of Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the chief is doing is saying: 'Let's do this right. Let's make this 
fair,' " said Dobine, who is in charge of detectives at the LAPD's Pacific 
division. "He has the courage and the strength to do what's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 The Narcotics Group promotions have been put on hold because of the 
controversy, and department officials said Chief Willie L. Williams has 
postponed new oral exams that had been slated for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is likely to flare up again Tuesday, when narcotics detectives 
expect to appear before the Los Angeles Police Commission to lodge complaints 
against Parks. His backers also plan to appear before the panel.

EMERGENCY STATUS URGED FOR NEEDLE EXCHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles riots, the Northridge earthquake, last fall's wildfires -- 
each of them prompted city officials to declare a local state of emergency. If 
Hollywood Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg has her way, the AIDS epidemic will 
prompt the same response. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about police citations issued in recent months to activists who are 
distributing clean needles to drug users on Hollywood streets, Goldberg on 
Friday urged Mayor Richard Riordan to declare a local public health emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is designed to discourage the LAPD from disrupting the needle 
exchanges, which are against state law but occur throughout the city. 
Authorities have long given tacit approval to the exchanges because AIDS is 
commonly transmitted by dirty needles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many, many more people will die from this emergency than died during the 
earthquake or the civil unrest," Goldberg said. "Most of those states of 
emergency were declared to protect property. This is really designed to protect 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring a state of emergency would not legalize the needle exchanges but 
officials say it would send a message that City Hall supports such efforts and 
would put needle exchanges toward the bottom of the Police Department's list of 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A top official for the LAPD said the state of emergency would not change their 
policy. "It is already at a low priority," Assistant Police Chief Bernard Parks 
said. He added that the LAPD will still respond, however, to the most serious 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and several Northern California counties have 
used similar declarations to allow needle exchanges without disruption by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 If the City Council approves Goldberg's motion next week, it would be up to 
Riordan, who has supported needle distributions in the past, to issue the 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city law, a local emergency applies to "any occurrence which by 
reason of its magnitude is or is likely to become beyond the control of the 
normal services, personnel, equipment and facilities of the regularly 
constituted branches and departments of the city government." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been numerous states of emergency declared in recent years, most of 
them tied to Mother Nature. Besides the big three disasters above, the winter 
storms in 1992 and 1993 prompted emergency declarations, as did the Big 
Bear-Landers earthquakes in 1992 and the Sierra Madre earthquake in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The target of this declaration is the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving sporadic complaints from critics in recent months, police have 
issued five citations to the activists who gathered every Wednesday night at a 
Hollywood street corner to exchange clean needles for used ones. All those 
cited have been working with Clean Needles Now, which has distributed needles 
for more than two years on Los Angeles streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office says it is reviewing the cases but has not filed 
charges in any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood activists say they are trying to reduce the spread of AIDS by 
handing out fresh needles to those who might otherwise risk contracting HIV by 
using dirty ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics, led by real estate developer Jerry Schneiderman, argue that 
street corner needle exchanges attract vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want Hollywood to become the hub of distribution for the entire city 
so drug addicts flock here," he said. "You should see the creeps and characters 
who show up." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, the exchange site was next door to an elementary school and a 
Catholic church until sponsors bowed to criticism and recently moved to an 
alley behind a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Dent, principal of Selma Avenue Elementary School, had no objections to 
the location, saying that drug use was a fact of life in the neighborhood and 
that the distributions occurred well after the students had gone home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the timing of it, it has never caused a problem for us as a 
school," she said. "I don't personally see drug pushers in front of the school 
and they have not, to my knowledge, bothered any schoolchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 But the receptionist at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, Rachel Rodney, 
complained of drug users traipsing through the church parking lot about the 
time that evening services were letting out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very glad it's moved," she said. "The program is probably good, but why 
can't they do it at a health clinic and not in the street?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There are more than half a dozen needle distribution sites in other parts of 
the city, including South Park and Skid Row, and two sites are planned soon for 
the San Fernando Valley, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the locations are kept secret to avoid rousing controversy and scaring 
away drug users who gather there. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters, who represents parts of Downtown and South-Central, 
supports the distribution sites in her district. She joined Councilmen Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Richard Alarcon and Mike Hernandez in co-sponsoring Goldberg's 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an awful lot of drug use in abandoned buildings and homes and the 
outright selling of it on street corners," Walters said. "The drug users are 
there already. These programs are just trying to control the spread of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Gov. Pete Wilson has vetoed legislation that would have made 
needle distribution legal. In March, 1993, San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan 
defied Wilson and declared a public health emergency so the city could provide 
funds for the needle exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's motion would not legalize the possession of a hypodermic needle -- 
a violation of the state Business and Professional Code -- but would direct the 
police to make citations a low priority. Nor would it provide funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in fact a health crisis," Goldberg said. "We don't want the police to 
break any laws but we want them to go as far as they can within the law to 
permit this. This ought to be on the bottom of their list." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who plans to vote against Goldberg's motion, 
has been the only council member to speak out against needle exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a good way to fight disease," Svorinich said. "There is no 
question that AIDS is a serious epidemic but we won't be sending the right 
message to people of Los Angeles if we allow the illegal distribution of 
needles."

ARIZONA GOVERNOR APPROVES FAMALARO EXTRADITION; JUSTICE: PAINTER ACCUSED OF 
MURDERING DENISE HUBER MUST FACE A COURT HEARING AS EARLY AS MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Arizona's governor signed extradition documents Friday that could force house 
painter John J. Famalaro to return to Orange County to face charges he murdered 
a young Newport Beach woman and kept her nude, handcuffed corpse in a freezer 
for nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Fife Symington signed the extradition papers after they were forwarded to 
him by California Gov. Pete Wilson as part of a lengthy process to move a 
criminal defendant over state lines, said Douglas Cole, Symington's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 An extradition hearing for Famalaro is scheduled for Aug. 29, but Yavapai 
County Counsel Thomas Lindberg said Friday the governor's signature means the 
hearing could be held as soon as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is accused of murdering 23-year-old Denise Huber, who vanished after 
her car broke down on the Corona del Mar (73) Freeway in June, 1991. Arizona 
authorities discovered Huber's body last month in a running freezer in the back 
of a stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro's driveway. Investigators now 
suspect she was killed in a Laguna Hills storage bin and are planning to move 
the case to Orange County for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Lindberg filed a legal motion to dismiss a single felony theft 
charge remaining against Famalaro in Arizona to help smooth extradition. The 
charge stems from the stolen rental truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said that he expected Yavapai County Superior Court Judge Raymond W. 
Weaver to schedule an extradition hearing Monday or Tuesday to determine 
whether Famalaro wants to continue fighting extradition.  
</P>
<P>
 "From there, it's just a matter for Orange County or Costa Mesa police to 
arrange to pick him up," Lindberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, who has pleaded not guilty, could face the death penalty if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 A search of Famalaro's Prescott Country Club home turned up 3-year-old Orange 
County newspapers that carried stories about Huber's disappearance and her 
parents' futile attempts to find her. Huber's clothing and purse were found in 
Famalaro's garage in a box marked "Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia could not be reached to 
comment about extradition late Friday. But he said this week that a therapist 
has begun visiting Famalaro in the Yavapai County Jail. Gumlia said a team of 
psychologists and psychiatrists is lined up to examine Famalaro when he arrives 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said the move does not indicate he plans an insanity defense. The 
attorney said he routinely requires psychiatric examinations at the outset of 
serious cases. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Ventura County authorities said they no longer suspect Famalaro in 
the abduction and death of Nancy Huter of Thousand Oaks, who disappeared March 
3, 1992. Famalaro was considered a suspect because the circumstances were 
similar to the Huber case. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the Huber case, authorities found Hurer's abandoned car after her 
disappearance and officers found no sign of a struggle near her vehicle. 
Huter's body was found near Malibu more than a year after she vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have been fairly able to establish that he was not connected to 
this case," Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Craig Husband said.

<P>
 The city is seeking applicants for two positions on the Traffic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 William Bivens and Joseph Greco recently notified the city that they must 
resign from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Bivens, a commissioner for more than a year, said he is resigning because his 
job now requires more travel.  
</P>
<P>
 Greco, on the commission since January, resigned because he has moved to 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission makes recommendations to the City Council regarding improvement 
of traffic conditions, enforcement of traffic regulations and parking. 
</P>
<P>
 It meets the third Wednesday of each month at 7 p.m. in the Council Chambers, 
25201 Paseo de Alicia. 
</P>
<P>
 The two terms to be filled will expire in January, 1997. The deadline for 
applications is 5 p.m. Sept. 8. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; ALMOST NO TRUANCY REPORTED IN DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the school district's 21,600 students return to school in September, 
teachers expect to see each and every one of them in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Irvine Unified School District teachers will not be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials reported this week that unexcused absences averaged less 
than 1% last school year. The 0.71% rate of unexcused absences works out to an 
average of five absences per day for each of the district's 28 schools in 
grades kindergarten through high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the problems that some districts have," said Jerry Rayl, 
assistant to the superintendent. "These kids go to school." 
</P>
<P>
 After subtracting excused absences, Irvine public schools reported a 96.4% 
average attendance rate for the 1993-94 school year. Unexcused absences during 
the 1992-93 school year were also under 1% in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been fairly constant in that range for a number of years," Rayl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Department of Education no longer compiles yearly attendance 
rates, but individual school districts are required by law to make attendance 
rates public. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District, which had 30,110 students enrolled 
last school year, also reported less than 1% in unexcused absences. In the 
Santa Ana Unified School District, unexcused absences averaged 2.5% of the 
district's 48,897 students enrolled during the 1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, Meadow Park Elementary School reported the highest attendance rate 
for the last school year: 99.99% of Meadow Park students either attended class 
or had an excused absence such as illness or a doctor's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Michael B. Regele said Irvine's high attendance rates 
are a reflection of the community. "Part of the reason people move to Irvine is 
because they value education," Regele said. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher attendance rates also bring increased revenue, as state funding levels 
for most public school districts are based on average daily attendance levels. 
</P>
<P>
 One consequence of the Irvine school district's success is the growing number 
of families who live outside the city but register their children in the school 
district. School district officials say parents who use the address of friends 
who live in the city are hard to detect -- despite the occasional phone call 
from school to a student's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their friends are pretty good at covering for them," said Rayl, adding that 
he understands the motivations behind the subterfuge. "They're just trying to 
succeed."RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; SERIES OF COLLISIONS KILL ONE MOTORIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman slowing down to avoid a stranded car on the Garden Grove Freeway was 
killed when another motorist struck her from behind in one of a series of 
collisions involving four cars which left another man seriously injured early 
Friday morning, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of accidents, which blocked eastbound traffic for more than four 
hours, began at 5:10 a.m., when Crystian Adolfo Pivaral, 20, of Santa Ana 
attempted to exit the freeway at Euclid Street. He later told officers that he 
had swerved to avoid a passing vehicle that blocked his exit, Officer Joan 
Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaral told police that he lost control of his car, which veered left and 
struck the center divider wall. Pivaral left the car jutting halfway onto the 
No. 1 lane and walked toward the right shoulder of the freeway, across three 
lanes, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Zarina, 22, of Westminster, slowed to avoid Pivaral's car at 5:12 a.m. 
and was struck from behind by a car driven by Manuel Flores Felix, 39, of 
Westminster, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact was so severe that it pushed the back end of Zarina's car into the 
front seat. She died on impact, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix, driving at a high speed, then veered toward the right and struck a car 
driven by Nathan John Jones, 20, of Huntington Beach. Jones' car then struck 
Pivaral's disabled car in the No. 1 lane, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was not injured, but Felix suffered "moderate to major" injuries to the 
chest and was taken to Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center, Rivas said. 
Hospital officials did not return phone calls regarding Felix's condition.  
</P>
<P>
 One person who witnessed the first crash said that Pivaral was driving at "a 
very high rate of speed" when he crashed into the center divider, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still investigating the incident, and anyone who may have witnessed 
the crash is asked to contact the CHP at (714) 892-4426. TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; RESTAURANT STRUCK BY GRAFFITI VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A hamburger restaurant here is believed to be the latest target of animal 
rights graffiti vandals who already have struck at five other fast-food 
eateries this week in South County, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of Bravo Burgers on Beach Boulevard found the walls covered with 
messages such as "Animal Killers Will Die," "Meat Equals Sin" and "Meat Eaters 
Must Die" when they opened the restaurant Friday, police Lt. Luis Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the spray-painting at Bravo Burgers occurred between 11:30 p.m. 
Thursday, when the restaurant closed, and 5:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The initials ALF, which police said apparently stands for Animal Liberation 
Front, were also sprayed in blue and silver paint around the building. 
</P>
<P>
 ALF is an international underground organization that has in the past taken 
responsibility for break-ins at government and university laboratories to 
protest treatment of lab animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither police nor Orange County sheriff's investigators could say whether the 
group was responsible for the incident at Bravo Burgers or if it is related to 
the South County cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we have absolutely no idea who's doing it," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to Bravo Burgers is estimated at $1,000, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar messages were discovered earlier this week in South County, where 
vandals struck at McDonald's restaurants in Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel, at 
Fatburger in San Clemente, at a Burger King in Rancho Santa Margarita and at a 
Carl's Jr. in Laguna Niguel.TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; PROBE OF STREET LIGHT BILLING GOES PRIVATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The efforts by some residents to review the city's street lighting system will 
continue, but their work will no longer be sanctioned by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday approved dissolving a special committee on street 
lighting at the request of the committee members who said that their work could 
become a burden to city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Former councilman Ray Littrell and two other committee members said that 
because of the requirements of the state public meetings law, city employee 
support would be necessary to carry out the committee's work. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would mean taking time away from more pressing duties, Littrell said. 
Instead, he said the former committee members would have to work as private 
individuals, and at no cost to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The other members are residents Jack Schild and Tom Petrosine. 
</P>
<P>
 The council created the panel earlier this month to review the street lighting 
billing system, including reports that the Southern California Edison Co. may 
have double billed the city for some street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has more than 7,800 street lights. Some have electric meters and 
others are paid at a flat rate. The city has been doubled billed -- at a flat 
rate and a metered rate -- for at least nine street lights at a parking lot on 
Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not been determined yet how much the city was overbilled, but Brad 
Martin, the Edison area manager, has offered to pay back the excess charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also was expected to investigate whether the city is being 
billed for some street lights located in neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the committee has now been dissolved, Littrell and his group will 
continue to receive help from city employees whenever possible, officials said.

FOX DELAYS SIMPSON MOVIE UNTIL JURORS ARE SELECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fox Television Network said Friday that it will postpone the scheduled 
Sept. 13 showing of its quickie television movie "The O.J. Simpson Story" until 
after the jury is selected for Simpson's murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to postpone the film marked a reversal of Fox's position last 
week to air the film despite the objections of Simpson's attorney, Robert L. 
Shapiro, who said broadcasting the film would jeopardize the former football 
superstar's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 13 air date would have come a week before the start of Simpson's 
trial on charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her 
friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have had an opportunity to review the final shooting script of 'The 
O.J. Simpson Story,' " a statement by Fox said. "We are pleased with both the 
script and the production to date. However, after our internal assessment of 
the situation and after discussions with Mr. Simpson's counsel, we have decided 
to postpone the Sept. 13 broadcast of 'The O.J. Simpson Story' until after the 
jury has been selected." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement continued, "We believe this is consistent with our stated policy 
to date, which has been to evaluate each stage of development of the movie in 
light of our responsibilities as broadcasters." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro told Associated Press that he was pleased with Fox's decision. "Much 
to their credit, they put the right of O.J. to have a fair trial ahead of their 
commercial venture and should be commended for being able to handle this with 
common sense," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Shapiro's earlier protests, the network had maintained that the 
film would not deal with the guilt or innocence of the former football great 
and would be based strictly on public record.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY PLANS ORDINANCE ON TOPLESS CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials say they do not expect a rush by the purveyors of adult 
entertainment into Seal Beach if a proposed ordinance is approved by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a flurry of state and federal court rulings citing a First 
Amendment right to provide topless entertainment, the City Council on Monday 
night will vote on a proposed ordinance to establish a clear set of guidelines 
for strip clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you can say whether this will make it easier or harder for 
these types of businesses to locate here, the law will just be more specific," 
said Lee Whittenberg, city director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attempt in crafting this ordinance is to keep those kinds of businesses 
as far away from the residential neighborhoods as possible. It's basically 
prompted by a court decision," Whittenberg added. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, a federal district court judge ruled that dancers at an Anaheim 
nightclub had a constitutionally protected right to go topless. The judge 
upheld the city's right to regulate where such businesses are located, but he 
ruled that Anaheim's ordinance violated previous federal court decisions 
because it gave "excessive discretion" to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seal Beach, the council Monday night will vote on a proposed ordinance 
prohibiting adult entertainment businesses within 1,000 feet of a church, 
school or public park and within 400 feet of a residence.  
</P>
<P>
 It would also prohibit the businesses from being prominently located at some 
of the city's high-visibility shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the new ordinance was drafted out of concern for potential 
lawsuits because of the vagueness of current guidelines regarding adult 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no existing rules to tell what you can and cannot do," Mayor George 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown quickly pointed out that Seal Beach has received no formal request to 
open an adult entertainment business within city limits for more than five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't anticipate this is going to open Pandora's box," Brown said. "We're 
just doing what so many other cities have done. It's basically setting down the 
ground rules." RUSS LOAR

</P>
<P>
 The action is being taken because of the discovery of an oversight that 
omitted the conditions when the deed was transferred to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week agreed to have its legal department pursue the deed 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The city deeded the property to the county to develop the 106-acre park, which 
will be county-owned and maintained.  
</P>
<P>
 The park, on the southeast edge of the Bolsa Chica wetlands, is also known as 
Linear Park. The park will be a long narrow strip of land that connects Central 
Park to the oceanfront. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the council had requested that city officials examine the possibility 
of placing the deed restrictions requiring natural plants be placed at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the council inadvertently approved the deed transfer without any deed 
restrictions, and subsequently it was transferred to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dave Sullivan said that the apparent mistake was "just one of those 
unfortunate things."  
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said the deed restrictions should be pursued to restore public 
confidence.  
</P>
<P>
 He added that "people in the city would feel better if (the restrictions) were 
on there." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission in July approved development of the first, 
three-acre phase of the park. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; ANITA HILL MOVES TO COTTAGE HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anita Hill, the law professor whose charges of sexual harassment against 
then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas sparked a national debate, has moved 
to a remodeled cottage here. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who is on leave from the University of Oklahoma, has a contract with 
Doubleday to write two books -- her autobiography and a study of historical and 
contemporary sexual harassment.  
</P>
<P>
 A University of Oklahoma spokeswoman, Jerri Culpepper, said Friday that Hill 
has been on leave without pay since Aug. 16, and is expected back May 16, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill has been teaching at the university's Norman campus since 1986, Culpepper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since moving in this week, Hill has declined requests for interviews by news 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything to talk about," she said Thursday. "It's my policy not 
to grant interviews to newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill did not say why she moved to this community, but she joins a long list of 
writers and artists who have called this seaside village home. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, during televised testimony that riveted the nation, Hill charged that 
Thomas sexually harassed her while she worked for him at the U.S. Department of 
Education and later at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Senate subsequently confirmed Thomas, but Hill became a heroine to 
women's groups that have complained that women are not treated fairly in the 
workplace.BERT ELJERA

<P>
 The City Council has approved construction of the first portion of a 
32,000-square-foot community center, and ball fields for baseball, softball and 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.8-million project, at Camino del Avion and Alipaz Street, is being paid 
in part from a 1990 local bond measure.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the project should provide facilities for youth sports as 
well as seniors who have wanted the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer said he didn't view the decision as one that 
pitted seniors against youth.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; MAYOR PRO TEM TITLE RULED OFF BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city attorney ruled that Councilman Fred L. Barrera cannot list the title 
mayor pro tem as his occupation on the November ballot for the mayoral 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came after Councilwoman Joanne Coontz, Barrera's opponent in the 
mayor's race, had an attorney file a protest with the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera said he will challenge the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Elections Code states that candidates may only use the title of 
elective office won by a "vote of the people," City Atty. Robert Franks wrote 
in a Wednesday memo to the city clerk. Barrera was elected to his role of mayor 
pro tem by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera said he has hired an attorney to prepare a lawsuit to challenge 
Franks' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ruling has exceptions, and precedent has been set," Barrera said. Both 
Gene Beyer and Don Smith used the title on ballots when they ran for mayor, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera's campaign spokesman, David Hart, said his candidate has a strong 
claim to the title since Mayor Beyer has been almost consistently absent from 
council meetings because of ill health. 
</P>
<P>
 Franks said the city's legal staff had discussed those issues but had decided 
that the wording of the code was clear. Some 1991 amendments clarified the 
statute and would override the precedents Barrera cited, he said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; PAINTED TILES POINT TO PRIDE IN COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Michael Jacobs painted a picture of a school on a ceramic tile to 
show how proud he is of education in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 David Puga, 11, drew a picture of a Mexican flag, showing pride in his 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 And about 200 other children and teen-agers from La Habra and Buena Park 
painted their ideas of community pride on six-inch-square tiles as part of a 
community project aimed at combatting graffiti and inspiring pride in the 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The tile painting got underway after the project participants, mostly Boys & 
Girls Club and Job Training Partnership Act members from both cities, painted 
over graffiti on walls at La Bonita Park in La Habra and a vacant commercial 
building in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of tiles were painted, and organizers of the event hope to get city 
approval to place the tiles on walls at parks. The tiles will be glazed and 
made graffiti-proof so that if they are scribbled on, the markings can easily 
be washed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives kids pride in their community," said Kay Jacklin, La Habra's 
supervisor of community services. "The tiles will go up at a park and will 
express community pride. It becomes physical evidence that you have pride in 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The tiles in La Habra displayed pictures of the La Habra Boxing Club, the Boys 
& Girls Club, peace signs, a Raiders emblem, anti-gang, anti-crime and 
pro-environment messages and some of the names of the painters -- Johnny 
Lucero, Noelle, Ernie Jimenez, Remigio Garcia, Lucy Licona. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buena Park, similar themes were evident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a lot of good kids out there who really want to get involved in their 
community, and this project made them feel more community-oriented," said 
Barbara Baiz, the Buena Park Police Department's gang prevention adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Smith, 17, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned that if everyone works together, we can clean up the city 
quick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monique Perez, 13, said she is tired of the gang violence and graffiti she 
sees in her city and drew a picture of flowers and the word "peace" on it to 
promote peace in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Celia Orozco, 18, wrote her daughter's name on her tile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want everybody to know I'm proud of my daughter, and I'm proud of this 
city," she said.MIMI KO

Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure will extend from Penn Way to Santiago Avenue and will continue 
through Monday at 5 a.m. The road will be shut down again from midnight Aug. 27 
to 5 a.m. Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-ramps from 17th Street to the Santa Ana Freeway will remain open, but 
the off-ramps from the freeway will be closed. Pedestrians will be prohibited 
from traveling on 17th Street during the closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and merchants will probably hear some noise from the construction 
site, which will be illuminated by floodlights, according to a Caltrans news 
release.  
</P>
<P>
 Some vibrations from the work might also be felt, the statement said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; VOTE AGAIN DELAYED ON CLOTHESLINE BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial decision on whether to outlaw clotheslines again has been 
postponed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were scheduled to vote Thursday on a proposed ordinance that 
would, among other things, prohibit clotheslines on front and side yards 
visible from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 But after residents protested, the vote was postponed to Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council postponed the vote because residents said the 
ordinance was unfair to poor people and Latinos and would cause financial 
hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people signed a petition in opposition to the proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
 The city then revised the ordinance and by placing more restrictions on drying 
laundry outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 That outraged residents who said they were under the impression that the 
clothesline prohibition would be eliminated from the ordinance altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Some blamed Dorothy Rush, a community activist who has been battling with the 
city for years trying to get it to adopt a strong anti-blight ordinance, for 
instigating the clothesline controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she agrees with a portion of the ordinance that outlaws hanging 
laundry to dry on fences, trees and shrubs but opposes the clothesline 
prohibition. Even though she once was a strong advocate of the ordinance, Rush 
last week called it "totally ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they've tried to please Rush but can't seem to strike a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, eliminating the clothesline prohibition from the ordinance 
seriously will be considered, City Manager Lee Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're trying to do is solve the damn problem," he said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; FIREFIGHTERS TO COLLECT TELETHON DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters will collect donations for Jerry Lewis' Labor Day telethon 
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Harbor Boulevard and Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is called "Fill the Boot" because firefighters will be asking 
motorists to drop donations into a firefighter's boot. Firefighters nationwide 
will be conducting similar campaigns this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department expects to raise about $20,000 to contribute to the fight 
against muscular dystrophy, firefighter Bob Moore said. The Anaheim Fire 
Department has led all fire agencies in California in collecting for the 
telethon for the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret of their success?

<P>
 "We have a good attitude," Moore said. "But it's also a good street corner."

OFFICIALS URGE PREPARATION FOR WILDFIRE SEASON; EMERGENCIES: REPORT RECOMMENDS 
BETTER COMMUNICATIONS, TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT IN WAKE OF LAST YEAR'S BLAZES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While praising the swift and effective mutual aid response to last fall's 
series of devastating Southern California wildfires, government emergency 
officials issued a report Friday recommending 95 potentially costly 
communications, training and equipment improvements to battle blazes more 
effectively.  
</P>
<P>
 The state and local officials, speaking at a news conference in Malibu, also 
issued a warning that more fires the size of those that scorched Altadena, 
Malibu, and Laguna Beach remain a distinct possibility during the next three 
months in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year's fires did not cancel out the threat of more fires," said Chief 
Deputy Chief Stephen Sherrill of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. "They 
told us that the weather and brush conditions were in such a state that we're 
continuing to look at disastrous-type conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 48,000 acres and 37 homes already have burned this week in an 
arson-sparked blaze in rural San Luis Obispo County. But the traditional fire 
season in Southern California does not begin until September and continues 
through November, said Governor's Office of Emergency Services Director Richard 
Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a long way to go to get through it this year," Andrews said outside 
Malibu City Hall. "But there's still time to clear brush." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two-week series of fires that began Oct. 26 required the largest call for 
mutual aid since the system was set in place 44 years ago, according to the 
38-page report released by the Office of Emergency Services. More than 15,000 
firefighters and 1,500 fire engines were dispatched to battle 22 fires in six 
Southern California counties that consumed nearly 200,000 acres and 1,200 
structures, injured 62 people and left four dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said Friday that arrangements have recently been completed for a pair 
of National Guard firefighting planes based at Point Mugu Naval Air Station to 
be available for fire emergencies within 13 hours after state officials request 
them. Previously, it had taken 24 hours to equip and staff the C-130 cargo 
planes for fire duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the delay, the planes were inaccessible during the fast-spreading 
Altadena and Laguna Hills fires Oct. 27 in which several hundred homes were 
destroyed. However, the newly issued state report says that even if the planes 
had been more quickly activated, they probably would have been used to fight 
wildfires in Ventura County rather than the Altadena and Laguna Hills blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendations in the report include the use of satellite technology to 
improve radio communications in remote canyons and additional training for 
firefighters called in under mutual aid pacts who are not fully prepared or 
equipped to battle massive wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said he could not place a price tag on such improvements. However, Los 
Angeles City Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said the cost of satellite relay 
equipment alone could be in the tens of millions of dollars. That, said Manning 
and other officials at the news conference, compares to the estimated 
$1-billion loss in last year's fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The state report does not discuss whether the state would be better off 
purchasing or leasing CL-415 "Super Scooper" airplanes that can pick up 1,600 
gallons of water at a time and dump it, often within minutes, on wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Gov. Pete Wilson, citing the high cost, vetoed a bill that would have 
provided $1.8 million to test the Canadian-made aircraft. Andrews and Sherrill 
said Friday that county and state fire officials will meet early next week to 
discuss possible alternate funding sources, including the federal government or 
insurance companies, to help lease the plane for testing this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said the "Super Scooper" is "not a silver bullet" because it is of 
limited use in inland areas or at times when ocean waves are choppy. Also still 
unclear, he said, is whether it is worth buying one of the planes for $17 
million when the same amount would buy several smaller fixed-wing firefighting 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "the time has come for new tests of the 'Super Scooper' (to 
determine) what its potential and limitations may be," Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Malibu Mayor Jeffrey W. Kramer, who hosted the news conference, 
said he was "a bit troubled" by the state's less than lightning pace in leasing 
or acquiring the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "It evinces a little bit of shortsightedness," Kramer said. The cost of these 
fires is enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other speakers at the news conference was state Department of 
Forestry Director Richard Wilson, who urged that about 1 million acres of 
woodland a year be cleared through cutting or controlled burns in order to 
reduce the potential for runaway wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a rather grim situation," Wilson said, "in that the dryness, the 
accumulated effect of drought, the build-up of fuels . . . makes the whole 
strategy of fire-fighting a more complicated business." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrill also called for stronger suppression measures, saying that it is 
extremely difficult to fight blazes fueled by 50-year-old brush, which shoots 
flames up to 200 feet high in narrow, remote canyons.  
</P>
<P>
 "In Malibu, everything was done that could be done," Sherrill said. "We faced 
an awesome, disastrous force, (including) 30 to 50 m.p.h. winds coming from 
four different directions."

MTA HALTS HOLLYWOOD SUBWAY TUNNELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints that subway construction is causing more damage than 
the January earthquake, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has 
indefinitely stopped tunneling beneath Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials could not say how long the project would be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The world-famous Walk of Fame has buckled and cracked along a stretch of 
Hollywood Boulevard near Hudson Avenue, and workers were hurriedly making plans 
to remove the stars of Carol Burnett, Fred MacMurray and other celebrities from 
sections of the damaged sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Storekeepers have complained about cracks in floors and walls, and the 
tunneling has caused the ground to subside up to nine inches. A movie theater 
was also forced to close after a water pipe broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the $1.5-billion second leg of the subway that eventually will connect 
Downtown Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley was suspended Thursday after an 
appeal from that neighborhood's City Council member, Jackie Goldberg. Earlier 
in the week, Goldberg chaired a meeting attended by about 100 residents and 
business owners complaining about the tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints are the latest problem to beset the subway project, which has 
been plagued by accusations of poor safety and accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Friday called on the MTA to immediately 
investigate the damage on Hollywood Boulevard and report its findings, 
including preparing a plan to prevent further damage before tunneling resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unthinkable to permit the MTA to continue without answers and a plan 
for future action to guarantee the safety of people and property along 
Hollywood Boulevard," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has called in a team of experts to evaluate construction techniques 
and safety procedures. Tunneling was stopped for several months last year 
because of flooding and again for three weeks in March because of a 
construction accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ordered a halt to tunneling because the contractor was experiencing 
greater-than-anticipated ground settlement" at Hollywood Boulevard and Hudson 
Street, MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin White said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the problem is loosely packed, sandy soil. The tunneling has 
served to "compact this area of loose, sandy soils and caused then a 
corresponding subsidence at the surface," MTA spokesman Bill Heard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials contend the situation has stabilized. But the contractor is 
installing additional support columns to the tunnel liner until the cause of 
the settlement has been determined.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an MTA worker was assigned to Hollywood Boulevard to begin taking 
claims for damages from business owners and residents. Tunneling in the problem 
area has been completed and the giant boring machines are sitting idle west of 
Hollywood and Hudson, officials said.

D.A. PROBES DISAPPEARANCE OF STUDENT ACTIVITY FUNDS; EDUCATION: UP TO $100,000 
IS MISSING FROM EL RANCHO HIGH SCHOOL IN PICO RIVERA. HOME OF THE FORMER 
BOOKKEEPER, WHO IS NOW A BOARD MEMBER, IS SEARCHED.

<P>
 The district attorney's office is investigating the disappearance of as much 
as $100,000 from student activity funds at a Pico Rivera high school, and has 
searched the home of a school board member who once worked as the school's 
bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities searched the home of board member Eleanor C. Cole this week, said 
Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. She would not 
elaborate, and Cole declined to comment. Cole resigned as bookkeeper in 
November after she was elected to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials contacted authorities after auditors discovered that 
student activity funds were missing at El Rancho High School. Auditors found 
that receipts were made out to students who paid for such items as gym clothes, 
prom photographs and lost identification cards, but there was no record that 
the money was deposited.  
</P>
<P>
 Auditors estimated that $25,000 to $100,000 disappeared in the 1992-93 school 
year. The audit, conducted by an accounting firm, advised El Rancho Unified 
School District officials to contact outside authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members and administrators refused to comment on the audit. John 
T. Sherman, former district superintendent, said he contacted the district 
attorney's office in November at the school board's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors said they found shoddy bookkeeping and inadequate controls over how 
officials handled student activity funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees apparently were extremely lax about depositing cash, waiting months 
after the money was collected before making a deposit, according to the audit. 
At one point, as much as $47,000 had been collected but not deposited.  
</P>
<P>
 "The delaying of deposits increases the possibility that funds may be 
misappropriated or unaccounted for," the audit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some records that should have been kept by the school were also missing, 
including books that showed how much cash had been collected from students. 
About 105 receipt books were missing, making it impossible to track the flow of 
money in the student activity fund, according to the report.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Student activities apparently were not affected by the losses because the 
district dipped into other funds to cover shortfalls, auditors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators were faulted for not instituting controls, such as dividing the 
duties of the bookkeeper in charge of student activity funds with other school 
officials. The bookkeeper had the sole responsibility for signing checks, 
depositing money and reviewing bank statements, making it difficult for errors 
to be caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the problems were discovered, the district's central office took 
over bookkeeping at the high school, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Supt. Anne Eichman would not comment on the district attorney's 
investigation. But she said the district tightened bookkeeping practices at all 
schools and in the central office about two years ago, after county education 
officials found problems in the district's bookkeeping records. She would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got more checks and balances built in," Eichman said. "We are now 
following correct procedures."

Rivera.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HOSPITAL TO OFFER FIRST AID CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several classes in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation will be offered 
over the next few months at Anaheim General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes are being sponsored by LifeLine CPR, a private medical training 
firm that is associated with the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic first aid training courses will be held on Sept. 17, Oct. 8 and Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The courses will look at methods for treating shock, bleeding, broken bones, 
exposure to heat or cold as well as neck and back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will also learn basic CPR skills and how to deal with adults with 
obstructed air passages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help (people) make a difference in . . . stabilizing patients 
before medical professionals arrive," said Marla Chappelear, a nurse who runs 
the LifeLine program. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a key part of the program deals with evaluating emergency situations 
before taking action. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many times, rescuers become victims themselves because they go into 
dangerous situations," Chappelear said. 
</P>
<P>
 More advanced CPR classes as well as first-aid training for children are also 
available.  
</P>
<P>
 The classes are taught by nurses and emergency medical technicians who have 
been certified by the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for the classes vary from about $15 to $35. For more information, call

ANAHEIM EXPECTED TO KEEP CONTROL OF 2 GOLF COURSES; PRIVATIZATION: PROPOSAL BY 
COMPANY TO TAKE OVER LINKS SEEMS HEADED FOR DEFEAT AS A CONSULTANT'S REPORT 
SWAYS COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial proposal to privatize the operation of the city's two 
municipal golf courses is expected to go down in defeat Tuesday, ending an 
emotional debate that has raged for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly and Councilman Irv Pickler, who had favored the idea, said 
Friday that they intend to vote against the proposal by American Golf Corp. to 
operate H.G. (Dad) Miller and Anaheim Hills golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, I see no long-term benefit in accepting the private offer," 
Daly said. "The offer on the table is good, but not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 American Golf's proposal to operate golf courses would bring an estimated 
$85,000 to city coffers annually for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The private contractor would make about $2 million worth of improvements to 
the irrigation systems at the courses and would pay rent of $1.6 million per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Fred Hunter and Bob Simpson have opposed the move, while Daly, 
Pickler and Councilman Frank Feldhaus have favored it. Feldhaus could not be 
reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council postponed a vote on the issue on Tuesday to give the city's Budget 
Advisory Commission a chance to review an independent report by KPMG Peat 
Marwick Management Consultants on the pros and cons of the idea. On Thursday, 
the commission met and unanimously voted against it, chairwoman Shirley 
McCracken said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee agreed with city analysts, who said the financial benefits are 
minimal and do not justify the risk of losing control over the courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the independent report gave him and other council members their 
first chance to fairly evaluate the proposal. The study was ordered in June 
following conflicting testimony over how much revenue a private contractor 
could bring to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the cost-benefits study makes a convincing case that a private 
operator would probably increase the city's revenues in the short run but could 
limit the amount potential income in the long run," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to financial concerns, Pickler said he made his decision out of 
loyalty to the 25 full-time and 40 part-time workers at the golf courses who 
would no longer work for the city. Although American Golf has stated that those 
employees would be rehired, there is no guarantee that it would be at the same 
wage.

FOR INTERNEES, NEW LIFE TOOK ROOT IN FARM COMMUNITY ; HISTORY: A CENTER WILL 
COMMEMORATE THOUSANDS WHO CAME TO SEABROOK, N.J., AFTER THEIR RELEASE FROM 
WORLD WAR II DETENTION CAMPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of World War II, thousands of Japanese Americans freed from 
detention camps came to this farming village in southern New Jersey hoping to 
rebuild their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some left after earning enough money at a large vegetable farm and packing 
plant to move back to the West Coast. But several hundred remained and left a 
lasting mark on this bucolic community about 36 miles south of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, about 500 Japanese Americans still live here and they want 
their migration remembered. They are working to establish a museum and research 
facility to chronicle one of the ugliest chapters in U.S. history -- the 
detention of thousands of Japanese Americans after the Japanese attack on Pearl 
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seabrook Educational and Cultural Center, scheduled to open in October, 
will commemorate the flight here by more than 2,500 internees who were freed 
from detention camps in the South and West in 1944 and 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is that we don't want the same thing to happen to any 
other person," said John Fuyuume, the cultural center's project director. "We 
don't want them to be incarcerated for prejudicial reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese Americans were lured here by industrialist Charles F. Seabrook, 
who was seeking a labor force for his vegetable farming and packing operation, 
Seabrook Farms, that filled huge government orders for the troops. Seabrook 
became the single largest employer of internees. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1944, Ellen Nakamura, then 25, traveled here from a detention camp 
in Jerome, Ark., where her family had been held for two years. The only woman 
and the youngest in a three-member relocation committee, she tried to assess 
how Japanese Americans would fare at Seabrook Farms. 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting Seabrook, Nakamura went from camp to camp persuading other 
internees to make the cross-country trek. She even had to persuade her fiancee, 
Kiyomi, promising to marry him only if he would agree to move to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura said the lush farmland in southern New Jersey was reminiscent of her 
native Tulare, Calif., where the family farmed vegetables before their 
detention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited. I couldn't tell enough about what I saw," recalled 
Nakamura, the first Japanese American woman to settle here. "We'd have a new 
start here." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple married in May, 1944, and a month later moved to Seabrook. 
Eventually, other family members relocated here too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there would be great potential for families," said Nakamura, who 
eventually moved from the government-built village to a 73-acre farm several 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura worked at Seabrook for nearly 40 years, first as a liaison between 
the company and the former internees and later in the housing department. Her 
late husband also worked briefly at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never regretted our decision," said Nakamura, 75, of Elmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural center, in the basement of Upper Deerfield Township Hall, will 
include hundreds of photographs, oral histories and artifacts, says Nakamura, 
its founder and chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 A reunion also slated for October is expected to draw former residents from 
across the country and a few from Japan. One former resident is building a 
replica of Seabrook Village to be displayed at the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders seldom talk about their internment experience, but want to preserve 
their history for posterity, Nakamura says. Too many of the younger Japanese 
Americans know little about their heritage, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Americans were stunned by the hysteria that swept the country after 
the attack on Pearl Harbor. About 120,000 -- the majority of them native-born 
American citizens -- were rounded up because of their Japanese ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only question we had was, 'How come? We're Americans' " recalled Fusa 
Kazaoka, 64, a retired telephone company worker who lives in Seabrook. "They 
were treating us like we were enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 An order signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt allowed the government to 
send Japanese Americans to internment camps. The government contended that they 
were a threat to national security and detained them, without trials or 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a lingering but seldom-voiced bitterness remains. Some former internees 
refuse to talk about their internment, saying the memory was still too painful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parents are the ones who suffered," said Rose Dodohara, 62, who was sent 
with her family to a Japanese internment camp in Texas in 1944. "For them it 
was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until nearly four decades later that the country tried to make 
amends. President Reagan signed legislation in 1988 granting an apology and 
$20,000 restitution to each of the estimated 60,000 living camp survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than nothing," said Kazaoka, who came to Seabrook in 1945 when 
she was 16 and still lives nearby with her 92-year-old mother. "It's a small 
price you get for everything you lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Hustled from their homes and farms, the Japanese Americans were transported by 
train to the detention camps. The shades were drawn and the passengers were 
guarded by military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the camp, hundreds of families were thrown together, living in a communal 
environment in cramped military-style quarters with little privacy. The remote 
and isolated camps were surrounded by barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1943, the government gave the approval for most of the internees to leave 
the camps if they had jobs and passed a loyalty test. Travel to the West Coast, 
however, was restricted until the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 families came here from the Jerome, Ark., camp alone. More came 
from camps in Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, Colorado and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The former internees welcomed a new start, although most came here with 
nothing but the clothes on their backs. Most had lost their land back in the 
West, as well as their belongings, which were either sold or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know where to go," said Mitsuko Omura, 75, who came here with her 
husband, children and several other relatives. "So we came here." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Seabrook persuaded the federal government to build 156 small 
apartments, a library, community center and dining hall. Each internee was 
given $25 and a railroad ticket from the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 They lived in cinder-block, barracks-style apartments in Seabrook Village -- 
where most remained until the 1960s and '70s. Here they began to build a sense 
of community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese Americans who remained in Seabrook became an integral part of the 
community, which today has about 6,800 residents. Their children excelled in 
academics and athletics at public schools, before leaving to seek better 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents traveled from house to house in the village celebrating traditional 
Japanese holidays. Recreational activities were held for youngsters at the 
village community center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a perfect place to grow up in," Kazaoka said. "It was a real safe, 
comfortable kind of place." 
</P>
<P>
 But the transition here was not easy and the work was hard at the Seabrook 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Seabrook provided lodging, lunch and utilities for six months to the newly 
freed Japanese Americans. In exchange, they had to agree to work in his 
processing plant and farm for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary was usually about 49 cents an hour for menial jobs at the plant. So 
they could take turns caring for their children, husbands and wives worked 
alternate shifts, harvesting crops in the fields or packing vegetables on the 
assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not an easy life," says Fuyuume of the culture center, who worked at 
the factory as a timekeeper supervisor. "Most families had to work 12 hours a 
day, seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak during and after the war, the plant employed 4,000 people who 
packed 100 million pounds of frozen, canned and dehydrated vegetables yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Japanese Americans worked at the plant until it closed in 1981. Others 
launched their own businesses nearby or pursued successful careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few former internees live in the graffiti-covered village, now a public 
housing project. The village bears little resemblance to the neatly kept 
complex described by former residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a Buddhist temple stands as one of the few visible reminders of the 
Japanese American migration to Seabrook. The temple began holding services in 
1945 in Seabrook Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped out the Japanese community," recalled Frances Ono, 72, of 
Bridgeton. "It held the people together." 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation -- members of the Jodo Shin sect -- is smaller today, with 
only about 100 members. Once comprised only of Japanese, the temple has about 
15 white members with a white priest at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the temple, located on a seven-acre site a few miles from its original 
spot, still serves as a center for spiritual, social and cultural activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an anchor," said the Rev. Rebecca MacDonald, the first non-Japanese 
and first woman priest at the temple. "It's been a very important part of the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The original Seabrook settlers struggle to keep customs and culture alive 
through celebrations such as the Obon Festival, held annually on the third 
Saturday in July to honor dead ancestors. An annual chow mein dinner sponsored 
by the Japanese-Americans Citizens League still draws hundreds of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The elders still speak Japanese, but most of their children did not learn the 
language. A young descendant of one former internee thought that her 
grandmother spoke Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things we try to keep up," Ono said. "Gradually, we're 
going to lose it."

 Roxane Dinkin was 42 when she discovered a lump in her neck. When her doctors

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Dinkin wondered if she would make it to 43.

 But as the shock waned and her survival instinct surged, Dinkin realized that 
to cope with the crisis she needed spiritual -- as well as medical -- healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I immediately made an appointment at the Jewish Healing Center," said Dinkin, 
a psychologist who lives in Marin County. "Their idea was to help me mobilize 
my own spiritual resources to deal with the cancer. And that, in turn, led me 
to a deeper degree of self-acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Healing Center is a service, education and resource center 
dedicated to meeting the spiritual needs of Jews living with chronic and acute 
illness. Established three years ago in San Francisco, the center provides its 
Bay Area clients with pastoral counseling, healing services, spiritual support 
groups, educational workshops and a hospice program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Begun on a shoestring budget by a small group of women rabbis, the center was 
initially expected to operate at the fringes of the mainstream Jewish 
community. But a deluge of individual and congregational interest has convinced 
organizers to open a national office in New York this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some observers, the center's appeal reflects a spiritual turn 
among American Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an expression of a broader movement that I call a return to 
spirituality in American Judaism," said Rabbi Neil Gillman, an associate 
professor of philosophy at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. "It's 
part of an attempt to reassert the balance between the intellectual dimensions 
of religion and the emotional and spiritual parts." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dinkin, whose cancer is now in remission, that balance was crucial. A 
convert to Judaism, she was already committed to Jewish learning. But her 
status as a cancer patient led her to ask how the tradition could help her 
accept the hardest lesson of her illness -- living completely in the present. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it," 
Dinkin said, quoting a psalm she used for meditation. "Cancer changed my 
orientation to life. You only have today." 
</P>
<P>
 Dinkin's "teacher" during her illness was Rabbi Nancy Flam, the center's West 
Coast director and one of its founders. Flam and several friends began 
discussing the Jewish approach to healing when they were in seminary. Flam had 
lived with the pain of her parents' divorce, another woman had breast cancer, a 
third was tending to a terminally ill spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to know what guidance and support Judaism had to offer," Flam said. 
"That's why the Jewish Healing Center is dedicated to examining Jewish texts 
and finding Jewish rituals that have healing power. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard Jews say they have found spirituality in 12-Steps or Esalen or 
Buddhist meditation," she said referring to Esalen, the New Age meditation 
center located in Northern California. "But why shouldn't Jews learn about and 
experience healing in a Jewish context?" 
</P>
<P>
 The center's dual emphasis on education and experience -- teaching what Jewish 
texts say about healing and sponsoring services, programs, and support groups 
-- has sparked similar efforts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington and San Francisco, congregations initiated programs for "bikkur 
holim," or visiting the sick. Synagogues in Dallas and Evanston, Ill., hold 
regular healing services. A conference on healing and the rabbinate, sponsored 
by the center in February, brought about 150 Jewish leaders together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these rabbis were very mainstream, and they want to integrate this 
stuff into their congregations," Flam said. "The experience of illness has 
catapulted congregants into exploring their spiritual lives. They are saying, 
'We are thirsty. We need sustenance."' 
</P>
<P>
 But this sustenance is not for everyone. Rabbi Morton Summer, of Yeshiva 
University in New York, said Orthodox Jews, with whom he works, are not part of 
the trend.

CIRCUIT PREACHERS STILL SPREAD THE WORD TO RURAL AREAS' FAITHFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Virginia Showalter spends her Sundays in small white churches and on 
miles of winding mountain roads in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Showalter, 52, is an old-fashioned circuit preacher, a Methodist minister 
tending to a flock of six churches and about 110 faithful in the mountains 
about 45 miles east of Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being on vacation here. We have fun. It's not work. God couldn't 
call me to do anything better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for these people to feel they are important," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ministers believe more circuit riders will return as people continue to 
move to cities, leaving many rural churches unable to afford a full-time 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Showalter is among 26,000 Methodist ministers who serve multiple churches, 
mostly in Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia, said Robert Kohler of the 
denomination's Division of Ordained Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Protestant denominations use circuit preachers. A handful of rabbis and 
Roman Catholic priests also travel circuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The life of a circuit preacher today is not as rough as when they rode 
horseback. Preachers then were on the road a year at a time. They seldom 
married and they often died young, Showalter said. Then, all the ministers were 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 Showalter spends her Sundays in her four-wheel-drive Subaru, which she usually 
lets her husband drive because, she said, it's easier than listening to him 
tell her what to do. They drive about 30,000 miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Sunday begins at 9 a.m. and ends about 12 hours later. She usually 
preaches two or three morning services and one evening service. In the 
afternoon, she visits parishioners and attends meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The membership at Showalter's six churches ranges from 10 to 32. Four are 
located within a 15-minute drive of Showalter's home, on winding, sometimes 
unpaved mountain roads. Two others are about a 20-minute drive from home in 
different directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two have running water. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to West Virginia, I had seven little churches with seven little 
outhouses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiritually, the churches have their own identities, which she keeps in mind 
when preparing her sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 She has a children's sermon when children are present. One church's service is 
liturgical, the others are more simple. Some have pianists, others don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Showalter spends most weekday evenings at church meetings and her days working 
on sermons or visiting parishioners. Although her seminary professors 
recommended visits of no more than 30 minutes, she often spends a day with 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
 Methodist leaders in West Virginia are considering the Rev. Leo Farley's 
proposal to merge or close churches with fewer than 12 members by 2000. Farley 
said large churches have supplemented the salaries of circuit ministers for 
some small churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a stewardship matter, stewardship of money and stewardship of 
resources," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think of the church as a business," Showalter said, "practicality 
would say close and merge. If you think of a church as a family, a community, 
you're hurting people (by closing a church). I don't think that's what the 
church should be about." 
</P>
<P>
 The church is often the center of the rural social life and sometimes a town's 
last public building, Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each community wants to retain its church," said Norma King of Russellville, 
who attends Showalter's Brackens Creek church. "It's like when we lost our post 
office, we lost our sense of identity. Each little church is our identity." 
</P>
<P>
 King and other members don't mind sharing a minister because that's the way 
it's always been. 
</P>
<P>
 Congregants still have the advantages of attending a large church by joining 
with other churches served by the same minister to sponsor youth events, food 
pantries, or choirs. For example, two of Showalter's churches recently gathered 
at a riverside to celebrate a baptism. 
</P>
<P>
 Showalter was an accountant in Connecticut before going into the ministry and 
moving to West Virginia eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She is ordained in the American Baptist and United Methodist churches, which 
helps her fit in rural West Virginia, where most churches are either Baptist or 
Methodist.

FEWER THAN HALF OF AMERICANS STAY IN PARENTS' DENOMINATION; AFFILIATIONS: 
SWITCHING IS MOST COMMON AMONG SUCH MAINLINE GROUPS AS PRESBYTERIANS, 
METHODISTS AND EPISCOPALIANS, RESEARCHERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religions News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In years past, church affiliation was passed down from generation to 
generation like a family heirloom, but as the 21st Century looms closer, fewer 
than one of every two Americans clings to the denomination of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The practice of switching faiths is rampant in contemporary America," 
conclude the authors of one recent study, "The Presbyterian Presence: The 
Twentieth-Century Experience" (Westminster/John Knox Press). 
</P>
<P>
 Only 43% of the American public remain in the religious body they were born 
into, according to that study. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer are the barriers separating different denominations strong enough 
to keep people from crossing over them," wrote Robert Wuthnow, a leading 
sociologist of religion at Princeton University, in "The Restructuring of 
American Religion" (Princeton University Press, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wuthnow: "An increasingly large number of people feel comfortable 
in switching from one denomination to another." 
</P>
<P>
 Denominational switching cuts across all faith groups but is most common among 
members of the historic "mainline" denominations that were traditionally the 
most visible churches in American culture -- Presbyterians, Episcopalians and 
Methodists, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Those churches hit hard times in the mid-1960s, when membership and financial 
support took a dramatic plunge, even as conservative evangelical, 
fundamentalist and Pentecostal churches began to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures cited by Wuthnow from the 1970s and early 1980s, 45% of 
worshipers brought up as Presbyterians are no longer Presbyterians. 
</P>
<P>
 For Methodists, the defection rate is 40%; Episcopalians, 38%; Baptists and 
Lutherans, about 25%; Jews, 15%, and Catholics, 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 When individuals or families switch denominations, it is usually not so much 
because of misgivings about church theology or social policies, studies show. 
Rather, it is because the ecumenical movement, stressing church unity, has 
erased many of the boundaries that historically distinguished one denomination 
from another. 
</P>
<P>
 "In congregations, people have accepted the ecumenical movement to mean that 
there is nothing essentially different among the various Christian churches -- 
in part because this is what mainstream Protestant churches have taught," 
according to "The Presbyterian Presence." 
</P>
<P>
 More than ever, Americans see religious life as an ecclesiastical delicatessen 
with a menu that includes not only the various Protestant denominations, which 
were predominant in the past, but also the Roman Catholic Church, new religious 
movements and others. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the case of congregations, such as the defection in Arlington, Tex., of 
St. Mary the Virgin Episcopal Church to Catholicism, it is precisely that 
dilution of denominational distinctiveness -- and the dissatisfaction with it 
-- that often prompts a switch. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the most visible and acrimonious en masse defections, the wholesale 
flight of congregations in Mississippi from the liberal Presbyterian Church 
(U.S.A.) -- which has about 11,500 congregations nationwide -- left the 
denomination "a shadow of its former self" in that state, according to "The 
Presbyterian Presence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, during the eight-year period 1983-90, a total of 93 congregations 
left the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), virtually all to join the more 
conservative Presbyterian Church in America or Evangelical Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, 22 of the denomination's about 
11,000 congregations withdrew between 1990 and 1993. Eighteen of those 
affiliated with other denominations -- almost all to more conservative Lutheran 
bodies -- and four went independent. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the loss of congregations came in the years after controversial 
mergers that created the 5.2-million-member ELCA and 2.8-million-member PCUSA. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the more liberal Protestant mainline denominations such as the 
ELCA, PCUSA, Episcopal Church and United Church of Christ are more likely to 
switch denominations than their more conservative Protestant counterparts or 
Roman Catholics, according to studies of denominational switching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the liberal denominations attract more members from other churches -- 
including conservative churches -- than they lose, according to comprehensive 
studies by Wade Clark Roof and William McKinney, who documented their findings 
in "American Mainline Religion: Its Changing Shape and Future" (Rutgers 
University Press, 1987). 
</P>
<P>
 But switchers to liberal Protestant denominations tend to be older and less 
active than people who switch into the more conservative churches. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the liberal, mainline churches have lost substantial numbers of 
members to the "no religious affiliation" category. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of "Vanishing Boundaries: The Religion of Mainline Protestant Baby 
Boomers" (Westminster/John Knox Press, 1994) suggest that the key to the health 
of the mainline Protestant churches lies not in the regional and national 
denominational structures but, rather, in the local churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individual ministries and churches, learning from successes elsewhere and 
adapting them to their own particular settings, hold out the greatest promise 
for the future of the mainline churches," the authors concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 They acknowledge, too, that recovery of a voice of authority in the churches 
is a necessary component to any mainline resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 But an emphasis on doctrinal authority is likely to create only further 
dissent and splits, according to the authors. More fertile territory, they 
suggest, is in the moral arena, where the churches could "emphasize thoughtful 
and responsible Christian moral living in 20th and 21st century America."

CYCLISTS USE PACK MENTALITY TO MAKE A POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 Clad in spandex, plastic helmets clasped under their chins, two dozen 
bicyclists rode Beach Boulevard Friday in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they carried no signs and sang no slogans, the demonstrators were 
united in purpose: to remind motorists of cyclists' rights on the road. And so 
they rode through rush-hour traffic, side by side, up and down the 
construction-clogged boulevard, as bewildered drivers slowed and swerved, 
leaving the riders a lane to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 There were bicycle commuters and high-speed racers, beach-going cruisers and 
even a tandem bike with couple in matching fuschia shirts patterned with lemons 
and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't own a car; this is the way I get around," said Mike Mott, a Midway 
City engineer who, like several of the other riders Friday, commutes daily on 
two wheels to McDonnell Douglas. "I just want to have fun and let the motorists 
know that we have the right to the road. We're vehicles too."  
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after San Francisco's "Critical Mass," a monthly event in which as 
many as 1,500 cyclists cram downtown streets, blocking traffic for hours, 
Friday's was Orange County's second bike-in. The inaugural event last month 
drew seven riders. Participants in the loosely organized ride Friday promised 
an even bigger show next time. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the cyclists complain that there are too few bike-only lanes in 
Orange County. More specifically, they are upset with the reconfiguring of 
Beach Boulevard into four lanes -- lanes too narrow for a cyclist to share 
safely with a wide car. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the cyclists took over the right lane of Beach as they cruised from 
Edinger Avenue down to Garfield Avenue and back. Most drivers simply avoided 
them, although when they crossed three lanes of traffic to make their left 
turns, one person made an obscene gesture and another called out something 
crude. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right! Way to go everybody," Mott called out as the crowd rejoined at a 
strip mall parking lot after being split up several times by traffic. "Way to 
go, everybody safe and sound! I had a ball!"

LOVER'S LEAPS; ARMY SKY DIVER FINDS SPORT CAN UNITE A COUPLE AND KEEP THEM

 If you think you have troubles with long-distance relationships, consider 
Trevor McCarthy. He had to leap from a plane at 12,500 feet Friday to drop in 
on his wife in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A corporal with the Army's Golden Knights Parachute Team, McCarthy is 
stationed at Ft. Bragg, N.C., but will perform with the team this weekend at 
the Van Nuys Airport Expo. 
</P>
<P>
 During a practice jump Friday from an Air Force C-130 cargo plane above the 
San Fernando Valley, McCarthy and his 10 comrades reflected on a lifestyle 
where 200 m.p.h free falls are less traumatic than missing a weekend with a 
loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We travel about 300 days a year," McCarthy said of the team, which will 
perform at 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the annual Van Nuys air 
show. "It's pretty rare that I get to see my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the romance of parachuting that literally swept his wife, 
Katherine, off her feet. The 22-year-old real estate agent met her future 
husband in 1991, when he became her sky-diving instructor at a civilian school 
in Perris. 
</P>
<P>
 Following their marriage, he joined the Army in 1992 in order to try out for a 
three-year berth on the elite parachuting team, which performs at air shows and 
competitions around the country. Now the couple hook up only on leave or when 
his drop zone is nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the occasional loneliness, it is a lifestyle McCarthy would not trade 
for anything, even though there are many who wonder why someone would jump out 
of a plane for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sport, like skiing or surfing," said McCarthy, who competed for six 
weeks in Yuma, Ariz., before he was accepted on the team. Only about eight of 
50 applicants made it to the team of 83 men and women, who travel together at 
various times. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before making his 2,079th jump Friday, McCarthy called the experience 
"like riding a roller-coaster 2,000 times." 
</P>
<P>
 Routinely risking their lives does not make them feel closer to death, said 
Sgt. Gary Winkler of Deerfield, Fla., the team leader. At 35, he said, jumping 
actually makes him feel younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blows the wrinkles back." Not that sky-diving is always this lighthearted. 
The dangers are real enough to make newcomers superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people first start jumping, they tend to wear the same flight suit, 
helmet or underwear," said McCarthy. "Then you realize there is nothing 
otherworldly about it. It's just physics." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there is more to it than just physics. 
</P>
<P>
 As the plane climbed to jump altitude, Winkler tossed a black-and-gold marker 
out the yawning rear cargo door to gauge the winds that would influence their 
descent to the drop zone on the airport. Falling at 16 feet per second, the 
streamer would still be aloft long after the jumpers, racing earthward at 176 
feet per second before their chutes opened, touched terra firma. 
</P>
<P>
 Climbing to 12,500 feet, an altitude from where Catalina Island can be seen as 
a baseball diamond on the horizon, Winkler signaled his team into position. 
Then, with a shout, the nine men and two women hurtled into space, yanking the 
cords that set off red smoke grenades attached to their boots that marked their 
trail through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Plunging to earth at speeds between 120 and 200 m.p.h., the group plummets 
10,000 feet in 65 seconds before popping the chutes. This is enough air time to 
create three patterns: a star, a diamond and a bomb burst -- all visible from 
the ground because of the crimson smoke trailing each jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hardest part of the job still awaits -- repacking the 265-square-foot 
nylon chutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like making your bed," said Sgt. Steve Baker, 30, of Fort Worth, Tex. 
"You hate doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's about all McCarthy and his teammates hate about the job. They only 
have three years to enjoy it, after all, before they must return to their 
regular Army duties, as everything from Army medics to photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, McCarthy will be condemned to the ground as an infantryman when 
his Knighthood ends. Perhaps that explains what he plans to do with his time 
off with his wife this weekend.

WARNING SHOT INADVERTENTLY KILLS BOY, 14; INQUIRY: RANCHER IS ARRESTED. 
AUTHORITIES SAY HE WAS TRYING TO SEND A SIGNAL TO TEEN-AGERS TAMPERING WITH HIS 
CAR.

<P>
 A wheelchair-bound Acton man who fired a warning shot when he saw two 
teen-agers tampering with his car Thursday night inadvertently killed a third 
youth he did not see, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a heart-breaking twist, friends say the rancher, Malcom McWilliams, 52, 
only wanted to get the boys' attention so that he could tell them about a 
recent joy-riding accident that killed one of his granddaughters and gravely 
injured another. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought he was doing a good deed," said Cindy Giles, who lives in a 
trailer on the ranch. "He never saw the third kid." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested early Friday, McWilliams was "very cooperative and very 
upset about the shooting," said Sheriff's Deputy Benita Hinojos. 
</P>
<P>
 He was booked into a jail ward at County-USC Medical Center on suspicion of 
involuntary manslaughter. The district attorney's office will decide whether 
criminal charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams remained in custody Friday in lieu of $15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said McWilliams was the grandfather of JoKema Du Bois, 15, of Santa 
Clarita, who took her grandmother's car without permission June 1 to attend a 
church youth group meeting. When the car crashed, JoKema and two of her 
passengers were killed. Two other girls were injured, including JoKema's 
14-year-old sister Barbara.  
</P>
<P>
 Malcom McWilliams is divorced from Mary McWilliams, who was raising the 
sisters, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday night's incident, McWilliams is accused of fatally wounding 
Ernesto Luis Pedraza, 14, of Apple Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto and two friends were staying at the Thousand Trails campground in 
Acton when they decided to hike down Bootlegger Canyon Road to steal 
McWilliams' Chevette, Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 8 p.m., McWilliams heard someone tampering with his car, which was 
parked about 100 feet from his house. When he went outside, he saw two people 
trying to start the Chevette, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 From his patio, McWilliams fired one shot from a carbine rifle into an 
abandoned vehicle next to the Chevette. 
</P>
<P>
 "McWilliams did not fire into the air because he did not want anyone to be 
injured," Hinojos said. "However, McWilliams did not know that a third boy was 
hiding behind the abandoned vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 The warning shot went through the abandoned vehicle and struck Ernesto, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaware that Ernesto had been shot, McWilliams detained one of the boys at 
gunpoint and summoned sheriff's deputies. The other youth fled.  
</P>
<P>
 When deputies took the youth who had been detained by McWilliams back to the 
campground, Ernesto's guardians asked where he was, Hinojos said. The youth 
replied that his friend had been shot. Deputies found the boy's body behind the 
abandoned car about two hours later, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams' neighbor, Giles, said McWilliams had been despondent in recent 
months over the accident involving his granddaughters. She said he fired the 
warning shot because he wanted to deliver a stern lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted these boys to stand still, so he could tell them about JoKema and 
Barbara and how joy-riding was dangerous," Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor, who went to McWilliams' house after hearing the gunshot, said 
the rancher was unaware that his warning shot had killed Ernesto until the 
boy's body was found at about 12:15 a.m. Friday. "The fact that he shot this 
kid just really upset him," Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Conrad, 70, of Watts, said he has leased the rugged 80-acre ranch to 
McWilliams for the last 25 years. Conrad said he believes McWilliams was 
paralyzed from the waist down from a bullet wound, but said the rancher doesn't 
discuss his disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, McWilliams has raised horses and exotic animals such as 
ostriches at the ranch, Conrad said. At one point, he built an Old West movie 
set at the ranch but was unable to attract filmmakers, the owner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside his house, McWilliams has collected photographs of John Wayne and 
cowboy-related memorabilia. He also displayed awards received for his efforts 
as an auctioneer and square-dance caller. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, McWilliams has developed medical problems that took him away 
from the ranch for long periods and left his property vulnerable to theft, 
Conrad said. The accident involving his granddaughters added to his woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became a basket case," Conrad said. "I've been coming up once a week to 
talk to him and hold his hand."

ELECTIONS / L.A. CITY COUNCIL; YAROSLAVSKY, FEUER CLAIM OVERLAPPING 
CONSTITUENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky's decision to run for the Los Angeles City Council has 
already sparked soul-searching in liberal Jewish political circles on the 
Westside as activists decide between her candidacy and that of Michael Feuer, 
head of a highly regarded legal-services program for the disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political observers have even speculated that it will soon be evident 
either to Yaroslavsky, 47 -- who is hoping to succeed her husband, Zev -- or to 
Feuer that their constituency is not big enough to support both and that one of 
them will have to bow out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some would bet that Barbara Yaroslavsky, wife of a popular, 19-year 
veteran of Westside politics, is more likely to survive in this hothouse 
political environment, others are not sure Feuer will bend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's in the race to stay, but there's no question that she has done 
him damage," said consultant Steve Afriat. "If I were him, I'd try to branch 
out and appeal to Valley voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Feuer acknowledged that the road ahead has been made tougher by Yaroslavsky's 
decision. "But I like to take on challenges," he said. "I'm in this race to 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
 "People have remained very supportive," Feuer added Friday, a day after 
Yaroslavsky confirmed her entry into the campaign for the 5th District seat. "I 
was at a charity event last night (for a Westside poverty-law firm) and people 
were encouraging me to stick it out. The message to me is that if the 
electorate will focus on the merits of the candidates, I can win. My challenge 
is to get the voters to stay focused that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Yaroslavsky said she has been heartened by the "phenomenally 
positive response" to the news that she had decided to run. Nor does it worry 
her, she said, that Feuer's Westside support has not faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good," Yaroslavsky said. "They should stick to their commitments. But 
there's enough people to go around for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that former Los Angeles Board of Education member Roberta 
Weintraub, who is already in the race, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Leah Purwin 
D'Agostino, who is all but in the race, are likely to find their heaviest 
support among moderates. Others with their hats in the ring include Jeff Brain, 
a San Fernando Valley realtor; Bill Christopher, a Westside community activist, 
and Ryan Snyder, a transportation activist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, the 36-year-old Feuer has been executive director of Bet-Tzedek 
Legal Services, a platform that also helped spawn the political career of state 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood). 
</P>
<P>
 During Feuer's tenure, one of Bet-Tzedek's most serious challenges has been to 
survive financially as the government grants it once relied on have shrunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapting to leaner times, the agency has launched annual -- and increasingly 
successful -- campaigns to raise private donations. Now more than one-third of 
Bet-Tzedek's $2.9-million budget comes from private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agency's board members are essential to Bet-Tzedek's financial 
strength, Feuer has been a key player in major decisions, including the 
selection of board members with more corporate experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Bet-Tzedek provides legal services to poor, disabled and elderly clients. It 
also has made a name for itself providing legal aid to Holocaust survivors, 
victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake and small-business owners hurt by the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Feuer has used his access to political activists and contributors as the 
launching pad for his quest for public office. Virtually the entire Bet-Tzedek 
board of directors -- about 35 strong -- have endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements filed with the Los Angeles Ethics Commission in July, Feuer 
reported raising more than $60,000 for his campaign, making him the race's 
early financial leader. Critics, however, point out that half of Feuer's 
reported war chest consists of pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see how much of those pledges are paid now that Barbara is in the 
race," said one Yaroslavsky partisan, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as it became increasingly evident that Barbara Yaroslavsky would run, 
Feuer has shown staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, for example, a letter went out to hundreds of Westside Jewish 
leaders -- many of them lifted from Zev Yaroslavsky's lists of supporters -- 
urging them to back Feuer as the "tireless crusader" for the disadvantaged 
clients of Bet-Tzedek and a man of "impeccable integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 It was signed by several well-known Jewish liberals, including Bruce Corwin, 
president of Metropolitan Theatres, attorneys Lisa Specht and Ed Sanders, and 
community activist Marcia Volpert. 
</P>
<P>
 That these people would step up to the plate in the face of Barbara 
Yaroslavsky's impending move was a good sign for Feuer, according to some 
observers. Their presence in Feuer's camp also points to some of the rift lines 
in the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corwin, for example, is president of Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, where 
Barbara Yaroslavsky is a member of the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbara is a very good friend of mine," said Corwin, a veteran of Democratic 
politics. "But Michael is an extraordinary person." 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbara's entry won't affect me," said Volpert, recently the chairwoman of 
the Jewish Federation Council's high-profile Community Relations Committee and 
current member of Mayor Richard Riordan's Water and Power Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it will make it a more difficult campaign for Michael," said Volpert, a 
Sherman Oaks resident. "If you take the knee-jerk view that both are leaders in 
the Jewish community, then maybe it looks like the choice (is difficult). But 
there is a difference. Michael has a record of running a major organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Marcia Herman of Brentwood, co-founder of the Women's Political 
Committee, feel a tug at their convictions in the emerging 5th District race. 
"I've known Barbara for years as a friend," said Herman, who is a member of 
Bet-Tzedek's board. But friendship aside, Herman is backing Feuer.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND; OWNERS HOPE TO SAVE STERLING'S FROM RAZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sterling's, a landmark restaurant and one of the key meeting places in the 
mountain community of Sunland, may have to be torn down because of earthquake 
damage. But its owners are doing their best to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sent letters to everyone I can think of," said Al Jesensky, co-owner of 
the restaurant, which opened in 1938 and specializes in pan-fried chicken and 
steaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Caputo is the other co-owner of the restaurant, which has been closed 
since the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were starting to make a comeback when Jan. 17 hit," Jesensky said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said business had dropped off in recent years, mainly because Lockheed 
Corp. has pulled most of its operations out of Burbank, taking many big dinners 
and banquet functions with it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Jan. 17 quake buckled floors, cracked walls and separated the walk-in 
freezer and refrigerator from the walls, the restaurant was in default on a 
loan from the Small Business Administration. That is why SBA officials turned 
down their loan application, even though Sterling's sustained $300,000 in quake 
damage, Jesensky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying that if we had a second chance we could pay both off," Jesensky 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the restaurant could reopen in time for the Christmas season, it would have 
a better chance of survival, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a tougher deadline looms over the owners' heads. On July 1, the Los 
Angeles City Department of Building and Safety issued a notice giving 
Sterling's 90 days to be repaired. If the restaurant does not comply with the 
order by the end of September, it could be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesensky said he needs more time because he is trying to appeal the SBA's 
denial of his loan. But, he said, city officials will not consider an extension 
of that deadline until the 90 days have elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to use public sentiment to sway the officials, Sterling's started a 
petition drive two weeks ago. Petitions will be presented to city officials in 
September to ask for help in sparing the restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 Sterling's supporters also have contacted Councilman Joel Wachs and state 
Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) to ask for help. Jesensky said he has 
written to a variety of federal officials -- including President Bill Clinton 
-- to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so frustrating because on the whole, FEMA (the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency) and the SBA have been relatively good in helping us with 
most of the people who contact us with a problem," said Arline DeSanctis, 
Wachs' chief field deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, Wachs' office has resolved problems by working out communications 
problems between loan applicants and state and federal officials, she said. In 
this case, Wachs has written James Lee Witt, FEMA's director, a letter dated 
Aug. 8 to ask him to investigate the matter. Witt has not yet responded to the 
request, DeSanctis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had many letters from people in the community about this," DeSanctis 
said, adding that local chambers of commerce had been appealing for help to 
save the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community has felt they have suffered a great loss," said DeSanctis, 
adding that she also liked the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was delightful," she said. "It sort of reflected the rural 
atmosphere of Sunland-Tujunga." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was also a central part of life in this community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the only meeting place where you can have banquets and meetings 
in town," said Jim Mertzel, the former head of the Sunland-Tujunga Coordinating 
Council. "When something has been there as long as that I guess it does have 
sentimental value." ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COUNCIL MAY REVIEW CUT IN QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Council members from the San Fernando Valley may get a second 
chance to vote on a proposal that seeks to cut more than $8 million in aid to 
replace quake-damaged housing, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A dispute on the matter arose earlier this week when the council voted to 
allocate $47 million in redevelopment money to build and repair the city's 
housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Richard Alarcon had offered a plan to 
set aside $23 million of the funds for quake-damaged housing. But the plan lost 
on a 6-6 vote, with Yaroslavsky and Valley Councilmen Hal Bernson and Joel 
Wachs absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The council instead approved an alternative plan by Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas to set aside $14.7 million for quake-damaged areas -- $8.3 
million less than previously proposed -- and to designate $14 million for areas 
damaged by the 1992 riots. The remaining $18.3 million would go into a pool for 
housing projects citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley council members who were absent were furious, saying the vote should 
have been delayed until they were all present. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Ridley-Thomas and Alarcon introduced a motion that would allow the 
council to vote Tuesday on whether to reconsider the item. At least 10 of the 
15 council members must vote to reconsider the item before a second vote is 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council votes to reconsider the matter, a final decision will be made 
Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased the City Council will now have the opportunity to look at the 
entire matter in order to make the best decision for the city of Los Angeles," 
Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas, who represents some of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the 
1992 riots, said Friday that he has no objections to bringing the matter to 
another vote. He said his only objection was to delaying the allocation of the 
money. HUGO MARTIN

 It's time for schoolchildren to roll up their sleeves and grit their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for the looming math problems and reading quizzes, but for the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 As the start of school nears for thousands of kindergartners and other new 
students across the county, the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services is urging parents to take advantage of its free immunizations to 
prepare students for strict school requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools have a policy that says, 'no shots, no school,' " said Dr. 
Shirley Fannin, director of disease control programs for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren are required to have at least four DTP diphtheria, tetanus and 
pertussis or whooping cough -- shots, three doses of oral polio vaccine and one 
combined shot of measles, mumps and rubella. In addition, children entering 
school for the first time must have a skin test for tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The county health centers immunize about 50% of the children entering school 
every year at their 40 immunization clinics and health centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin said immunization efforts since the late 1970s have dramatically slowed 
the spread of childhood diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once upon a time," she said, "the schools were notorious as a major source of 
spreading disease. Now, just a small proportion of our cases are school-age 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 For the location of county immunization clinics and health centers, call 
(800)427-8700. SUSAN BYRNES

 Valley College is seeking help from the public in recovering 29 Italian 
cypress trees that were stolen from school grounds over the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is public property; these are taxpayers' dollars, and so this basically 
is a theft from the community," college President Tyree Wieder said."I'm 
disappointed in my fellow citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials believe the trees, worth about $150 each, were stolen by 
someone who plans to sell them, said Roger Baehne, the school's principal 
gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 The bases of the trees are painted an orange color, which would make them easy 
to spot, said Baehne, who urged anyone seeing the trees to report it to the 
police. They also can call the school at (818) 781-1200, Ext. 301. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees, 10 to 12 feet high, had only been in the ground about a year and 
the root systems had not yet established themselves, Baehne said. The root 
systems had been removed along with the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that they weighed 200 pounds each after they were removed from 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to be either one very strong person, or two people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first theft, Baehne said, 15 trees were taken Monday night or Tuesday 
morning. In the latest theft, he said, 14 trees were taken either Thursday 
night or Friday morning from a landscaped strip behind the stadium near 
Hatteras Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The school started painting the bases of the trees after nine cypresses were 
stolen about five years ago, Baehne said. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; THIS PUMPKIN IS NOT YOUR GARDEN-VARIETY 
</P>

<P>
 While Doris Matthews' giant pumpkin is a mere cucumber in the eyes of the 
Guinness Book of Records folks, at 74 inches in circumference this is not a 
squash to sneeze at. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tone worthy of a supermarket tabloid headline, Matthews tells the story 
of how the half-dead seedling that fell into her brother's kitchen sink during 
the earthquake was tenderly replanted in the soil of her Reseda back yard. And 
it just keeps growing. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shaking stopped on Jan. 17, Leland Fry of Northridge surveyed his 
home for damages. He walked into his kitchen to find a mess of dishes strewn 
across the floor -- which didn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 What did worry Fry was that his two prize pumpkin seedlings had spilled from 
the window sill into his kitchen sink. One was too far gone to save; the other 
was just barely hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to nurse it for several months until it was healthy enough to go into 
my sister's garden," Fry said. "We planted the seedling in May and it was 5 
inches tall, but afterward it seemed to grow an inch or two every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The pumpkin now weighs in at 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big pumpkin," said Randy Mineo of Chatsworth Nursery. "It is unusual 
for one that size to grow in someone's back yard. I certainly tip my hat to 
them, but it's nowhere near record size." 
</P>
<P>
 Mineo, who once had a 285-pound pumpkin on display in his store, was moved to 
find out that the largest pumpkin ever recorded weighed in at 816 pounds and 
was grown in Wrightstown, N. J. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is Matthews going to do with her sizable squash? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, she hopes it lasts on the vine until Halloween and then there may be 
pumpkin pies in store for the whole neighborhood. ANTONIO OLIVO

 Spanish explorers were in Burbank last week. They were among the 17 images 
engraved in a 20-by-16-foot concrete sculpture unveiled on the corner of 3rd 
and Angeleno streets. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 people attended a dedication ceremony Thursday, including Burbank 
Mayor Bill Williams and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The free-standing work, titled "Burbank Evolves," is formed of three adjoining 
concrete walls that depict the city's history. Indians, Spanish explorers and 
railroad cars are among the images engraved in the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Sheets created the piece in six weeks. The cost of the project was 
$27,000, funded by the city's Art in Public Places Ordinance. The ordinance 
requires all new commercial, industrial or public projects costing more than 
$500,000 to spend at least 1% of their budget for public art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank Evolves" is part of the Burbank Courthouse parking structure built in 
May. It is the fifth piece the city has completed since the ordinance was 
adopted in 1992. ALICIA DOYLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DOCTOR TAKES SOCIAL CAUSE TO WOODSTOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While 500,000 people were smearing themselves with mud, practicing the hippie 
dances of their parents' youth and generally having a groovy time at the 25th 
anniversary of Woodstock last weekend, Dr. Vicki Hufnagel was lubing up women's 
bellies and performing ultrasound procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 No rest for the wicked -- or for physicians at a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old director of female reconstructive surgery at Thompson Memorial 
Medical Center in Burbank, Hufnagel left heat prostration and overdose victims 
to others at the festival in Upstate New York, however. She was there mixing 
social concerns and medicine, teaching women about their bodies and how to get 
the kind of medical treatment they want in a system she believes is dominated 
by male concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole thing is making medicine for the people," especially women, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hufnagel has pioneered a program called "Her Body" where women can go to a 
hospital or medical center and watch a videotaped hysterectomy, read up on 
cervical cancer and get counseling on everything from the HIV virus to prenatal 
nutrition.  
</P>
<P>
 The centers are at two Los Angeles-area hospitals and at a hospital in Palm 
Springs. A third is in the planning stages at a New York medical center. By 
offering women "one-stop shopping" for such varied medical services, Hufnagel 
said, she is able to charge less than they might pay elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Hufnagel said she went to Woodstock II to educate young women about medical 
concerns unique to them and about issues she feels still aren't being properly 
addressed. A quarter-century after their mothers removed their tops and 
demanded equal attention for the female body, last weekend's concert-goers came 
to see her in a tent that Hufnagel put up near such political activists as 
Greenpeace and Mother Jones magazine. She and her nurses and assistants went to 
work even before the festival began. Hufnagel missed the original Woodstock 
because she was studying at the country's other counterculture outpost, 
Berkeley. This reunion lacked the same sense of hope and promise, she said, 
both medically and socially. 
</P>
<P>
 The vibes were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 People complained " 'We can't do anything about AIDS, we can't do anything 
about Rwanda.' A lot of people didn't have insurance. What we were seeing was 
this overwhelming sense of nihilism," she said. ERIC SLATER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Soka University will present a tour of its newly dedicated John and Juliana 
Gensley Native Plant Demonstration Garden and Botanical Research Center and 
Nursery on Sept. 6 from 10 to 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The botany research center and nursery was set up to restore portions of the 
campus to its native habitat following the introduction of non-native plant 
species over the last 70 years. The center currently houses a fully documented 
seed bank of more than 250 plant species. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants expected to be in bloom during the walk include orange wallflowers, 
foothill penstemon and monkey flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka University is located at 26800 W. Mulholland Highway, Calabasas. 
Soka-affiliated schools maintain six environmental preserves in America and 
Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 Juliana Gensley, a professor emeritus from Cal State Long Beach, will lead the 
tour. Both she and her husband, John, have been actively involved in the 
community since 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gensleys have organized docents at Malibu Canyon State Park, where they 
have led nature walks for adults and children, and have worked to preserve the 
White Oak farm and the Sepulveda Adobe. They have also organized and led the 
Juan de Anza Pageant and researched and wrote a book on the Stunt family and 
their ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition for their volunteer efforts, the two have been awarded the 
Calabasas Chamber of Commerce's second annual Bill van Gieson award. FRANK

HUNT CONTINUES FOR RAPIST IN SHERMAN OAKS ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police continued their search Friday for a knife-wielding rapist 
who broke into two Sherman Oaks homes earlier this week and attacked a 
21-year-old woman and a 14-year-old girl as they slept.  
</P>
<P>
 Appealing for help from the public, detectives released a composite drawing of 
the man suspected of raping the 21-year-old and attempting to rape the 
teen-ager before she fought back and scared him away. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Mel Arnold described the suspect as a black male between 25 and 35 
years old, about 5-foot-6, 130 to 140 pounds with either a shaved or bald head. 
Arnold said the attacker may also have scratches on his face and neck as a 
result of his struggle with the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold also said he considers the man, who threatened both victims with a 
knife, "extremely dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks took place between 3:45 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Thursday in two quiet 
neighborhoods. In both cases, the attacker entered the homes through rear 
doors. It was not clear if the doors were locked. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first attack, the man entered a house on Nagle Avenue, raping the 
21-year-old and holding her at knifepoint while her family slept in other 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three hours later, the man is believed to have walked into a house 
on Morrison Street and attempted to rape the teen-ager. She fought back, 
however, and chased her attacker out of the house and down the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women were treated for minor physical injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted Friday, the teen-ager urged women to prepare themselves for 
potential attacks by taking self-defense classes. Although she had not taken 
such a class, she said she has read about rape in school textbooks and in 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rape is a violent crime," she said. "It's not a crime of sex. It's a crime of 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold said detectives were searching their files for recently released sex 
offenders and asking other law enforcement agencies in Southern California if 
they have investigated similar attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The detective also urged residents to protect themselves by keeping doors and 
windows locked or by installing security devices such as window bars or alarm 
systems.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY WON'T CHARGE IRS AGENT IN SHOOTING DEATH; INVESTIGATION: 
PROSECUTORS SAY THEY LACK SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO WIN A CONVICTION AGAINST PAUL 
HAMILTON DAVIS. THE INCIDENT STEMMED FROM A TRAFFIC DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal charges will not be filed against an off-duty IRS agent who shot and 
killed an unarmed Bakersfield man following a traffic dispute on a San Fernando 
Valley freeway, the Los Angeles district attorney's office announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they chose not to charge Paul Hamilton Davis in connection 
with the July 16, 1993, shooting death of Mickey Jay Smith because they lacked 
sufficient evidence to win a conviction. They found Davis was not acting in his 
official capacity as an IRS agent when he killed Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the fact that we believe that Mr. Davis, by his impetuous acts, 
ultimately put into motion the chain of events which led to Mr. Smith's death, 
we cannot legally, ethically, or successfully charge him with committing a 
crime," according to an 18-page report issued by the district attorney's office 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report noted that the case was weakened by numerous factors, including a 
potential credibility problem of a key witness, Smith's own history of violence 
against his family and girlfriend and the likelihood that Davis could present a 
strong defense that he shot Smith in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think we could win it," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Efrem M. Grail, the 
prosecutor assigned to the case. "It was very complex." 
</P>
<P>
 News of the decision came as little surprise to Smith's mother, Lee Craig, who 
described the handling of her son's case by law enforcement officials as 
"tacky." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling he (Davis) would get away with it," Craig said in a telephone 
interview from her Bakersfield home. 
</P>
<P>
 Others greeted the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased," said Jim Asperger, an attorney from O'Melveny & Myers, 
who represents Davis. "Clearly it was the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Justice Department could still file civil rights charges against 
Davis. The FBI launched a preliminary investigation into the shooting after a 
complaint was filed with the department. An FBI spokesman could not be reached 
for comment late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A $30-million civil rights lawsuit was also filed last month by Smith's 
girlfriend, Brandi R. Griffith, and the couple's 2-year-old daughter against 
Davis and the IRS. Griffith's lawyer, James De Simone, said Friday he is 
"confident the truth will come out in (a civil) trial." 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to prosecute Mr. Davis to the fullest extent under the law for 
federal civil rights violations," he said. "Smith's child is without a father 
because Davis killed him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Events leading to Smith's death began shortly after 7:30 p.m. on the Golden 
State Freeway while Smith was riding in a rental truck driven by his friend, 
Chris Stayton. During a lane change, the truck swerved in front of a car driven 
by Davis, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Stayton's account, contained in an LAPD preliminary homicide report, is that 
Smith began taunting Davis, who followed Stayton and Smith off the Branford 
Avenue exit, where both vehicles stopped along a side road near an industrial 
complex. Stayton said Smith got out of the truck shouting obscenities and 
repeatedly shoved Davis, who moments later shot and killed Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Stayton and other witnesses told police they did not realize Davis was a law 
enforcement officer until after the shooting when police arrived and the agent, 
dressed in business attire, flashed his badge at officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The report issued by the district attorney's office also noted that Davis did 
not brandish his law enforcement badge or an available flashlight to try and 
de-escalate the situation, however it found that Davis did attempt to radio the 
IRS to request police backup just prior to the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was unarmed at the time of the shooting, according to police. A 
coroner's toxicology report found that his blood alcohol level, at .18%, was 
more than twice the legal driving limit of .08%. Prosecutors said that would 
have bolstered Davis' contentions that he feared for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also noted in their report that numerous witnesses stated they saw 
Davis retreat four to five times as Smith continued to approach him and shove 
him, but one witness said he saw the two men shove each other. Two other 
witnesses also told police they saw Smith strike Davis in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times last year, Stayton said although Smith was 
acting aggressively, he did not believe his friend posed enough of a threat to 
Davis to warrant the shooting.

10 AFTERSHOCKS HIT WEST VALLEY IN 24 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In case you needed a reminder of jittery times past, the western San Fernando 
Valley got hit with 10 small aftershocks in just 24 hours, beginning Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The rash of shakers started at 9:41 p.m. Thursday when a magnitude 3.1 struck 
three miles west-northwest of Canoga Park, according to Caltech officials.A 
magnitude 3.5 -- the biggest of the group -- followed at 11:56 p.m. It was 
centered two miles south-southwest of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday morning, a 2.9-magnitude quake hit at 9:39 a.m., followed by an 
early afternoon pair each registering 2.6 at 12:26 and 12:47 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon was rounded out by a 2.9 at 3:46, a 2.8 at 3:50, a 2.6 at 3:58, 
a 2.5 at 4:15 and a 2.6 at 4:31. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have many times in the past, seismologists said this aftershock 
activity is normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a lot of earthquakes after a big quake. The bigger the earthquake, 
the more aftershocks," a Caltech spokeswoman said, "and there will probably be 
a lot more in the immediate future." 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists said there have been more than 8,700 aftershocks of the Jan. 17 
earthquake.

OFFICIALS SUSPECT WOMAN OF FILING FALSE ASSAULT CHARGE; POLICE: COMMON-LAW 
HUSBAND NOT CHARGED AFTER DISCREPANCIES ARE FOUND IN WIFE'S STORY. AUTHORITIES 
SAY SHE'S DONE IT BEFORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A wheelchair-bound, legally blind woman who accused her common-law husband of 
sexually assaulting her is under investigation for filing false police reports, 
a prosecutor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old woman is also being investigated for cruelty to animals for 
taping the muzzle of her guide dog and claiming her husband had done it so he 
could attack her, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sera Boyadjian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors refused Friday to file charges against West Hills riding 
instructor Terry Foladare, 41, after a weeklong investigation turned up his 
accuser's history of making unfounded police reports, Boyadjian said. Police 
and prosecutors declined to identify her. 
</P>
<P>
 Foladare was arrested Aug. 13 night after the woman identified him as her 
assailant. He was held in the West Valley jail on $300,000 bail before being 
released on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the true victim here," said Detective Nancy Severns of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's West Valley station. "She has continued to call up and make 
complaints against the gentleman since his arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, the detective said, officers have responded and found she was safe 
and that the allegation was unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began to unfold at about 10 p.m. Aug. 13 when she called police and 
claimed she had been sexually assaulted. When officers arrived at her Reseda 
Boulevard apartment, they found the dog in the kitchen, restrained and with its 
muzzle taped shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Both husband and wife are physically challenged, police and prosecutors said. 
They are estranged and have lived apart for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Police escorted the woman to a hospital, but she refused a portion of the rape 
examination, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Foladare vehemently professed his innocence and gave police 
a detailed account of his own, the prosecutor said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he said checked out," Boyadjian said. "The information he gave us 
was corroborated. Meanwhile, her story was falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the subsequent investigation turned up at least three 
other unfounded police reports made by the alleged victim at three different 
Valley police divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her history shows a serious lack of credibility in filing sexual assault 
reports," Boyadjian said. "He is just one of a string of men who seems to be a 
victim of her allegations of sexual abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the charges can be filed as either felonies, which are 
handled by her office, or misdemeanors, which are prosecuted by the city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Detective Severns said the case occupied all her time and that of 
several patrol officers this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame when someone does this, because sexual assault is such a 
sensitive issue," Severns said. "It makes it that much harder for true victims 
to come forward because they are afraid nobody will believe them."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STATE WAIVER SOUGHT OVER SCHOOL BONDS; 
CASTAIC: THOUGH VOTERS APPROVED $20 MILLION FOR TWO NEW CAMPUSES, PROPOSITION 
13 ALLOWS ONLY $14 MILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 This rural community's school district was an exception to the rule last year 
when its voters approved a $20-million bond measure for two new schools.  
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second school-bond measure to pass in the Santa Clarita Valley 
since Proposition 13 limited property-tax increases for many California 
residents in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 But in order to sell all $20 million of the bonds, the Castaic Union School 
District must be an exception again. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to use the money to build a junior high school in the Villa 
Canyon area and an elementary school near Camino Del Valle Park.  
</P>
<P>
 There is just one problem. Under a State Department of Education rule that 
school officials originally overlooked, the district should only have sought 
voters' approval to sell $14 million of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule, in effect since Proposition 13 was passed, prevents districts from 
issuing bonds in an amount greater than 1.25% of the assessed value of property 
within their boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 It is designed to ensure that "school districts don't get so much in debt they 
can't pay it off," said Dwayne Brooks, the education department's assistant 
superintendent for school facilities planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule was news to the Castaic school board and other residents who 
supported the bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of districts or entities that are probably unaware of it," 
said Dirk Gosda, who promoted the measure as a member of Castaic Citizens for 
Castaic Schools and now serves as a district trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees voted 5 to 0 Thursday night to seek a waiver from the State Board 
of Education to sell the remaining $6 million in bonds. They expect the state 
board to review the application in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 If the waiver is allowed, the additional bond sales will raise the $39.21 
annual fee paid by the average Castaic homeowner for schools by $5, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees had the option of using other money to start building the new junior 
high now in the hope that property values increase enough in the near future to 
permit more bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has on hand about half the estimated $17 million needed to build 
the junior high school, said Michael R. Slater, business manager.  
</P>
<P>
 He and other local school officials say they are confident the waiver will be 
approved, citing waivers granted to districts elsewhere. They also note that 
78% of Castaic voters supported the $20-million bond sale at the polls.

HAWAII FLOORED FOR COUNT OF 10; BASEBALL: CUNNINGHAM'S HOMER BREAKS TIE, SPARKS 
EXPLOSION THAT SENDS NORTHRIDGE TO WORLD SERIES, 17-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In many respects, it was merely another sloppy Little League game like ones 
played every day all over the country -- full of errors, walks and wild 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 But this game was played before 8,800 fans, plus cameras from almost every TV 
station in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And this game sent the Northridge 11- and 12-year-old all-star team to the 
Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., culminating a two-month-long 
quest that has included 17 consecutive victories and four tournament 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 After five innings of mistake-filled play, Northridge bore down in the sixth 
and final inning, exploding for 10 runs to snap a tie and defeat Waianae, 
Hawaii, 17-7, Friday night in the Western Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will open World Series play against Brooklyn, Minn., champion of 
the Central Region, Monday at 4 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Matt Cunningham homered to lead off the sixth. He hit a grand slam 
later in the inning, during which Northridge sent 14 batters to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Dunlap and Matt Fisher also homered for Northridge, which pounded 18 
hits -- at least one by every starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew against this team we would have to hit the ball hard," said Fisher, 
who had three hits. "We had to score a lot, then score a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
 When the scoring was done, it was time to celebrate. Northridge players dashed 
around the field, holding up T-shirts that proclaimed them champions as the 
crowd stood and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our goal, to make it to San Bernardino," Cunningham said. "Then to 
win it here is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (17-0, 5-0 in regional play) opened the scoring in the first on a 
three-run home run by Fisher. Northridge starter Justin Gentile was wild, 
however, and Hawaii answered with four runs in the bottom of the inning on two 
hits and four walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Tuber replaced Gentile with two out and the bases loaded, and after a 
passed ball sent home Hawaii's fourth run, Tuber struck out Matthew Flanagan to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile was wiping away tears after taking Tuber's position in left field, but 
he bounced back to double, single and drive in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job was to pitch, then my job changed and I told myself I had to hit," 
Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii scored two more in the second on three consecutive bloop hits and two 
Northridge throwing errors to take a 6-3 lead with none out. Tuber settled down 
by striking out the side and he went on to retire 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber (5-0), grandson of former Dodger and National League batting champion 
Pete Reiser, struck out 11 and recorded his third victory in the regional. He 
also had two singles and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to pitch this game, and I was standing in left field when 
Justin was struggling, thinking that I would get in," said Tuber, a 5-foot-9 
right-hander. "I felt ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge scored four runs to take a 7-6 lead in the third when a double off 
the right-field fence by David Teraoka followed an error, a double by Fisher 
and a single by Tuber. Teraoka, who was only in the lineup because regular 
first baseman Matt Cassel severely cut his hand Thursday in the team barracks, 
scored on an error by Hawaii first baseman Jubie Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the game David was real nervous and crying in the dugout, but he did a 
great job," Northridge Manager Larry Baca said. "I can't say enough about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Another player coming through in a starting role was second baseman Michael 
Frost, who doubled and singled. Frost is in the lineup because regular catcher 
Jonathan Higashi was declared ineligible for living outside the Northridge 
league boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham moved to catcher, where he has done an outstanding job, and Frost 
has started, getting eight hits in five regional games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber was sailing along until Fred Taitin hit a solo homer to right field with 
one out in the fifth to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Northridge needed more offense. No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii's Christen Asinsin threw 126 pitches before he was lifted with the 
score 12-7. Cunningham greeted reliever Keoki Telles with a grand slam, but 
he'll remember his first homer the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we were going to Williamsport when that ball sailed over the fence," 
Cunningham said.

OHIO BACK FOR MORE AGAINST THOUSAND OAKS IN TITLE ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Thousand Oaks heads into today's championship game of the Little League 
Junior World Series for 13-year-olds, the team must back up some pretty 
impressive praise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparky Anderson, manager of the Detroit Tigers and a Thousand Oaks resident, 
is an honorary guest of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put all your money on Thousand Oaks," Anderson said earlier in the 
tournament. "They got some guys that can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks (17-1) will play Hamilton, Ohio, at 2 p.m. PDT, needing only one 
victory to claim the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks has reached the championship game of the eight-team 
double-elimination tournament without a loss, defeating Puerto Rico, 3-0, on 
Monday; Jacksonville, Fla., 10-3, on Wednesday, and Ohio, 5-2, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If Thousand Oaks loses the first game, a second game will be played 30 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio (14-1) advanced to the championship round with a 9-6, come-from-behind 
victory over Vestal, N.Y., on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio trailed New York, 5-1, after four innings, but scored a run in the fifth, 
six runs in the sixth and another in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, which defeated Matamoros, Mexico, 6-2, earlier in the day, scored a 
run in the bottom of the seventh and loaded the bases with two outs, but could 
draw no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Strauser (6-0) will make his third start of the series for Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauser (three innings) and Kevin Howard combined on a one-hitter in the 
victory over Puerto Rico, and Strauser gave up one run and four hits in five 
innings to pick up the victory over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Manager Ed Kitchen said that Wes Munyon (1-0) will be the first 
pitcher out of the bullpen, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 If Munyon falters, Kitchen will turn to Howard (7-1), who has two victories in 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard pitched a five-hitter and struck out seven batters against Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up the victory in relief against Puerto Rico, allowing one hit and 
striking out six in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care who we play and we haven't cared from the beginning," Kitchen 
said. "We can't be cautious; we need to stay aggressive."

BARTELS JOINS HIS SON WITH A FAIR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIN ESPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coming into Friday night's 20-lap street stock main event at Ventura Raceway, 
Bill Bartels of Los Angeles figured it was his turn to win a feature race 
during the Ventura County Fair, since his son, Ron Bartels of Hawthorne, did it 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels figured right, taking the lead on the third lap and coasting to his 
third victory. 
</P>
<P>
 By the sixth lap, Bartels had a one-third of a lap lead over eventual 
second-place finisher James Weston of Santa Barbara, a margin he maintained 
until Jeff Holmes spun on the 10th lap to bring out the caution flag. 
</P>
<P>
 After the restart, Bartels needed four laps to open a quarter-lap lead over 
Weston, which he maintained until the final lap, when he ran into traffic and 
coasted to the finish.

COURT UPHOLDS BOFA'S USE OF ARBITRATION TO SETTLE DISPUTES; FINANCE: BANK'S 
1992 POLICY DENIES CUSTOMERS THE OPTION OF A COURT TRIAL, A MOVE TAKEN TO CUT 
RISING LEGAL COSTS. RULING IS CALLED A SERIOUS SETBACK TO CONSUMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Calling it a serious blow for consumers, trial lawyer and consumer groups said 
Friday that they were stunned that a state court upheld a Bank of America 
policy that forces customers to settle disputes through binding arbitration 
instead of a court trial. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco County Superior Court judge Thomas J. Mellon on Thursday 
rejected a lawsuit that sought to overturn BofA's 1992 decision that imposed 
binding arbitration on customers with checking, savings and credit card 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this as an opportunity to try to take on financial institutions and 
mandatory binding arbitration plans in hopes that a victory would deter other 
institutions," said Ken McEldowney, executive director of San Francisco-based 
Consumer Action, one of the plaintiffs in the suit against California's largest 
bank. "This is such a serious setback for consumers that the need to appeal 
becomes even more important." 
</P>
<P>
 After San Francisco-based BofA adopted the arbitration policy two years ago, 
rival Wells Fargo followed suit. Both banks said they adopted the arrangement, 
which also applies to class-action lawsuits filed by customers, to reduce 
rising legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's ruling may spur other banks to adopt arbitration to resolve 
disputes with customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the BofA policy, either the bank or a customer can force a dispute into 
arbitration when a lawsuit is filed. The arbitrator, usually a practicing 
attorney, is appointed by the American Arbitration Assn. with the consent of 
both the bank and customer. BofA said it has required its commercial customers 
to submit to arbitration for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It saves tremendous amounts of legal costs" for both parties, BofA spokesman 
Peter Magnani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the arbitration policy was applied to consumer accounts, only five 
disputes have gone toward arbitration at the customer's request, Magnani said. 
But all those disputes were resolved before arbitration began, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitration is routinely used by stock brokerage houses to resolve disputes 
with retail customers. However, some consumer advocates have contended that the 
arbitration panels used in resolving brokerage disputes were biased in favor of 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In their suit filed in 1992, Consumer Action, the California Trial Lawyers 
Assn. and four BofA clients claimed that BofA's policy violated the state's 
Consumer Legal Remedies Act and the Unfair Business Practices Act. While not 
opposed to arbitration in general, the groups claimed, among other things, that 
BofA had failed to provide sufficient notice and information to customers about 
binding arbitration. The bank notified customers of the change in a card 
inserted into monthly banking and credit card statements. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a hearing Thursday, Judge Mellon said BofA customers received 
sufficient notification. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Sturdevant, a member of the California Trial Lawyers Assn. who led 
the case against BofA, said a decision to appeal will be made after a written 
version of Mellon's ruling can be reviewed.

TRISTAR MARKETING DUO HEADED FOR UNIVERSAL; HOLLYWOOD: THE MUCH-RESPECTED TEAM 
OF BUFFY SHUTT AND KATHY JONES WILL REPLACE PERRY KATZ, WHO GETS A PRODUCTION 
DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a long-rumored move, outgoing TriStar Pictures marketing executives Buffy 
Shutt and Kathy Jones are close to finalizing a deal to run marketing at 
Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt and Jones will replace Perry Katz, who was named Universal's executive 
vice president of marketing only eights months ago. Universal sources say Katz 
will be given a production deal -- a move he reportedly negotiated when he 
first took the job on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt and Jones, who work as a team, are among the industry's most respected 
marketing executives, having worked on such hits as "Philadelphia" and 
"Sleepless in Seattle." Their hiring could spark other changes at Universal, 
though sources said nothing has been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt and Jones declined to comment on the move, as did MCA Motion Picture 
Group Chairman Tom Pollock. Though their TriStar contracts run through December 
and they have reportedly been asked to stay long enough to market TriStar's big 
November release, "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," sources said Friday that Shutt 
and Jones may move to Universal much sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing veterans had been vacillating for months about whether to sign a 
new deal at TriStar, which, like Columbia Pictures, its sister studio at Sony 
Pictures Entertainment, has been undergoing internal strife for the past year.  
</P>
<P>
 In a cost-cutting move, Sony recently decided to merge the marketing 
departments of Columbia and TriStar, offering Shutt and Jones the combined job. 
To Sony's surprise, they rejected the proposal and said they would move on 
after their contract expired. After much eleventh-hour scrambling, Sony handed 
the job to Columbia Pictures Vice Chairman Sid Ganis, who was named president 
of worldwide marketing for the two studios one week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While Shutt and Jones were pursued by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox, 
sources said Universal always had the inside track. Pollock reportedly 
expressed interest months ago in the two, and even offered to swap them for 
Universal executive Fred Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz was hired as vice president of research at Universal in 1987, shortly 
after Pollock came aboard. In 1990 he was made a senior vice president of 
marketing under Si Kornblit and in 1992 was promoted to executive vice 
president of marketing after Kornblit's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz viewed the marketing post as an interim position from the start, sources 
said. He declined to comment on the change, but sources said Katz has always 
wanted to move into production. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt and Jones were running their own marketing company in New York when Dawn 
Steel hired them to run marketing at Columbia in 1989. Two months after their 
arrival, Columbia and TriStar merged their marketing departments under Shutt 
and Jones. In the fall of that year, the studios' owner, Coca-Cola, sold the 
company to Sony. In June, 1991, the marketing departments were split again and 
the executives moved over to handle TriStar.

 SOUTHLAND FIRM SPOTLIGHTS FCC AUCTION WOES; TELECOM: FAILURE OF SUN VALLEY 
COMPANY AND OTHERS TO ANTE UP MONEY FOR INTERACTIVE TV LICENSES CASTS CLOUD ON 
BIDDING PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Horses roam the ramshackle Sun Valley, Calif., property that is listed as the 
address of Interactive America Corp., but there is nothing to indicate the 
presence of a company prepared to launch a pioneering new television service. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive America was the second-largest bidder in the recent Federal 
Communications Commission auction of interactive TV licenses, but it failed to 
submit its $1.37-million down payment on time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the one-page application required to take part in the FCC auction, 
Interactive America identified itself as a small business in which a woman held 
a controlling interest -- and thus it qualified for a $3.3-million discount on 
the $17 million it bid for 15 separate licenses last month. But the woman's 
identity has not been revealed, and company President Christopher Pedersen 
refused to provide any details on the company's history or financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive America is not the only one of the bidders to miss the payment 
deadline for the interactive TV licenses, which will be used for a new wireless 
service that will allow viewers to respond to what they watch on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The top bidder, Commercial Realty St. Pete Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla., also 
failed to make a down payment -- and at one point campaigned for others to 
withhold money. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 500 bidders, some whose only asset appeared to be their business cards 
and the required $2,500 bidding deposit, sought their fortunes in the July 
auctions. And when it was over, a few bidders -- stoked by the gold-rush 
atmosphere that has marked other wireless technologies such as cellular 
telephones and two-way paging -- may have gotten carried away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike some of the other (defaulters) who went into this just to screw up the 
system . . . Interactive America essentially seemed to have just gotten in over 
their heads and bid too much," said Andy Sernovitz, president of the 
Interactive Television Assn., a Washington trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC officials are furious about the missed payments, which threaten the 
integrity of its new-spectrum auction process. The government once gave away 
radio frequencies and required them to be used in the public interest, but it 
has now begun selling licenses for new services to the highest bidder -- a 
process that could raise as much as $10 billion over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, don't get into the auction if you can't make the down payment," FCC 
Commissioner James H. Quello said recently. "I think the people who make bids 
and don't have the funds are irresponsible. . . . If they have overbid it's 
their fault, not our fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Quello's remarks were echoed by a lawyer representing other interactive TV 
license bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that all bidders carry a responsibility . . . to honor 
their obligations," said Thomas A. Hart Jr., a Washington lawyer. "It creates a 
cloud over the future financial success of the IVDS industry as well as the 
auction process and the existing procedures at the FCC." 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery surrounding the female owner of Interactive America also 
underscores potential problems with the FCC's detailed set of preferences for 
women, minorities and small businesses. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt has hailed 
these incentives as an enormous economic opportunity for the so-called 
designated entities, but the FCC did not screen auction applicants to see if 
their preference claims were valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen of Interactive America said the company's owner wished her identity 
to remain undisclosed. He said that Leslie B. Kinikin, the owner of the Sun 
Valley house whose name is also listed on the FCC application for the auction 
as a person authorized to make a bid for Interactive America, is not the owner 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen said he is not an investor in the company, which he said was formed 
in June, about a month before the auction. The state Department of Corporations 
said the company is not incorporated in California, and city records show no 
Los Angeles business license. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC spokeswoman Susan Sallet said bidders were only required to submit a 
one-page form listing the name of the company, its address and phone number and 
the names of people authorized to bid. They could check off boxes indicating if 
the firms are woman- or minority-controlled. Pedersen signed the form, which 
stated, among other things, that the applicant is "legally, technically, 
financially and otherwise qualified" to bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallet said the FCC accepted that information without verification because "we 
needed to balance the need to make sure you were a serious bidder with the need 
to keep the auction flexible." She said bidders were required to submit more 
detailed information with their down payments, to be followed by an audit. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Interactive America is not registered as a California 
corporation and is not licensed to do business in Los Angeles is not illegal. 
But a company must obtain a Los Angeles business tax certificate before 
conducting any revenue-generating business in the city, said Don DeBord, chief 
of the city clerk's tax and permit division. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen said Interactive America has not made the down payment that was due 
Aug. 8 because the FCC has approved only one interactive TV equipment supplier. 
The vendor, Eon Corp. of Reston, Va., was also a bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen said that with only one approved vendor, he couldn't be sure his 
company could meet the requirement that 10% of the system be built within a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 10% of its interactive systems within one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no problem in making the down payment," Pedersen said. "We're trying 
to be fair. We want (the FCC) to be fair." 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's Sallet said those in default will lose the licenses and have to pay 
the difference between what they bid and the new bid when the licenses are 
re-auctioned, plus 3% of the lesser bid.

20TH CENTURY INDUSTRIES SHARES FALL NEARLY 25%; INSURANCE: PLUNGE IS REACTION 
TO RULING THAT MEANS THE FIRM, ALREADY HIT BY CLAIMS FROM THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE, 
MUST REBATE $119 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shares of 20th Century Industries lost nearly a quarter of their value Friday, 
a day after the California Supreme Court rejected the Woodland Hills-based 
insurer's constitutional challenge of regulations for Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century's stock closed at $12.75 a share, down $3.625, or 22%, in 
heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 While some other insurance stocks were down slightly, Wall Street singled out 
20th Century as investors had another day to digest Thursday's legal defeat, 
under which the company -- already battered by an estimated $685 million in 
claims from the Northridge earthquake -- is required to rebate $119 million to 
policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion diverged Friday on whether the California ruling might embolden other 
states to pursue similar rate rollback measures. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century has not yet decided whether to appeal the California decision to 
the U.S. Supreme Court and won't decide "for a while yet," a spokesman said. 
The firm has 30 days to apply for review by the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock of Mercury General Corp. -- the other major, publicly traded auto 
insurer whose business is concentrated in California -- closed down 75 cents at 
$27.50 after dipping as low as $26.875. Unlike 20th Century, Mercury has 
already settled its Proposition 103 rebate liability, voluntarily returning $46 
million, or an average of $173 apiece, to its policyholders in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Dinon, senior vice president of 20th Century, said the dozens of 
shareholders who called him Friday were less concerned about the rebates than 
about whether the company will be able to earn a reasonable profit in 
California in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's ruling, the court affirmed state Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi's authority to impose an across-the-board cap on insurers' profit 
levels when setting rates or determining Proposition 103 rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 If regulators focus on insurers' profits rather than on whether their prices 
are reasonable, it will suppress competition, innovation and cost-control, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to think courts in other states are more sensible," Merrill 
Lynch analyst Gerald Lewinsohn said in predicting that the rate rollback wave 
will ebb at the California border. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street analysts are out of touch with real people, consumer advocate 
Ralph Nader said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insurance industry has exhausted its appeals and (Proposition) 103 is now 
free to be at large throughout the country," Nader said. In the past, whenever 
a state has considered Proposition 103-style reforms, the industry has 
responded that the approach was unconstitutional, he said. Thursday's ruling 
proved otherwise, Nader said. Insurers Sink

 California property-casualty insurance stocks were generally lower Friday, 
after the state Supreme Court upheld rebate orders. 03,15,15,16 1994 Fri. close

OFF THE TICKER: BARGAIN JEANS AT $2,500 A PAIR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like so many shoppers, Yo Murata was happy when he found that perfect pair of 
blue jeans: comfortable yet classic, broken-in but sturdy. And the price was 
right.Only $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to buy ones like I used to wear as a teen-ager," the 44-year-old 
fast-food franchise owner explained. 
</P>
<P>
 A vintage-jeans craze in Tokyo has given rise to about 100 boutiques catering 
to connoisseurs of faded denim and old-style copper rivets. Demand has pushed 
prices up to levels normally associated with haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
 Murata's purchase was two years ago, and he regards it as a great buy. These 
days, a pair of the same vintage jeans -- Levi's, circa 1950 -- fetch about 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The boom has sent an influx of Japanese buyers to the United States, inflating 
the price of used jeans around Los Angeles.

ROLLER DERBY; SMALL STORES SCRAMBLE FOR IN-LINE SKATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave White is in the seemingly fortunate position of owning a skate shop in 
the middle of the biggest boom the in-line skate industry has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 But that blessing became a curse a few months ago when demand for the skates 
exploded and supplies dried up. In late spring, when White tried to order more 
Rollerblade skates -- the most popular in-line brand -- the company said it 
would not be filling any new orders until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could be able to order skates and get them within a week or two, I could 
sell 10 to 20 pairs a week," White said. "But now I can't sell any. I don't 
have what people are looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he is losing customers to sporting goods giants such as Oshman's 
Sporting Goods, Sports Chalet and Big 5 Sporting Goods -- chain stores that 
pre-ordered thousands of pairs of the skates and have continued to receive 
shipments while shelves in smaller stores stay empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big companies can afford to pre-order hundreds or even thousands of skates," 
White said. "I'm a small shop, and I can only order two or three pairs at a 
time. Smaller skate shops have been shut out." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at Sportmart in West Los Angeles, the store is overflowing with 
in-line skates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got too many (darn) Rollerblades," said Tony Bell, an assistant manager. 
"We've been choking them up. Our buyers tend to buy and ship as many as they 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The discrepancy is the unintended consequence of a record sales year for 
in-line skate manufacturers, who woefully underestimated consumer demand for 
the 1994 season after coming off a relatively flat year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demand is outstripping capacity between three and six months," said Pierre 
Boivin, president of Canstar, which makes Bauer in-line skates. "It's an 
industrywide problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Although revenue climbed 13% to $243 million in 1993 from $215 million in 
1992, the number of skates sold grew only about 4%, according to statistics 
from the National Sporting Goods Assn. in Mt. Prospect, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 But things turned around quickly this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter alone, 1.8 million pairs of skates were sold -- nearly 
double the 1 million pairs sold in last year's first quarter, said Henry Zuver, 
executive director of the International In-Line Skating Assn., a trade group in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales are expected to reach $325 million by the end of December, traditionally 
the biggest month for the industry, said Thomas Doyle, research director of the 
national sporting goods association. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one predicted that we would have this level of growth," said Deborah 
Autrey, a spokeswoman for Rollerblade in Minneapolis, where extra shifts of 
workers are churning out skates as fast as they can. "There's only so much 
capacity in our manufacturing facilities, and it just takes time to fill 
orders." 
</P>
<P>
 Skate manufacturers and retailers are at a loss to explain the unexpected boom 
in skate sales, but many cite the introduction this spring of skates with more 
advanced braking systems that make it easier for skaters to stop. Other 
explanations include the proliferation of roller hockey leagues, the Winter 
Olympics -- which featured athletes who train using in-line skates -- and good 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, specialty skate shops -- which sell 15% of all in-line 
skates and often concentrate on stocking high-end blades for the skating 
connoisseur -- are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's costing me about 20 sales a day," said Phyllis Fleschler, owner of 
Valley Skate & Surf in North Hills. "We've had lists of people (waiting to buy 
in-line skates). As a matter of fact, the oldest one on the list is from 
March." 
</P>
<P>
 Unbelieving customers roam from store to store, often in a hopeless search for 
their first-choice pair of skates, said Patrick Lochouarn, owner of Venice 
Rollerworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "After going to six or seven stores, they realize" the skates aren't 
available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Pierre said he is asking around at hockey rinks and scouring the Trading 
Times in search of a new pair of in-line roller hockey skates. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being unable to place orders, stores report that they are not 
receiving full shipment on their pre-ordered skates. Shipments to Fleschler's 
store have been down 25% since the shortage began. 
</P>
<P>
 Lochouarn got only a third of the Rollerblades he ordered in his August 
shipment and has scratched off his booking orders skates he is sure will not be 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I'm not a small specialty store," said Ric Miranda, a buyer for 
Sandy's Ski & Sport, a three-store chain that has seen sales of in-line skates 
grow from a quarter to half its business in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Catch-22 for the little guy, because once the big company makes a big 
commitment, the little guy doesn't have a chance to go back and order more," 
Miranda said. "But they can't cancel orders," so they have to buy 
conservatively, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But that, said Zuver of the in-line skate association, is "just business." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a chain store buying 100,000 units and a small store buying 100 
units, the large store is certainly going to have more flexibility," Zuver 
said. Still, he added, "most skate companies have been in business long enough 
to know that specialty shops are very important to them, and they don't want to 
step on their toes either." On a Roll The number of in-line rollerskaters has 
increased fourfold since 1990...

 McDonnell Settles Pollution Suit: McDonnell Douglas Corp. agreed to install 
$600,000 in air-pollution-control technology at its Long Beach and Huntington 
Beach plants to settle a lawsuit brought by state authorities alleging that the 
company failed to warn the public about toxic emissions at the sites. Under the 
proposed settlement filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the St. 
Louis-based company also agreed to pay $125,000 in penalties and other costs, 
California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren said. The suit stemmed from Proposition 
65, which requires companies to "provide a clear and reasonable warning" before 
potentially exposing the public to dangerous emissions, Lungren said.

 Japan Lifts Apple Ban: The Japanese government said it is lifting the 23-year 
ban on U.S. apple imports, clearing the way for Washington apples to be sent to 
Japan by December, a Washington Apple Commission spokesman said.Japan's 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries made the announcement after 
determining the apples were safe and cleared all necessary health inspections, 
commission spokesman Jim Thomas said. "The next step now is they've put out 
their regulations on how we're supposed to do all this. This gives us the 
go-ahead to start the procedures to export this year's crop to Japan," Thomas 
said. Japan's ban on American apples has been the focus of a longstanding trade 
dispute.

 Job-Creating Tax Credit Faulted: An internal Labor Department report calls for 
scrapping a $300-million program that falls short of its goal of enticing 
businesses to hire disadvantaged workers. The audit, prepared by the 
department's inspector general's office, said employers would have hired nearly 
all the workers for which they received the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit without 
the program, adding that the cost of the program far exceeds its benefit.Doug 
Ross, head of the Employment and Training Administration, acknowledged problems 
with the program but said some of them have been addressed. He added that a 
more scientific study is needed. A department spokesman said later, however, 
that the intent was to recommend further study only if the program is renewed.

 First American Title Buys Rival: The nation's No. 2 title insurer announced 
the acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot Title Insurance of Greensboro, N.C. The 
acquisition will add only three branches to First American Title Insurance 
Co.'s international network of 300 locations, but it would give the company an 
important presence in the fast-growing North Carolina market.Jefferson-Pilot is 
a subsidiary of Jefferson-Pilot Corp., which is one of the nation's largest 
shareholder-owned life insurers. First American, based in Santa Ana, has bought 
about 10 other title insurance companies in the United States in the past year. 
Terms of the latest acquisition were not disclosed.

 TWA, Machinists Union Reach Agreements: Trans World Airlines said the 
tentative pacts with its largest union provides new work-rule and productivity 
changes that would generate significant cost savings.Details of the plans were 
not immediately available. The machinists union represents 13,800 of TWA's 
24,500 U.S. workers, and the St. Louis-based airline views the agreements as a 
key first step in an effort to reverse its recent losses. Members of the 
International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers will vote on the 
proposed changes Aug. 25-30, TWA said.

 U.S. Suspends Film-Dumping Probe: The Commerce Department said it has 
suspended the anti-dumping trade investigations into color photo papers and 
chemicals from Japanese firms after the firms agreed to increase prices to a 
fair market value. It said the suspensions followed agreements that Fuji Photo 
Film Co. and Konica Corp. will sell their products, from Japan and the 
Netherlands, at or above the foreign market value in the United States. The 
Commerce Department, acting on an Eastman Kodak Co. complaint, issued a 
preliminary dumping finding last March, and a hearing on the issue was 
scheduled next week by the U.S. International Trade Commission, a final arbiter 
on whether such anti-dumping practices were injuring U.S. companies.

CAROLINA FIRM BUYS O.C. MANUFACTURER; HOUSING: EASTERN HOUSING MAKER BUYS 
GOLDEN WEST HOMES OF SANTA ANA TO GAIN WESTERN FOOTHOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A North Carolina maker of manufactured housing said Friday that it has bought 
Golden West Homes of Santa Ana in a deal currently worth $17.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood Homes Corp. of Greensboro, N.C., said it bought privately held Golden 
West in a bid to expand its market in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West operates manufactured housing plants in Perris, Sacramento and 
Albany, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood said it will issue 700,000 shares of common stock, equal to about 3.4% 
of its outstanding shares to buy Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood's stock closed Friday at $24.87, down 13 cents, in trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual sales price of Golden West will depend on the trading price of 
Oakwood shares when the deal closes, which is expected at the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is subject to approval by Golden West's shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West's work force of 750 -- 430 of them in California -- and its 
management team led by President Harry E. Karsten Jr. are expected to remain in 
place under the acquisition, becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will fit very well into our long-term strategic plan which is to establish 
a presence on the West Coast," said Oakwood Vice President C. Michael 
Kilbourne. "We always intended to be in that market. When Golden West became 
available, that accelerated our entry by at least two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood expects to build about 12,000 manufactured homes this year in the 
South, parts of the Midwest and as far west as Arizona, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West expects to build about 5,000 homes, less than half of them in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the two firms will be building far fewer than industry leader 
Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. of Riverside, which plans to build upward of 70,000.

MINNESOTA JOINS CAMPAIGN AGAINST TOBACCO COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attack on the tobacco industry by states trying to recoup taxpayers' 
health care costs is escalating, with Minnesota joining the fray and several 
more suits expected this month and next. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota this week became the second state to file suit, following 
Mississippi's lead in May. West Virginia has also said it will sue, and Florida 
and Massachusetts have passed legislation allowing them to sue tobacco 
companies for reimbursement of Medicaid costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Motley, a Charleston, S.C., lawyer well known for his representation of 
asbestos victims, who is advising some states in the tobacco litigation, said 
another suit is expected within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be several more states filing in August and September," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the tobacco industry is among the most profitable, some legal experts 
think the state suits, along with several large class actions brought by 
individuals, pose a significant financial threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some predict that, if the companies begin to lose any of these cases, they 
could be forced to seek bankruptcy protection in the same way that Manville 
Corp. did in 1982 after a flood of asbestos injury suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco companies say that is nonsense. Yet the momentum is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mississippi case, filed May 23, marked the first time that a state 
government sought compensation for funds allocated to Medicaid, indigent care 
at state hospitals and insurance on state workers and state retirees because of 
smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota, a state that has been aggressive in environmental legislation, 
added a new twist by alleging antitrust and consumer protection law violations 
in its suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Atty. Gen. Hubert Humphrey III said the state also will weigh 
criminal action against tobacco companies if developments in its anti-smoking 
suit warranted such action. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is also unique because Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state's 
largest insurer, is also a plaintiff in the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry continues to say it will win the suits because it has 
been victorious in almost every other lawsuit and has never paid a penny in 
damages.

SANTA ANA TITLE INSURER BUYS RIVAL; ACQUISITION: FIRST AMERICAN WILL GAIN THREE 
BRANCHES AND AN IMPORTANT PRESENCE IN NORTH CAROLINA.

<P>
 First American Title Insurance Co., the nation's No. 2 title insurer, 
continued its acquisition streak Friday by announcing its purchase of a North 
Carolina competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot Title Insurance of Greensboro will add only 
three branches to First American's international network of 300 locations, but 
it will give the company an important presence in the fast-growing North 
Carolina market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always interested in picking up companies that have good people and 
strong local reputations, as well as companies with a long history and good set 
of title records," said Parker S. Kennedy, president of First American. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson-Pilot is a subsidiary of Jefferson-Pilot Corp., which is one of the 
nation's largest shareholder-owned life insurers. The company, which had 1993 
revenue of $1.2 billion, also has extensive holdings in fire and casualty 
insurance, mutual funds and broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 David A. Stonecipher, chief executive of Jefferson-Pilot, said Friday that, 
while the title company has been an excellent performer, "title insurance is 
not one of our primary businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 First American, based in Santa Ana, has bought about 10 other title insurance 
companies across the nation in the past year. Terms of the latest acquisition, 
which is subject to regulatory approval, were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 First American, which had premiums of $1.1 billion and revenue of $1.4 billion 
last year, is second in size only to Chicago Title Insurance Co., Kennedy said.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS SETTLES POLLUTION LAWSUIT; MANUFACTURING: IT WILL INSTALL 
EMISSION-CONTROL EQUIPMENT AT LONG BEACH, HUNTINGTON BEACH PLANTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp. has agreed to install $600,000 in air-pollution 
control technology to settle a California lawsuit alleging that the company 
failed to warn the public about toxic emissions at manufacturing plants in 
Huntington Beach and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis-based aerospace contractor's proposed settlement with the state 
was filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren 
said.McDonnell Douglas also agreed to pay $125,000 in penalties, investigative 
costs and payments to the California Public Health Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit stemmed from California's Proposition 65, which requires companies 
to provide a clear and reasonable warning before potentially exposing people to 
chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects. The state was concerned about 
emissions of hexavalent chromium from two McDonnell Douglas aircraft 
manufacturing plants, Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Installation of the pollution-control devices will reduce the amount of the 
chemical released in neighborhoods near the plants, Lungren said. In addition, 
the company will install specialized filters at two spray paint booths in Long 
Beach and one in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas's commercial aircraft operations, which make the MD-80 
twin-jet and MD-11 tri-jet, are concentrated in California. The company also 
builds the C-17 military transport plane in California.

CHEERS TO THE 'OLD LADY OF THREADNEEDLE STREET'; ARCHITECTURE: THE 106-YEAR-OLD 
BANK OF ENGLAND BUILDING, LIKE OTHER VENERABLE STRUCTURES, IS DOING NEW DUTY -- 
AS A PUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking at the sky-high marble and the golden chandeliers, you might think 
nothing much has changed since the Bank of England opened this branch on Fleet 
Street in 1888. 
</P>
<P>
 But the clink of beer glasses rings in a new era now that one of Britain's big 
brewers has converted the cavernous old place into a pub -- minus the 
jukeboxes, televisions and gaming machines that have invaded some English 
drinking establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people fancy a night with loud music, then let them go somewhere else," 
said Iain Anderson, manager of the Old Bank of England, operated by Fuller, 
Smith and Turner PLC. 
</P>
<P>
 London is the world banking center, but as computers and look-alike suburban 
branch offices change the face of the industry, Britain is left with an urban 
landscape littered with old offices not readily adaptable to modern banking 
methods. Finding uses for them is not always easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many old banks, designed to lure business, have elaborate architecture worthy 
of a church and they often are viewed as local landmarks. Preservationists try 
to keep out the wrecking balls and cringe when a McDonald's slaps the golden 
arches onto an old facade. 
</P>
<P>
 "A pub is not a bad use," said Gordon Higgott, an officer with English 
Heritage, which reviews new uses for listed buildings. "It's no longer suitable 
as a bank -- and buildings have to pay their way in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A gathering of early afternoon drinkers nodded their approval recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always nice when you go to a new place to find a few faults, but there 
aren't any here," Patrick Kennedy said. "When you went to see the banker, you 
expected to see a grand hall. I'm very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The real Bank of England, known throughout London's financial district as the 
"Old Lady of Threadneedle Street," is apparently taking the transformation of 
its former digs with a dose of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's deputy governor, Rupert Pennant-Rea, plans to attend an opening 
ceremony next Tuesday and pull a few pints of beer out of the casks. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's about as much interest as the central bank is going to show in the 
brewing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no plans to open a pub in the Bank of England," the central bank said 
through a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, when the original bank building was designed in the mid-1880s, 
right next to London's Law Courts, construction crews had to knock down two 
pubs to make way for it.

SMALL ON-LINE SERVICES OFFER OPPORTUNITY, MAYBE A PROFIT; TECHNOLOGY: BULLETIN 
BOARDS PROVIDE SUBSCRIBERS WITH A COZY, LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE TO PRODIGY AND 
COMPUSERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For thousands of Southern Californians, the route to the information 
superhighway runs through a spare bedroom in Greg Gooden's Van Nuys home. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 60 people convene there at a time, using their personal computers 
and telephone lines to socialize, play games, use the library and pick up their 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden's bedroom is the home of the Annex, one of tens of thousands of small 
computer bulletin board services springing up around the country. With start-up 
costs as low as a few thousand dollars, bulletin boards are a good 
entrepreneurial opportunity for the technically savvy -- and provide personal 
computer users with a friendly, low-cost alternative to national on-line 
services such as Prodigy, CompuServe and America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you buy a modem, it usually comes with a trial subscription to one of 
the national services like Prodigy," says Dale Porter, 31, who runs a bulletin 
board called KBBS out of his home in Northridge. "But when the trial period 
ends and Prodigy sends you this big bill, you realize it's time to start 
shopping around. That's how a lot of my customers find me." 
</P>
<P>
 The mom-and-pop bulletin boards -- of which there are now an estimated 57,000 
nationwide, according to Boardwatch magazine -- have nowhere near the array of 
on-line publications, databases, and shopping opportunities that the national 
services offer. But small bulletin boards can often provide a cozy electronic 
meeting place for people with special interests -- dentists, for example, or 
stamp collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 And local, general-interest bulletin boards such as the Annex and KBBS are a 
bargain for PC owners who simply want to meet people through electronic "chat" 
sessions, play games and send electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe, for example, charges $20 to join and levies a monthly fee of 
$8.95. Customers get unlimited access to the basic services, such as on-line 
publications and news files, but they can send only 60 mail messages a month 
without paying extra, and many of the more interesting services carry 
surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Annex and KBBS, by contrast, offer full use of their systems for a flat 
rate. KBBS has a one-year subscription, which limits users to 90 minutes of 
on-line time each day, at $9.50 a month. A comparable subscription at the Annex 
costs $8 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some see other benefits as well. "One big attraction of a board like KBBS is 
its social character," says Sharon Landers, 32, who has been a KBBS subscriber 
for two years. "I enjoy chatting with other users. Basically it's an on-line 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 KBBS and the Annex provide several channels where users can engage in live 
trivia games, group conversations or private chats. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers can obtain games, spreadsheet and word-processing programs, and even 
buy products from an on-line shopping service. Subscribers can also send 
electronic mail to others, including anyone outside the system who has an 
address on the Internet, the worldwide computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 For the proprietors, however, making bulletin boards into profitable 
businesses is no easy feat. Gooden, a former office manager, logs 18-hour days 
surrounded by an array of computers, monitors and technical reference manuals. 
And even though his board is relatively successful -- with 2,000 active users, 
it generates about $7,000 a month in subscription revenue -- all the profits go 
back into the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, experts believe that only about 5% of all bulletin board systems 
are profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Higgins, who runs the BrainStorm bulletin board in Simi Valley, knows the 
financial challenges well. 
</P>
<P>
 "After four years . . . I haven't come close to breaking even," Higgins, 32, 
said. "Last year BrainStorm grossed $7,000. But I spent $14,000 upgrading and 
adding new features." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, he has a full-time job as an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't mind dipping into my own pocket to improve the system," 
Higgins said. "I'm convinced that the BBS industry has a big future, and I want 
to be a part of it."

OPPOSITES ATTACK TONIGHT; PRO FOOTBALL: CONFIDENT RAIDERS TRY TO BUILD TOWARD A 
BIG SEASON AGAINST UNSURE RAMS IN ANAHEIM.

<TEXT>
<P>
 One team, confident of its direction, views tonight's game as just another 
dress rehearsal, an elaborate practice session complete with officials and a 
big crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The other team, unsure where it is going -- on the field or off -- sees 
tonight's game as crucial, as important as anything that will follow. It is 
time for this club to stop practicing and start producing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 They share Southern California and they'll share the field tonight when they 
meet in an exhibition game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But they share little else. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders appear headed for a successful season. Even Art Shell, the team's 
usually reticent coach, concedes that his team is talented. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory tonight would be nice, but the Raiders have already proved what they 
can do in this exhibition season, having beaten their division archrival, the 
Denver Broncos, in Barcelona, and the defending Super Bowl champion Cowboys in 
Dallas, before losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will be more concerned with some key personnel decisions that have 
to be made before the season opener two weeks hence. 
</P>
<P>
 Who will be the starting running backs? 
</P>
<P>
 Will Greg Biekert or Rob Fredrickson be able to do the job as the starting 
middle linebacker? 
</P>
<P>
 Will starting wide receiver Alexander Wright hold off the challenge of James 
Jett? 
</P>
<P>
 Can Nick Bell, the starting fullback in this game a year ago, hang onto a 
roster spot at tight end? 
</P>
<P>
 Is Scott Davis ready to take a spot as a starter on the defensive line? 
</P>
<P>
 Where will veteran defensive back Albert Lewis fit into the secondary? 
</P>
<P>
 Ty Montgomery has been the starting tailback this exhibition season, with 
Napoleon McCallum at fullback, both of them returning to the roles they filled 
at the end of last season. But waiting in the wings are the two high-profile 
free agents signed in the off-season, tailback Harvey Williams and fullback Tom 
Rathman. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Rathman, a veteran of eight years in the league and two Super Bowls, 
expecting to be the opening-night starter? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to believe I'm expecting that," he said. "It's a good situation 
here, but at the same time, I don't know what they're thinking. I feel like I 
need to establish myself and earn the job as opposed to them giving it to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not frustrated at the way they're handling things at this point. It's 
good. Nap and Ty have been here a long time and they deserve to be there right 
now. It's going to take somebody proving themselves to get them out of the 
starting spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the Raiders have never put a big premium on who starts. They have 
always been more concerned with who finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 As for concern over the Raider running game, which sank to a preseason low 
last Saturday when the team gained only 50 yards rushing, it is difficult to 
form any solid opinions based on the exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raiders' proficiency with the passing game hasn't left much time for 
the running game to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No back has been in there long enough to develop a rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Steelers put up an eight-man front at times last week, yet the Raiders 
kept running. That would not figure to be the case in a game that counted. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the field tonight is a team that knows who will do the 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 But not much else. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis, coming off a season in which he gained 1,429 yards, is the 
primary ballcarrier. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and quarterback Chris Miller are only going to be as successful as 
their offensive line. And right now, that's not too successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox keeps moving his linemen around, trying to find an effective 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still an evaluation process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's definitely not an evolution process, because the Rams have decided to go 
back to experience over youth, putting 18-year veteran Jackie Slater into the 
lineup for tonight's game at right tackle in place of two-year veteran Darryl 
Ashmore. 
</P>
<P>
 After having 99 yards of offensive output called back last week against the 
New England Patriots because of penalties, after top draft choice Wayne Gandy, 
the left tackle, was whistled four times for lining up illegally, Knox has 
shaken up his line again, looking for stability from Slater, 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox will also put Bill Schultz in at left guard in place of Tom Newberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I would like to see first is the elimination of the self-inflicted 
wounds, the lining up off-side, for example," Knox said. "You don't give 
yourself a chance to win if it's first and 15." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams haven't done much winning of late, regular season or exhibition 
season. They were 5-11 last year, have lost seven consecutive exhibition games 
over the last three years and are 0-2 this summer, having lost to the Green Bay 
Packers on the road and New England at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have scored only one touchdown in the two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the uncertainty over where they will play after this season and 
last week's home crowd of 24,847 is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have agreed to play in the Coliseum this season after extensive, 
costly reconstruction work repaired the earthquake damage. But owner Al Davis 
wants some assurances about improvements to the old stadium before signing a 
long-term deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams aren't ready to sign anything in Anaheim. Instead, they are looking 
at their options around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 So tonight these teams meet, perhaps for the last game of this summer freeway 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 By next year, who knows? Occasional Rivals 
</P>
<P>
 It's only about 30 miles from the Coliseum to Anaheim Stadium, but proximity 
hasn't done much to get the Los Angeles football teams together on a football 
field since the Raiders moved here for the 1982 season. A look at the results 
of their meetings since the move: Year: Result

HECK OF A HORSE TRAINER; HUNTINGTON BEACH'S BAFFERT TURNS PASSION FOR RACING 
INTO LUCRATIVE BUSINESS, AND ALL-AROUND GOOD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is early morning on the back stretch at Del Mar, the time when a racetrack 
is at work, not play. The coastal fog has drifted away, and the pungent odor of 
the barns is in the air as stalls are mucked and the sun starts to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Baffert is standing in the little grandstand on the backstretch with his 
stopwatch, checking the progress of a 2 year old named High Stakes Player, who 
is getting a breezy workout from exercise rider Christian Mendoza. "Don't let 
him go," Baffert orders into the two-way radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to watch those riders," he says, smiling. "They like to get a 
little test drive sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Baffert has become one of California's leading thoroughbred 
trainers. He had trained a few thoroughbreds before but mostly concentrated on 
his quarter horse stable at Los Alamitos. Since he switched on a full-time 
basis, his horses have won more than $1 million each year, highlighted by 1992, 
when they won just under $1.7 million and his stable's Thirty Slews won the 
prestigious Breeder's Cup Sprint. His horses already have won almost $1.2 
million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Baffert looks as though he just walked in from a nearby beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He's wearing sneakers, khaki shorts and a T-shirt you can buy at those 
eclectic specialty shops. He especially likes this one, which advertises a 
restaurant he insists doesn't exist. The shirt carries a slogan: "Home of the 
</P>
<P>
 Original Shark Taco." Underneath, it says: "It's Hell In A Shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Baffert laughs and says: "There are a lot of days I feel just like that, hell 
in a shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on those days, Baffert enjoys being at Del Mar. He says it allows him to 
be himself, the casual dresser and the free spirit. When he gets dressed up, 
it's in blue jeans and a bright, open-collared shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 You can tell he likes the constant schmoozing, in the track's own special 
language, with the hot walkers, grooms and other trainers. A friendly word 
here, a wisecrack there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't spend much time in the Turf Club, though," he says, referring to the 
posh dining room. "But it probably hurts my business, too." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows he is exaggerating a bit when he smiles and says: "A lot of people go 
there to talk about how much money they have. Hey, I don't want to know how 
much money you have. I want to know how much you're going to spend." 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not around the track, Baffert lives in Huntington Beach with his 
wife, Sherry, and their four children. The oldest is 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always said that if I moved to California I'd live by the ocean," he says. 
It's also not that far from from Santa Anita, where he normally maintains his 
stable, or from Hollywood Park or Del Mar. "I do most of my racing here in 
California now," he says. "There's no reason to go anywhere else except for a 
few of the big races." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baffert grew up on the family cattle ranch near the Mexican border in Arizona 
and became involved in quarter horse racing naturally. He started riding match 
races in high school in nearby Nogales. After high school, he tried his hand as 
a jockey at Los Alamitos and quickly found he was too big. He returned home, 
enrolled in the University of Arizona's racetrack industry program and 
graduated from there. 
</P>
<P>
 His first job after college was as a salesman, but he found he wasn't suited 
for it, and quickly gravitated to training quarter horses. He did well 
immediately in Arizona. But Baffert says: "The best thing that could have 
happened to me was when they closed the track there, and I moved to 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos was good to him as a trainer. He quickly established himself as a 
leader, and in 1986, he had the nation's top quarter horse, Gold Coast Express. 
He also started working with thoroughbreds in the late 1980s at the 
encouragement of Mike Pegram, who owned thoroughbreds as well as the quarter 
horses Baffert trained for him and Hal Earnhardt at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thoroughbred Baffert bought was Thirty Slews. It was at the yearling 
sales at Keeneland, and Baffert spent almost twice what he had intended when he 
bid $30,000. But at that price, Thirty Slews turned out to be an unbelievable 
bargain. Not only did he win a Breeder's Cup race at Gulfstream Park in 1992, 
he won more than $800,000 after Baffert sold the horse to Pegram and others. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Baffert doesn't do is buy a horse and keep it for himself. "I 
wouldn't be in business very long if I did that," he says. "The owners might 
think I'd be trying to keep the best ones for myself. But one thing I do is 
handpick most of the horses I have. That way I know what I'm getting. When you 
buy a horse, it's like getting married." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his style is easygoing, Baffert treats it as serious business. The 
owners are putting up real money, although most of them have plenty of it. They 
buy his skill and instincts, as much as the care the horses receive and the 
space they occupy. A big stable has its own big overhead, and Baffert has 32 
horses at this Del Mar meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 When Baffert started in the quarter horse business, it was only him, a few 
horses and one groom. Today his payroll includes an assistant trainer, grooms, 
hot walkers and exercise riders, and all work for him 12 months a year. "The 
money I get from the owners mostly pays for the overhead," Baffert says. "How 
well I do depends on how much we win." Trainers normally get 10% of the purses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's mid-morning now, and Baffert is in his makeshift office in a room at the 
corner of his barn. He's keeping things light with those who pass by. 
</P>
<P>
 "My philosophy about life is that we may not be in it for a long time, but 
we're in it for a good time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he adds: "There's enough stress in this business without adding more. . . 
. But sometimes around here it's like it was being in a submarine during the 
war. You're always checking for the damage report." 
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks ago, one of the stable's most promising colts, Flagship, died 
when an intestine ruptured. A little before noon on this day, Baffert gets more 
bad news. He is called outside the stall of Thirty Slews, now an aging 7 year 
old. A veterinarian shows him the ultrasound of one of the horse's ankles, and 
it confirms there is tissue damage. It is not unexpected, and Baffert is 
prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll retire him then," Baffert says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not lame, or anything like that," he adds later. "We won't drop him down 
in class, though, and run him in those kinds of races and take any chances on 
hurting him more. He's meant too much to us to do that to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty Slews was entered in the Breeder's Cup sprint again in 1993 at Santa 
Anita and finished fourth, but he wasn't the same horse. "He wasn't the same 
physically after that first Breeder's Cup," Baffert says. "But he picked the 
right time to run the race of his life for us. You don't forget that, though. . 
. . There's not a day goes by that I don't walk by and pet him." 
</P>
<P>
 And Baffert, questioned about his feelings about Thirty Slews going into 
retirement, thought for a few seconds. "Well," he says. "I guess it's better 
him than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Time does not stand still in racing any more than in anything else. There 
always are going to be newer and younger stars in the stable. 
</P>
<P>
 For Baffert, they have colorful names such as Letthebighossroll, bought for 
$80,000 and now a winner of more than $500,000. There's also 
Letthebigcajundoit, who has yet to race but has the breeding, the size and the 
look of a winner. "I can hardly wait for him," Baffert says.  
</P>
<P>
 Both of those horses are owned by Pegram, a letthegoodtimesroll kind of owner 
who lives in Mt. Vernon, Wash., and owns 11 McDonald's franchises. Pegram named 
one of his horses Golden Arches, another Burger and Fries. Golden Arches has 
won more than $400,000, but Burgers and Fries, despite an expensive price tag, 
turned out to be mostly hot dog and went to the claiming races. 
</P>
<P>
 Another horse in the stable is 4-year-old gelding Sir Hutch, owned by Bob 
Lewis of Newport Beach. "He's one of the best sprinters in the country right 
now," Baffert says. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually owners name the horses, but Baffert named Thirty Slews, a grandson of 
the folk hero Seattle Slew, winner of the 1977 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 When Baffert came back from Keeneland, a stable hand asked him how much he had 
paid for the big gray colt. "Thirty (bleeping) slews," Baffert roared, 
concerned that that he paid so much money for a horse without a buyer. "So 
that's what we ended up naming him. But we had to leave out the (bleeping)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is early afternoon now, and the track is starting to come alive. The cars 
are starting to maneuver their way between the orange pylons on Jimmy Durante 
Boulevard, and the racing silks are being unfurled. It is nearing post time for 
the first race, and Baffert settles into his clubhouse box. Pegram, along with 
others, will join him soon. Two of their horses are on the day's card. 
</P>
<P>
 Pegram is outgoing, and he enjoys talking about racing and his association 
with Baffert. They have become good friends, and their friendship endures even 
after the days when one of their heavy favorites is beaten in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Bob when we were racing quarter horses," Pegram says. "We both ended up 
in El Paso one night trying to get flights back to L.A. They were all booked 
and neither one of us wanted to wait it out in El Paso, so we decided we might 
as well fly to Las Vegas . . . I knew right then I'd found myself a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I've learned in this game is that you're going to lose more than 
you're going to win, so you'd better have a trainer that you can have some fun 
with, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Baffert is 41, but some people around racing might think he's a bit older. 
That's because Peagram ran an ad in the Daily Racing Form when Baffert turned 
38; Pegram congratulated him on his "40th birthday" three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite occasional practical jokes, Baffert says he enjoys his relationships 
with his owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fortunate from that standpoint," Baffert says. "They're good 
winners and good losers. Mike has been known to kick a few chairs, but it 
doesn't last that long." Pegram laughs and says: "Just through my third beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Baffert's own goals in racing are fairly simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to keep my owners in the business and for them to do well," he 
says. "And I want to make a good living for myself. I didn't get into this 
business to get rich." 
</P>
<P>
 Baffert is not one to put himself on the spot, but the competitive fire 
flames, and he says: "I'd like to win as many Breeder's Cup races as I can . . 
. and maybe at least once have a horse in the Kentucky Derby who really has a 
chance to win it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's about time for the fifth race, and Baffert goes to the paddock to saddle 
a brown mare named Common Threads. Baffert's wife and three of the children 
have arrived. The kids are young, all bouncy and blond, and they look as though 
they have just stepped out of a cereal commercial. Baffert takes the baby, 
Savannah, into his arms and walks around the paddock area with her, chatting 
and smiling broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pegram's final instructions to jockey Martin Pedroza: "Come back tired . . . " 
Instead, she gets caught in traffic and comes back fifth. But there's always 
the eighth, where Argolid is one of the betting favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Argolid breaks clean in the $60,000, seven-furlong race for 3 year olds and 
appears to have control with Corey Nakatani, one of Baffert's favorite jockeys. 
But El Alerta comes from out of nowhere down the stretch to catch Argolid and 
win in a photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, second isn't too bad," Sherry says. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a race Baffert thought the horse could win. It was not the best of 
days, but it certainly wasn't one of those "hell in a shell" days either.  
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, Bob's really disappointed when he loses," Sherry Baffert says, 
"but on those days when he comes home and sees his children, everything is 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 And there will be more races that can be won tomorrow.

OWNERS' MAIN WEAPON HASN'T BEEN UNSHEATHED; BASEBALL: IF A LEGAL IMPASSE IN 
NEGOTIATIONS IS DECLARED AFTER THE SEASON, THE PLAYERS COULD BE BE REPLACED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Geoghegan, a Chicago labor expert who extols the virtues of unionism, 
posed an interesting question recently: 
</P>
<P>
 Without Frank Thomas or Ozzie Guillen, can there be the White Sox? 
</P>
<P>
 "They can put together another team, but suppose Frank and Ozzie go across the 
street and somebody wants to set up the Green Sox?" Geoghegan said. "Who do you 
want to go see, Frank Thomas or some bush leaguer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of replacement players might seem far-fetched, but with the baseball 
strike in its eighth day and counting, some see it coming to that. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the Major League Baseball Players Assn. is bracing for the day 
the owners declare a legal impasse, or collective-bargaining deadlock. Put 
simply, management could declare further negotiations pointless and impose its 
last best offer unilaterally sometime after the season ends in October. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an economic weapon afforded management by the National Labor Act, and if 
used effectively, could break union solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to get people to cross the picket line," Geoghegan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple threat of an impasse caused the players to set the strike deadline 
this month, when they had the most leverage, said Lauren Rich, assistant 
general counsel of the players union. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs usually make most of their money at the end of the season, when fan 
interest is piqued by the pennant races. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't strike by trying to get an agreement acceptable to them, then 
they are forced to live under unilateral conditions once the season ends," Rich 
said of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 They might have to play under such conditions anyway, but at least by striking 
they used their most potent weapon to counter the owners' proposed salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, dismissed the idea that the 
owners might declare an impasse. He said that although the law allows 
management to implement its last best offer once a stalemate is reached, it 
cannot impose those conditions on employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union tells the public that we have the right to impose as if we can put 
the salary cap in without their consent," he said. "We can't do that. An 
implementation . . . only means we have the right to offer to play under our 
last best offer. And they don't have to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreement over the impasse illustrates the fissure that has separated 
the parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the players' circle say the owners plotted this course more than a 
year ago, when devising the salary cap, a proposal modeled after the NBA's to 
curb the escalating salaries of individuals in an effort to spread the wealth 
uniformly. Knowing the players would not give up lucrative contracts, the 
argument goes, the owners forced a showdown that would lead to a bargaining 
impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, they say, it took the owners 18 months to devise a salary cap, 
leaving them perhaps only three months to declare a legal impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 When players talked about striking a year ago, the owners agreed not to 
unilaterally implement as long as players did not strike, Rich said. This time, 
the owners refused to make that pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why players are on strike today," she said. "The players viewed that 
as no choice at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said he never made such a promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commitment I made was that we would not lock out or do anything during 
this year's baseball season," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the dispute is not resolved by October, Ravitch said, he was unsure whether 
the negotiations will have reached an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I will do," he said. "I'm not saying I would implement. I 
am saying I won't give up the right to." 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Rich: "When they won't promise they won't, we have to assume they 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 But if that is true, the owners are taking a risk. Their product is the work 
force, one that cannot easily be altered without damaging the game's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the owners must tread carefully. But so must the players. If an impasse is 
declared, the players' options are limited. They can continue to strike, but 
striking during the off-season means nothing. They can strike during spring 
training or the first months of the 1995 season, but it would have little 
financial impact on the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they could try to fight the impasse by filing a claim of unfair labor 
practices with the National Labor Relations Board. The players would ask the 
board to stop the owners from implementing it through an injunction until the 
collective-bargaining agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a favorable ruling, the players must prove the owners negotiated in bad 
faith. Jerry Hunter, general counsel of the NLRB for the Bush Administration, 
said only 30% of the claims during his tenure were considered meritorious. Of 
those claims, the board settled 93% without going before an administrative law 
judge to get a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what the players might claim: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The owners used delaying tactics by spending 18 months to come up with a 
proposal and then declared an impasse after three or four months of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The salary cap was an unreasonable bargaining demand because it was so far 
beyond anything in any previous contract. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The owners failed to designate an agent with sufficient bargaining 
authority. Don Fehr, executive director of the union, has claimed Ravitch does 
not have the power to do anything except present the salary-cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The NLRB's regional office in New York would most likely handle the case 
because the disputing parties are located there. But most labor law experts 
consider the players' arguments weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hard to prove (bad faith), especially with the recent history of 
the labor board," said Steve Schlossberg, former Labor undersecretary. "Bad 
faith means you proposed something so ridiculous that it offends, and the 
(owners) haven't been quite that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch is not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the slightest hesitancy whatsoever, I can tell you we can withstand 
the scrutiny of any unfair-labor-practice charge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the dispute lands in the purview of the NLRB, it can take months, even 
years, to be concluded. If a regional director agrees with a charge of unfair 
labor practices, the case will be heard by an administrative law judge. It 
could take two years for a decision unless the parties settle outside of court. 
With the appeals process, it could take another five to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just not something anyone has the stomach for on this side," Rich 
said. "We already spent five years getting $280 million from the (owners on 
collusion findings). We don't want to go through that again."

PLAYING FOR KEEPS; DARLENE MAY WON SO MANY BATTLES ON COURT, BUT NOW CANCER IS 
HER TOUGHEST OPPONENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's haunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene May did everything right. 
</P>
<P>
 She has always done everything right. You don't get 500 coaching victories and 
three national titles any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost by herself, she coached the Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball program 
into national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't mean anything now. 
</P>
<P>
 May learned last month that she has breast cancer, that it has spread to her 
liver, that she has six months to five years to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer?  
</P>
<P>
 It didn't seem possible. At 53, she exercised religiously, ate well and was in 
great health. She has never smoked, didn't drink to excess. 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer didn't seem possible. She'd had a mammogram last year. Same as 
every year.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it doesn't seem real, even now. It would have been discovered 
before. How could this happen? Dammit -- she did everything right. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't anything she did. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, May came home and found a message to call her doctor regarding her 
mammogram. That could only mean bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 It was too late to call that evening, though, and May didn't sleep much that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 When morning finally came, May called. 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem, you're fine," the nurse told her. 
</P>
<P>
 May remembers that call perfectly because the information she got was 
perfectly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The test result had remarks written by the radiologist: Instruct the patient 
to follow up with more specific tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the person on the other end had looked at the wrong chart or read it 
incorrectly, the wrong information was given.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, May's doctor died of a heart attack. May theorizes that he 
never saw her mammogram results. When she found another doctor, his office 
assumed that she had followed up as directed by the radiologist's notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But May never knew about the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she known, she could have had surgery to remove the cancer before it 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have any message," May said softly, still weak from chemotherapy 
treatments three days earlier, "it is: You get tests taken regularly and ask to 
look at the results." 
</P>
<P>
 May, who declined to discuss whether she was considering legal action, now 
lives in Oregon, near doctors and facilities she trusts.  
</P>
<P>
 If she was coaching, she would be back in her routine: In the office by 8 
every morning, in the gym shortly after that, setting up schedules, making sure 
players have classes and wading through the paper work. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oregon, she has no routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wake up thanking God that I'm still here," she said. "I took so much 
for granted for so long. It's tough -- I'm just so scared, basically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wake up and ask, 'Is this still here? Yes it is, it didn't go away this 
morning. . . . It didn't go away overnight. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who knows someone who has cancer knows it is not a good fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds are not good. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemo treatment is hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, you take poison to kill the cancer cells. They tell you it's in 
tiny amounts, but it makes you sick.  
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, the recovery from chemotherapy is awful. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine going into a room with 20 other cancer patients once every three 
weeks, so you can have three needles stuck into your arm, or depending on your 
cancer, an intravenous drip of saline solution and drugs to kill the 
fastest-growing cells in your body. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why your hair falls out -- hair grows quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to be brave to pick up your hair and look in the mirror. By then you 
know the truth even if you feel fine. 
</P>
<P>
 You're fighting a monster. 
</P>
<P>
 So you keep going to treatments every two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 You do this knowing that for 72 hours afterward you might suffer severe 
headaches, fever and vomiting -- as long as you have something to vomit. Then 
it's just retching. The sleep you get is born of exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll get anti-nausea medicine, but it's overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days, you'll feel better. But you'll still be exhausted. Then you 
get to look forward to your next treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle becomes mentally exhausting. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes you appreciate a good game of cards. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one years ago, May was hired to coach women's basketball at Cal Poly 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually I kind of stumbled into coaching," she said. The former coach (Judy 
Brame) took another job (at Cal State Northridge), and I knew some people. No 
one had the job and it was getting pretty late, so they called me in August and 
asked if I was interested. I was, but I didn't know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
 She only knew that she loved the game, was intense and hated to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 She did very little of that. 
</P>
<P>
 May took over a team that had been 6-16 in 1973-74 and turned it into a 16-6 
team. The next season, Pomona was 20-6.  
</P>
<P>
 Then things really started to roll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third year, the Broncos joined the conference they dominated for the 
next 18 years, the Southern California Athletic Assn., which became the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 May's conference record is 195 victories and eight losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked at that the other day, even I thought, 'Oh my, that's a heck of 
a record,' " May said. "I think people can get to 500 victories by hanging 
around long enough, but that conference record is pretty good. A lot of people 
will have trouble doing better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 She got her 100th victory in only her fourth season. And she averaged 26 
victories a season in building a 519-119 overall record. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other women's basketball coaches have more than 500 victories, Pat 
Summitt of Tennessee and Jody Conradt of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, May won the first of three national titles.  
</P>
<P>
 "That really has to be the high point -- it was so special," May said. "The 
first one is always different for some reason. I remember walking off the court 
with my arm around (former player) Jackie White, happy as two hogs in mud." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the team lost seven games with its 28 victories that season, May says 
it might have been the best in terms of talent and what the players got out of 
their talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were very few teams that could have beaten us that year and I don't 
care what division," she said. "We were good and we played at a very high 
level." 
</P>
<P>
 May's teams won titles again in 1985 and '86 and finished second three other 
times. Pomona remains the only team to have earned berths in every NCAA women's 
tournament at any level. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my eyes, she is a legend," said La Habra's Paula Tezak, who played for May 
on the championship teams of 1985 and '86. "I was close to her as a player. She 
would do anything she could for her players and we felt that we would do 
anything for her." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the attitude that bred such success. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of May's players were chosen Division II player of the year, White in 
1983, Vickie Mitchell in '86, Debra Larsen in '87, and Cathy Gooden in '89. 
White, Mitchell and Larsen were selected to the NCAA Division II all-decade 
team as well. Sixteen of May's players were selected as All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaches like Darlene May come along about once in a lifetime," said Karen 
Miller, Pomona's athletic director. "Her contributions to women's basketball 
and women's athletics are too immense to measure." 
</P>
<P>
 That has not gone unrecognized. May has won two Women's Basketball Coaches 
Assn. (WBCA) national-coach-of-the-year awards and been voted CCAA coach of the 
year four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Significant indeed, but not good enough to earn places on her wall. 
</P>
<P>
 That's for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 May also is a widely respected and experienced basketball referee. Her 
officiating career reached a high point when she was selected to work the South 
Korea-Australia women's basketball game in the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 That made her the first woman to referee an Olympic basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics are special for her because records might be broken, but no one 
will replace her as the first woman basketball referee. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, she did everything right and was subsequently selected to referee 
the bronze-medal game between China and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "That had a lot of meaning," May said. "It was something that I worked a long 
time for -- traveling to a lot of countries and working international games. It 
may sound glamorous, but believe me, there's nothing glamorous about being the 
only woman referee, stuck with all foreigners who are yelling at you, and every 
one being a man."  
</P>
<P>
 Her experience as a referee helped make May one of the game's most 
knowledgeable coaches. Her teams were smart too. She had them take referee 
tests every year, and passed along her knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 She was often accused of intimidating referees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's true, what can I tell you except that it is not my fault?," she 
said. "If they are intimidated, what am I supposed to do? The other coaches 
scream at them too." * 
</P>
<P>
 It fell to assistant Paul Thomas to call the players and tell them about May's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They responded just like I did, maybe just like everyone," Thomas said. "It 
was very much a shock. We all think we're invincible -- we all thought she was 
invincible. But we all know she's going to do what she taught us. She's going 
to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has become interim coach, a difficult position if only because he is 
following a legend.  
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I feel what Darlene has accomplished can't be matched," he said. 
"But I cannot be Darlene May. No one can. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a personal and coaching standpoint, I miss just having her around: The 
time in the office, the time on the road, before and after games, meals and 
scouting -- the whole process. But you have to look at it this way: I've spent 
the last four years learning from the best." 
</P>
<P>
 May said that the calls and notes from those who heard about her illness have 
been touching. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it's amazing," she said. "I never knew how many friends I had out 
there. I'm going to miss the camaraderie." 
</P>
<P>
 She is surprised by what she already misses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think you'll miss the kids because there are so many problems: 
getting them in the right classes, injuries, boyfriends and all those kinds of 
things. But you even miss that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss every day going to the gym. This definitely was not part of my plan -- 
I should be in that gym with Paul, running the basketball camp. The wins and 
losses, well, I'm sure I'll miss the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know, that's why I'm going to beat this thing. Even when I'm playing 
cards, I'll beat you. If I don't, I'm going to throw the cards all over the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 In this fight, May still is doing everything right. Darlene May By the Numbers

TOP HATS AND TALES; A DAY OF RACING AT ROYAL ASCOT IS A SPECTACLE IN SEVERAL 
WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Upon arrival at Heathrow Airport outside London, we ran into Arthur Hancock 
and his wife, Staci. Hancock was one of the owners of Gato Del Sol, the 
Kentucky Derby winner in 1982, and a partner in Sunday Silence, the Derby 
winner in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 We all had much too much luggage -- Pat and I had been on the road for four 
weeks -- and Staci was especially burdened with several large hat boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see," she said, "we'll be at Royal Ascot for all four days." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no greater sin for a woman than wearing the same hat twice at Royal 
Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hancocks had been to the mid-June meeting before, but this was going to be 
our first trip to the suburban London track, where the once-a-year 
Tuesday-to-Friday race meeting is billed as the British counterpart to a 
Breeders' Cup day in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank heaven for Royal Ascot's unique cocktail of fast horses, pretty girls 
and pageantry," wrote John Oaksey in the Telegraph. "(For four days) British 
racing can and will put on a spectacle the like of which can be found nowhere 
in the world. More than any other race meeting, except the Grand National (the 
steeplechase near Liverpool) and to a lesser extent the (English) Derby, Ascot 
reaches well outside sport's normal audience. For all kinds of social and 
sartorial reasons that have nothing whatever to do with horses, or even 
betting, many people simply long to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Ascot is a dizzying mix of hats, horses and hobnobbing. Even the men 
wear hats -- gray top hats that are the codas to their three-piece morning 
suits. Several weeks before, I had faxed my measurements to Moss Bros, the 
97-year-old London firm that rents about 10,000 outfits every year for Royal 
Ascot, and my ensemble was waiting for me at its shop near Piccadilly Circus. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, a lot of us had laughed at the thought of Bobby Frankel, the 
Brooklyn-born trainer from California, appearing in such a get-up at Ascot, but 
he couldn't have looked any more foolish than I did. The fit was perfect, but I 
guess some men never look good in hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat and I were to meet her sister and her sister's husband -- Margaret and 
Dave O'Donovan -- at an underground station not far from Ascot, so we took the 
railway from our hotel in Kensington. I seemed to be the only man on the train 
in a morning suit. Remember the opening scene in the movie "Quick Change?" in 
which Bill Murray, on his way by commuter train to rob a bank in New York, is 
dressed like a clown? Well, that's how I felt on the London underground, en 
route to Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ascot's vast parking lot, which is actually a golf course, Dave O'Donovan 
got out of his car, looked around and said, "Every Rolls in Britain must be 
here." We were not traveling in one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 We had been advised that cameras were not permitted inside the track. A London 
newspaper, doing a scouting report on Royal Ascot, had listed the "snob factor" 
as a nine on a scale of 10. In the parking lot, Dave tipped an attendant to 
take a picture of the four of us. I didn't know that Dave had already tipped 
the impromptu photographer and also gave him something. All of this largess 
would have been quite worthwhile, had there been film in the camera. Dave 
didn't talk to Margaret for about five minutes because of that. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at our gate, and Dave had to leave his camera in a locker. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II had already arrived with the Queen Mother, the Prince of 
Wales and other members of the royal family. They reached the Royal Enclosure 
by horse-driven landau. We would be seeing them later, we told ourselves, 
because we had two credentials for the Royal Enclosure. Sports Illustrated had 
considered covering Ascot, but the assignment was canceled when the Queen 
wouldn't consent to a 30-minute interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gamel, the horse owner and former board member at Santa Anita and 
Hollywood Park, had told me that he was going to Ascot, but it seemed pointless 
to look for him. In these morning suits, all of the men looked alike. How do 
penguins manage? 
</P>
<P>
 There are six races daily at Ascot, which besides the Royal Ascot meeting runs 
only 19 other days the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Anne, with an interest in racing, had the original course built in 1711, 
six miles from Windsor Castle. As it is now configured, Royal Ascot is a 
triangular course of about 1 3/4 miles on rolling land, which puts a premium on 
stamina. There is a rise of about three-eighths of a mile that takes the horses 
to the stretch turn, and it's still uphill through the stretch, for all but the 
last furlong of the 4 1/2-furlong run. 
</P>
<P>
 In England, the races are listed by post times, not numerically. The first 
race is the 2:30, the second the 3:05, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Barathea, the colt who forgot to turn left at the start of the Breeders' Cup 
Mile at Santa Anita last fall, made his first start since then and won the 
2:30, the Queen Anne Stakes. The 3:05, the Prince of Wales Stakes, was won by 
Muhtarram, who was saddled by John Gosden, the trainer who was based in 
Southern California for 10 years before he returned to England in 1989. At 
Royal Ascot, the trainers also dress in top hats and tails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not the best thing to wear when you're saddling horses," trainer Clive 
Brittain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to everyone except me, our foursome cashed its first tickets in the 
3:45, the St. James Palace Stakes, which at $350,000 was the richest race of 
the day. Grand Lodge beat Distant View by a head, under an all-out ride by Mick 
Kinane, the 35-year-old Irish jockey who is the strongest and perhaps the best 
rider in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinane's whipping was so spirited that the stewards, although letting Grand 
Lodge's victory stand, gave the jockey a two-day suspension, saying that he had 
used unreasonable force and raised the whip above shoulder height. 
</P>
<P>
 England's whip rule has been controversial since it was adopted a few years 
ago, and Kinane's suspension revived the furor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to give Grand Lodge everything I did to get him up to win, and I paid 
the penalty," Kinane said. "It was the difference between winning and losing, 
and this is a classic example of where the rules conflict with winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Cecil, who trains Distant View, wants the whip rule changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying the better horse did not win, or taking away from Grand 
Lodge," Cecil said. "But it does make a mockery of the rules when our jockey 
(Pat Eddery) stuck to them and the other rider didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 As Dave made his way from our seats down to the apron in front of the track to 
cash on Grand Lodge, he was glad that Mick Kinane had ignored the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 We bet most of the day with Duggie Pye, a fine old English concern that is one 
of more than a dozen legalized bookmakers operating side by side at track 
level. You can bet through the tote, as they do at U.S. tracks, but the 
advantage in using bookmakers is that you can shop for the best price, and you 
get the odds on a horse at the time you make the bet. The bookies post their 
numbers on elevated chalkboards, taking the bets while an assistant with a 
spreadsheet does the manual computations. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 4:55, Margaret and I made our way over to the Royal Enclosure. Dave 
had dressed in a business suit, and only men in morning suits and women wearing 
hats covering the crowns of their heads are permitted in the enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Men in black derbies guard the gates, and their no-nonsense reputation is 
known throughout Europe. The sister of the Princess of Wales was once denied 
admission because she forgot her badge. And a few years ago, actress Joan 
Collins tried to enter with someone else's badge. She was caught and has been 
denied credentials ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 But we found a softy at the gate. Our credentials weren't what I thought they 
were, and he politely told us that we weren't allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," I said. "I'm from America. Do you think I'd be dressed like this if I 
didn't want to get in?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, all right, mate," he said. "Pop on in, but please don't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Enclosure looks like a casting call for "My Fair Lady." There are 
hats at Royal Ascot and then there are the hats in the enclosure. One woman was 
wearing a gray top hat like mine, only it was festooned with ostrich feathers. 
Another was wearing a wicker concoction that was a cross between a flying 
saucer and a giant banana. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, a woman wore a red, white and blue model that jutted out like 
a battleship on either side. People behind her couldn't see the races, so Sir 
Nicholas Beaumont, the clerk of the course, asked her to leave. She went to her 
car, changed to a smaller hat and came back in. 
</P>
<P>
 There are those social commentators who fear that too many badges are issued 
to the Royal Enclosure, that tackiness is around the corner for Royal Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ascot's been ruined," said Jeffrey Bernard, who writes a weekly column for 
the Spectator. "Many people go there to be seen, and not because it's the best 
racing in Europe. The hats get in the way of the bloody horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stand the people that go there. People who read Harper's & Queen, 
Tatler and Vogue. They don't know one end of a horse from another. They don't 
appreciate what they're seeing. Ascot's almost Python-esque now." 
</P>
<P>
 All I know is that we will go again. After the races, thousands in the crowd 
of 44,000 lingered as Lady Beaumont, the flag-waving wife of the clerk of the 
course, led a rousing community sing with the Grenadier Guards' band in a 
gazebo behind the six-story grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 We sang "Hello, Dolly," "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling," "Bring Back My Bonnie 
to Me," "The Beer Barrel Polka," and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 The lager and champagne never stopped flowing, but no one was tipsy enough to 
try turning over the bandstand, as had been attempted several years before. 
</P>
<P>
 And afterward, the police announced that they had randomly checked 66 drivers 
leaving Royal Ascot, and none had failed the intoxication test. That was the 
most extraordinary statistic on a truly extraordinary day.

JUDGE ORDERS MOORER-FOREMAN FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a perhaps unprecedented rebuke of a major boxing governing body, a Nevada 
state judge Friday night revived the once-canceled Michael Moorer-George 
Foreman heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight is back on," said Todd duBoef, an executive with Top Rank Inc., 
Foreman's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost 12 hours of court arguments Friday, Judge Donald Mosley ordered 
the World Boxing Assn. to sanction the Nov. 5 fight at the MGM Grand in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the WBA said it would strip Moorer of his title if he fought 
Foreman, saying that placing Foreman in the ring with a far-younger fighter 
posed serious health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, who is also the International Boxing Federation champion, refused to 
risk having the WBA belt taken away if he fought Foreman, causing his promoter, 
Dan Duva, to drop Foreman and replace him with Joe Hipp. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers representing Top Rank and Foreman filed suit last Monday charging 
that the WBA had ulterior motives in refusing the sanction, possibly including 
the influence of Don King, who promotes every fighter ranked in the WBA's top 
five heavyweights -- except for Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Henry Holmes, Foreman's attorney, Mosley, in issuing a mandatory 
injunction forcing the WBA to sanction the fight, ruled that the WBA did not 
follow its sanctioning rules and acted "arbitrarily and capriciously" and had 
"reasons other than were publicized" for refusing its sanction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am personally delighted that justice was done," Holmes said, "and that 
finally a boxing organization has been required to comply with the law." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Holmes, both Moorer's camp -- which was represented by Duva and 
Moorer manager John Davimos -- and representatives of the Nevada State Athletic 
Commission were ready Friday night to go ahead with the Moorer-Foreman fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman was present at the hearing, and Holmes said the fighter shook the 
hands of all the lawyers, hugged his wife and immediately returned to Malibu, 
where he had begun training for the bout.

BULLFROGS BEAT SAN JOSE TO WIN SERIES; ROLLER HOCKEY: ANAHEIM WINS, 7-6, AND 
STARTS THINKING OF THE REST OF THE PLAYOFFS. THE BLADES ARE NEXT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There was only mild celebration after the Bullfrogs defeated the San Jose 
Rhinos, 7-6, to win Game 2 and clinch their first-round Roller Hockey 
International playoff series Friday at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll savor tonight's victory for a little while, but we're only one quarter 
the way there," Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier said. "This is just step one." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gervais had two goals and two assists and Rob Laurie provided solid 
goaltending again, recording 40 saves in front of a crowd of 8,130. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Anaheim defeated San Jose, 8-5, in Game 1 Thursday, the Bullfrogs won 
the series two games to none and advanced to the Pacific Division finals. 
There, the Bullfrogs will meet the Blades, who finished the regular season with 
the best record in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 1 of the Pacific Division finals is Tuesday at The Pond with Game 2 
Wednesday at the Forum. If the teams split the two games, a 12-minute mini-game 
will follow the second game to decide the series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs' advancement into the next round was never a sure thing. San 
Jose pulled its goaltender in the final 1 1/2 minutes to try to erase the 
one-goal lead, but Laurie made 12 saves in the fourth quarter and the Bullfrogs 
shut out the Rhinos in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to single people out tonight because it was really a total team 
effort," Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kerr had one goal and two assists filling in for Brad McCaughey, who sat 
out the game with a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Langdon, who scored only three goals in the regular season, scored his 
third goal of the playoffs. He knocked in a rebound for the Bullfrogs' second 
power-play goal of the game and a 4-2 Anaheim lead with 4:51 remaining in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon's goal came after Gervais scored two first-half goals, both one-time 
shots from near the right faceoff circle. His second goal came with 9:28 
remaining in the second quarter, gave the Bullfrogs a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais led a productive power play that produced four goals for the 
Bullfrogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs gave themselves some breathing room in the third quarter, 
breaking a 4-4 tie by capitalizing on a double-minor roughing penalty to San 
Jose's Carl LeBlanc. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby McKillop scored his first goal of the playoffs off assists from Gervais 
and Steve Beadle, who had three assists. Kerr scored off of assists from Jim 
Brown and Joe Cook to push the lead to two with 2:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After San Jose's Mark Woolf scored to cut the lead to one, Rick Judson scored 
on a breakaway for Anaheim to make it 7-5 with 1:25 left in the third.

O'MALLEY PRAISES ADDITION OF OWNERS; BASEBALL: BUT THE DODGERS' OWNER URGES 
THAT SELIG CHOOSE A GROUP OF "COOL HEADS" TO JOIN NEGOTIATIONS NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dodger owner Peter O'Malley said Friday that the decision to have five owners 
join negotiator Richard Ravitch at the bargaining table in response to a 
request by federal mediators was an opportunity for something positive to 
happen. He added, however: "It would be a mistake to pick extremists from 
either end (of the ownership spectrum)." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley would not identify the extremists but said there are some owners 
whose selection by acting commissioner Bud Selig would not help the process. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 8 of the players strike, Selig said he had yet to finalize the group 
that will join Ravitch when bargaining talks with the players' union resume on 
Tuesday or Wednesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It was learned, however, that he will select a pool of 10 owners and club 
officials, with no more than five attending any negotiation session, of which 
there have been none since the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Selig-Prieb, Selig's 34-year-old daughter and the Milwaukee Brewers' 
vice president-general counsel, is thought to be among the five meeting with 
the union first. 
</P>
<P>
 Also likely to be in that group are Philadelphia Phillie Executive Vice 
President David Montgomery and Minnesota Twin General Manager Andy MacPhail, 
whose father, Lee, then American League president, helped settle the August 
1985 strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Selig has reserved the right to make changes over the weekend, 
but the pool is also expected to include Chicago White Sox owner Jerry 
Reinsdorf, Toronto Blue Jay President Paul Beeston, Colorado Rockies owner 
Jerry McMorris, Boston Red Sox CEO John Harrington, Houston Astro owner Drayton 
McLane, Seattle Mariner CEO John Ellis and Atlanta Brave President Stan Kasten. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said he was not specifically asked by the mediators to select 
representatives of the big, middle and small markets, but was doing it anyway, 
spanning ownership's approach to revenue sharing and the salary-cap proposal 
that the union has said it will not accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be as fair as I can," he said. "All points of view will be represented." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is all window dressing, with the owners unwilling to compromise on 
the salary-cap proposal, remains to be seen. Selig and Ravitch said again 
Friday that the proposal has not been modified, nor is that likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said the selection of owners 
could be significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically it matters in the sense that a representative sampling of clubs 
would include small markets, big markets so to speak, those who aren't 
interested in busting the union, those who are, those for whom salary caps are 
a religious proposition and those for whom it is not," Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspicion already is growing that the one thing they will have in common 
is their ability to sing as a chorus." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley cited the significant financial losses on both sides and said it was 
time for a concerted effort aimed at resolving the differences and hoped 
Selig's selections included a "broad outlook of new and old ownership . . . 
cool heads, far thinking people. It's time for diplomacy and understanding, not 
a lot of shouting across the table." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would participate if asked but would also support whoever is 
picked. He said he continues to support the owners' salary-cap proposal but 
felt it would be inappropriate to comment on strategy or speculate as to what 
might happen, adhering to Selig's dictate restricting comment.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS LAY OFF THREE BECAUSE OF STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels have laid off three employees because of the baseball strike, the 
team said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers came from the media relations, ticketing and computer services 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hurting a lot of innocent people," Angel spokesman Kraig Kojian said of 
the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, five other teams cut staff as the baseball strike entered its 
second week, and the Kansas City Royals said they wouldn't operate an 
instructional league team this fall because of the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, St. Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres 
and San Francisco Giants announced layoffs or forced vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout completed its eighth day, with 17 more games canceled. It has 
wiped out 103 games, the second-most of any baseball work stoppage. In the 
50-day strike of 1981, 712 games were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Players, however, found new activities. In Culver City, a softball team led by 
Mike Piazza and Eric Karros of the Dodgers played against a national 
championship fast-pitch team of 9- and 10-year-old girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners are convinced the season is over and the World Series won't be 
played for the first time in 90 years. George W. Bush, a Texas Ranger managing 
general partner, was asked about the World Series by a youngster at an 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it (will be played)," Bush said. "It looks like 
it's going to be . . . long, extended labor negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, the Giants said 55 of their 153 full-time employees were put 
on vacation and were told layoffs are possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis Cardinals laid off about 50 part-time and seasonal workers and 
interns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montreal Expos and New York Yankees previously had cut staff.

 Tom Geoghegan, a union advocate and labor law expert from Chicago, understands 
why the average worker cannot relate to the striking baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think of people who are union types, (I) can't think of worse 
material than young, millionaire ballplayers who are probably Reaganites," he 
said. "Why are they in a union? Because they can get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fans don't have the right in their own work lives to go out and bargain with 
their employers through a union the way the players do. Unlike steelworkers, 
they can't be as easily replaced. That's the real resentment. If you had unions 
like in the 1950s, you wouldn't see fans begrudge the players." ELLIOTT ALMOND

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; HOCKEY IS NEXT SPORT IN LABOR SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks Bob Corkum, Stu Grimson and Guy Hebert were in Toronto on 
Thursday for the first contract talks in five months between the NHL and the 
Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 And the question is this: Is hockey about to go the way of baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we are at a parallel, though not at as advanced a point, as 
baseball," said Grimson, an assistant captain who chose to attend the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 What Grimson is saying is that a salary cap is at issue, and the players are 
adamantly against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL says it is not insistent on having a salary cap, but clearly the 
emphasis is on limiting salary escalation with league-wide legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think any sports executive has got to be concerned with the rampant amount 
of inflation associated with the cost of playing," said Tony Tavares, president 
of Disney Sports Enterprises. "You don't have to be a genius or a rocket 
scientist to figure out you can't have 30, 40, 50% salary increases and expect 
to get that back in ticket-price increases." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grimson: "All we can see is that their position is to quash us into 
accepting a salary cap, and we are not willing to give in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have said all along, as long as negotiations are tied to a salary cap, 
discussions are no longer fruitful. As long as a salary cap is part of it, 
there's really no point." 
</P>
<P>
 With the trade of Troy Loney to the New York Islanders in June, the Ducks lost 
their elected NHLPA player representative. Corkum, the assistant player rep, is 
now in that role, and Grimson and Hebert chose to join him. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have been without a contract for almost a year, and they are 
unhappy that Commissioner Gary Bettman brought them to the bargaining table by 
threatening unilateral rule changes (Grimson calls them "impositions.") 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman has said that if no collective-bargaining agreement is reached, a 
16-point plan for rules changes will be put in place Sept. 1. Among them: 
players will have to pay their own way to and from training camp and will not 
receive their $54 per diem food allowance for training camp or regular-season 
road games. Also included: reduced game rosters and reduced retiree medical 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the possibility of a work stoppage looms, Grimson said the players 
aren't threatening a strike -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ducks are reporting to training camp," said Grimson, who will join Corkum 
and Hebert in a phone brigade to report developments to their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares acknowledges he is preparing for the possibility of a strike -- or a 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the players are preparing for a stoppage and so are we," Tavares 
said, saying he is preparing in case the Ducks need to cancel dates at The Pond 
of Anaheim and refund ticket money or cancel television broadcasts. "We've been 
doing all that preparation work ever since this thing started rearing its 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Much as baseball players were upset by the owners' failure to make a scheduled 
pension payment, hockey players are upset by the NHL's threatened rules 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dispute over the (collective-bargaining agreement) has escalated 
radically. Things that have been in place for years have been stripped," 
Grimson said. "It's their attempt to choke us into knuckling under . . . It's a 
radically different game than the one we left in April." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya update: Paul Kariya and his agent, Don Baizley, will meet with General 
Manager Jack Ferreira and club President Tony Tavares on Monday in Vancouver, 
near Kariya's parents' home. However, Ferreira said the chances of the sides 
striking a deal Monday are remote, and that the meeting is simply another step 
in a slow process.

CAMP WILSON; PEPPERDINE ASSISTANT RETURNS TO PACOIMA WITH MESSAGE FOR KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lamar (Marty) Wilson moved from his mother's house in Pacoima to his father's 
home in Simi Valley in the summer of 1981 to avoid the trouble that often 
brewed on the streets of his hometown. But he has not forgotten his roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, an assistant basketball coach at Pepperdine and former standout at 
Simi Valley High, returned to his old stomping grounds earlier this week to 
conduct the first Marty Wilson basketball camp at Maclay Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the camp -- which was free for neighborhood kids -- was devoted to 
teaching basketball fundamentals. But Wilson also took time to emphasize the 
importance of higher education and goal-setting, and the negative effects of 
gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic reason for this camp is that I wanted to get some kids off the 
streets," said Wilson, 27. "That was the No. 1 goal. I grew up here, so I know 
there are a lot of gangbangers on the streets. We want to give the kids 
something to do and show them that there are other ways to spend their time." 
</P>
<P>
 Each "camper," as Wilson calls them, received a T-shirt and a pair of tickets 
to a Pepperdine home game during the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets, donated by Pepperdine, also entitle the recipients to a tour of 
the Malibu campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to show these kids that there are other things outside of 
this neighborhood," Wilson said. "I was lucky. I was fortunate to get outside 
of this neighborhood and see what there is outside of Pacoima, but not everyone 
gets a chance to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's quest to escape the neighborhood prompted his move to Simi Valley 
when he was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can call me a scaredy-cat or whatever, but I decided that I wanted to get 
out of here," said Wilson, the youngest of six children. "After I graduated 
(from Maclay), I saw a lot of my friends getting into gangs, carrying guns and 
getting into drugs. I just didn't want to get caught up in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson enrolled at Simi Valley, he became the second member of his family 
to attend the school. His brother Norris had lived with his father, Willie, 
during the 1977-78 school year and played basketball for then-Pioneer Coach Bob 
Hawking. The coach didn't realize initially that Marty and Norris were related. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember talking to my wife and she said that a Lamar Wilson had called and 
said he was going to enroll in school," said Hawking, an assistant at Cal State 
Fullerton. "But I didn't make the connection at first." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson played in a handful of varsity games as a sophomore, but spent most of 
season at the junior varsity level because Hawking figured he would benefit 
most from extensive playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 The seasoning paid off as the 6-foot-3 Wilson moved into the Pioneers' 
starting varsity lineup as a junior and earned Ventura County player of the 
year honors as a senior, averaging 21 points and 10 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the opportunity to coach a lot of good players at Simi Valley and Marty 
was no different from the rest of them in that he had a tremendous work ethic," 
said Hawking, who coached Don MacLean of the Washington Bullets at Simi Valley. 
"He had tremendous pride. He came to work every day. There were no days off for 
Marty Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed with Pepperdine, but major injuries during his third and fourth 
seasons at the West Coast Athletic Conference school limited his effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing an average of eight minutes a game during his first two seasons 
at Pepperdine, Wilson was expected to be the Waves' starting point guard in 
1986-87. But he sat out the year because of two protruding disks in his spine. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, he averaged 5.5 points and 6.5 assists for the first 17 games 
before suffering a season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 5.5 points and 5.0 assists as a senior as the Waves posted a 20-13 
record and a first-round victory in the National Invitation Tournament in the 
1988-89 season. Being named the team's most valuable player was indicative of 
his importance to the team, according to Hawking, a Pepperdine assistant from 
1988-90. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very unique thing to average five points a game at a major university 
and be named MVP," Hawking said. "But that's how much his leadership qualities 
meant to the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the injuries might have prevented Wilson from playing professionally 
-- he was cut after a tryout with the Quad City Thunder of the Continental 
Basketball Assn. in 1989 -- they were a blessing in disguise in a certain way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The injuries were frustrating when I went through them, but I'm kind of glad 
that I did because it made me more focused," Wilson said. "It made me focus, 
first, on getting my degree, and secondly, it made me start thinking about my 
future and what kind of goals I wanted to set on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 A love of basketball and the ability to get along with young people made 
coaching a natural vocation for Wilson, who lives in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an assistant coach at Simi Valley under Dean Bradshaw during the 
1989-90 season before being hired as a part-time assistant at Pepperdine. 
Coincidentally, Wilson replaced Hawking, who joined the staff at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was the Waves' part-time assistant for two years before gaining 
restricted earnings status the past two seasons. A restricted earnings coach 
can earn a maximum of only $16,500 a year, according to NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was unsure of his future at Pepperdine after Tom Asbury announced in 
April that he had accepted a position at Kansas State. Before Asbury left, 
however, he secured a full-time assistant position for Wilson, no matter who 
was hired as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really meant a lot to me," Wilson said. "It showed that I must have done 
some things right. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Wilson would like to become a head coach at the NCAA Division I 
level, but he has set no timetable for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Wilson knows is that he'd like to continue his camp. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event drew 50 to 60 kids a day and he hopes to attract 300 daily 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always want the kids from the neighborhood to be able to attend this camp," 
he said. "I always want it to be a way to keep them off the streets and instill 
something positive in them."

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; LANDAKER ENJOYED A FIELD DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Landaker's victory came last week, when he performed the simple task of 
fielding a ground ball and throwing it to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 The routine play during a rookie league game last week was momentous for 
Landaker. The Royal High graduate had played fewer than 10 minor league games 
in the field since the Houston Astros made him a second-round pick in 1992. 
Years of sidearm throws from shortstop had turned his right shoulder into mush. 
</P>
<P>
 Landaker's 1994 season began in mid-June with Kissimmee, Fla., in the 
rookie-level Gulf Coast League, but he was restricted to being the designated 
hitter until his arm healed. Landaker's big day came last week, when 
Kissimmee's second baseman was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got hurt, the (coaches) said, 'It's a short throw. Do you think you 
can fill in for him?' " Landaker said. "I was expecting to be nervous on how my 
arm would feel, but from second base it is more or less a lob throw. The arm 
felt fine. It really didn't feel like I'd missed any time." 
</P>
<P>
 But he had. 
</P>
<P>
 Landaker signed for $185,550 after the Astros made him the 39th pick in the 
1992 draft, but he played only instructional league ball in the fall that 
season. Last year, he played in only 10 games, also because of his sore right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Landaker blamed the shoulder problem on too many sidearm throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like if I would have worked on getting more over the top it would have 
helped a little more." he said, "But dropping from the side all the time really 
takes a toll. . . . Every time I would drop down, I would feel numbness in my 
fingers and a sharp pain." 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros put Landaker on what he called "a pitcher's program," to rest his 
arm. But the pain persisted until recently, when he was finally able to take 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting has not been a problem. Landaker is batting .340. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Landaker: One of Landaker's roommates in Kissimmee is Jeff Hook, who 
pitched at Newbury Park and Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to play against each other (in high school)," Landaker said, "It's 
weird looking out and seeing someone who is from so close to where I'm from. He 
is 15 minutes away from me back in California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still going: Burlington (N.C.) outfielder Bryan Warner has picked up in 
professional baseball where he left off this spring at Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, a 14th-round pick of the Cleveland Indians in June, is hitting .306 
with six home runs and 28 runs batted in at rookie-level Burlington. He batted 
.352 with 11 home runs and 48 RBIs for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 "At every level coming up, I'd always done really well," Warner said, "so I 
guess I didn't expect to do any different, but there's always that in the back 
of your mind that this is pro baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Change of scenery: Javier Delahoya had a good season for the Dodgers' double-A 
team in San Antonio last year, which made his dreadful season with the Florida 
Marlins' double-A team in Portland, Me., somewhat surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoya, placed on waivers by the Dodgers after going 8-10 with a 3.66 
earned-run average at San Antonio, has an explanation: 
</P>
<P>
 "I had problems with the (Portland) pitching coach and manager," said 
Delahoya, a North Hollywood High graduate. "We didn't really get along. . . . 
They tried to change my mechanics. They tried to change the way I was 
pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoya was 0-7 with a 6.48 ERA at Portland before he was sent down to 
Class-A Brevard County, Fla. Getting away from Portland -- or pitching against 
lesser competition -- seems to have helped Delahoya. He is 3-3 with a 2.70 ERA 
at Brevard County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Huntsville, Ala., designated hitter Joel Wolfe (Chatsworth) hit 
the ball that caused Michael Jordan to injure his shoulder while trying for a 
diving catch in left field. Wolfe wound up with a triple. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Dan Chergey (Thousand Oaks) was finally sent down to Class-A Brevard 
County, Fla., last Tuesday. Chergey was promoted to triple-A Edmonton in June 
as a reward for his success at Brevard County and to fill a spot on an 
injury-depleted staff. Chergey was 2-1 with a 5.95 ERA in 19 2/3 innings at 
Edmonton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day Chergey returned to Brevard County, his teammate, catcher Mike 
Sims (Cal State Northridge), suffered a broken jaw in a home-plate collision. 
Sims, whose jaw was wired shut during surgery, will miss the rest of the 
season. Sims batted .248 with no home runs and 29 RBIs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Rosselli (Alemany) and Roger Salkeld (Saugus) faced each other in a 
triple-A game Thursday night in Calgary. Salkeld was the winning pitcher in the 
4-3 game. Although the pitchers came to triple A from opposite directions -- 
Salkeld down from the majors and Rosselli up from double A -- they have been 
equally disappointing. Salkeld is 3-5 with a 6.06 ERA and Rosselli is 1-7 with 
a 4.50 ERA.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: STEVE CHILCOTT; A PREMATURE END TO PROMISING CAREER; 
BASEBALL: NO. 1 PICK IN '66, PLAGUED BY INJURIES IN MINORS, DIDN'T PLAY IN EVEN 
ONE BIG-LEAGUE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Had Steve Chilcott only broken for third base 27 years ago, he might not be 
building houses today. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have seemed boneheaded at the time: a slow-footed catcher running for 
third after the pitcher made a pickoff throw to second. But, given what 
happened when Chilcott's right arm slammed back into the second-base bag, 
popping his shoulder loose, the foolhardy play probably would have been wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the shoulder injury suffered during that play not ruined Chilcott's 
chances of playing major league baseball, he might not be the answer to the 
following trivia question: 
</P>
<P>
 Who is the only player to be selected first in baseball's June amateur draft 
and retire without playing a game in the major leagues? 
</P>
<P>
 1. Steve Chilcott, catcher, Antelope Valley High, by the New York Mets.  
</P>
<P>
 You could look it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey Stengel, managing the Mets at the time, personally scouted Chilcott at 
Antelope Valley in 1966. But, because of injuries, Chilcott never rewarded the 
Mets for their confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott played parts of seven minor league seasons, never advancing higher 
than triple A. For practical purposes, though, Chilcott's career ended at 
second base one night in the Class-A Florida State League, just about a year 
into his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott's playing days were dotted with injuries, but none led more directly 
to his retirement than his shoulder problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't throw a ball hard enough to break a pane of glass," said 
Chilcott, now a 46-year-old construction supervisor in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I'd better start finding something else to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Chilcott was the guy other guys wanted to be in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was everything that you'd want an athlete to be," said George Fetters, one 
of Chilcott's teammates on the Antelope Valley High football team in 1965. 
"When you are young and you look at a guy you'd like to be like, I wanted to be 
like Steve Chilcott." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jerry Watkins, who played football and baseball with Chilcott in high 
school: "He was the epitome of a ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott not only started three years for the baseball team, leading the 
Antelopes to three Golden League titles, he played quarterback for a 
league-championship football team his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just a heck of an athlete," said Fetters, now an assistant football 
coach at Antelope Valley. "He could throw the ball a long way and he was really 
a strong, physical kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I remember is him running me over all the time. I was an 
inside linebacker and I thought I was pretty good, but he would run us over.  
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought he should have played football." 
</P>
<P>
 Football was merely an amusement for Chilcott. He knew baseball was his 
ticket. Chilcott moved to catcher from third base his senior year. With a 
muscular 5-foot-11, 185-pound frame, a strong arm and a powerful left-handed 
bat, he was a scout magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of funny," he said, "there were usually more scouts in the stands 
than fans. It would be 25 scouts and 20 fans." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of fans increased significantly on one occasion, though, because of 
one of the celebrities who had come to scout Chilcott. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casey Stengel came to town," Chilcott remembered. "He showed up just before 
the game started, and by the second or third inning, there were hundreds of 
people there, checking him out. Then after Casey left, it was just those 25 
scouts and 20 fans." 
</P>
<P>
 With all the attention, Chilcott figured he would be a first-round pick. The 
Mets made him not only a first-round pick but the first overall pick in 1966. 
He signed for $75,000, plus a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest paid major league players -- Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, Sandy 
Koufax -- in that era made only about $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott split his first season between the rookie-level Appalachian League 
and the Class-A New York-Penn League. He started the 1967 season at Winter 
Haven, Fla., and was adjusting to professional baseball well. He was hitting 
.290 with six home runs and 45 runs batted in through 79 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Game No. 79 was the fateful one, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott was leading off second base when the pitcher whirled and threw to 
second. Chilcott dived into the bag with his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the pivotal play in his career even more miserable, Chilcott missed the 
umpire's sign and thought he was out. He was safe. When Chilcott got up to run 
to the dugout, he was tagged out. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know just how out he really was. "I thought I would be back to play 
in a short time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott, who didn't play again that season, now knows his injury to be a 
chronic recurrent posterior semi-dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent surgery in 1969, but that was only one of his problems.  
</P>
<P>
 An infection suffered after he fouled a ball off his shin sent him to the 
hospital for a month, and later he suffered a broken hand on a foul tip. All 
along, his shoulder continued to bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the pain would just come back," he said. "I'd have to get cortisone 
shots and have to sit out a week or two. It was just really a frustrating 
routine." 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott, who had been traded to the New York Yankees before the 1972 season, 
was released in the middle of that season. He tried to rejoin the Mets, but 
they were too busy preparing for the next draft to bother. 
</P>
<P>
 At 24, his baseball career was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott said he was disappointed more than depressed, particularly as he 
watched players such as Tug McGraw and Ken Singleton -- his minor league 
teammates -- go on to major league careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while, after I got out of ball, I followed the guys I used to play 
with," Chilcott said, "and I wondered what would have or could have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott went back to school. His family had moved from the Antelope Valley to 
Santa Barbara shortly after he graduated high school, so he enrolled at Santa 
Barbara City College, where firefighting piqued his interest. 
</P>
<P>
 He pursued a career as a firefighter in the mid-1970s, working as a temporary 
in the Santa Barbara Fire Dept. But after several years, frustrated that he 
could not get a full-time job, Chilcott realized -- again -- that it might be 
best to pursue another career. 
</P>
<P>
 After helping a friend remodel homes, he seemed to have found his niche. In 
1980, the same year he married, Chilcott became a full-time contractor. Today 
he proudly talks about how he supervises construction of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott also dabbles in real estate, renting apartments and houses he owns in 
California and Arizona to help him live comfortably in Santa Barbara. As for 
baseball, Chilcott coached Little League briefly several years ago, and he 
follows major league baseball on television, but that's it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilcott's baseball career is now a distant memory. He said he hardly ever 
thinks about his days in the minors, except when he's out sweating on a 
construction site and feels a twinge in his right shoulder. Twenty-seven years 
later, it still hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 Should have gone to third, Steve. We're No. 1

TABASCO CAT WILL HAVE A RABBIT ON HIS SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's confrontation between Holy Bull and Tabasco Cat has most of the 
elements of great drama. They will face each other in a historic race, the 
Travers Stakes, before a crowd of more than 40,000 at Saratoga.The 3-year-old 
championship will be at stake and the horse-of-the-year title might be on the 
line too. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one ingredient is missing: suspense. There is no doubt which of the two 
is the better horse. Holy Bull is -- by many lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Travers were purely a match between Holy Bull and Tabasco Cat, the 
outcome would be almost a forgone conclusion. Instead, this race pits Holy Bull 
vs. the team of Tabasco Cat and Commanche Trail, and the presence of the latter 
may alter the complexion of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas entered the allowance-class sprinter Commanche Trail to 
act as a rabbit who will try to put early pressure on Holy Bull. If he is 
prepared to go on a suicide mission, running as fast as possible for the first 
half-mile of a 1 1/4-mile race, he might compromise Holy Bull's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 If Commanche Trail comes out of the gate in high gear, will Holy Bull outrun 
him? The Bull might be able to beat the Cat, but can he beat the rabbit too?

 Be Real Now, a troubled fourth in the Las Damas Handicap on July 30, is the 
3-1 favorite for the $20,000 Bobby Doyle Memorial Handicap tonight at Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for the longtime track announcer at Los Alamitos, the Doyle will be run 
at 400 yards and, besides Be Real Now, eight other 3-year-old fillies were 
entered. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Terry Smith and trained by Brian Koriner, Be Real Now was bumped and 
jostled from both sides at the start of the Las Damas and finished fourth, 
beaten by 1 3/4 lengths. Down With Debt won the Las Damas and returned to upset 
Refrigerator in the Go Man Go Handicap a week ago. 
</P>

<P>
 Two races earlier, classy Arabians T C Tomtyr A and Magna Terra Smoky will get 
together in a $6,000 allowance race at seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Yancey Carter Jr. and ridden by Jerry Lambert, who has made a 
successful return to riding at Los Alamitos, T C Tomtyr A is the 4-5 
morning-line favorite as he goes for his 16th victory in 26 lifetime starts. 
Magna Terra Smoky, who was beaten 5 1/2 lengths by T C Tomtyr A in their last 
encounter on July 23, has won 35 of 78 starts and has earned more than 
$201,000. Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a simulcast race from Sam Houston Race Park in Texas before the 
first live race at 7 p.m. . . . Through Thursday, the overall mutuel handle is 
up 22% over 1993 and the overall average attendance is up 31.4%. On-track

RUNNING / JOHN ORTEGA; HAMSTRUNG BY INJURY, BECK PASSES ON EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A promising season has turned into a summer of discontent for Marty Beck of 
Nike International L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The former standout at Glendale College and UCLA placed fifth in the 400-meter 
intermediate hurdles in the USA Track & Field championships in June after 
lowering his personal best to 49.53 seconds in a heat, but he has not raced 
since because of a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck suffered the injury on July 9, the day before he was to race in the U.S. 
Olympic Festival. It forced him to cancel what would have been his first tour 
on the European track circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck withdrew from such events as The World Games in Helsinki, Finland, and 
the Bislett Games in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 While the strained hamstring has been "very frustrating" to Beck because it is 
his first serious injury, the setback also has been hard on his bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, 24, would have received appearance money in Europe and he has 
performance incentives in his contract with Nike. 
</P>
<P>
 As Beck puts it, the injury "has taken food out of my 'fridge." 
</P>

 Trivia question: Who is the only male athlete to win six individual titles in 
the state high school championships? 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: He is the last man to win the shotput and discus in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turning the tables: Regina Jacobs of the Mizuno Track Club has a reputation 
for performing below par against top international competition, but the Argyll 
Academy -- now Campbell Hall High -- graduate scored a big victory in the 1,500 
in last week's USA-Pan Africa meet at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, 30, had failed to qualify for the finals of the last two Olympics as 
well as the 1987 and '91 World Championships. But in the Pan Africa meet, she 
ran 4 minutes 10.24 seconds to edge Algeria's Olympic champion, Hassiba 
Boulmerka (4:10.63). Boulmerka also won the 1991 World title. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comeback trail: After winning four state titles in cross-country and track at 
Agoura High, Bryan Dameworth was one of the nation's most highly recruited 
distance runners in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he prepares for his fifth -- and final -- year at Wisconsin, he is not 
thinking about NCAA championships or All-American finishes. He simply would 
like to complete the fall season without injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Dameworth posted personal bests of 4:09.32 in the mile and 8:53.26 in the 
3,200 meters during his senior season at Agoura but has been plagued by 
physical maladies since. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent injury -- a strained lower back -- occurred in March and 
prevented Dameworth from competing during the outdoor track season. During the 
indoor season, he had run personal bests of 8:14 in the 3,000 and 14:13 in the 
5,000.

 "After doing well indoors, I was looking forward to the outdoor season, but it 
never happened," he said. "I was working out one day and my back felt fine at 
the start of the run, but it was really hurting at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the injuries, Dameworth remains optimistic about his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep going until I drop," he said. "I still feel like I can run 
some good times if I put it all together. . . . I'm hoping that (the injuries) 
have made me hungrier."

 Dropping down: The Agoura High girls' cross-country team, a Division I power 
since the state championships began in 1987, will compete at the Division II 
level this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Agoura was classified as a Division II school for the past four years 
based on its enrollment, Charger Coach Bill Duley petitioned the California 
Interscholastic Federation to move up to the Division I level because he wanted 
his team to run in the top division. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing second to Palos Verdes -- now Peninsula -- in the first three 
state championships, Agoura won the Division I title from 1990-92 and placed 
fifth last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers might not be as strong this year as in seasons past, but that did 
not influence his decision, Duley said. Instead, he cited concern about the 
boys' team, which has remained at the Division II level the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved up to Division I because I wanted to beat Peninsula," Duley said. 
"But I noticed that the boys kind of got washed over in the last couple of 
years because they were at a lower level. That's not good for the program."

 Record watch: Denean Howard still holds the national high school record in the 
girls' 400 with her 50.87 clocking for Kennedy in 1982, but Charlynna Foster of 
Clearwater, Fla., broke Howard's age-14 record in last month's USA Track & 
Field Junior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster ran 53.43 to trim nearly four-tenths of a second from Howard's mark of 
53.82 set in 1979.

</P>
<P>
 The beat goes on: Mark Covert's running streak turned 26 last month and shows 
no signs of ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Covert, the men's and women's cross-country and track coach at Antelope Valley 
College, has run at least three miles a day every day since July 23, 1968, the 
summer before his freshman year at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Covert, he had run 108,759 miles by the anniversary. That's an 
average of about 11 miles a day, 80 miles a week and 349 miles a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Covert is believed to have the longest active streak in the world and is 
closing in on the record of 28 years 8 months set by Great Britain's Ron Hill.

discus in the 1920, '21 and '22 state championships for Oxnard High. Houser won 
the shotput and discus in the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris and repeated his 
victory in the discus in the 1928 Games in Amsterdam.

 Dennis Riedmiller, who last spring guided the Camarillo High boys' team to its 
first Marmonte League title in 12 years, will take over the girls' program at 
Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Riedmiller, 37, also was a football assistant and taught special education 
classes at Camarillo for the past four years, but was told in June that budget 
cuts would prevent the school from rehiring him. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted a special education teaching position at Channel Islands shortly 
thereafter, but it was only recently that his coaching status was verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Riedmiller, who guided Camarillo to a 12-2 record in Marmonte League 
competition during the past two years, will replace Myra Beemis, who elected 
not to return as girls' coach after one season. Riedmiller also will be the 
junior varsity football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands' girls tied Thousand Oaks for first place in the Marmonte 
League track finals in May, but several top performers, including Dolores 
Tuimoloau and Shawanda Hotchkiss, graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to go out there and see what they've got and then take it from 
there," Riedmiller said. JOHN ORTEGA

SPLASH CLINCHES TEAM'S FIRST PLAYOFF BERTH WITH AN 8-4 VICTORY AGAINST CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year after the franchise finished last in the Continental Indoor Soccer 
League, the Splash on Friday clinched its first playoff berth with an 8-4 
victory over Carolina in front of 2,813 at Independence Arena in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (16-6) scored five consecutive second-half goals against the Vipers 
(2-19) and increased its Western Division lead to 1 1/2 games over second-place 
San Diego (15-8). The division's top four teams advance to the playoffs; the 
team with the best record holds the home-field advantage through the league 
quarterfinals and semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the Splash played well for the fourth consecutive time on 
this seven-game trip; it has three victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows the players that they can play well at home and now they're 
getting confidence that we can play well on the road," Coach George Fernandez 
said. "It's building to where we're confident, like we should win every game -- 
it's like a quiet arrogance. We believe we should win and we're going out there 
with that attitude and being very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Raffaele Ruotolo scored two goals, and his two assists extended his CISL 
record to 23 consecutive games with an assist. His 29th goal of the season gave 
the Splash a 4-3 lead four minutes into the third quarter, and the Splash never 
trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruotolo has 19 multiple-point games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Ervine also scored twice, giving him 27, and had an assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ratcliffe, Paul McDonnell, Mike LaPosha and Doug Neely also scored. 
Neely's goal was his CISL record 12th power-play goal and his 22nd of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash made five of its 10 second-half shots; it was three of 20 in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit everything except the net," Fernandez said. "The second half we picked 
it up in our intensity, aggressiveness and tactics. Our pressure was 
outstanding -- we played like a team. The first half, we played like 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Castro had two assists and Ralph Black had one; Black needs only two more 
to reach 350 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash's magic number to clinch the division title is four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip continues Sunday against Pittsburgh (12-11).

THE SCENTS AND SOUNDS OF AFRICA; POP MUSIC: SAMBA NGO CALLS HIMSELF A CHILD OF 
THE WORLD, BUT HIS WORKS ARE DEEPLY ROOTED IN HIS NATIVE ZAIRE. HE PLAYS 
TONIGHT IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO.

 Take the anthropomorphism of Disney's "The Lion King," roll it all up into one 
man and stick a guitar in his hand, and you might just come up with Samba Ngo. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, the Zairian musician seemed to combine the enthusiasm 
of Simba, a laugh that's as infectious, if not so skewed, as Ed's, and the 
shamanism of Rafiki. 
</P>
<P>
 But where Disney often has been criticized for simplifying and sanitizing the 
cultures its movies portray, Ngo strives to infuse his music with the full 
richness of human experience, both personal and societal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Africa we live in mysticism, we live in spirit," said Ngo (pronounced 
in-GO), who performs two shows with his Ngomo Players tonight at the San Juan 
Capistrano Regional Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was a medicine man," or nganga, Ngo, 44, recalled. "When he cured 
people, he always used music. Always. I learned my father's techniques, that 
everybody is music, and music is therapeutic. Everybody is sound, and sound can 
make these (therapeutic) effects on the body. But music is also universal -- 
everybody can feel the rhythm, can be in the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Ngo, who also plays a free concert Sunday at California Plaza in downtown Los 
Angeles, was reached by phone at "Congolese Camp," an annual workshop in the 
mountains of Nevada focusing on the music, culture and history of the Congo, 
Zaire's neighbor to the west. Held for the last 14 years, the workshop is led 
by a small group of Congolese musicians and artists living in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ngo, 300 "diverse" people attended camp this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only musicians, no. Normal people, doctors, we have everybody!" he said. 
"We want the world to know us better. If we were intellectuals, we would write. 
But we're artists, so we do what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Ngo does is compose, sing and play guitar, drums and likembe , a Zairian 
thumb piano. Latin American music and Ray Charles were among his earliest 
influences, but today his music fuses soukous, jazz and funk styles into a 
danceable African pop. His concerts include Congolese dancing, extended 
instrumental improvisation and call-and-response vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngo was born in Zaire (then the Belgian Congo), but moved to Brazzaville in 
Congo when his Congolese parents were expelled in 1964. He departed the Congo 
four years later and never looked back when the band he was in, Echo Noire, won 
a tour of France. The years he spent in Paris come through in his accent.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now I am (one of) the children of the world," Ngo said. "I never go back (to 
Africa) to live, but only to visit my parents. And I go back for the smell, for 
the culture, to keep my roots very strong. I don't want my learning to 
assimilate me. I want to assimilate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ngo was prone to speak in extended metaphors, and he explained in a roundabout 
way how people can be in the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smell of Africa is the smell of the drum," Ngo said. "When I say the 
smell of the drum, I mean the feeling, the spirit.  
</P>
<P>
 "The drum is a monotone," he said. "The chief function of the mind is to 
think. If you ask the computer not to think, that is difficult. The monotone 
breaks the mind so the music can be. If the mind is still thinking, it is 
impossible for the music to be.  
</P>
<P>
 "When people come to listen to music, they are ready to hear. It is only for 
me to give the right sound, so the mind should not think any more, except 
musically." 
</P>
<P>
 Ngo toured as a member of M'Bamina for 14 years, during which the group 
recorded nine albums. He now lives in Santa Cruz and performs with the Ngomo 
Players, a seven-piece band. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The songs on his latest album, "Introspection," have titles such as "Hope," 
"Sickness," "Respect" and "The Word," and the joyousness with which they're 
sung belie the often political lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a political singer, and in the Congo (that was) a problem," he said, 
then corrected himself. "It's not that I am a political singer, (it's that) I 
sing the things I see. With M'Bamina, I gave the government a hard time -- the 
hospital has no medicine, but the people have Mercedes. And there's no way to 
drive the Mercedes, because we have no freeway, no where to drive them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sing the history of human beings," he said. "How we forget how powerful we 
are, how we only see our own interests. Is the world blind or what? We don't 
recognize things in terms of human understanding. Somebody has a problem 
because his color is different, or he is a Jew, or somebody has a problem 
because he's asking to have a little more. . . . Baaah! " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He took exception to a question about "current events" in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The events in Africa are not new for me," Ngo said. "It is the same. I was 
born in the era of colonization. Now I am 44, and Africa is more devastated 
than when I was young. Mobutu (Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko) was chief 
when I was young and he is still chief. But colonization was no better. When my 
father died, he still had the mark of beatings from the French and Belgians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never believed that the atomic bomb is going to destroy the world," he 
said. "Poverty is going to destroy the world. The problem is starvation -- when 
you are hungry, that is the true bomb." 
</P>
<P>

WILL 'PAT' PLAY IN PEORIA FOR DISNEY?; MOVIES: JUST AS AUDIENCES STRUGGLE TO 
DETERMINE THE SEX OF THE 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' CHARACTER, THE STUDIO IS 
WONDERING WHAT AUDIENCE THIS COMEDY WILL APPEAL TO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On television, "Pat" wasn't ready for prime time. Now, the question on the 
minds of Walt Disney officials is whether the androgynous character of 
"Saturday Night Live" fame is ready for the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Pat," a motion picture based on the gender-neutral character portrayed 
by comedian Julia Sweeney, opens Friday in three cities: Houston, Seattle and 
Spokane. By following this cautious approach, Disney officials say they can 
decide whether the movie will have wider appeal. It is scheduled to open in Los 
Angeles on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 To fuel interest in the comedy, Sweeney will barnstorm all three cities, 
making public appearances and conducting a battery of one-on-one TV, radio and 
newspaper interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a test-market screening," said a source close to the project. "They want 
to see if a TV concept can be pushed to the big screen." 
</P>
<P>
 The character of Pat is not something "the suits" at Disney understand, the 
source added. "This is a college type or underground club type of film. The 
test marketing will see what direction it will take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it a film I would race to see?" the source added. "No, but I also don't 
get all the jokes on 'Saturday Night Live' anymore because I'm too old." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as audiences have a difficult time determining whether Pat is male or 
female, Disney executives are wondering what audience this comedy will appeal 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Cook, who heads distribution at Disney, said the decision to open in only 
three cities, with Sweeney making public appearances, is "taking a page out of 
the way movies were distributed years ago when they would have stars go out and 
go market by market." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just thought (the cities) were diverse enough and would give us a good 
reading," Cook explained. "Fortunately, we have a star in Julia Sweeney who is 
willing to go into each of these markets and really work them." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook called the movie a "unique character piece" and said that by opening in 
only three cities "we are able to gauge the reaction in these markets to 
determine how we are to proceed." He said only 30 prints have been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 One source, who asked not to be identified, said the length of the movie -- 
only 75 minutes -- "gives some indication that it's a stinker." 
</P>
<P>
 The plot revolves around the enigmatic Pat, who goes through a series of jobs 
until meeting his/her perfect match -- the equally androgynous Chris (played by 
David Foley) -- and they make plans to marry. Meanwhile, Pat's new neighbor 
develops an obsession for her (him?). Troubles ensue. Along the way, Pat gets 
picked up by a rock band. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Adam Bernstein, the Touchstone Pictures release is produced by 
Charles B. Wessler with screenplay credits going to Jim Emerson, Stephen 
Hibbert and Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 To market the movie, Disney has come up with print ads showing a nude Pat but 
with strategic body parts covered with a pink question mark. "The sex symbol of 
the '90s," reads the ad. " 'It's Pat: The Movie' proves love is a many-gendered 
thing." Disney also is putting out a press kit including a paper Pat doll with 
punch-out clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if moviegoers in Middle America are ready for "Pat," Cook replied: "I 
hope so. We're going to give it every opportunity."

POP BEAT: REVEREND HORTON HEAT'S GOT THE ROCKABILLY CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reverend Horton Heat may not be certified to save souls, but he has 
resurrected the reckless side of rockabilly and blessed it with even more bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "At my shows, people always scream, 'Heal me, Rev, heal me!,' " says the 
Dallas-based singer-guitarist, speaking in a booming Texas twang. "So I just 
throw my drink on 'em and say, 'Awright, you're healed.' What else can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Heat's third album and major-label debut, "Liquor in the Front," bursts with 
maniacal, full-throttle rockabilly, topped by the mechanized production of 
industrial-rock kingpin Al Jourgensen -- fittingly, the leader of Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio -- Heat, drummer Taz and bassist Jimbo -- is powered by speedy punk 
undercurrents, and doesn't exactly fit in the nostalgia category. So Heat keeps 
company with the Seattle crowd, touring with bands such as Soundgarden. On the 
other hand, he'll be opening for Johnny Cash in San Francisco next month, and 
he headlines his own L.A. show at the Palace on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rockabilly is a weird thing," says Heat, whose real name is Jim Heath. "Even 
when we were playing a straighter rockabilly sound, there was no place for us 
to fit in but alternative clubs. It all kind of fits together. Sid Vicious did 
Eddie Cochran songs, and the Cramps did songs by Jack Scott. Rockabilly's got a 
lot of energy. There's a lot overlooked about that genre of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockabilly -- the primal root of rock 'n' roll best known through the early 
hits of Elvis and his '50s followers -- does resurface every so often, the last 
big revival coming in the mid-'80s. But that one was centered around the 
superficial trimmings of the genre -- flashy attire, pompadours, et al -- 
rather than its actual rebellious roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Stray Cats were a great band," says Heat, who grew up in Corpus Christi, 
Tex., playing '50s rock, country, punk and metal. "But they were fluffy, so 
consequently you had a lot of bands come out at that time and all they knew was 
Stray Cats' songs and that they had to have the right clothes. That was not for 
us at all." 
</P>
<P>
 For every action there's a reaction, so in 1989 Heat (who declines to give his 
age but appears to be in his mid-30s) formed the trio -- known collectively as 
Reverend Horton Heat -- as an abrasive answer to that processed rockabilly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty sickening and missing the initial point of what rockabilly was 
all about," Heat explains. "Jerry Lee Lewis burning his piano, the Burnette 
brothers getting in fights on stage, Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran getting 
drunk together. . . . They weren't clotheshorses. Jerry Lee was way out of 
control, and that's partly what rock 'n' roll is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Heat, who's a virtual encyclopedia of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Col. Parker 
facts, doesn't care which style of rock or country he's drawing from -- just as 
long as it bites back. "Though I love '50s music, rather than go see something 
too sweet like Buddy Holly or a cutesy country band, I'd much rather see 
Motorhead or AC/DC. Something that really rocks, something that's out of the 
chute and you just can't stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lizardry: Speaking of out of control , get ready for Jesus Lizard. The 
adrenalized punk-rock quartet has been praised by such bands as Sonic Youth and 
Helmet, and its crazed demeanor has attracted a serious cult of fans that 
expands with each record. The Chicago band will release its fifth album next 
week, "Down" (on the Touch and Go label). At a time when the once-adventurous 
punk-rock genre has become tame and accommodating, alternative-rock Jesus 
Lizard has earned its fans' loyalty by being extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all kinds of art, its impact should be that you either really like it a 
lot or just hate it. Nothing passive," says Jesus Lizard's singer David Yow, 
who's been known to foam at the mouth and writhe on stage as if possessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything scary that you get from us comes from our music, since we don't put 
that stuff across in the way we dress or marketing. It just comes from inside."

FOSSIL OF RARE MAMMOTH IS RECOVERED; SCIENCE: THE MOST COMPLETE SKELETON OF THE 
ICE AGE BEAST ARRIVES FROM SANTA ROSA ISLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It looks like a pile of bones and plaster, and weighs nearly a ton. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shipment that arrived at Ventura Harbor Friday afternoon holds the 
secrets to the life and death of the pygmy mammoth that roamed the Channel 
Islands during the last Ice Age. 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks of excavation, a team of scientists returned from Santa Rosa 
Island with the most complete skeleton of the species ever discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 They found the feet. They found the toes. They even found the arthritic spurs 
on the joints of the toes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been seeing bits and pieces in museum drawers for years," said Louise 
Roth, a Duke University biology professor who did her dissertation on Channel 
Islands mammoths. "But to see the skeleton like this was spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as soon as the scientists uncovered the fossil, found in a sand dune 
earlier this summer, the team began taking it apart for transport back to the 
mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 The mammoth, whose ancestors swam out to the islands off the Ventura Coast 
thousands of years ago, made the return trip by boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting at the harbor were about 100 community members excited about the 
paleontological find and what it could do for the little-known Channel Islands 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers were selling pygmy mammoth T-shirts and handing out free champagne 
as park rangers used a crane to hoist two crates full of prehistoric bones off 
the boat. Inside the park center, visitors could see a videotape of the 
excavation. Plans are under way for a contest to name the mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Friends of Channel Islands National Park hopes to raise enough 
money to put a fiberglass model of the creature in the visitors center. The 
discovery, they say, could raise the visibility of the five-island park off the 
Ventura County coast. 
</P>
<P>
 One visitor who expects to return is paleontologist Larry Agenbroad, a mammoth 
specialist who teaches at Northern Arizona University. Agenbroad has helped dig 
up more than 50 of the ancestral elephants at the Mammoth Site in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the Channel Islands trip was his first encounter with the pygmy variety, 
which developed after generations in the limited island space. After excavating 
this fossil, Agenbroad found a bone of a larger mammoth on another part of 
Santa Rosa.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is only going to lead to future work on the islands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the excavation, Agenbroad predicted that the skeleton would be 75% to 
85% complete. Instead 90% to 95% of the fossil remained intact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mammoth also turned out to be larger than initially predicted. Crude field 
measurements show that it stood about 5 1/2 to 6 feet high and weighed 2,000 to 
3,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The sizes of the tusk and pelvis tell scientists this was a male mammoth. Its 
badly worn teeth and the degree of bone fusion suggest an older animal, the 
equivalent of a modern elephant that is older than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The excellent condition of the fossil suggests that this beast died a gentle 
death. "It just laid down and died apparently, maybe starvation, maybe 
drought," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists found the breastbone and the small bones that support the mammoth's 
tongue -- discoveries that tell them that the skeleton was not disturbed after 
death. A stream of water that developed thousands of years later washed away a 
tusk, a foot and part of a shoulder, but otherwise the fossil remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The complete skeleton should provide clues to what the animal ate, how it 
lived and why it died. "I think in the long run it will help us understand 
evolution a little better and extinction a little better," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly when this particular mammoth died remains a mystery. Scientists say 
the creature is 20,000 to 60,000 years old. Tests planned for the sediment 
around the fossil should reveal something about the skeleton's age. 
</P>
<P>
 The bones could also be tested for age, but Agenbroad said he doesn't want to 
sacrifice a bone for such testing. Right now, the bones are braced with splints 
and covered with plaster to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaster was applied on the sandy slope where the fossil was found. Unable 
to carry the heavy plaster casts up a steep hill, the scientists used a 
helicopter to take pieces of the skeleton across the island. From there a boat 
carried them to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never containerized a mammoth before," Agenbroad said. "I've never 
airlifted a mammoth before. I've never sea-lifted a mammoth before. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I've never had champagne for getting a mammoth before," he said, lifting 
his plastic glass toward the crate full of bones.

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; LIVES OF 'CARNIES' NOT ALWAYS FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many locals, the Ventura County Fair means 12 days of fun, games and 
cotton candy under a burning August sun. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also Tracy Burt's stolen vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron LaTour's big chance. 
</P>
<P>
 And one in a seemingly endless succession of destinations for weary Joyce and 
Lex McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
 All four have landed at Seaside Park this August, joining a traveling 
hodgepodge of faces, personalities and lifestyles that each morning at 11 a.m. 
bring the locals their annual county fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials report that there are about 300 "carnies" working the carnival 
this year, and 260 concessionaires on the fair grounds, hawking everything from 
face painting to deep-fried egg rolls. Some have been returning to Seaside Park 
every year for the last quarter century. Others, like Ron LaTour, made their 
debut on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Or in LaTour's case, make that Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 This fair was supposed to be LaTour's big chance, the largest fair he and his 
gleaming gold and silver cart have been in since joining the circuit last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just before the extravaganza opened Wednesday, the health department 
found his cart unsanitary and ordered him to construct a plastic case around 
his coffee-making device. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, don't get me started on the Ventura County Health Department," he said, 
grimacing as he whipped up an iced latte Thursday afternoon. "I didn't open 
yesterday. Just spent the entire day building this trap." 
</P>
<P>
 LaTour taught special education in Visalia for 14 years before the 
entrepreneurial bug hit him in the early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy hard work, but I was getting all this time off and not enough 
gratitude for the work I did," he said of his time as a teacher. "But now, 
people love my product. They get very excited. I've had people come to me and 
say, 'I had to come to the fair to get the best cup of coffee I ever had."' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A satisfied grin spread over LaTour's angular face. He's ready to pour 
espressos and cappuccinos 'till he drops, for this kind of appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What keeps me traveling is the opportunity to do 500 drinks per day," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce and Lex McKnight used to get excited about the fair. They can still 
remember the day 19 years ago when a friend came to their apartment, snuggled 
deep in the snows of a cold Pennsylvania winter, and asked them how they'd like 
to spend the summer in California.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was building houses, my wife was waitressing, we were both in dead-end 
jobs," Lex McKnight, 43, recalled. "It sounded like a pretty good deal to us."  
</P>
<P>
 The McKnights headed off for the bright canopies and searing grills of a 
traveling West Coast hotdog booth, and never looked back.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two decades later, they own the orange and yellow striped concession 
that advertises "Crispy Golden French Fries" and "Delicious Sausage." They 
travel up and down California highways all summer, peddling their delicacies at 
a dizzying merry-go-round of fairs and expositions. They can fry corn dogs 
leaning over a burning pan of oil in the 106 degree heat of Victorville and not 
faint once. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are getting weary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind the work," Lex McKnight said the day before the Ventura County 
Fair opened, snapping a vinyl awning onto their booth parked alongside the 
agricultural barn. "It's the traveling I get tired of. We've been to some 
places year after year. It's not like we're seeing new places all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the evenings, the McKnights sleep in a house trailer they transport across 
the country. During the winter, when the fair season shuts down in most parts 
of the country, they retire to Florida, where they work a few winter fairs and 
cook up a storm in their home near Ft. Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 The McKnights' living arrangements are not unusual for concessionaires, many 
of whom make enough money to maintain a permanent winter home in addition to 
their migratory trailers or the series of motel rooms they pay for all fair 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the carnies are a different story. Joanna Bray, 46, joined the carnival 
circuit in September, 1992, when the Los Angeles County Fair came to Pomona, 
and she's stayed with it ever since. She even married a fellow carnie, Russ 
Bray, 34, and together they travel from town to town, festival to festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is tight for the migrant Brays. Most nights, their carnival attractions 
become their bedroom. Joanna Bray works in a Ping-Pong toss booth. When the 
gates close and the visitors go home, she and her fellow workers roll down the 
awnings to make walls around the otherwise open concession. Bray lies down on 
her portable air mattress and falls asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Nights that the Brays feel particularly flush, they rent a hotel room and 
enjoy the luxury of a bed and the privacy of a closed door. On their time off 
from the fair circuit, they stay with Joanna's mother in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They say they were born with a wanderlust they still can't shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kind of excitement you feel when you are a child and going on 
vacation, well, that's what I feel every time we go to a new town," Joanna said 
over dinner with Russ one evening in the cut-rate, carnie concession stand 
nestled into a far corner of the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how long the spot is, you are always ready to go," Russ explained, 
digging into a meat and bean stew.  
</P>
<P>
 "And you are looking forward to the next spot," Joanna said, finishing his 
sentence.  
</P>
<P>
 The Brays try to travel light. But some carnies carry a load of baggage with 
them from town to town. Howard Hilliard, a thin 6-foot-6 Texan who loves to 
work in Kiddieland, lugs two huge suitcases, a couple of bulging shoulder bags, 
a waist pouch, a briefcase and a card table from stop to stop around 
California, loading them onto the semi-truck of the carnival company that 
employs him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other guys tell me I should get my own truck," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard used to carry nine barbecue grills with him as well, but finally 
discarded all but one in an attempt to conserve storage space.  
</P>
<P>
 Many women take their infants and toddlers with them on the circuit, either 
persuading a friend or relative to travel with them and serve as a baby-sitter, 
or trusting other workers to look after their children as they rotate through 
their breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Burt needs little in the way of baggage, thank you. She left that all at 
home in Santa Rosa -- the four children, the husband, the volunteer 
responsibilities and the studies in bookkeeping she is but one month away from 
finishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my summer vacation," she said. "I had to do something for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Burt sits high atop the fair, at the peak of the Super Slide, 
laying out burlap sacks for kids to sit on and glide on down the wavy yellow 
plastic.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last one down's a rotten egg!" she called out one sunny afternoon as three 
children raced, screaming with laughter, down the long slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it's kind of ironic, isn't it?" she said, noting how she'd left 
children behind only to be assigned to a ride in Kiddieland. "But they keep me 
in line. I have a lot of fun with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt's fair saga began back home in Santa Rosa, when the fair came to her town 
and an idea came to her head. Within a week, she had left her four children, 
ages 9 months to 8 years, with her sister, told her husband to deal with things 
for a couple of weeks, and hopped into a friend's car, bound for Ventura and 
the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 She can't remember the last time she had a vacation. It feels great, she said. 
She wears a bathing suit under her T-shirt and shorts everywhere she goes, and 
on her breaks, she strolls over to the ocean, whisks off her top, and sunbathes 
on the sand until it is time to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days into the fair, she missed her kids so much she gave up part of her 
precious breaks to call her sister's house to check on them. But she said she 
has no regrets. As much fun as the crowds at the midway are having, she is too. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I went to the store last night, and these kids said, 'Hey, I 
remember you, you're the lady from the fair,"' she grinned and shook her head. 
"Boy, that put a smile on my face." * FAIR SCHEDULE: B2

CRITICS WANT LANDFILL ACTION OFF THE BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their latest plea to the court, Weldon Canyon landfill opponents Friday 
urged a judge to remove a landfill initiative from the November ballot because 
it grants one company a "monopoly" at the dump site between Ventura and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is not about the need for another landfill in Ventura County," 
wrote Katherine Stone, an attorney for the city of Ojai. Rather, she argued, 
it's a question of adhering to state laws that limit what can be done in a 
ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weldon Canyon landfill initiative lacks the proper wording and provisions 
to allow voters a clear view of what they're supporting, she wrote: "If the 
measure were placed on the ballot, it would mislead the voters because the full 
impact of the measure is not disclosed." 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill supporters argue that Ventura County voters should have their say 
over the controversial Weldon Canyon project. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired appeals court judge will hear final arguments Monday before deciding 
whether the matter should remain on November's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But foes in Ojai and Ventura filed suit, contending that the measure had so 
many legal problems that it should be declared invalid before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A key flaw, Stone argued in the 15-page court filing, is that the ballot 
initiative benefits only one private interest: Taconic Resources, the San Diego 
County partnership that wants to open the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 That, she argued, violates state laws against giving preferential treatment to 
any company and, in essence, is "legislating Taconic into a monopoly position." 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, Stone argued that Taconic "has no demonstrable qualifications 
to run a major landfill operation" and would be the only company to benefit 
from the ballot initiative, as it is written. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for landfill supporters argue that the public good will come 
when the site opens and the western half of the county can dispose of its trash 
conveniently. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the voters are deprived of their right to vote in the November, 1994, 
election, they cannot vote again until March, 1996," wrote Wes Peltzer, the San 
Diego County attorney representing supporters. "In the interim, the need for a 
new landfill to dispose of 300,000 tons of waste generated in western Ventura 
County each year remains unfulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peltzer could not be reached for comment Friday. But in court papers he also 
argued that the ban on referring to specific companies applies only to 
statewide measures, not to local initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 A Moorpark activist, Ellen Brown, began the petition drive for the Weldon 
Canyon measure this spring. With the help of paid signature gatherers, the 
drive collected more than 32,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Those voters, Peltzer argued, should have their say. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers will face off Monday before retired Appeals Judge Richard Abbe, a 
Santa Barbara judge brought in to hear the case. Both sides have promised to

CORONER IDENTIFIES GAS IN DEATHS; ACCIDENT: REPORT SAYS THREE RINCON OIL RIG 
WORKERS SUCCUMBED TO LETHAL DOSES OF CARBON MONOXIDE, NOT HYDROGEN SULFIDE, AS 
FIRST THOUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three workers killed in a Rincon oil rig accident last week died after 
inhaling toxic levels of carbon monoxide gas, the Ventura County coroner's 
office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities originally suspected that the workers were killed after breathing 
lethal doses of hydrogen sulfide, a colorless gas sometimes found in oil 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 But the coroner's report appears to debunk that theory. In a short news 
release, Chief Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran said preliminary analyses 
show that all three victims had lethal levels of carbon monoxide in their 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time there is no indication that hydrogen sulfide gas played a role 
in their deaths," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, blood samples have been sent to a consulting lab for further 
tests for hydrogen sulfide. The workers' cause of death will not be final until 
those results are back in several weeks, coroner's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas emitted from car tailpipes and 
other sources of fire. It can attain lethal levels in enclosed spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette smoking causes the largest human exposure to carbon monoxide, 
experts say. The gas kills by depriving the body of oxygen, causing quick 
deterioration of vital organs such as the brain and heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Furrow, vice president of Pride Petroleum, which employed the three men 
who died, said the coroner's findings will shift the focus of his company's 
investigation to the possible source of the carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
 The only combustion engine running at the time of the Aug. 10 accident was a 
small truck motor owned by Schlumberger Well Services, Furrow said. But it is 
rare for emissions from a single engine to cause problems because carbon 
monoxide gas dissipates quickly in open-air pits, such as the one in which the 
victims were working, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some rig operations require the use of up to eight engines at one time, with 
no problems from carbon monoxide fumes, Furrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To my knowledge, I've never heard of a carbon monoxide poisoning in any 
case," he said. "We're really at a loss as to what could have been the source 
of the carbon monoxide." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlumberger officials were not available for comment Friday. Nor were 
executives at Vintage Petroleum, the Tulsa, Okla.-based oil company that hired 
contractors Pride and Schlumberger to do the drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 But a state safety official said he also found the coroner's report puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
 There has not been a single fatality from carbon monoxide poisoning in the oil 
industry statewide for the past 10 years, said John Duncan, who is spearheading 
an investigation for California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cal/OSHA investigators are not ruling out any possible cause for the 
deaths, including hydrogen sulfide poisoning, until their investigation is 
complete in about a month, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride workers Sean Harris, Jason Hoskins and Ronald Johnson were killed while 
working in a pit at the wellhead of a defunct rig near Seacliff. The men were 
making holes in a steel down pipe because Vintage wanted to convert the well 
into a disposal site for water used during oil operations, Furrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About noon, the men were overcome by fumes that sent them into cardiac arrest. 
Johnson died at the scene and the other two were declared dead at a Ventura 
hospital a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other workers who pulled the men from the pit were sickened by the fumes 
but recovered after medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Furrow said Pride investigators right away did not believe the deaths were 
caused by a release of deadly hydrogen sulfide gas because nobody noticed the 
characteristic rotten-egg odor of the vapors.

COUNTY'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CLIMBS TO 9.3% IN JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's unemployment rate climbed a full 2 percentage points from 
June to July, hitting 9.3%, the highest it has been since January, according to 
state figures released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was attributable to two predictable seasonal changes, a drop in 
agricultural production and the school system's summer break, said officials 
with the state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not unusual that the rate increased from June to July," said Linda 
Reed, an analyst with the department. "The declines in government were expected 
because the schools are on furlough and as different crops come and go, so do 
the workers." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, the county's unemployment rate reached a three-year peak of 
10.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, July is the month of the highest unemployment rate," said Joe 
Bonanno with the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Factoring in the fluctuation in agriculture and the temporarily out-of-work 
school employees, Bonanno said the two-point increase was not significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really isn't a change," Bonanno said. "It's still not growing. But if 
we were sailing it would be calm seas."  
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the unemployment rate for July also stood at 9.3%, while the rate 
nationwide was a considerably lower 6.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, with the close of the strawberry harvesting and processing 
season in July, 6,300 farm workers lost their jobs, dropping the number of 
agricultural workers in the county to 15,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, schools employed 1,400 fewer people during July. But Reed said that 
loss was misleading, because those jobs will be regained by September. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the jump in the unemployment rate, Bruce DeVine, chief economist with 
the Southern California Assn. of Governments, said he was not disturbed by the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is any cause for alarm really," he said. "It's a seasonal 
loss. When you look at these figures you have to take into account the special 
features that affect the county." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the agricultural losses, the manufacturing sector lost 300 jobs 
and the service sector, including health and business, declined by 400 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Small gains were reported in several areas from June to July; 200 more jobs in 
retail trades, 100 in insurance, 100 in finance, 100 in real estate and 100 in 
wholesale trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction also added 100 jobs since June. That industry has grown by 600 
jobs since July, 1993, which economists said is very likely a result of 
rebuilding from damage caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kennedy, manager of the unemployment office in Simi Valley, said the 
western part of the county had incurred more than the east county in job losses 
during July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Job orders actually improved for us," Kennedy said. "We had 269 job orders in 
the system as of Aug. 12. Two years ago we would have maybe had 100 on hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment claims also dropped off in his office, he said. In June, the 
office reported 1,636 new claims, or people who had just signed up for 
unemployment, and in July that number declined to 1,568.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; SPEED LIMIT ON 7 STREETS TO BE INCREASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark officials will increase the speed limit on seven city streets based 
on information gathered from a citywide traffic survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted every five years, is used by the city and local law 
enforcement to adjust speed limits to the average flow of traffic, said Sgt. 
Keith Parks of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department Moorpark Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophy is that if 85% of the drivers drive at a certain speed than 
that is safe, regardless of what is posted," Parks said.  
</P>
<P>
 The exception to that rule is in areas near schools and parks, where speed 
isdictated by the presence of children and not by traffic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark speed survey showed that drivers travel on average 10 m.p.h. 
faster than the posted limit on certain sections of Hearon Drive and Peach Hill 
Road. Drivers are traveling on average five m.p.h. faster on sections of Campus 
Park Drive, Country Wood Drive, Walnut Creek Road, Mountain Meadows Drive and 
Poindexter Avenue. Officials are recommending that the limits on those roads be 
increased to reflect the average driving speeds, Parks said. On three roads the 
speed limit will be lowered. The limit will be reduced by five m.p.h. on 
Collins Drive, Condor Drive and Spring Road. SCOTT HADLY

 The body of a 27-year-old North Hollywood man was found early Friday washed up 
on shore at Lake Piru, a coroner's spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Danilo Carranza drowned Sunday while on an outing with his family. 
Carranza was wearing a life vest but began to struggle in the water, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members aboard a rented boat threw him more life vests, but he 
continued to sink. A man aboard the boat dived into the lake to try to save 
Carranza but was unsuccessful, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's helicopter and a search-and-rescue dive team were unable to find 
Carranza Sunday. Rangers made the discovery Friday. FRED ALVAREZ

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; PORN ACTRESS TO BE TRIED IN 
MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After listening to a 14-year-old boy testify about two sexual encounters, a 
Municipal Court judge ordered a 45-year-old adult-film actress from Newbury 
Park to stand trial on six counts of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Arden, who has appeared in sexually explicit films and magazines, 
listened quietly in the county courtroom as the boy testified that he initially 
had sex with the woman in mid-April out of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the encounter, the two again had sex after Arden threatened to 
report the boy to the police, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge James P. Cloninger ordered Arden to stand trial on two counts 
of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, two counts of sexual conduct using 
a foreign object, one count of showing explicit photos to a minor and one count 
of lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy said Arden contacted him through a youth employment service in March 
to help her move out of a rented room on White Oak Lane. A month later, as he 
was doing more work for Arden, she showed him nude photos of herself and other 
overweight women on a computer screen and in the pages of a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her my mom didn't let me look at these sort of things," the boy 
testified. But the youth said he agreed to have sex with the woman because he 
was "curious and confused." 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, he said they had sex again after she threatened to report him to 
police. Police have said they began investigating the case in May, after the 
boy's mother became suspicious when Arden called asking for her son. The mother 
was in the courtroom Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden's arraignment was set for Sept. 2. She is being held in Ventura County 
Jail in lieu of $20,000 bail. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BOY SAYS BROTHER GOT HIM TO SELL COCAINE

 An Oxnard man must stand trial on charges of forcing his 12-year-old brother 
to sell drugs, but the defendant's girlfriend will face lesser charges, a 
Ventura County judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge John R. Smiley found probable cause to uphold charges against 
25-year-old Roberto Guadalupe Avitia of inducing a minor to sell narcotics, 
possession of cocaine and possession of heroin.He faces up to 11 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge dismissed a charge of inducing a minor to sell narcotics against 
Avitia's girlfriend, Maria Racquel Chavez, 21. Chavez was ordered to stand 
trial on the othercharges of possessing cocaine and heroin and faces up to five 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was arrested Aug. 4 after police raided the family's apartment in a 
crime-ridden south Oxnard neighborhood. The raid was conducted after the boy 
sold $60 worth of cocaine to an undercover officer. He later told police he was 
working for the two defendants, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the witness stand Friday, the thin, dark-haired child said that only 
his brother instructed him to sell the drugs. Testifying under a grant of 
immunity, the boy said Chavez told him it was bad to deal in narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy estimated that he conducted 30 drug sales during the two-week period 
before his arrest. "Isn't it true that it was Roberto who helped you sell drugs 
but not Racquel," questioned defense attorney Tim Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," answered the boy through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did Roberto teach you to sell drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
 "More or less," the boy testified. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian S. Rafelson maintained that 
evidence suggests that Chavez also encouraged the boy's drug-trafficking 
endeavors. Prosecutors had not decided whether to refile the charge against 
her, as is allowed under law, he said. DWAYNE BRAY

 A Ventura city worker struck by a car last week died Friday of head injuries, 
authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Ramirez, 57, of Oxnard was hit by a car as he was retrieving orange 
traffic cones on Victoria Avenue just north of Olivas Park Drive last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officials said the investigation into the incident 
is continuing and no charges have been brought against 28-year-old Patrick J. 
Biando of Ventura, who hit Ramirez as he drove to work in Oxnard, authorities 
said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Biando was changing lanes and apparently did not see Ramirez until it was too 
late, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazir Lalani, Ramirez's boss, said Ramirez had received safety training and 
was wearing an orange traffic vest.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city officials with whom Ramirez worked while in the engineering 
division of the Community Services Department expressed sorrow Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tragic accident . . . that took his life," said Carol Green, 
assistant to the city manager of Ventura. "We haven't experienced anything like 
this before. It's a very distressing event." JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; U.S. FUNDS SOUGHT FOR DRUG PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Paula city officials want to use federal Community Development Block 
Grant funds to finance a police-run drug education program that was cut earlier 
this year for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to ask county regulators, who decide how cities 
can use federal funds, to approve the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Police Chief Walter Adair was forced to reassign his one Drug 
Abuse Resistance Education officer earlier this year to street patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The application approved this week by the council would allow use of $42,000 
of the Community Development Block Grant money to hire an entry-level police 
officer, Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time we've used this money to fund any of our police 
programs," Adair said. "But I feel confident we'll be successful in getting 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Arnold Dowdy said that under existing block grant 
guidelines, the federal money must be used to fund programs that support at 
least 50% of the area's low- to moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 Because nearly 60% of the children tutored about drug abuse prevention in the 
DARE program qualify, he said he sees no problem in gaining approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one more way we're trying to be creative in dealing with the city's 
budget problem," Dowdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval process will take about three months, and any new officer would 
require about four months of training before joining the force, Adair said. It 
would be at least six months before the DARE officer could be reassigned from 
the streets to the classrooms, he said. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; PROMISE OF FANS COOLS SICKOUT THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fillmore teachers backed down on their threat to stage a sickout this week 
after the school district offered to distribute electric fans to combat 
classroom temperatures in the high 90s, and shorten the school day during 
extremely hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Wednesday with Supt. Mario Contini, teachers demanded that the 
administration take action to improve working conditions in the district, where 
many classrooms are not air-conditioned, said Mary Ford, president of the 
Fillmore Unified Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 96 degrees in one teacher's algebra class," Ford said. "It's 
ridiculous to expect anyone to learn algebra, or anything else for that matter, 
in conditions like that." 
</P>
<P>
 School begins in early August for the district's year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Cayetano Elementary School, Principal Karen Cooksey said she was 
rotating classes into the air-conditioned school library every 30 minutes to 
cope with the sweltering heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Riley, an English teacher at Fillmore High School, said he resorted to 
taking a sponge bath at lunch time and standing in front of a large fan through 
most of his classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riley said after Wednesday's meeting with school district personnel that 
he was convinced a solution to the problem has been found. "I would say we have 
a big happy ending, or maybe a big, happy midpoint to the story," he said. 
</P>

 In addition to distributing fans and working on a policy to shorten the school 
day when temperatures exceed 95 degrees, the district will set aside money to 
buy air conditioning for the high school, Riley said. "We know that money isn't 
just sitting around somewhere so it might not happen anytime soon," Riley said. 
"But the district is saying the right things." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the high school had discussed walking out during classes Thursday 
in protest, but Riley said the administration's promises stopped the walkout.

DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME SAYS AREA WOULD BE HARMED BY RESORT; PORT HUENEME: 
A MEMORANDUM CITES ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITY. CITY OFFICIALS SAY THE DOCUMENT 
IS LUDICROUS AND INDEFENSIBLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Joining the debate over whether a recreational vehicle park should be built on 
the beach in Port Hueneme, the state Department of Fish and Game has declared 
Hueneme Beach an environmentally sensitive area that would be harmed by an RV 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the proposed RV resort came in a memorandum sent to the 
California Coastal Commission Aug. 12 in response to questions that the 
commission had posed to the Department of Fish and Game about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum marks the first time the department has made an in-depth formal 
analysis of the possible damages that an RV resort could cause to the 
California least tern and western snowy plover, which inhabit nearby Ormond 
Beach, said Christopher Price, an analyst with the California Coastal 
Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 "This letter specifies issues which were never specified before. Particularly 
in designating the site and explaining the site's environmental sensitivity," 
Price said. "This is probably the most detailed and formal correspondence from 
the Department of Fish and Game." 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-page memorandum states that "This area is considered ESHA 
(Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area), primarily because of the entire site 
value as a buffer for the diverse, rare, sensitive and important biological 
values of the Ormond Beach ecosystem. . .The entire area could just as well be 
named the Hueneme ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Friday that the memorandum is ludicrous because it assumes 
that most of the undeveloped coastal land in Southern California is home to 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "This letter does not make sense. It's indefensible," said Port Hueneme City 
Manager Richard Velthoen. "They are suggesting that every undeveloped piece of 
coastal land in Southern California be declared an ESHA." 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum states that "given the rarity of the coastal strand with 
adjacent upland or wetland habitat, most open space left along the coastline of 
southern California should be considered ESHA." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the memorandum declares Mugu Lagoon, Point Mugu Naval Air 
Weapon Station, Ormond Beach, private and Oxnard-owned properties inland to 
McWane Road, Hueneme Beach, Mandalay Beach, McGrath Lake and McGrath Beach to 
be "only a few of the many possible areas qualified as ESHA." 
</P>
<P>
 The city project calls for the construction of a 146-space RV resort on a 
10-acre beachfront site at the end of Ocean View Drive at Hueneme Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old project, which was approved by the City Council last May, has 
been opposed by environmentalists and residents who claim it would harm a 
nearby wetland habitat and ruin their views of the ocean as well as devalue 
property.  
</P>
<P>
 But city officials have maintained that the RV resort is the most feasible 
means for the financially strapped city to raise revenues without increasing 
taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 The RV resort is expected to bring the city a net revenue of $400,000 a year. 
The city plans to use the money to maintain its parks and recreational 
facilities, said Tom Figg, director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the city begins building the RV resort, the Coastal Commission must 
approve the project. The commission is scheduled to vote on the proposal on 
Sept. 13 in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners of the 375 condominiums adjacent to the proposed site saw the Fish 
and Game memo as a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department's recommendation is clear: If the city builds the RV (resort) 
they will be destroying endangered species," said Tom Brigham, president of the 
Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn. "The environment has been saved." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Brigham said he fears that the city may decide to move the location of the 
RV resort a half mile toward the pier where the land is not considered an 
environmentally sensitive habitat area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they have no plans to move the site of the RV resort. "It 
would be absurd for us to change the location of the RV resort," Velthoen said. 
"We just hope the commissioners will approve the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Price, the Coastal Commission analyst who will submit a report to the 
commissioners in early September, said the information the Department of Fish 
and Game provided will play an important role in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the memorandum further substantiates claims about the potential 
impact the RV would have in the sensitive resources which inhabit the area," 
Price said. "It certainly will affect our recommendation."

SIERRA CLUB SUES THOUSAND OAKS OVER COUNCIL'S SUBDIVISION APPROVAL; NEWBURY 
PARK: HOUSING OK IS CALLED AN 'UNPRECEDENTED BLUNDER' THAT THREATENS 
ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against Thousand Oaks 
Friday, alleging the city abandoned its commitment to the environment and to 
the safety of its residents to push forward a major Newbury Park development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club called the city's approval of the Dos Vientos housing 
development an "unprecedented blunder," and said the project would be harmful 
because of its proximity to power poles and fault lines, and its added traffic 
and smog. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the San Francisco-based national nonprofit group contends that the 
220-house subdivision endangers 10 federally protected animal species and would 
irreparably damage the environment because it blocks a vital wildlife corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 in July to approve the subdivision, which is part of 
a massive 2,230-house development planned for 4,570 acres north of Potrero 
Road. Council members argued they could not break a 1990 agreement they had 
signed with the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 City offices were closed Friday and the city attorney was not available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Judy Lazar, one of those who supported the development, said 
the council was locked into the decision to build Dos Vientos when the 
development agreement was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have been the time for a lawsuit," she said. "I don't think at 
this point they have grounds for a suit. We did the best that we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Club attorney Stephan Volker said his group took on the case because it 
is "a chance for the courts to clarify whether a city can limit an 
environmental review simply because they mistakenly entered into a restrictive 
development agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the Conejo Valley residents who have raised more than $10,000 to help fund 
the lawsuit said they are supporting the case because they felt betrayed by the 
City Council's approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Debate over this development has galvanized the community," said Michelle 
Koetke, who formed Residents to Preserve Newbury Park three years ago to oppose 
Dos Vientos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't believe that a city that was noted for its planning would do 
something this destructive," she said, adding that the council decision 
promises to be a major issue in the upcoming City Council campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Elois Zeanah, who joined Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski in voting 
against the agreement, refused to speculate on the impact the lawsuit would 
have on the campaign, but said it was clear to her that the residents are 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be a record issue for use, in terms of the number of people 
attending hearings on Dos Vientos," Zeanah said. "Every one of those residents 
expressed strongly their disgust with the development." 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over approval of the project drove a wedge between council members, 
with Zeanah and Zukowski arguing that the city had abandoned its commitment to 
protect the safety of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the reports had proven with all clarity that this project is harmful 
for the residents and for the environment," Zeanah said Friday. "I think this 
lawsuit is going to make it clear that a development agreement is not 
all-powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore has argued that Thousand Oaks simply could not back out of 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me when you have a contract with someone you're obligated to stay 
within the confines of that contract," Fiore said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Signed in 1990, the deal offered two developers, Operating Engineers and 
Courtly Homes, the right to build 2,350 residences in exchange for $12.6 
million, 1,000 acres of open space, and set-aside money for parks, schools and 
other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 220-house subdivision was the first portion of the project to win council 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is still months away from groundbreaking because the developers 
need permit approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Club attorney Volker said he hoped the legal action would be far enough 
along by then to prevent the start of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to move as quickly as possible on this to ensure no earth is 
moved," Volker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the lawsuit is the contention that the development agreement had a 
clause that allowed the city to back out of the deal if the development 
violated any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club alleges that the project violates the California Environmental 
Quality Act because of numerous impacts -- many acknowledged by the city -- to 
the wildlife in the mountains near Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dos Vientos lies at the heart of one of only two habitat corridors connecting 
the natural habitats of the Santa Monica Mountains to wildlife areas to the 
north," the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lazar said Friday the major impacts of the development had been mitigated 
by the council. "The densities are lower and the mitigation efforts by the 
developer were tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 But the location of the development was something Volker said the Sierra Club 
could not ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 "That area is a national resource," Volker said. "It is a unique habitat for 
endangered species, it provides a link between wild areas, and the value of 
that land was in itself sufficient to warrant our suit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar said she believed the lawsuit would be proven frivolous and would force 
the city to waste taxpayer money to defend the council decision.  
</P>
<P>
 But reaction to the suit from the community was supportive, Koetke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it marks a sea change in Thousand Oaks," Koetke said. "It will allow 
the residents to take back Thousand Oaks. We are supporting that effort both 
with our spirit and with our dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) issued a statement 
praising the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that this lawsuit will ultimately result in preserving the scenic and 
ecological value of the National Park Service property," Beilenson's statement 
said. "We cannot allow this development to spoil this valuable parkland that we 
have worked so hard to acquire." 
</P>
<P>
 Volker said the issue has gained widespread support in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue has struck a nerve," he said. "(Residents') efforts have far 
surpassed those of any community I can recall." 
</P>
<P>
 Volker said the next step in the case will be a hearing within two months to 
determine which public documents will be included in the court record.

DISPUTE OVER FUNDS MAY COST CITY, GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A dispute between the city of Moorpark and a local environmental organization 
over money left from a $64,000 state grant to restore habitat on the Arroyo 
Simi may result in the money being returned to the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The city and the local chapter of the Environmental Coalition are arguing over 
$4,470 that has yet to be spent. The city wants to split the sum equally, while 
the Environmental Coalition is arguing that the city should receive no more 
than 25% of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about the money, it's the principle," said Roseann Mikos, the 
Environmental Coalition's project manager. "What we offered was more than fair. 
They aren't entitled to half the money when they themselves admit they didn't 
do half the work and never planned to do half the work."  
</P>
<P>
 At a City Council meeting Wednesday night, the council split 2 to 2 on what to 
do with the money. Council members Patrick Hunter and Bernardo Perez favored 
the Environmental Coalition's offer, while Mayor Paul Lawrason and Councilman 
Scott Montgomery thought the city should receive 50% of the leftover money. 
Councilman John Wozniak was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mikos, who would receive the money for work she performed on the project, had 
bitter words for the city Friday after an agreement on what to do with the 
money remained unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason they are singling me out," she said. "And now they're drawing 
a line in the sand hoping we'll back down. Well, we're not backing down. 
They're trying to take money out of the budget that isn't even theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikos said both the city and members of the Environmental Coalition planned to 
be compensated for half the time they spent working on the project, and to 
donate the other half of their time. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a final report on the project, city personnel were expected to 
put in 319 hours performing mostly administrative work, but actually put in 
about 335 hours. Personnel working with the Environmental Coalition planned to 
work 3,168 hours, but actually put in 5,644 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear we both did more work than we anticipated, but look at the hours 
and tell me who did the bulk of the work," Mikos said. "They weren't even out 
there doing the planting and weeding. Most of their time was spent reworking 
the contract, because of problems they had in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason argued it was only fair to distribute the money equally because the 
city and the Environmental Coalition were equal partners in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received $11,968 for its time. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said missteps at the beginning of the project by city staff members have 
created an atmosphere of mistrust between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, just before the city was to receive the $64,000 grant, Montgomery 
tried to stop seven members of the Environmental Coalition's board of 
directors, including Mikos, from being paid for part of their work on the 
project. He said then that he did not know the group was being paid and was led 
to believe the group would volunteer its time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council meeting this week Montgomery said he thought the project was 
about volunteerism and that he owed it to the city's taxpayers to demand an 
equal share of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez disagreed. "It's been a long, painful process in which the city should 
take the blame for initial missteps and oversights," he said.
