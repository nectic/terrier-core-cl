 POET'S CORNER: Anne Youngdale got a letter the other day from Los Angeles 
County prosecutors. The 66-year-old Oak View woman wasn't in trouble. Seems her 
prose about the O. J. Simpson case caught the eye of the law in L. A. . . . 
Youngdale, a recent inductee to the International Society of Poets, sent Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti and prosecutor Marcia Clark a poem that she wrote 
memorializing the victims in the case. . . . "They thanked me for my poem," 
Youngdale said, "they thanked me for my support and they said all they wanted 
was for fairness and justice to prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 NATURE'S HELPERS: The idea came to Paul Starbard three years ago: The 
environment's in trouble. Kids are in trouble. Someone had to make a commitment 
and, he reasoned, "it might as well be me. . . ." So he created the CREW 
(Concerned Resource and Environmental Workers), an Ojai-based nonprofit project 
that puts city kids to work helping Mother Nature (E1). The CREW has been busy 
this summer grooming trails that snake through the mountains above Ojai. . . . 
Next up? Maybe a national CREW. "Our whole country's full of kids who need 
attention," Starbard said.

<P>
 PITCHING IN: Lena Simitzi knows when she started volunteering at the Ventura 
County Fair. She just doesn't know when she'll stop. . . . Simitzi, 84, of 
Ventura, has volunteered at the fair for 51 years (B1), longer than any living 
soul. . . . She began by judging buttons and rose to head the home arts 
division. . . . Though still active, she has scaled back her activity. "There 
comes a time when you have to give it up and let someone else take over," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 ILLEGAL PROCEDURE: The state's leading high school pass receiver will spend 
the next six months in jail instead of on a football field after being 
sentenced for shooting at his girlfriend's home (B1). . . . Former Newbury Park 
football star Leodes Van Buren lost his University of Colorado scholarship 
after his arrest. As his attorney says: "It certainly disrupts his ability to 
go on with his education and his football career."

2 TEEN-AGE ROBBERS HANDED OVER TO TRIBE FOR EXPECTED BANISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers who admitted robbing a pizza deliveryman have been handed over 
to a tribal judge on their way to an expected banishment on remote Alaskan 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Guthrie and Simon Roberts, who had been jailed since shortly after the 
August, 1993, attack, were released Wednesday to tribal Judge Rudy James. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours earlier, Superior Court Judge James Allendoerfer signed an order giving 
custody of the 17-year-olds to the tribal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Allendoerfer agreed to release the two for 18 months, during which time they 
will be judged by a traditional tribal court in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 James said the pair would likely be banished to remote islands for a year with 
the hope the experience would spiritually cleanse them. They would be provided 
tools and wilderness training before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers and their families would probably also have to pay restitution 
to the victim, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allendoerfer would also have the option of sentencing them to prison 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Guthrie and Roberts, from Klawock on Alaska's Prince of Wales Island, were 
visiting relatives last August when they attacked pizza deliveryman Tim 
Whittlesey. They pleaded guilty in May to first-degree robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittlesey, who was hit with a baseball bat, suffered permanent vision and 
hearing loss.

PRESIDENT PRAISES LAWMAKERS FOR 'BRAVE AND PROMISING STEP'

<P>
 Following is the text of President Clinton's statement on the Senate 
procedural vote on the crime bill: 
</P>
<P>
 For six long years, the American people have watched and waited as Washington 
talked about stemming the tide of crime and violence in this country, but did 
not act. Today, senators of both parties took a brave and promising step to 
bring the long, hard wait for a crime bill closer to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to salute the senators of both Republican and Democratic ranks who put 
law and order, safety and security above politics and party. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary Americans all across our country ought to take heart today. In the 
last two weeks, members of Congress in both houses and from both parties have 
thrown off the bonds of politics as usual to do the people's business. That's 
what the people sent us all here to do. I hope this crime bill will now rapidly 
pass the Senate and that we can move on doing the people's business across 
party lines, unencumbered by the labels of the past and the false choices of 
the past, moving to a better future for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you.

DUNAWAY SUES LLOYD WEBBER OVER 'SUNSET BLVD.' FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In retaliation for being dumped from the Los Angeles production of "Sunset 
Boulevard," Faye Dunaway on Thursday filed a $6-million-plus lawsuit in Los 
Angeles Superior Court against composer/producer Andrew Lloyd Webber and his 
Really Useful Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie star was to have taken over the role of Norma Desmond on July 5, but 
only three days before Glenn Close was to leave the role June 26, Lloyd Webber 
abruptly announced that Close's final performance would be the swan song for 
the entire Los Angeles production. Dunaway, he contended, could not sing the 
role well enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway is seeking $1 million for breach of contract, at least $5 million on a 
variety of defamation and fraud charges, and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she assumed the role, Dunaway's salary would have been $25,000 a week, 
plus 5% of the weekly gross over $700,000. With full houses, she could have 
earned as much as $38,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement Thursday, Dunaway said she welcomed "a public forum to 
set the record straight and clear both my name and my reputation. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I am the last in a long line of artists who have come to this man's 
productions in good faith and have suffered great personal and professional 
injury at his hands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit paves the way for another high-profile celebrity trial -- or, as 
Dunaway's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, jocularly called it Thursday, "Dunaway 
vs. Webber -- the 'Sunset Boulevard' You Never Saw." The case has been assigned 
to Judge Michael Berg but probably will not go to trial before next year, 
O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Brown, a longtime spokesman for Lloyd Webber based in New York, 
responded angrily to the suit: "We've never seen a lawsuit with so little 
foundation. It's a stickup, and we're not going to tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 37-page complaint filed Thursday, O'Donnell contends that Dunaway was 
cast as "a stalking horse to test the financial viability" of the show and that 
Lloyd Webber fired Dunaway out of greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit claims that when advance sales for "Sunset Boulevard" diminished, the 
producer and his investors decided that they could save money by sending the 
already seasoned Los Angeles cast to the Broadway production scheduled to open 
in November. It also contends that the closing was aimed to recoup some of the 
Lloyd Webber group's Los Angeles investment by selling the set used in Los 
Angeles to the upcoming Toronto production, which it claims was announced just 
one day before Lloyd Webber's decision to fire Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit asserts that Dunaway was the victim and that Lloyd Webber "cast a 
dark shadow" over the actress's professional abilities and breached her 
contract. The complaint characterizes Lloyd Webber and his fellow defendants as 
"coldblooded character assassins cravenly abusing their awesome power over the 
world's media and public opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, in turn, accused Dunaway on Thursday of being the media manipulator. 
"The complaint is a press release masquerading as a pleading -- a further log 
thrown by Miss Dunaway and her representatives to fuel the fire of media 
attention, which they have stoked since her termination from the role of Norma 
Desmond." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also pits Lloyd Webber against his longtime collaborator, Trevor 
Nunn, director of "Sunset Boulevard." The complaint quotes extensively a letter 
from Nunn to Dunaway dated June 28, in which the director says he protested 
"vigorously" over the lack of time scheduled for rehearsals where both he and 
Dunaway would have been present. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell argues that Nunn was given six weeks to prepare Betty Buckley, a 
more experienced musical theater actress, to take over the role in London, 
while he was given only six days to work with Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn also is quoted as recalling the meeting at which Lloyd Webber reportedly 
gave encouragement to Dunaway only one day before he decided to fire her. The 
next morning, Nunn said, he reminded Lloyd Webber of what he had said to 
Dunaway. "He replied that he realized at the time that he was saying the 
opposite of what he thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint goes into considerable detail about whether Dunaway's shooting 
schedule for the film "Don Juan de Marco and the Centerfold" was a factor in 
the decision to fire her. The "Sunset Boulevard" producers knew about the 
shooting schedule all along, argues O'Donnell, and it "never changed during the 
six weeks from when Ms. Dunaway was offered the part until her termination."

ETHICS PANEL LOOKS AT MTA VOTE BY RIORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's political ethics commission is investigating Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan to determine whether he violated conflict-of-interest law by 
taking action last year that benefited an engineering firm in which he held 
$9.75 million of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with the investigation said this week that the California Fair 
Political Practices Commission is examining Riordan's role in 1993 as a board 
member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. As a first step, the 
commission has requested documents from the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in June that Riordan, who pledged during his 1993 campaign 
to separate his business holdings from any official duties, took actions that 
benefited Tetra Tech Inc., a Pasadena-based engineering firm. Financial 
disclosure reports show that Riordan's stake in Tetra Tech was his largest 
single holding in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has said that he was unaware one year ago that his actions at the MTA 
would benefit Tetra Tech. The mayor on Aug. 25, 1993, introduced and won 
passage of an amendment to the MTA's budget that committed $97 million for a 
light-rail project that would link Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. Although 
the amendment did not mention Tetra Tech, it provided funding for a contract 
the firm had received in June, 1993, one month before Riordan took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seven weeks of that vote, Tetra Tech received its first $267,000 under 
the contract. As of June of this year, Tetra Tech had received about $320,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen C. McAndrews, an attorney who is representing Riordan, said Thursday 
that she believes the FPPC investigation is at an early point. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, it's at a very preliminary stage," said McAndrews, who 
served as an FPPC commissioner from 1977 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The FPPC is empowered to impose administrative penalties and fines and, more 
rarely, to refer cases for criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 McAndrews said the mayor could not have violated conflict-of-interest law 
because he has said he was unaware last year that his championing of the 
$97-million amendment would benefit Tetra Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have knowledge (of a potential conflict of interest) and there is 
really no way he could reasonably have had knowledge," McAndrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's press secretary, Noelia Rodriguez, said Thursday that the mayor's 
office is "more than willing to cooperate with any investigation that takes 
place." Rodriguez also said that all of Riordan's stock in Tetra Tech was sold 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 For Riordan, the liquidation marks the end of a six-year affiliation with 
Tetra Tech -- a firm that he helped establish in 1988 with a leveraged buyout 
that allowed its existing management to purchase control from Honeywell Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and one of his investment banking partners held two of the three seats 
on Tetra Tech's board from 1988 to 1992. Riordan's investment banking partner, 
J. Christopher Lewis, continues to serve on Tetra Tech's board and is trustee 
of the mayor's 14-month-old blind trust. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, a spokeswoman for the FPPC, citing agency policy, declined to 
discuss the Riordan matter. 
</P>
<P>
 After The Times' article in June, the FPPC was urged to open an investigation 
by California Common Cause, the nonpartisan lobbying group, and by state Sen. 
Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Turvill, spokeswoman for the FPPC, said the agency investigates only 
a small fraction of requests. Last year, Turvill said, the FPPC received 750 
written requests to open investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter sent by an FPPC attorney to Riordan's attorney on July 13 said the 
mayor would have to abstain from certain future budgetary decisions affecting 
Tetra Tech in order to avoid a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The FPPC letter, in response to a request for advice from McAndrews, stated 
that Riordan must abstain from participating in budgetary decisions in which he 
has a "disqualifying financial interest." 
</P>
<P>
 State law generally prohibits officials from participating in decisions that 
affect their financial interests of at least $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 McAndrews, noting that the FPPC's advice applies to future actions, said she 
does not believe that the letter can be interpreted as a passing of judgment on 
Riordan's role a year ago with the Pasadena line amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was absent last month when the MTA voted on its latest budget. 
McAndrews said Riordan's absence was caused by a scheduling conflict, not 
concern for the recent FPPC advice letter.

SEISMIC SERIES; EARTHQUAKE IS A PLAYER IN NORTHRIDGE TEAM'S LITTLE LEAGUE 
VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON and SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of this year's calamitous quake and in the thick of this month's 
baseball strike, a gang of Southern California youngsters found something to 
cheer about Thursday as Northridge became the national champions at the Little 
League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-0 victory over a team from Springfield, Va., came on the strength of a 
one-hit shutout by pitcher Nathaniel Dunlap and a three-run homer by Spencer 
Gordon. Parents and boosters, who had traveled across the continent for the 
playoff game, cheered wildly, clad in custom-made T-shirts bearing the team's 
unofficial nickname -- The Earthquake Kids.  
</P>
<P>
 The victory marked the third consecutive U.S. title to be awarded to a 
Southern California team, and put Northridge into the Little League World 
Series championship game, to be played Saturday against Maracaibo, Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 But its biggest impact was perhaps the psychological boost it will give the 
team's embattled hometown, which has waged an uphill fight for eight months 
against the devastation wrought by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sign-ups for Little League came two weeks after the magnitude 6.8 temblor, and 
as the Northridge players practiced for their chance at the World Series, the 
quake has never been far from their families' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite literally, it was a shock that hit very close to home: An estimated 
two-thirds of the team's families had to move out of their homes after the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The family of shortstop Matt Fisher is still living on the second floor of 
their quake-damaged house -- two parents, three children and a dog. The first 
baseman's family, the Cassels, are still renting while their home repairs drag 
on. The parents of Spencer -- the right fielder who hit the winning home run 
Thursday -- lost their law office in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if it they hadn't had to wage a comeback against a natural disaster, 
the Northridge team would have made the record books. According to Little 
League Headquarters, Northridge is the first team from the Western Region to 
have sent three teams to the World Series. The community's team qualified in 
1967 and again in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also marked the third U.S. title in as many years for Southern 
California Little Leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Long Beach won not only the national championship, but the World 
Series, winning the title with a victory over a Panama team. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the same Long Beach team won the national championship then lost in 
the World Series finale to the Philippines. Later, it was revealed that several 
Filipino players were overage and Long Beach was awarded the title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge team got an early start on Thursday's victory, scoring all 
three of its runs in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Gentile -- who just the day before had pitched a one-hitter of his own 
-- led off with a double. Then Matt Cunningham reached base on an error, and 
one out later, Spencer hit a line drive over the center field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hit it, I thought it was a pop-up to center field, " said Spencer, who 
is 12. "Then I saw fans scramble for the ball, and I knew it was out (of the 
park)." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Nathaniel Dunlap -- a 5-foot-11 right-hander whose pitches have 
been clocked at 74 m.p.h. -- managed to hold onto a no-hitter for 5 1/3 innings 
of the six-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole hit he gave up went to Springfield's Paul Weishar, who singled to 
right field. Then, after an error put runners on first and second, Dunlap 
struck out the last two batters to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates were telling me I was born to pitch this game," Dunlap said, 
"and except for (losing) the no-hitter, this is the greatest game I've been a 
part of." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Larry Baca said that if the team wins the series, it will be due -- at 
least partly -- to January's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the quake," Baca said, "our kids played more baseball than they 
would have in other years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mall was closed, and they spent most of their time on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's game, which will also be played in Williamsport, will start at 
12:40 p.m. and be carried by ABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Henson reported from Williamsport and Hubler reported from Los Angeles.

1965 FALLOUT HITS A SUSPICIOUS L.A.; HEALTH: AREA OFFICIALS SAY THEY WERE 
UNAWARE OF A RADIOACTIVE CLOUD THAT WAS SENT OVER THE CITY. ATOMIC AGENCY 
OFFICIALS MINIMIZE HAZARDS. 
</P>

<P>
 They were seemingly unrelated front-page news events on Jan. 13, 1965: 
Government scientists in Nevada had intentionally blown up a nuclear rocket, 
and the Santa Ana winds had begun pushing warm desert air "from a high pressure 
front in Nevada" into the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were more than coincidence. Newly released records show that Atomic 
Energy Commission officials had been waiting for the unusual southwesterly wind 
pattern in order to gauge the possible environmental effects of a major launch 
pad disaster involving nuclear rockets then being tested for the space program. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to the Southern California public and most local officials, the 
radioactive cloud from the blast was tracked 200 miles as it moved across 
California, over Los Angeles and out over the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years later, news of the radioactive cloud, which officials insist 
was harmless, has landed in a far more suspicious and environmentally conscious 
Los Angeles than existed when hilltop missile bases guarded against foreign 
nuclear attack and police officers were equipped with Geiger counters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scare was more from the Soviet Union than . . . our own testing," said 
retired City Engineer Donald Tillman, who sat on Los Angeles' Civil Defense and 
Disaster Board in the mid-1960s. "I think most people had a feeling that these 
tests (were necessary) and they expected the Defense Department to protect us." 
</P>
<P>
 Since those days, another era has dawned. An anti-nuclear movement has been 
born. Disaster has struck at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island. There has been a 
series of disclosures about Cold War-era government testing programs using 
unwitting citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who released details Wednesday of Los 
Angeles' nuclear cloud, has charged that about 6 million area residents may 
have been used as human guinea pigs in the experiment. He has called on the 
Department of Energy to include the incident in a series of government human 
radiation experiments being reviewed by scientists to determine if compensation 
or follow-up medical care is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's further evidence that the nuclear industry has been quite careless 
throughout its history," said Joseph Lyou, who directs the Committee to Bridge 
the Gap, a Los Angeles nuclear watchdog group. Lyou said his group's rough 
estimates suggest a few among the millions of people living here at the time 
might have died or contracted cancer as a result of the radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment was sharply disputed Thursday by agencies involved in the 
experiment, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which conducted the 
test for the old Atomic Energy Commission. "It was such a small amount (of 
radiation) by the time it got to the border of the test site it wasn't anything 
to get excited about," said John Gustafson, a laboratory spokesman. Gustafson 
said Los Alamos physicists estimate that the exposure levels in Los Angeles 
were a fraction of a millirem -- far less than the added radiation received in 
many routine activities, including flying across the country in an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 What seems clear is that few knew at the time that the cloud was quietly 
drifting over Los Angeles. Several political and government officials said 
Thursday that they were surprised by the disclosures and should have been 
informed at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would have all sorts of investigations by the Fire Department and the 
supervisors would have asked what went wrong (and the) congressional 
representatives of Los Angeles to investigate," said former county Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn, who was a leader in Cold War civil defense planning issues and 
one of those who said he knew nothing of the cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said the cloud could have created public panic. Others were not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody really was that concerned," said former Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates, then a rising protege of the late LAPD Chief William H. Parker, 
the city's civil defense czar. "I don't think the whole issue of radiation was 
(seen) as the kind of danger that people perceive it to be today." 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman added: "Scientists (would have said) it's going to disperse. It's 
gonna be gone. It's not like a tidal wave or dam about to break." 
</P>
<P>
 News accounts at the time described the explosion of the rocket, part of an 
ill-fated plan to use nuclear missiles for a moon mission, as a spectacular 
event that illuminated the Neveda sky "like a Roman candle." Associated Press 
reported that the blast, far smaller than that of a nuclear weapon, sent up a 
"white cloud of intense radiation (that was) blown harmlessly to the 
southwest." 
</P>
<P>
 Fallout tests were conducted around the site at Jackass Flats, Nev., news 
reports noted. But it was not disclosed that planes were tracking the cloud as 
it moved toward Southern California, or that officials were closely monitoring 
routine air and milk samples in the cloud's path days after the blast. Elevated 
levels of radiation were found in air samples in Los Angeles and elsewhere, but 
they were were not significant, officials later reported in the newly released 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hindsight, clearly there would have been apprehension and concern," said 
Harry Hufford, a former county executive who oversaw a reorganization of public 
health agencies at the time. He noted that even low-level radiation exposure -- 
such as that from X-ray machines used to measure feet in shoe stores -- was an 
emerging public health concern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much remains unclear about the Jackass Flats experiment. Officials could not 
say Thursday if scientists believed in advance that the cloud would reach Los 
Angeles, or why a public alert was not issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson, the Los Alamos laboratory spokesman, said scientists wanted winds 
blowing toward the southwest (prevailing winds are to the east) because it was 
a small blast. Officials believed the cloud would dissipate over less populated 
desert areas, he said. He speculated that no public warning was issued to Los 
Angeles residents because by the time the cloud left Nevada "the levels (of 
radiation) were so low, especially given the standards of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great stretch to imply these were human radiation experiments" on 
populations downwind from the blast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a minimum, said anti-nuclear activist Lyou, the cloud that came to Los 
Angeles highlights the arrogance and carelessness of atomic research in the 
era. "Obviously, there was a greater degree of naivete and recklessness and 
less public oversight than should have been," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 An irony of the new disclosures, several of those interviewed said, is that 
Los Angeles' Cold War civil defense efforts focused intensely on the hostile 
nuclear threat looming across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were looking for the foreign enemy," said Los Angeles historian John 
Weaver, who has written about the era. "They weren't looking for the enemy that 
was directing their (defense) operations." Clouded Connection 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly unrelated front-page stories in Jan. 13, 1965, editions of The 
Times-scientists in Nevada intentionally blowing up a nuclear rocket and Santa 
Ana winds blowing warm desert air "from a high pressure front in Nevada" into 
L.A.-were more than mere coincidence, according to records that show officials 
ad been waiting for just such fa weather pattern to measure, among other 
things, th possible environmental effects of a major disaster in the use of 
nuclear rockets for space flight.

OFFICER FIRED IN KING CASE GETS JOB IN CULVER CITY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: TIMOTHY E. 
WIND IS HIRED AS A POLICE DEPARTMENT COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICER. OFFICIALS SAY 
HE IS WELL QUALIFIED AND NOTE THAT HE WAS ACQUITTED IN TWO TRIALS. 
</P>

<P>
 Timothy E. Wind, the rookie police officer who repeatedly struck and kicked 
Rodney G. King in the videotaped beating that shook Los Angeles, has been hired 
as a community service officer by the Culver City Police Department, officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind, who was fired by the Los Angeles Police Department after the 1991 
beating but acquitted of criminal charges, will not carry a gun in his new 
position and is not considered a sworn peace officer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needed a job and we had a position available and he tested and came out 
No. 1 on the list," Lt. Joe D'Anjou said. "It's better than nothing, which is 
what he's been making since L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Wind started work Tuesday on the 35-hour-a-week job, which D'Anjou said pays 
$9.32 an hour. Earlier this summer, Wind had sought reinstatement in the LAPD 
and had won a captain's recommendation that he be rehired. But that idea was 
quickly shot down by Chief Willie L. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Anjou said the hiring of Wind had been kept quiet because of the publicity 
that it was sure to arouse. He would not comment on how the decision to hire 
Wind was made, except to say that he had been screened and was qualified for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of the job is pushing paper and answering the phone," 
D'Anjou said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there had been no speculation about whether Wind might eventually 
become a police officer with the Culver City department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't even discussed that," D'Anjou said. "We won't even be testing for 
policemen for another year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction from community leaders and major players in the King drama was 
mixed. One of King's lawyers, Steven Lerman, said the Police Department might 
be inviting trouble for itself, but did not begrudge Wind getting the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Magic Johnson taking a job parking cars. I think there is a public 
relations issue that has to be addressed and apparently Culver City has elected 
to assume the controversy," Lerman said. "If it gets out that Culver City has 
hired Tim Wind, then it might be taken as implicit that that's what it stands 
for. For Culver City to take on this kind of controversy is somewhat curious." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Lerman said, his client has no intention of trying to block 
Wind from working again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rodney King is not in the mode of a vendetta or retaliation," he said. "If 
Mr. Wind has a family to support, he's got to do the best he can by them." 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Mayor Albert Vera said he had only heard of Wind's hiring Thursday 
morning. He said his feelings were mixed, to a point where "one foot is in hot 
water and another is in icy water." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he had come down on the side of supporting the decision of Culver 
City Police Chief Ted Cooke to hire Wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe these people need a chance to survive too," Vera said. "I think 
they need a chance to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Ed Walkowitz said he would have been very concerned if Wind 
had been convicted of anything, but being acquitted twice was a major factor in 
supporting the former Los Angeles police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say that anyone involved, including someone found not culpable, should 
never get a job again is sort of a scary prospect," Walkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind's lawyer, Russell Cole, said he did not hear about his client getting the 
job until Thursday afternoon, when he was contacted by the press for comment. 
He described the new job as great and said he was not surprised that Wind would 
try to remain in police work, even if it was not as a sworn officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me that against big odds, he's going ahead," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Cmdr. David Gascon said his agency would have no comment on Wind's 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Anjou said community service officers wear uniforms of dark trousers and 
blue shirts, with a cloth badge designating them as civilian employees. He said 
most such employees are young people who want to get a feel for what police 
work is like before deciding whether to enter the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, he's working in the orientation phase," D'Anjou said. "We don't 
know ultimately where we will put him." 
</P>
<P>
 He said one option is putting Wind on park patrol, in which his duties would 
be to watch for rule infractions, but he would have to call police officers for 
any sort of enforcement. D'Anjou described Wind as very neat and bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had enough negative publicity in his life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four officers charged in the King beating were convicted. Laurence 
M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon were sentenced to 30 months each in federal prison 
-- sentences that may be greatly increased after an appeals court ruling last 
week. A third officer, Theodore J. Briseno, was acquitted in state and federal 
courts but was later fired from the Police Department. King filed a civil 
lawsuit and was awarded $3.8 million.

JUDGE ISSUES INJUNCTION AGAINST GANG IN NORWALK ; COURTS: ORDER NAMES 22 PEOPLE 
AND BARS THEM FROM TERRORIZING A NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Norwalk was granted an injunction Thursday against a notorious 
street gang accused of terrorizing a neighborhood by firebombing homes, 
harassing people, shooting weapons into the air and using drugs in public. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction, one of the first used to combat gang violence in Los Angeles 
County, names 22 members of the Orange Street Locos gang and bars them from 
carrying weapons -- including pipes, baseball bats and crowbars -- in public 
places. It also prohibits them from blocking public thoroughfares, trespassing 
and destroying public property. In all, the court order restricts 19 separate 
acts. Violators could face up to six months in jail and $1,000 fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk Superior Court Judge Lois Anderson-Smaltz granted the city's request 
after attorneys argued that the gang had turned the 20-square-block 
neighborhood, about a mile south of Norwalk City Hall, into a virtual war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was welcomed by residents in the neighborhood of small homes and 
apartment buildings where iron bars cover many windows. Some said they are 
afraid to venture out of their homes at night because of gang members loitering 
in streets and alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the city took action," said Armando Guzman, 44, who says that gang 
members make insulting comments, scrawl their names on the wall of his house 
and prowl through his yard at night. "They're a pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Hardin hopes the crackdown will end the gunfire that she hears at least 
once a week. "I'm always afraid of that stray bullet when they start playing 
John Wayne," said Hardin, 40, who walks her 6-year-old son to school less than 
a block away to protect him from the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 No gang members showed up for Thursday's court hearing, but several reacted 
angrily to news of the injunction and rejected characterizations of them as 
violent hooligans. They blamed sheriff's deputies and Norwalk public safety 
officers for causing them trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "They harass us, stop us for any reason," said a 19-year-old who is named in 
the court order but asked not to be identified. "They say if my record is 
clean, they're gonna mess it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents whose sons were named in court documents also criticized the action 
and said the neighborhood is a safe place to live. "Why are they focusing here? 
I don't see too much of a problem," said Steve Estrella, whose two sons, ages 
18 and 20, were named in the injunction. "If they really wanted to help these 
kids, why not find them jobs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Deanne B. Ancker, who is representing Norwalk, said the 
city will probably seek similar sanctions against other troublesome gangs now 
that the court has approved this injunction. The Orange Street Locos, with 
about 60 members, is one of 11 gangs in the city, which has an estimated 2,500 
gang members in all. 
</P>
<P>
 The court order follows successful efforts recently by Los Angeles and Burbank 
officials to win injunctions against entrenched gangs in their cities. In Los 
Angeles, a judge has upheld charges filed against at least one gang member 
arrested under similar terms of a court order there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ancker said the city decided to target the Orange Street Locos because of the 
intensity of the ongoing violence. Gang members are responsible for several 
firebombing incidents in recent years, including one in which an Orange Street 
Locos member recently pleaded no contest to arson charges, she said. The gang 
also has intimidated residents by firing guns into the air, breaking into cars, 
drinking in public and loitering, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I don't feel like going out alone because the cholos look at you 
like they're going to do something," said Aurora Alcantara, 18, whose front 
door was kicked in three years ago by gang members chasing a rival who had fled 
into her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction seeks to end the problems by setting a 10 p.m. curfew for all 
members of the gang under 18 and a midnight curfew for adult members. It also 
prohibits them from blocking walkways and sidewalks, speeding down streets in 
their cars, entering abandoned buildings and being on rooftops without a 
legitimate reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Street Locos has proved to be one of most active and defiant gangs 
in Norwalk, authorities said. Orange Street Locos have been known to throw 
rocks and bottles at sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities hope the restrictions will send a message to the gang. "The idea 
is to stop the behavior, not to pick up all these kids and lock them in 
prison," Ancker said. "We want to emphasize to them that we are watching them 
and that they need to stop terrorizing the citizens. Right now, they ignore 
laws because it's rare that they get picked up and charged." 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction was the first obtained under a year-old pilot program of the 
district attorney's office and Norwalk to target troublesome gangs within the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancker said the number of gang members on the street has decreased in the 
month since the city initiated legal action against the gang. "Just by 
notifying them that they are being sued, they have disappeared," Ancker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Street Locos members are expected to be served with copies of the 
injunction next week and Ancker said additional copies will probably be posted 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to send a message out that we are not going to tolerate it anymore," 
said City Manager Ernie Garcia. "This gives us another tool to get the 
attention of those who are not willing to obey our laws."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SCHOOL 
DISTRICT, UNION IN LONG MEDIATION SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers union were locked in 
a mediation session with a state arbitrator late Thursday, a sign that both 
sides are attempting to break their deadlock over a salary dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't really moved much, but we are still talking," said school district 
spokesman Bill Rivera.Before the session at the school district's headquarters, 
teachers union President Helen Bernstein characterized the talks as a positive 
sign and a chance to "use every opportunity" to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Any new offer from the district would have to be approved by the full 
seven-member Board of Education before it can be formally presented to the 
teachers union. School board President Mark Slavkin is the only board member 
attending the mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has offered to restore 7% of a 10% salary cut for teachers -- 
which includes an indefinite 4% restoration and a 3% one-year-only return. The 
union has rejected the offer, calling for a full 10% restoration. Unless a new 
offer is presented, the next step in the negotiations process is fact-finding, 
in which a neutral arbitrator will issue a non-binding report on the merits of 
the case.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 22-CITY 
BIKE TREK PLANNED TO BENEFIT AIDS CARE-GIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to raise half a million dollars for AIDS service providers, local 
activists Thursday announced plans for a 22-city, fund-raising bicycle trek 
across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride will begin in Los Angeles on Sept. 24 and end in New York on Nov. 18, 
said Maureen Simkins, who will lead the first AIDS Ride Across America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we raise, it's OK with me because I know that we're there to carry a 
message, and that's clearly the intent," said Simkins, who is also the 
president of the Los Angeles Center for Living, a nonprofit support 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a fund-raiser, it's to get communities in America together," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 175 riders have signed up for the trip's first leg through Southern 
California. The event will begin at the Pacific Design Center on Melrose 
Avenue. Riders will cover about 70 miles each day, Simkins said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; APPEALS 
COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Court of Appeal has rejected a tobacco-industry-sponsored challenge 
to the city of Los Angeles' ban on smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's 2nd Appellate District ruled Thursday that Section 339 of the City 
Election Code -- which invalidates petition signatures gathered by people who 
are not residents and registered voters within the city -- does not violate 
constitutionally guaranteed rights of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk's office ruled previously that, based on a 5% sample of 
signatures, pro-smoking forces had not gathered enough names to put a 
referendum invalidating the ban on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum's backers argued that they had been unconstitutionally 
restricted to using petition circulators who were registered voters in the 
city. A Superior Court judge agreed, but the appellate court reversed his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban remained in effect throughout the litigation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GARCETTI 
UNVEILS PROGRAM TO FIGHT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti on Thursday unveiled Los Angeles County's latest 
weapon against domestic violence -- a program in which volunteer lawyers, 
working out of a police station, will help victims of stalkers, harassers and 
batterers file for temporary restraining orders against their tormentors. 
</P>
<P>
 The orders, which must be issued by a judge, prohibit aggressive and 
persistent estranged partners from going near the target of their harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of the order can lead to immediate arrest on a misdemeanor charge 
under a law that went into effect in January. If the order is violated again, 
the violator can be charged with a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we are not going to stop all (domestic) violence with temporary 
restraining orders," Garcetti said during a news conference. "But it does stop 
many acts of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 His office and the 1,400-member Women Lawyers of Los Angeles began developing 
the program in March, Garcetti said -- three months before national attention 
was focused on domestic violence as a result of the O.J. Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is charged with the June 12 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. Five years before those killings 
-- to which Simpson has pleaded not guilty -- the ex-football great had pleaded 
no contest to misdemeanor spousal battery against Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Lydia Bodin, the deputy district attorney who conceived of the restraining 
order program, said her office had filed 1,300 felonies and 2,500 misdemeanors 
in domestic violence cases in the year that ended July 31. About a quarter of 
those cases involved restraining orders, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new program, which began Thursday at the LAPD's Southwest station, 
10 lawyers are available to help people process restraining orders free of 
charge. The program will be expanded to other stations when more volunteer 
lawyers are recruited, Garcetti said.

 But Healy went Winchell one better, using more than 500 sound bites, many from 
the non-sports world. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC, his last station, gave them one last play Wednesday night on a 90-minute 
tribute to Healy, who died of cancer last month at the age of 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, listeners could hear Johnny Grant angrily yelling, "Blow it out!" 
to protesters while emceeing a visit of then-President George Bush. The many 
Healy-coined nicknames were reprised, including "Brain Surgeons" for USC 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was a replay of Healy's induction into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
Guest speaker Milton Berle quipped that day that George Burns couldn't attend 
"on account of the distance -- he's across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The last broadcast of Healy's 43-year career was April 28 when KMPC abandoned 
its all-sports format. Many fans assumed his highly rated show would pop up 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "True to himself, at the end, he got his own exclusive," said former Times 
sports columnist John Hall. "He kept his illness a secret from everyone and 
nobody knew how really ill he was. He broke the story himself when he died."

 Bad connection: Roy Harris of West L.A. sent us a copy of his bill from 
Pacific Bell, which contains the heading: "New two-sided form saves paper!" 
(Note the exclamation point, designed to make sure customers are properly 
excited.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the back side of his bill is blank except for the words: "BLANK PAGE."

 Still life: Now, don't go accusing us of being politically incorrect when we 
report that, in an outdoor mall in Santa Monica, a colleague saw a bum holding 
a sign. After all, it said: "A bum holding a sign."

<P>
 Hey, Pacific Bell would appreciate the explanation. miscelLAny:

 In his biography of movie mogul Harry Cohn, author Bob Thomas points out that 
among the words banned from movies in the 1930s were cripes, Gawd, goose, hold 
your hat, in your hat, hell or damn (in most instances), madam (relating to 
prostitution), SOB, tart and whore. And, of course, there was also a ban 
against the f-word: fanny.

SIMPSON TEAM TO FIGHT D.A.'S USE OF GRAND JURY AT HEARING; COURTS: DEFENSE SAYS 
ANY EVIDENCE GATHERED BY PANEL SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED. EMBATTLED POLICE DETECTIVE 
ASKS JUDGE TO DENY REQUEST FOR PERSONNEL RECORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito on Thursday granted O.J. Simpson's lawyers 
an emergency hearing today in which they will try to block prosecutors from 
gathering more evidence against the former football great during a grand jury 
inquiry of Simpson's longtime friend Al Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a police detective whom the defense has claimed is racist and 
possibly corrupt, fought back Thursday by asking Ito to deny a defense request 
for his personnel records. Lawyers for Detective Mark Fuhrman are expected to 
argue that issue before Ito on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the closed emergency hearing this afternoon, Ito is expected to hear 
arguments on whether Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti is improperly using the grand 
jury to glean information to further implicate Simpson in the June 12 slayings 
of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, the defense argues that Garcetti should be sanctioned because 
such use of a grand jury is improper and that any evidence that the panel has 
produced against Simpson should be suppressed. The lawyers also asked that Ito 
dismiss the murder case against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers assert that the "grand jury is not empowered to conduct roving 
investigations, or assist the district attorney in conducting his own roving 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense team's constitutional expert, Gerald F. Uelmen, cites in the 
papers remarks Garcetti made Wednesday to reporters in which he said he was 
using the grand jury for "strictly investigatory purposes" in the Cowlings 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Childs, a spokeswoman for Garcetti, declined to comment on the defense 
contentions, saying "we will respond in court." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury inquiry of Cowlings, Garcetti said Wednesday, is aimed at 
determining whether enough evidence exists to charge him with trying to help 
Simpson flee from police June 17, the day that Simpson was to surrender to 
authorities on the murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of turning himself in, Simpson and Cowlings fled from the Encino home 
of another Simpson friend, Robert Kardashian. Cowlings and Simpson later led 
authorities on a nationally televised chase in a white Ford Bronco before 
winding up at Simpson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office last month declined to charge Cowlings with 
aiding a fleeing felon, but reserved the right to do so later. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Re, Cowlings' lawyer, has said that if a grand jury investigating 
Cowlings happens upon evidence relevant to the Simpson case, the prosecutors 
could use it. On Thursday, Southwestern University School of Law professor 
Robert A. Pugsley agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugsley noted that Garcetti has said he wants to investigate not only 
Cowlings, but everyone who had been at Kardashian's house the day Simpson fled. 
</P>
<P>
 That being the case, he said, "the grand jury can legitimately remain in 
session for as long as it takes to follow up the necessary leads to see if 
there is any basis for indicting any of those other people." 
</P>
<P>
 As the defense scrambled to block the prosecution's use of the grand jury, 
Fuhrman sought to block the defense from gaining access to his Los Angeles 
Police Department personnel records. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense wants access to any documents involving citizens' complaints 
against Fuhrman related to racial and other prejudices, falsifying evidence or 
civilian misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense hopes to attack the credibility of the detective, who has 
testified that he found a bloody glove behind a guest house at O.J. Simpson's 
estate. That glove is an apparent match of a bloody glove found at the murder 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense sources have been quoted as saying Fuhrman may have planted the glove 
on Simpson's property. Widespread media attention also has focused on a 1989 
interview that Fuhrman had with a psychiatrist in which he allegedly used a 
racial slur when referring to black people. Simpson's lawyers also have 
obtained an affidavit from a woman who said Fuhrman once made derogatory 
remarks to her about interracial couples and black people in general, an 
allegation that Fuhrman has denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers also cite a lawsuit in which a man contends that Fuhrman 
in 1987 took a knife from one location and placed it at his feet after Fuhrman 
and another officer shot him. In court papers filed Thursday, Robert H. 
Tourtelot, Fuhrman's lawyer, argued that the defense request for the personnel 
records is "stuffed to the gills with irrelevant evidence that could only be 
calculated to harass Detective Fuhrman and taint potential jurors." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers do not begin to establish a link between any alleged 
improper conduct by Fuhrman and the personnel records they seek, Tourtelot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Thursday, a woman who spoke to Simpson's house guest 
Brian (Kato) Kaelin the night Nicole Simpson and Goldman were killed disputed a 
magazine article suggesting that she and Kaelin may have perjured themselves 
during court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Ferrara labeled as false an Aug. 29 Time magazine article that said she 
had told friends that Kaelin saw Simpson outside his guest house moments after 
Kaelin was startled by a loud noise at the rear of the structure. The bloody 
glove was later found near the spot where the noise originated. 
</P>
<P>
 If Time's account were true, prosecutors could place Simpson in the area where 
the glove was found. Ferrara insisted that the magazine is wrong. A Time 
spokesman contacted Thursday stood by the article. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Robert Lopez contributed to this story.

SUIT ACCUSES MOVIE THEATERS' MANAGERS OF SEX HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former employee filed a lawsuit against Cineplex Odeon and its Universal 
City Cinemas on Thursday, charging that the management of the movie theater 
complex at Universal Studios condoned a "pervasive environment of sexual 
harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Kenney, 26, who worked as a personnel manager for Universal City Cinemas 
for about a year and a half before she was fired, said she was fondled and 
subjected repeatedly to crude jokes and explicit accounts of their sexual 
exploits by other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the lawsuit, in addition to the firm, are assistant manager George 
Webb, general manager Jody Bolstad, operations chief Larry Oya and 
projectionist Tim Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Lotts, an attorney representing Cineplex Odeon and the cinemas, said 
he could not respond to the lawsuit because he had not yet read it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Kenney said that after her complaints to Bolstad -- her 
supervisor -- about sexual harassment, he asked her to fill out a mock 
"employee evaluation" form replete with crude scatological and sexually 
explicit terms. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Burke fondled her after bragging about his skills at oral sex and 
Webb boasted about the size of his penis. Oya also made sexually suggestive 
remarks, Kenney said in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that despite her complaints to Bolstad, the "complained-of conduct 
continued unchecked" until she was fired without reason on April 16, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Stormer, the Pasadena attorney who filed the lawsuit on Kenney's behalf, 
has represented a number of other plaintiffs in highly publicized sexual 
harassment suits. One of these was resolved in 1993 when MCA Inc., parent 
company of Universal Studios, paid a tour employee about $600,000 in an 
out-of-court settlement. Universal City Cinemas is on the studio property but 
is not affiliated with the studio or MCA.

MISSION OF MERCI ; AMERICAN, FRENCH VETS OF WORLD WAR II ARE REUNITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years to the day since Paris was liberated from the Nazis, an American 
and a Frenchman who fought side by side in the French Resistance were reunited 
Thursday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlie Blood and Jean le Brix exchanged kisses on the cheek, swapped war 
stories and complimented each other on surviving to 1994 ("I'm 73, but I only 
look 72," cracked le Brix) -- and on surviving 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't words to describe it, but I will say he's a very brave man," 
said Blood, 78. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hero is not me, but him," replied le Brix. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's meeting underscores the little-known role that Americans played in 
the French Resistance, according to officials of the local French consulate who 
helped reunite the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of American airmen shot down over France by Nazi artillery were turned 
into guerrilla-style fighters after parachuting to the ground and being rescued 
by Resistance members. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how the saga of Blood and "Barnaby" began in the late spring of 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnaby was le Brix's code name in the Resistance: None of the freedom 
fighters used their real names for fear that they might be identified if other 
Resistance members were caught and tortured by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood met Barnaby after his P-47 Thunderbolt fighter was shot down while 
attacking a German ammunition train. He bailed out and hid in a wheat field 
until a young girl carrying bread, a bottle of wine and a French-English 
dictionary came to his aid and summoned Resistance members. 
</P>
<P>
 They took Blood in and introduced him to le Brix. "He could speak a little 
English, so I latched onto him," Blood explained. Soon, the pair were staging 
nighttime commando raids together. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnaby's knowledge of the terrain and German positions helped keep Blood safe 
during the month that the pair sneaked past Nazi patrols to blow up railroad 
tracks and bridges used by German invaders. The one time that Blood didn't 
follow Barnaby's advice, he ended up getting captured by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 As American forces advanced after the D-day invasion, Blood declined Barnaby's 
offer to personally lead him to U.S. troops. Instead, he hitched a ride with 
two Frenchmen who soon found themselves stopped at gunpoint at a German 
roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazis executed the two Frenchmen and took Blood into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnaby assumed the worst about Blood too. "For 50 years I thought he had been 
killed," le Brix said. "I thought he was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Blood managed to escape German detention the next month. He joined another 
Resistance group and later was part of a five-man squad that managed to 
liberate the French towns of Losche and Tours a few days before American 
soldiers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Blood continued in the Air Force, eventually working as a 
colonel in the Pentagon and later as an executive for Northrop in Los Angeles. 
Le Brix returned to Brest, where he worked until his retirement as a regional 
government administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Brix said he traveled to Los Angeles on vacation 15 years ago without 
realizing his old war buddy was living in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood traveled to France on vacation in 1984 and spent days looking for 
Barnaby. But he said he came up empty-handed because he only knew the code 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery was unraveled after Blood learned that the local French consulate 
was planning a mock invasion of Santa Monica State Beach on June 6 to 
commemorate D-day. He asked cultural attache Gerard Loiseaux if he would help 
find Barnaby. Intrigued, Loiseaux said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put an article in a Brittany paper about Blood and Barnaby and contacted 
some Resistance veterans associations," Loiseaux said. Soon, Barnaby's true 
identity was known. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's reunion, staged at the Wiesenthal Center in West Los Angeles, came 
after le Brix and his wife, Suzanne, arrived with friends Gerard and Yvonne 
Deschartres. They are visiting the Deschartres' daughter Nathalie, a Santa 
Monica video game producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood and his wife, Lucille, who now live in Canyon Lake in Riverside County, 
plan to visit the le Brixes next June. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnaby has promised to take him to the two Frenchmen's grave -- and to meet 
the woman who gave him bread and wine 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many heroes," Blood said.

SIMPSON TEAM ATTACKS D.A.'S USE OF GRAND JURY; COURTS: DEFENSE MOTION SEEKS 
DISMISSAL OF MURDER CASE. ELSEWHERE, DISPUTE SWIRLS OVER MAGAZINE STORY.

<P>
 O.J. Simpson's lawyers accused the county's chief prosecutor Thursday of 
abusing grand jury power and called for dismissal of the double-murder case and 
sanctions against the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a woman who spoke to Brian (Kato) Kaelin the night Simpson's 
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, were killed 
disputed a magazine article suggesting that she and Kaelin may have withheld 
evidence from investigators and possibly perjured themselves during court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 In their emergency motion accusing prosecutors of misconduct, five members of 
Simpson's defense team said Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti should be sanctioned for 
using a probe of Al (A.C.) Cowlings to investigate the slayings Simpson is 
charged with. 
</P>
<P>
 They suggest in the motion that the secret probe of Cowlings is a thinly 
veiled effort to get more information about Simpson from his closest friends, 
who would not talk unless they were subpoenaed by an official body. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a firmly entrenched rule that once a defendant has been formally 
charged, a prosecutor may not use a grand jury's investigative powers for the 
purpose of securing additional evidence against the defendant for use in the 
upcoming trial," the defense motion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito scheduled a closed hearing Friday afternoon 
to hear arguments on the motion. Earlier Friday, he is scheduled to release his 
ruling on the crucial question of whether the prosecution must share blood 
samples with the defense for DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Childs, a spokeswoman for Garcetti, said prosecutors will respond to 
the accusations at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 While defense scientists waited for word on whether they can begin their own 
tests, Simpson's girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, appeared before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said they are investigating whether Cowlings was helping 
Simpson elude arrest June 17. Cowlings, through his attorney, has said he was 
trying to save his friend's life since Simpson was threatening suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense suggested in its motion that Garcetti has no real interest in 
Cowlings. Garcetti said at a news conference Wednesday that the grand jury was 
not being used to indict but for its investigative powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion cited Garcetti's news conference, where he said information 
developed during the Cowlings probe conceivably could be used in the Simpson 
case -- or other cases -- if it proved to be relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury is not empowered to conduct roving investigations or assist 
the district attorney in conducting his own roving investigations," the motion 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury's investigative power is limited to determining whether a 
public offense should be charged by indictment." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers asked Ito to examine grand jury transcripts to find out 
whether "the grand jury was decoyed into serving primarily as a discovery 
device for the government's trial preparation." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 47, is charged with the murders of his ex-wife and Goldman. He is 
scheduled to go on trial Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 At a packed Century City news conference Thursday, Rachel Ferrara and her 
attorneys criticized a Time magazine article about a telephone conversation 
that she allegedly had with two friends. Ferrara said the magazine's account -- 
that she told the unnamed friends that Kaelin said during a phone call that he 
saw Simpson outside the guest house -- is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 If that story were true, prosecutors could place the former football great in 
the area about the time they believe a bloody glove was dropped nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaelin, who was living in O.J. Simpson's guest house, has testified that he 
was talking on the telephone with Ferrara when he heard three loud thumps on 
his wall June 12. Kaelin said he went outside to investigate about 10:40 p.m. 
and called Ferrara back, telling her that he had seen no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrara corroborated Kaelin's account in testimony at a July preliminary 
hearing and denied Thursday that she said Kaelin saw Simpson outside the guest 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never do that," she said. "It's so far-fetched from my character." 
</P>
<P>
 One of her attorneys, George Hernandez, said: "Time magazine has attempted to 
make Rachel Ferrara another victim in the O.J. Simpson trial." He accused the 
magazine of "reckless and . . . at worst, inflammatory" reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaelin's attorney, William Genego, also questioned the story. "First Time was 
altering the cover," he said, referring to the magazine's controversial 
darkening of Simpson's face in a recent issue. "Now they're altering the 
content." 
</P>
<P>
 A Time spokesman said Thursday that the magazine stands behind its story, 
which reported that the two friends passed their information to police and 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined 
to comment Thursday.

 You probably thought that the baseball strike took place because of the threat 
of player salary caps and team owners griping over revenues. Wrong. The purpose 
(or at least the result) was to give a bunch of boys from Northridge more of 
the limelight than they ever could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Wednesday, for example, the home run hitter who was featured in a 
photograph five inches wide and nine inches deep on the main sports page of 
this newspaper was not one of those high-priced pros who had been chasing Roger 
Maris' single-season record. It was a shot of some kid named Matthew Cassel, 
whose incentive clause on a contract, if he had one, might call for more pizza 
and a cola. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Cassel and the rest of the "Earthquake Kids," as they have been 
dubbed, will play in the biggest game of their lives. They will take on 
Venezuela in the finals of the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 This is baseball as it should be, and as the pros and owners should remember 
it: as a chance to forget about whatever ails or troubles you; a chance to 
immerse yourself in a game and just have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Northridge players, pitcher Peter Tuber, perhaps said it best, 
capturing a little of what seems to have been forgotten in strike talks and 
stalled negotiations. "I walked onto this field I had been dreaming about for 
so long," Tuber told Times reporter Steve Henson, "and it just smelled so 
good." Where else these days but Little League would you hear a player sound so 
excited about the smell of freshly cut grass?

THE LESSONS FROM A STALLED REFORM; A TRUE HEALTH CARE CONSENSUS IS MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever a President suffers a political blow of the proportion President 
Clinton suffered in his apparent failure to get comprehensive health care 
reform this year, the post-mortems abound: What should Clinton have done 
different? What are the lessons?  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has now noted what many others already had -- that because one-seventh 
of the U.S. economy is involved, health reform should be done deliberately and 
incrementally. Once the Administration's own proposal was clearly dead, a 
1,400-plus-page Democratic plan aimed to eventually provide insurance for all 
Americans. But while the plan contained new benefits for those already insured 
(for example, the popular proposal to pay for Medicare prescription drugs), it 
did not do much to bring in the 37 million Americans who have no coverage at 
all. The bill was full of mixed signals, in part because mixed signals were 
what Washington got from the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Those signals were typified by one person who told a reporter that she hoped 
that health care reform did not mean that the government would get involved 
with Medicare -- as if unaware that Medicare is indeed a government entitlement 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 What could Clinton have done to better ride the shifting political winds on 
health care reform, so strongly in his favor two years ago? One, he and First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton could have recognized that the findings of the 
Administration's early health care reform task force would not be embraced if 
exclusive meetings were held in secretive sessions. Bad idea. Next, the 
Administration might have learned more from the last time Washington -- led by 
a Republican administration in 1974 -- tried to tackle health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Some similarities are eerie: Then-President Richard Nixon called national 
health insurance his top domestic priority. Despite the Nixon Administration 
being weakened by the mushrooming Watergate scandal, then-Health, Education and 
Welfare Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger called for "adding, this year, 
comprehensive health insurance protection to the basic security guarantees that 
America offers." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans were ready to compromise; Democrats, anticipating gains in the 
November election, held out for a better deal, while medical, labor and 
business lobbyists swarmed in the background. Switch parties, move the clock up 
20 years and it all sounds depressingly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 History really doesn't have to repeat itself. But in order to avoid that 
seemingly natural cycle, America's leaders -- and its people -- must be clear 
not only on what they are trying to accomplish but on what they are willing to 
do to achieve it. A national consensus on what's needed to fix health care, the 
prerequisite to major social reform, is unfortunately missing.

SOMETIMES JUST SAY NO; STATE SENATOR ACCEPTS INVITATION TO SPEAK TO ALLEGED 
SUPREMACISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Don Rogers says he sees nothing wrong with his planned appearance 
Saturday night at a convention of alleged white supremacists. We do. Rogers, an 
Antelope Valley Republican, will be sharing the speaker's platform in 
Bakersfield with a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas and an organizer 
for the Aryan Nation. They and other kindred spirits will be there under the 
auspices of a newspaper called Jubilee, which is a national publication of the 
Christian Identity movement. According to a respected watchdog group, that 
movement's followers consider just about everyone who is not of Northern 
European background to be racially inferior. Nice company to be in, if you 
happen to be a practicing bigot. But hardly the kind of company that any 
responsible state official would choose to spend an evening with. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers blandly describes his hosts and others who will be at the convention as 
"patriotic Americans," an identification that inevitably and immediately brings 
to mind Samuel Johnson's sardonic mid-18th-Century definition of patriotism as 
the last refuge of scoundrels. In any event, Rogers says, he knows nothing 
about the charges that the Jubilee newspaper promotes racism (a smidgen of 
research would have cured this ignorance), and, anyway, he himself doesn't 
share the views of white supremacists. In that case why will he be supping 
there? Because, he says, it's his "impression" that the Jubilee people "are 
working to preserve and restore individual rights and freedoms"; presumably by 
using their freedom of speech to preach racial and religious intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers is 66 years old and no doubt well past the time when he might 
effectively be instructed in how public officials should properly behave. In 
any case he is a lame duck who under the term limits measure approved by voters 
will be gone from the Legislature in two years. None of that, however, excuses 
the irresponsibility of his decision to associate with a group whose alleged 
philosophy deserves condemnation by all decent people. The hatemongers knew 
what they were getting when they invited Rogers. And he knew too.

SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Prof. Adela de la Torre's column "On Health Care, a Matter of 
Trust," Commentary, Aug. 17: 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the 90 members of Congress co-sponsoring a single-payer health care 
reform proposal, I believe that single-payer deserves a more constructive 
assessment, and not such a doomsday description. When considering the whole 
picture, the single-payer system holds tremendous appeal to all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 It's simple to understand and use. For the patient, there are no up-front 
premium costs or complicated formulas for co-payments, deductibles, or 
co-insurance. The single-payer system offers security since you can never lose 
your health insurance coverage, even if you lose or change your job. These are 
the critical benefits single-payer has to offer, and they also deserve full 
airing and deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Torre raises the issues of cost and higher taxes. The discussion mix 
should also recognize the savings. According to the General Accounting Office, 
the federal auditing agency, a single-payer system in the U.S. would save close 
to $100 billion each year -- unmatched by any other health reform plan. How? By 
eliminating burdensome paperwork and other administrative expenses, we cut out 
the costly middleman. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a myth that single-payer would lead to a huge costly bureaucracy. 
In fact, the Medicare program, which has been managed by the U.S. government 
for nearly 30 years, spends just 2% on administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you trust what we have now? Seven million Californians do not have health 
insurance, and even those who do have coverage are only one serious illness 
away from financial ruin. 
</P>

<P>
 The article on the single-payer state health reform initiative is an honest, 
fair-minded description of what is contained in Proposition 186. Would that its 
critics deal with it with the same honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 I have one regret about the article. I wish it had included the fact that if 
Proposition 186 is approved in November, all Californians would no longer pay 
any insurance premiums, deductibles and few co-payments; and that Medicare 
recipients would no longer pay monthly Medicare Part B premiums.

U.S. POLICY AGAINST CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We disagree strongly with the editorial (Aug. 20) that "(U.S.) policy should 
be aimed at toppling Castro." 
</P>
<P>
 We in the United States have no right to impose our desires on a small 
neighboring country. It is our reprehensible embargo that has brought Cuba to 
the point of collapse. In the past we forced Cuba to rely on help from the 
Soviet Union. Now even that assistance is no longer available, and yet, despite 
extreme shortages of medical supplies, Cuba still offers free medical care to 
everyone living in the country. We are still wrestling with the issue of 
providing health care to all our people. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus of Cubans is caused by the United States' actions in trying to 
overthrow the government by every means short of war! Our government even 
forbids U.S. citizens to travel there to see with our own eyes what is going 
on. So much for our "free" society. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to solve the Cuban immigrant problem is to lift the embargo and 
allow normal trade relations with a country that poses no threat to the United 
States.

 The Cold War is over and Fidel Castro no longer has the support of the Soviet 
Union for his communist regime, yet we continue the personal vendetta against 
him, with sanctions detrimental to the Cuban economy. And now we are facing 
another wave of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't the time come for us to reverse course, lift the sanctions and help 
restore a prosperous economy to Cuba to reduce or eliminate the pressure of its 
people to seek asylum in the United States? How much longer are we going to 
punish the people of Cuba because of our personal grudge against Castro?

 Many naive Americans are saying that the Cuban economic problems are the 
result of the U.S. embargo. This is not so. The desperate economic conditions 
in Cuba are because of Castro's dictatorship. He runs Cuba as his private farm. 
He decides the life of the Cuban people. There are no unions, no free press, no 
political parties, no independent judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Europe received financial loans under communism, but economic 
conditions there did not improve until after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

 Eight thousand Cubans reach Florida and President Clinton and Atty. Gen. Janet

immigrants cross the California border and we can't get the time of day from

voters from California remember this in '96.

 Ingrid Peritz's revisionist commentary, "The People Castro Can Count on During 
Tough Times -- Cuba's Blacks" (Opinion, Aug. 21), is marred by glaring 
distortions and contradictions. For one thing, recent photographs of the 
thousands of desperate rafters escaping Castro's gulag clearly rebuke her 
claims that Cubans of African descent support the Castro regime -- one only has 
to glance at the many black faces among them. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, a look at the predominantly white faces of those in 
Castro's inner circle reveals yet another of Peritz's inconsistencies with 
regard to black "achievements" under Castro -- gains which are illusory at best 
and remain just another pathetic example of two-faced "revolutionary" rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 As to her inflammatory statement that exiled Cubans threaten to go back to 
"repossess their homes and reclaim their lost power," I can only remind her 
that those homes to which she's referring were stolen by Castro. Contrary to 
communist propaganda, the overwhelming majority of Cuban exiles were average 
working people.  
</P>
<P>
 And one final note. We Cuban exiles are proud of our accomplishments in the 
United States, our adopted country. We're people too. We have feelings. 
Communism apologists like Peritz should ask us what we'd envision in a 
post-Castro Cuba. I, for one, imagine freedom. Freedom for all. Freedom at 
last.

 Today's immediate crisis in Cuba can be immediately solved by giving Castro a

commissioner of baseball, provided that he immediately leave Cuba for his new 
duties, which will include solving the crisis in baseball.

EASTER ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your article about Easter Island (World Report, Aug. 2), William Long 
attributes the anarchy of the 1600s on the island to the obsession with moai 
construction. He mentions that the population had expanded to 10,000.When we 
visited Easter Island in 1989, we were told that because the population had 
exceeded the food supply, the statues were erected to help bring back 
prosperity. But by then it was too late, the woodlands had been cut, and the 
soil depleted. The ancestors had caused the problems, and now their moais were 
powerless to help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth's resources are finite, just as they are on Easter Island. 
Scientists from 57 national academies of sciences say that science can no 
longer be counted on for technological fixes to solve agricultural and 
ecological problems caused by population pressures. They are urging us to think 
of the future by calling for measures that will help achieve zero population 
growth within the lifetime of our children. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations International Conference on Population and Development to 
be held in Cairo in September is an attempt to stabilize world population at 
7.8 billion people. If the conference succeeds, perhaps humanity can avoid the 
terrible history of Easter Island.

DINOSAUR'S DEMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "After Jupiter: How Likely Are We to Be Hit by a Rock?" 
Opinion, Aug. 21: 
</P>
<P>
 As fallout from the spectacular collisions on Jupiter, we were once again 
treated to an article stating that "one such (asteroid) probably ended the 
reign of dinosaurs." I, like the vast majority of paleontologists who work on 
extinctions near the time of the dinosaur's demise, know that these claims by 
physical scientists are simply wishful thinking.We don't even have a worldwide 
record of dinosaur extinction. When and how fast the dinosaurs perished around 
the world remains a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Gregory Benford's column does not stop with misinformation about 
dinosaur extinction. He adds a new bizarre twist by claiming that if we protect 
ourselves from objects from outer space with nuclear-tipped missiles, that "for 
once we humans would be defending the entire ecosphere, not just ourselves." 
Since when did habitat destruction, outright hunting to extinction, pollution 
and the greatest single threat, overpopulation, stop being threats to the 
entire ecosphere? These very real impending disasters are far more worthy of 
our attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I certainly hope Prof. Benford had tongue firmly in cheek when he 
suggested that just as humans "are the sole stewards of our world, in all its 
rich abundance. The dinosaurs were once too -- but look what happened to them." 
Unlike the hapless dinosaurs, which had little control over their own fate, we 
know what we are calling down upon ourselves, and it isn't unwelcome rocks from 
space.

SEXUALITY IS NOT JUST 'GAY' OR 'STRAIGHT'; GAY RIGHTS: A MOVEMENT THAT

<TEXT>
<P>
 When we look at the gay political movement, we see 25 years since the 
Stonewall riots focused on promoting gay identity. This agenda has focused on 
"coming out," asking people to publicly identify themselves as homosexuals. It 
is an agenda aimed not at sexual freedom but defining homosexuals as a minority 
of persons to be protected against discrimination as defined in statutes. It 
attempts to cast what is essentially a moral issue as a civil-rights issue. But 
does this effort succeed?

 The identity agenda is based on three assumptions:

 * Coming out is the best way to integrate one's sexual experience into one's 
life and personality.

<P>
 * Coming out reduces the social stereotypes and fear of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coming out has resulted in political changes promoting greater acceptance of 
homosexual behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these assumptions, however, is true. Many studies have indicated that 
coming out entails the adoption of the stigmatic role that society has created 
in order to isolate and confine a certain behavior to a distinct population. 
Like other stigmatic roles, it attributes the behavior to an internal condition 
(sometimes called "sexual orientation") that distinguishes some people from 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of helping stigmatized persons integrate their sexual behavior into a 
moral system of behaviors, gay identity does just the opposite, removing it 
from the realm of freedom and responsibility. It objectifies the behavior, 
making it a "thing" with a life of its own that tends to organize more and more 
of one's personality and life around sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity agenda also assumes that coming out reduces the fear of 
homosexual behaviors. Sociologists point out that intimacy is rarely the 
solution to oppression and give the case of women's intimacy with men as proof. 
Coming out only brings home the lesson of stigma that no one is "safe," making 
others even more guarded of their own gay feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Science has repeatedly confirmed that homosexual experiences are not confined 
to any psychological or physical type of person. Gay identity results not from 
an internal condition but from adopting a role that society has constructed for 
the purposes of controlling, isolating and confining gay behaviors. Authorities 
such as Sigmund Freud, pioneering sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey and John 
DeCecco, editor of the Journal of Homosexuality, have expressed the belief that 
everyone is born potentially bisexual and that one's sexual capacities and 
choices are influenced by a wide combination of social and personal factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristotle long ago condemned our human tendency to define people by their 
behavior, an error of logic he called "hypostasis." English philosopher John 
Stuart Mill wrote, "Of all vulgar modes of escaping from considerations of the 
effect of social and moral influence on the human mind, the most vulgar is that 
of attributing the diversities of conduct and character to inherent natural 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay identity is the result of our society's intense and long-standing 
persecution of homosexual behaviors. As Kinsey pointed out in 1948, "There are 
practically no European groups, unless it be in England, and few if any other 
cultures elsewhere in the world which have become as disturbed over male 
homosexuality as we have here in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 This disturbance has produced a vicious and lazy way of thinking that divides 
the whole world into two kinds of persons, gay and straight. Labeling people as 
gay and straight is a no-win agenda that only reinforces the stigma, because it 
is a function of the stigma. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Fouratt of New York, one of the leaders of the gay liberation movement 
that arose from the Stonewall riots in 1969, wrote: " Homosexual. I find the 
word hard to relate to because it puts me in a category which limits my 
potential. It also prescribes a whole system of behavior to which I'm supposed 
to conform which has nothing to do with the reality of my day to day living. . 
. . I reject the word homosexual. I reject a category that defines my central 
life thrust in limiting terms. I am a human being."

THE WEST, BLINKERED, KEEPS BLUNDERING; ISLAMIC WORLD: ITS EVOLUTION HAS EVERY 
CHANCE OF BEING DEMOCRATIC IF DEMOCRACIES WILL PUT IDEALS AHEAD OF DEAL-MAKING.

<P>
 Pardon my French, but the government of France barely gives a damn about 
Rwanda. France cares first and foremost about Algeria, a volcano about to 
erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Algeria, once the jewel of the French empire, was the scene in the 1950s of a 
vicious war of independence that spilled over into France, nearly bringing 
about a right-wing dictatorship. Today it is the cradle of a North African 
fundamentalist revival that is overflowing into French domestic politics with 
consequences that could again polarize France. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur 
calls it France's "greatest threat." In America, influential intellectuals beat 
the same drum. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a crisis -- and this is by no means certain -- the West has made 
its own sizable contribution. For decades, the Western powers have rallied 
behind oil-rich governments in the Islamic world that were unpopular, 
inefficient, wasteful, self-servingly corrupt and unwilling to embark on the 
reforms that would have used wealth more efficiently and equitably to build a 
farsighted pattern of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, having backed and failed with the shah of Iran, having backed and failed 
with Saddam Hussein, the West is backing the generals in Algiers. Following the 
French lead, all the major Western powers supported the Algerian government 
when it canceled the second round of elections in early 1992 (the first free 
elections since independence) after it saw the Islamic fundamentalists win the 
first round. It was a narrow-sighted decision, and the beleaguered Algerian 
government is now under siege from an Islamic movement that has seen in a short 
two years its nonviolent, pro-democracy leadership taken over by quite ruthless 
political killers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Algeria does not have to be the first domino that goes on toppling 
throughout North Africa, even to that stalwart of Islamic rectitude, Saudi 
Arabia, producing militant anti-Western states, able to arm themselves with 
anything the ex-Soviet black market will provide. Some fundamentalists indeed 
may have a rough agenda of this sort. Most do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fundamentalists are moved by a down-to-earth search for values in a world 
that appears to have lost many of its bearings -- the essential and timeless 
qualities of family life, integrity, probity and individual responsibility. It 
is often the fundamentalists in these countries who offer free medical 
treatment, clean the streets and distribute cheap photocopies of textbooks. 
Many of its ranks, compared with those that rule, are highly educated people, 
often prominent in the professions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamentalist movements, despite their public image, are in a number of 
countries democratically inclined. In Algeria, 2 1/2 years ago, the movement 
was certainly democratic. In Tunisia, it still is. Yet it is the secretive, 
violence-prone groups, the gamaat, that we most hear about and are taught to 
fear. They are strong and getting stronger; in Iran and Algeria, they have the 
upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a battle for the mind under way. The West, having little direct 
influence, can encourage the democratic seed wherever it sprouts. This means 
uncoupling itself from the economically satisfying but spiritually corrupting 
partnership with the arms buyers of the old order. 
</P>
<P>
 The West, moreover, must recall its own history more clearly. Christian 
culture for its first millennium and a half had no other tradition than 
autocracy. Islam will, I am sure, engage before long, if it hasn't started 
already, in its own political Reformation and discover democracy for itself. 
But first it probably has to be purged by a spiritual Reformation. 
Fundamentalism is probably an unavoidable step along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The West can choose to help or hinder this process. At the moment it appears 
to be making all the wrong decisions. The French for their own pathological 
reasons that lie deep in their tortured history with Algeria may be making a 
terrible mistake. But there is no good argument why the rest of the West has to 
follow them.

DON'T LET CLAS DIE IN A POLITICAL DEADLOCK; EDUCATION: LET'S CONTINUE TO BACK 
THESE REFORMS, WHICH FOSTER THINKING, INSTEAD OF ROTE LEARNING AND 
MEMORIZATION. 
</P>

By MICHAEL W. KIRS; GERALD C. HAYWARD, ; JULIA E. KOPPICH, Michael W. Kirst, 
Gerald C. Hayward and Julia E. Koppich are directors of Policy Analysis for 
California Education, an education think tank based at UC Berkeley.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Legislature and governor will soon decide whether to throw out 
or improve California's new assessment system for K-12 pupils. The 
controversial "test" is called the California Learning Assessment System 
(CLAS). 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS is an important piece of the reform process in California schools. 
Although CLAS has experienced difficulties during its development, building an 
assessment system is complex and funding for continued refinement and testing 
are critical to CLAS' long-term success. 
</P>
<P>
 Some amendments to the original design are needed, and a bill by Sen. Gary 
Hart (D-Santa Barbara) provides for some of the needed changes. Gov. Wilson has 
"set aside" funding for new pupil assessments pending the Legislature's actions 
in revising the program. A political deadlock on this issue would be 
catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
 The new assessment system is unlike any K-12 tests that most members of the 
public have encountered. It is fundamentally different from the traditional 
multiple-choice tests that report pupil comparison scores based on statistical 
averages. CLAS challenges students to think about and derive several potential 
answers to complex problems and uses open-ended responses. Trained evaluators 
judge the answers based on objective standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional testing programs used in other state and national programs 
have a number of long-acknowledged and well-known deficiencies. These tests 
have been unable to assess pupils' abilities to solve math and science 
problems, write persuasive essays, understand the tone and mood of characters 
in complex novels, synthesize and analyze data, make inferences and design 
creative solutions. Most testing focuses on factual recall, memorization of 
math formulas and one correct answer. CLAS is a response to these weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing in this new form allows students to demonstrate knowledge -- how they 
wrestle with problems and consider competing ideas. Implemented across the 
state, this form of assessment allows schools to understand their progress on 
outcomes that are based on performance. More important, this focus is 
consistent with school reform efforts to improve the integration of content and 
skills in the classroom. This change is being successfully demonstrated in 
California and is consistent with Goals 2000, the new federal legislation to 
improve schools across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious project to introduce CLAS into the schools in 1993 has had two 
setbacks. One has centered on a question of the content of the tests; the 
second has been a set of technical problems related to the administration and 
scoring of the tests. CLAS has been challenged by some who object to the novels 
selected for analysis and the pupil responses designed to express an 
understanding of the emotions of characters. Moreover, opponents contend that 
the scoring is not objective. Indeed there is no machine-tabulated single-score 
answer. As a solution, the state will have to monitor the content of questions 
with assistance from educators and parents. But disagreements on the content of 
test questions should not stand in the way of state-of-the-art assessment 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The technical glitches with scoring are another matter. In implementing CLAS, 
designers were given overly optimistic deadlines. CLAS scoring was not able to 
provide reliable and valid scores for each California school in 1993. There 
were too many "bugs" that needed to be resolved in the scoring and sampling 
system. For example, while CLAS may soon be able to reliably report scores for 
schools, reliably reporting individual student scores will require significant 
additional development. This may take several years. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent technical review panel of university experts from around the United 
States has provided some solutions to these problems. While the experts 
"applaud the energy and imagination that have gone into CLAS to this point," 
they "advise against embarking on large-scale student-by-student reporting 
until CLAS has demonstrated its ability to deliver consistently dependable 
reports on schools." 
</P>
<P>
 The California State Education Department should have made it clear that CLAS 
was in a test-run stage. But these mistakes should not cause California to 
abandon this assessment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined efforts are needed by political and education leaders to insist on 
educational quality in California. CLAS is part of the agenda to improve that 
quality. We encourage those who stand for continued improvement and quality to 
support additional refinements as development of this assessment system 
continues.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JAMES BATES: COMPANY TOWN; FOR ROY DISNEY, LEGACY IS 
EVERYTHING

<P>
 When Michael D. Eisner installed the Seven Dwarfs atop Team Disney 
headquarters as enduring symbols of the company's heritage, he might as well 
have added the image of Roy E. Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The painfully shy executive with the uncanny resemblance to his Uncle Walt has 
a habit of popping up at critical junctures in the company's history to somehow 
help sway events his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Disney's fingerprints were all over the management coup that ushered in 
the Eisner-Frank G. Wells regime some 10 years ago. Now he's helped to derail 
the ambitious plans of Wells' would-be successor -- studio Chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roy's a very clever, skillful man," one associate said Thursday. "He's not 
openly aggressive, but he always gets what he wants. Maybe the cardigan 
sweaters lull people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the company say that from the start, Roy Disney was openly 
hostile to Katzenberg succeeding Wells as president. As a close friend of 
Wells, he resented Katzenberg's intense lobbying effort. But even before that, 
Disney, who is in charge of supervising the company's animation department, 
often complained that Katzenberg was taking too much credit for the spectacular 
success of animated features such as "The Lion King" and "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Katzenberg's phenomenal success in managing Disney's studio operations 
-- annual filmed entertainment operating income alone rose from $2.2 million in 
1984 to $622.2 million in 1993 -- Eisner and the other board members shared Roy 
Disney's reservations about putting the studio chief in a corporate role. 
Sources say Disney's behind-the-scenes work -- augmented by the vociferous 
protests of director Stanley P. Gold, who heads the Disney heir's Shamrock 
Holdings -- clearly eased the way for Eisner to announce Katzenberg's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Raymond L. Watson said Thursday that Disney "has a legitimacy 
that comes from both the amount of stock he owns and his heritage," adding, 
"When he speaks at the board meetings or speaks to animators, they know this is 
not just a paid executive but someone whose life has been nurturing the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 64, Disney holds the title of vice chairman of the board, but his role is 
much more expansive than that. He demanded and received the job of supervising 
animation in the 1980s, when Eisner and Katzenberg wanted to scrap the 
division. He has since become a trusted adviser to Eisner, who sees in him a 
non-threatening presence who also carries the prized family name. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say their bond has grown even stronger since the company was shaken by 
two dramatic recent events: Wells' death in a helicopter crash in April and 
Eisner's emergency quadruple heart bypass surgery last month. Disney rushed in 
from his seaside castle in Ireland to be at Eisner's side, and a company 
statement pointedly named him as Eisner's stand-in. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unaccustomed moment in the sun. Despite inheriting Walt Disney's 
physical features, Roy inherited practically none of his late uncle's famous 
charisma, close friends readily concede. 
</P>
<P>
 Puffing on an ever-present cigarette, he can usually be found holding up the 
wall at company events. One entertainment analyst says Disney has played no 
visible role in the company's investor gatherings in recent years, though 
Eisner and Wells may have been throwing him a bone at the annual meeting in 
Florida earlier this year when they allowed him to make the formal announcement 
that the company was finally releasing its classic animated tale "Snow White" 
on videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his work at the family store, Disney has profited handsomely from 
Shamrock Holdings, the investment company led by Gold. The company made a 
fortune buying and selling soybean giant Central Soya. 
</P>
<P>
 While he has cut back on his work the last three years, people close to Disney 
say his passion for protecting the company's legacy is what keeps him going, 
long after he could have retired on a nest egg valued at $540 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His interest in animation dates to his childhood, when Walt Disney tried out 
concepts for movies such as "Pinocchio" on his young nephew. Roy, whose father 
co-founded the studio, later went to work on the Burbank lot as a film editor, 
producer and writer. But he was resented be some colleagues because of his 
family connection and derided by others at the time as the "idiot nephew" for 
his diffident and uncommunicative manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Even while serving on the board before the 1984 power shift, Disney rarely 
said much in meetings, something friends now attribute to the overall lack of 
respect he was accorded then. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed drastically 10 years ago, when he and Gold engineered the ouster 
of the company's beleaguered management team in favor of Eisner and Wells, who 
orchestrated one of the most successful turnarounds in U.S. corporate history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Disney spends much of his time at his vacation home in Ireland, jetting 
there in his private plane, sources say he is still involved in the day-to-day 
operations of the company's vaunted animation department, which was supervised 
by him, Katzenberg and animation chief Peter Schneider before the recent 
upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to the studio say it was Roy Disney who pushed the company into 
paying for the expensive automated equipment that allowed its animators to move 
into the modern age. On the creative side, one executive describes Disney as "a 
big-picture guy," whereas Katzenberg focused on the finer points of character 
and script development. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one plays the bully role in animation. It's too collaborative for that," 
said one source. "But Roy puts forward ideas. He's very creative, he gives 
great notes and he's certainly no idiot. It's not just by luck that all this 
this has happened to him."

 Stock and bond prices fell sharply Thursday as investors took profits after a 
two-day rally that had sent the Dow Jones industrial index soaring nearly 100 
points and interest rates plunging. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimming the luster of a dazzling blue chip rally the day before, the Dow 
declined 16.84 points to 3,829.89. The indicator's 70-point gain Wednesday had 
sent the index to its highest level since late March. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by 1,125 to 1,056 
on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume slipped to 284.24 million 
shares from 310.52 million the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's key 30-year bond shot up to 
7.53% after falling to 7.45% as news of unexpectedly weak manufacturing growth 
in July reduced fears of long-term inflation. The bond's price, which moves in 
the opposite direction, plummeted 29/32 point, or $9.06 per $1,000 in face 
value. The fall accelerated after the price dropped through a psychological 
barrier where a number of brokers had set orders to sell. The drop was also 
exaggerated by light trading volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Thursday's setback, the Dow remains well above 3,800 and at levels 
unseen since mid-June. Some analysts saw that as a sign of vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still view it as some risk out there," said Steven Goldman, market 
strategist at Weeden & Co. "But I also think that a bear market wouldn't show 
this type of resilience." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman and others cite strength in technology stocks, which had lagged 
Wednesday but staged a formidable comeback Thursday. That buoyed the Nasdaq 
composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology issues. The Nasdaq 
index gained 3.08 to 754.80. 
</P>
<P>
 But most other broad-market indexes lost ground along with the Dow. The NYSE 
composite index fell 0.43 point to 258.18, and the American Stock Exchange's 
market value index retreated 0.86 point to 447.12. The Standard & Poor's 500 
list fell 0.95 to 468.08. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the market's probably a little overextended here on the short term," 
said Edward Collins, head block trader at Daiwa Securities America. He said the 
Dow average's 100-point gain Tuesday and Wednesday came "after a very lethargic 
summer. That's a lot to digest in a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks firmed early in the session along with bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fixed-income market could not hold its early gains, and selling 
pressure took hold in the early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar fell 2 3/8 to 112, International Paper lost 1 1/2 to 73 3/8, 
Eastman Kodak declined 1 1/8 to 49 1/4, DuPont fell 7/8 to 59 1/8, Exxon slid 
3/4 to 59 1/8 and Chevron lost 1/2 to 42 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM, another Dow component, headed the broad advance in technology issues 
and led the volume in NYSE trading, with 5.17 million shares changing hands. 
Big Blue gained 2 to 69 3/8, breaking through a 52-week high set last Friday. 
Compaq jumped 2 1/4 to 38 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walt Disney slipped 1/2 to 42 3/4 after the company said late Wednesday that 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of its film studio, was quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor makers were among high-tech stocks on the rise. Intel gained 
15/16 to 65 1/8, Texas Instruments rose 2 7/8 to 81 5/8 and Micron Technology 
leaped 2 3/8 to 43 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Webco Industries tumbled 6 to 7 1/2 after it said late Wednesday that it was 
restating its second- and third-quarter results due to "erroneous accounting 
adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 * Software Etc. Stores rose 1 to 10 and Babbage's gained 1 1/4 to 13 after the 
two agreed to merge. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, German shares, led by banks, closed higher, with the DAX 
30-share average gaining 25.84 points to finish at 2,152.21. In London, the 
Financial Times 100-share average gained 29 points to close at 3,234.2. But 
Tokyo's Nikkei average slipped back 68.31 points, closing at 20,443.29. In 
Mexico City, the Bolsa index closed at 2,776.21, down 22.01 points after the 
peso lost ground against the dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was mixed against other major currencies in thin trading.

<P>
 Twenty-nine years ago, a doctor at a Denver mental hospital sat a sickly, 
slightly retarded boy named Tim Baley down at a piano and watched him run his 
fingers across the ledges and valleys of the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The puzzled doctor began jotting down notes. Baley had undergone hundreds of 
tests, but medical minds were still having a hard time coming up with a 
diagnosis for the boy's developmental problems and poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 The piano test only deepened the mystery. Most kids who came through the ward, 
the ones with Down's syndrome or autism, would gleefully crash their palms down 
on the keys. Not Baley. "The doctor told us Tim was fascinated by it," Baley's 
father recalled, "and they said we should try to encourage him." 
</P>
<P>
 It probably would have been hard to discourage him. Baley, now 42 and living 
in Anaheim, has became a polished concert pianist who has performed in nine 
countries. He can't drive, he can't make change for a dollar, nor can he read 
the music he plays so artfully, but his breathtaking abilities regularly bring 
audiences to their feet.

<P>
 Tim Baley's story would be an incredible one if he were unique, but it is even 
more compelling to realize, as doctors have in recent years, that he is not one 
of a kind at all. In fact, last month Baley stood on a San Diego stage with 
four other Orange County musicians who share his unusual mix of profound 
ability and disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Baley and his band-mates have Williams syndrome (WS), a rare congenital 
disorder that has bolted from obscurity in the past few years to offer 
scientists a tantalizing riddle about the workings of the human mind. How can 
the condition stunt most learning and intelligence but leave other complex 
skills, such as verbal abilities, unscathed or, seemingly, even enriched? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a beautiful mystery, just beautiful," said Ursula Bellugi, director of 
cognitive neuroscience at the Salk Institute in La Jolla. "There is an exciting 
possibility here." 
</P>
<P>
 Baley shrugs when asked about the unusual nature of his talents. "I'm not 
handicapped," he told a reporter, wagging his hands in the air. "I have all my 
fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The debut performance of Baley's band, the Williams 5, was at a national 
convention of the Williams Syndrome Assn., a group that has grown from 150 
families to 2,500 in less than a decade. The mood at the event was celebratory, 
and it was clear that the group's members are enthusiastic about the increasing 
attention WS is receiving from researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is about to blow wide open," said UC Irvine biology 
professor Howard Lenhoff, whose daughter, Gloria, has WS and performs with the 
Williams 5. "The mystery of this syndrome is being solved." 
</P>
<P>
 The syndrome was named for J.C.P. Williams, a physician who in 1961 thought it 
was unusual that four infants in his care displayed a mild retardation coupled 
with a heart defect. Williams, then on staff at the Green Lane Hospital in New 
Zealand, typed up a paper, but his findings went largely unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two years later, geneticists at the University of Utah studying heart 
defects made the next major WS discovery when they happened upon the cause of 
the mysterious syndrome. Their findings, which tie WS to a missing chunk of DNA 
material in chromosome 7, touched off a flurry of scientific interest in the 
birth disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utah researchers found that people with WS are missing a gene responsible 
for manufacturing elastin, a protein that allows the body's tissues to flex and 
recoil. This would seem to be the culprit behind the heart ailments and other 
tissue problems that plague people with WS. Also missing are some genes of 
unknown purpose that surround the elastin agent, creating blank spots on the 
body's genetic map. 
</P>
<P>
 These blank spots are intriguing, Bellugi said, because they are likely tied 
to the unusual WS cognitive development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elastin-producing gene nicely accounts for many of the physical 
manifestations, such as the heart problems and maybe the facial traits, but we 
still have to map out the rest of the missing genes," Bellugi said. "That is 
where the potential for discovery lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Bellugi and a team of specialists at Salk are focusing on how and why people 
with WS have their language and social skills spared even though their 
condition causes malformations throughout the brain. How can a WS child weave 
an outlandish and vivid make-believe tale, complete with complex grammar and 
creative word choice, but not be able to tie his shoes? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, if found, could shed light on the theory that language is somehow 
separated from other functions of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking data, Bellugi and her colleagues compared children with WS to 
youngsters who have the same IQ but were born with Down's syndrome. The two 
groups were about even in their lack of problem-solving abilities, but when 
asked to name as many animals as they could in 60 seconds, the groups gave 
markedly different responses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Down's children named the animals a first-grader might, such as dogs, cats 
and horses, while the WS subjects rattled off obscure or exotic creatures, such 
as weasels, newts, salamanders, Chihuahuas, ibexes and yaks. People with WS 
also show a startling ability to remember faces, far better than most "normal" 
people, which complements their tendency to be highly sociable and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lenhoff, whose daughter, Gloria, can speak six languages and sing opera, 
the stunning dichotomy of skills among WS subjects defies any easy 
categorizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we really say they are retarded or developmentally disabled?" Lenhoff 
asked. "In many ways, some of these Williams kids are superior to a lot of 
typical people in verbal skills or music. I say the best thing to call them is 
mentally asymmetric. They are different, really, not disabled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the Williams 5's raucous debut performance, a parent of one of the 
performers scanned the faces of the exuberant, dancing crowd of children 
bunched up near the stage. "They all look related, they all look like they 
could be family," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 People with WS, especially when they are younger, share elfin features, with 
almond-shaped eyes, wide mouths beneath small, upturned noses and oval ears. 
One out of every 20,000 infants is born with Williams. Most will have a heart 
murmur and a narrowing of the arteries, leading to coronary ailments that can 
range from minor to life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williams babies also often suffer severe gastric problems and slow growth. 
Many parents must cope with their children's sleeplessness and irritability, 
conditions doctors say are probably tied to high calcium levels. 
</P>
<P>
 As they grow older, youngsters with Williams show delayed physical and mental 
development. Many of the childhood medical ailments, except for the gastric 
problems, tend to tail off, but muscle and skeletal maladies often set in. 
</P>
<P>
 People with WS also share a love of conversation (parents among the WS circles 
call it a "cocktail personality") and of music that goes far beyond the 
hyper-chattiness and love of song found in most all children. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Williams 5 wound their way through a set that included "The Rose" and 
"Take Me Home, Country Roads," their younger counterparts at the foot of the 
stage would alternately dance wildly and stare intently at the performers, 
seemingly transfixed by the melody and rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenhoff is eager for the scientific testing, which has so far dwelt on 
language abilities, to venture into the group's affinity for music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait," he said. "It is the aspect that fascinates me most. I'm sure 
my daughter is part of the reason for that. But I also think the connection 
with music is what makes Williams so different." 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, the soprano in the Williams 5, is an accomplished stage 
performer who has toured concert halls around the world. She has perfect pitch, 
as do most people with WS, and she has the hyper-sensitivity to sound, called 
hyperacusis, that comes with the condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hear dog whistles," Gloria, 39, confides with a grin. "But loud noises, 
I hate loud noises. They scare me and I just . . . lose it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The link might be cultivated and highlighted by a new music camp for 
youngsters and adults being offered by the Williams Syndrome Assn. at 
Tanglewood, the performing arts facility in Massachusetts. The camp debuted 
last weekend with a program for 40 students that included voice, musical 
theater, piano and a variety of recreational activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really just the start of something bigger, I hope," said Lenhoff, who 
helped organize the camp and whose daughter is attending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someday I hope, we all hope, to have a residential music and arts college." 
</P>
<P>
 The Williams 5 are finished with their set and an Elvis impersonator is 
onstage at the Bahia Hotel convention room, delighting the room full of dancing 
children with a hip-shaking rendition of "C C Rider." Gloria, smiling, is 
watching the faces on the packed dance floor and trying to answer a hard 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would I do without music? I don't know. I can't live without it." Her 
brows knit in an effort to imagine the world without the one thing, sometimes 
the only thing, that makes complete sense to her. "No songs? It would be . . . 
torment. Just torment." 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria asks for another question, hoping to do better this time. What is your 
secret wish? "Well, I have always wanted to go on Wheel of Fortune," she says, 
but then changes her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would want people to understand us," she says. "If people could see what we 
can do, all of us, what we can do as a person, then they would call us what we 
really are. Mentally gifted."

FIRST PERSON: ALL ABOUT HIS SO-CALLED RECKLESS YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TOMASHOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Son of Woodstock has come and gone, the time for anyone old enough to 
remember bell-bottoms to flash back on all his or her wild drug stories. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in a time when even our President has confessed to past drug dabbling, 
uneventful as that story turned out to be. With this in mind, I feel it's high 
time to come clean about the secret of my own crazy hallucinogenic past: 
</P>
<P>
 I don't have one. 
</P>
<P>
 I was allergic to marijuana. It gave me headaches. I don't like mushrooms even 
on pizza, so why eat any for a good time? My sinuses are so congested, cocaine 
would have been a waste. And heroin? I can't stand it when a doctor puts a 
needle in me, so where's the thrill of doing it to myself? 
</P>
<P>
 No, I decided early in life that drugs just weren't for me. 
</P>
<P>
 At every party or night out, my friends looked at me as if I'd shown up in a 
leisure suit. They didn't know what to make of the weirdo who just said no. 
They'd always try to get me to change my mind, but at least they didn't seem 
too upset when I didn't indulge. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say I haven't been affected by peer pressure. Instead of 
expanding my mind with chemicals, I did it by dreaming up new and interesting 
lies about all the drugs I'd used. 
</P>
<P>
 I've moved around a lot during the past 10 years, so the deception has been 
easy. In every new city I've had a new set of friends who knew nothing about my 
less-than-reckless youth. 
</P>
<P>
 This left me free to make up tales, such as the one about the time in college 
we got so high, my friends and I slept in a graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the night I was so stoned, I went out into a lightning storm and tried to 
take pictures of the maelstrom -- but forgot to take off the lens cap. 
</P>
<P>
 And the night before a Super Bowl Sunday when I took mushrooms with my 
roommate, fell into a snowbank and stayed there for an hour -- trying to figure 
out who would win if God and Superman got into a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 I was the Rosie Ruiz of the drug culture. I didn't run with the pack when they 
were doing their drugs. I just jumped in later to pretend that I had. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd launch into a new fib every time the conversation turned to discussion of 
wild youth, as it often does for guys in their 30s. And every one of them 
worked. Instead of sounding like a wuss, I was cool. I fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd grown up a real straight arrow, yet was always jealous of all those kids 
sitting in the high school parking lot, smoking pot while I was learning fun 
facts about logarithms. Years later, these were the people who ended up as my 
friends, so I figured it was imperative to appear as hip as they were. 
</P>
<P>
 There was just one problem. Telling stories about doing drugs is almost as 
addictive as doing them. And both have the same effect: Fun for a while but in 
the long run, a tiresome waste of brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
 So I've decided to kick the habit. As embarrassing as it is, I've started 
letting all my friends know the awful truth. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about time, really. Clean and sober is in. I'm in my mid-30s, and the 
drugs of choice for everyone in my peer group are the ones that clear nasal 
passages or ease painful itching and swelling. Boasting about past drug 
excesses is out of fashion. Boasting about recovering from those excesses is 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any other cheap thrill, drug tales have just lost their luster. Talking 
about that time you made a bong out of an old toilet-paper roll is about as 
interesting as talking about the Grateful Dead show you grooved to back in '83. 
Taking drugs used to be a way to feel young. Now, talking about them makes you 
feel really old. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the time of life to get kicks from other mood-altering substances. 
Like children. Many friends of mine have swapped their roach clips for diaper 
pins. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see the similarities between drugs and kids. Both can be pretty 
expensive if you want to do them up right. When either is bad, they can keep 
you up all night. And after a few years of having either around, you should be 
prepared to just say no quite often.

AROUND TOWN: BLAZING NEW TRAILS; A DAY IN THE MOUNTAINS IS NO PICNIC FOR THE 
CITY KIDS OF CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bumpin' through!" shouts John Verstraeten, balancing a bundle of branches and 
other earthly debris as he navigates the dusty path through shoulder-high 
chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
 Below lies a sweeping, if slightly hazy, vista of Ojai Valley. The mountains 
above are the Topa Topas. 
</P>
<P>
 We're in Los Padres National Forest with a group of city kids. But this is no 
picnic. Their gray T-shirts identify them as the CREW. They're here to work. 
</P>
<P>
 With misgivings, I hit the trail, close behind the CREW's assistant project 
director, Lanny Kaufer, who had to go and mention rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
 I see a snoozing snake under every rock. Every crackling twig is a rattle. 
Kaufer is reassuring, sort of: Despite numerous snake sightings, the CREW has 
yet to have "a dangerous encounter," up close and personal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is late morning. The CREW -- five boys, two girls -- has been on the job 
since 8. By day's end, they will have groomed 200 yards of Pratt Trail, which 
climbs 6,000 feet up from Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Blazed years ago by the U.S. Forest Service, it is a favorite of hikers, 
bikers and equestrians. But every three years native vegetation reclaims it and 
soil erosion lays bare big rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service once maintained the hundreds of miles of forest trails. 
They no longer can do it alone, because "our budgets have gotten smaller and 
our jobs more complex," says Charlie Robinson, recreation officer for the Ojai 
ranger district. "The CREW really has come along at an ideal time for us. They 
do a great job -- high energy and a lot of spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the trail, Paul Starbard, long-bladed loppers in hand, is working 
alongside the kids, as always. The CREW is his baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Starbard -- an ex-military policeman, ex-hunting guide, 
ex-building contractor -- walked into the Forest Service office. He'd been 
thinking: The environment's in trouble. Kids are in trouble. Someone had to 
make a commitment and, he reasoned, "It might as well be me." 
</P>
<P>
 Step by tiny step, his dream of the CREW (Concerned Resource and Environmental 
Workers) became a reality. Like those mountain trails, it's been a path strewn 
with obstacles, including money shortages. Few would argue the merits of a 
nonprofit project to put "at risk" kids to work helping Mother Nature, but it 
takes a fund-raiser to fund raise, it takes funds to hire a fund-raiser. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In bad economic times, "It's been a struggle, but it's like a calling," says 
Kaufer, a former outdoor-education teacher who recently came aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was to put 50 local kids to work this summer on the CREW's first 
major, continuous project -- and more than 100 applied. But the budget dictated 
only 10 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews were a bit unusual. Among Starbard's questions: "Do you mind 
picking up trash?" 
</P>
<P>
 They work a 40-hour week at $5 an hour, paid by the federal Job Training 
Partnership Act, one of the CREW's collection of "angels" that includes 
corporations, private donors, government grants and fee-for-service contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the youngsters have never had a real job before. As Angela Andreasen 
puts it: "There's not a lot of jobs out there for 14-year-olds." Leaning on her 
rake, her face and neck shaded from a relentless sun by a Foreign Legion-style 
cap, she says she's often exhausted; still, she likes "getting pushed." 
</P>
<P>
 As the only girls in this group, she and sister Karena, 16, have dealt with 
the macho thing. When the guys complained that this is "a man's job," Starbard 
reminded them that this is not a contest about hauling the most brush; it is a 
job training experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day, two boys got into a fight. They were suspended for two days 
but, by vote of the others, allowed back. 
</P>
<P>
 The job is "really adventurous . . . really cool," says Jesse Cardinali, 15. 
That pink stuff on his arms is calamine lotion. Poison oak is a common 
affliction. 
</P>
<P>
 But, hey, it's not one of those stuffy office jobs. "I'd been cooped up in 
school" all year, says John Verstraeten, 15, who admits to having blown all his 
pay on video games and clothes. His brother, Jed, 16, was also happy just to 
"get out of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Major downers: Heat. Snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 And, says Joshua Halls, 15, "They only let us work eight hours a day. A lot of 
guys here want to go 10-12 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Genaro Smart says he's saved $500 toward a car while "helping the animals." 
The CREW has built and placed 100 nesting boxes for endangered birds and has 
restored fish habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Starbard, 35, who's "just a grown-up CREW kid" from a high-risk background, 
negotiated a five-year lease with the Forest Service on a 10-acre former 
minimal-security facility at Rose Valley, 22 miles from Ojai. Next summer, he 
hopes to house a CREW there in an ecological boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
 In three years, 200 CREW members, a socioeconomic mix of 14- to 21-year-olds, 
have signed on for jobs ranging from graffiti removal to pipeline repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Starbard's letting himself think big. A national CREW? "Our whole 
country's full of kids who need attention." Question About Judaica? Ask Hava, 
Hava Knows 
</P>
<P>
 Curious about the Rosenberg spy case? Or just wondering where to get kosher 
cuisine in Paris? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Hava. 
</P>
<P>
 For 24 years, Hava Ben Zvi's been fielding queries both weighty and way-out as 
head librarian at the Jewish Community Library. 
</P>
<P>
 She hardly blinked when a caller asked, "Where is Cain buried?" And she 
advised the man wishing to learn Hebrew so he could read the Rosetta Stone that 
hieroglyphics might be more in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Zvi's domain is a 30,000-volume hideaway on the second floor of the 
mid-Wilshire Jewish Community Building. There, with a skeleton staff and eight 
way-past-retirement-age volunteers, she runs a resource dedicated to Judaica -- 
from history to folklore to cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, funded by the Jewish Federation Council, is free to the public, 
although Ben Zvi may ask first-time borrowers for a deposit. Insiders know the 
library well; "Hava's Hits," tips on books to dig into along with "a nice cold 
borscht," are posted in the building elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 But, outside, the 47-year-old facility is an inadvertently well-kept secret. 
Those who have found their way there include writers, students, artists, actors 
and filmmakers in quest of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
 The eclectic mix on the shelves includes an unauthorized biography of David 
Duke, various editions of the Talmud and "The Greatest Rabbis Hall of Fame." 
For the young and their teachers, there are games and videos. This is a 
people's library; Jewish university libraries are geared more to scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 There are books in English, Hebrew and Yiddish -- on Middle Eastern politics, 
the Holocaust, children's stories. There's a six-language Bible, although Ben 
Zvi says: "I never saw anybody using it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Zvi, born in Poland, learned firsthand about the Holocaust: Her father was 
killed by the Germans in 1941. She was sheltered by a Catholic family and later 
used her own wiles to escape: She found sanctuary in a state orphanage, passing 
as a Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
 At war's end, she was reunited in Palestine with her Zionist mother, who had 
moved there in 1939. Later, Ben Zvi taught school in Israel and married another 
Pole; they immigrated to America in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps she was born to be a librarian. When she was about 7, her father would 
take her to the Warsaw library. "They used to transfer me from one branch to 
another because I'd already read all the children's books." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, children's books on Jewish themes are very different. Then, they were 
"more didactic. The moral was really spelled out. Today, the child's pleasure 
is one of the major considerations." 
</P>
<P>
 The library's archives of local Jewish history date from 1850, when six Jews 
lived in the city. (Today, 501,000 live in metropolitan L.A.). 
</P>
<P>
 Want to give your baby a name with Hebrew origins? Ask Hava. Looking for a 
synagogue in Rio? Hava knows. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, a project of the Bureau of Jewish Education, is open from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Fridays, and 1 to 5 p.m. 
Sundays.

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; STARRY, STARRY SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want a clear view of the night sky in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 Go inside and turn on your computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomy-themed home computer programs have been on the market for several 
years, but the vast storage capacity of CD-ROMs has launched a new generation 
of starry software. Two of the more notable of the pack are "Planetary Taxi," a 
whimsical program aimed at junior high and high school students, and the 
spectacular Russian-made "Redshift," which turns your computer into a 
sophisticated planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Planetary Taxi," from the enterprising Voyager company in New York, depicts 
the solar system as a giant roadway accessible by interplanetary taxi. Your 
guide is Rita, a Brooklyn-accented dispatcher whose voice is a refreshing 
change from the bland norm of software programs that seem to get their actors 
from the same agency that supplies talent for infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita has you choose from three taxis. The "Rookie" model provides a simple 
tour of the program, while "Cruiser" and "Expert" get you into the "Planetary 
Taxi" game. 
</P>
<P>
 To play, you sit in the driver's seat with a view of a highway on a desert 
landscape. A passenger comes on-board and makes a request to go to a planet 
that meets his or her needs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a kid who can't wait for tomorrow to go to Disneyland wants you 
to take him to the planet with the shortest day. An athlete wants to go where 
he can jump the highest and a romantic soul wants to go to the planet with the 
most moons. 
</P>
<P>
 You click in a guess at what planet they want and the taxi streaks across the 
highway, recording the time it takes to get there at rocket speed of about 
25,000 miles per hour. If you've gotten the answer right, the passenger gives 
you a big tip. A near guess gets a smaller tip and if you're totally wrong, you 
have to try again. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to collect as much as you can in tips before racking up 50 years 
of travel time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Planetary Taxi" also includes 300 high-quality still photographs of the 
planets and a handful of animated sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the CD-ROM is available only on the Macintosh platform for about 
$30. Voyager officials say a Windows version will be out by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redshift" is the first software product developed in Russia to be generally 
available in the West and it's a stunner. (The program is in English and the 
title refers not to the favorite color of the former regime there, but to the 
term used to describe the increase in the wavelength of light of an object in 
the universe as it moves away from an observer). 
</P>
<P>
 The dimensions of the program, commissioned by London-based Maris Software, 
are mind-boggling. The program includes depiction of a sky full of about 
250,000 known stars, 40,000 deep space objects, 5,011 asteroids, the planets in 
our solar system and all their known moons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redshift" allows you to choose any moment in time between 4,000 BC and AD 
11,000 to check on the position of the planets. And it allows you to view this 
from more than 1,000 vantage points in the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you pick your time and place, you can set the planets and moons in motion 
to watch how they progress in relationship to each other. For example, you can 
choose to sit on Jupiter's moon, Io, and watch how the giant planet would have 
risen up into view on the day the Declaration of Independence was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 The view is a quantum leap up from the simple renderings of planets we studied 
in school. The heavenly bodies in "Redshift" are amazingly detailed, and the 
quality of the light shining on them changes with their movements in 
relationship to the sun and other objects. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous controls to manipulate -- you can speed up or slow down 
time, zoom in or out, or change the angle of view. 
</P>
<P>
 And if all this isn't enough, "Redshift" also includes 700 full-screen 
photographs of planets, moons, nebulae and galaxies, and it comes with a 
dictionary of astronomy that includes more than 2,000 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, "Redshift" provides a hint of the wonder we felt as kids when 
staring up at the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Redshift" is no kiddie program and it's not a game. It's for serious 
study of the heavens, whether by professional or amateur astronomer. Once the 
novelty of "Redshift" wears off, those with only a passing interest in the 
field will probably not delve much further into it.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's undeniably spectacular and bodes well for what can be done in the 
future on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redshift" is available in stores and through mail order for both Macintosh 
and Windows platforms for about $50.

 See the costumes worn by the stars of "In Living Color," "Tales From the 
Crypt," "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" and other television shows at Beverly 
Hill's annual display of Emmy-nominated costumes today through Sept. 4. The 
costumes, on display according to show, are all within walking distance of one 
another -- at stores such as I. Magnin, Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany & Co. 
Better yet, pick up the Beverly Hills trolley at the corner of Dayton Way and 
Rodeo Drive for a dollar, and take a tour of the city, which includes the 
costume display and a discussion of the designers (such as Bob Mackie, whose 
costumes for "Gypsy" are nominated). The trolley gives 20-minute tours of the 
city from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. (800) 345-2210. Sample Beers From 
Micro-Breweries 
</P>
<P>
 Quench your thirst for exotic beers and eat out too, for less than it would 
cost to take a date to dinner. The Summer Karnival of Beers offers tastes of 
food and beer from 30 micro-breweries at Fullerton Hofbrau, 323 N. State 
College Blvd. The event benefits the Boys and Girls Club of Fullerton. Two-hour 
sittings begin at noon both days, ending Saturday at 11:30 p.m. and Sunday at 8 
p.m. $25; $12 for designated drivers (includes food, drinks). (714) 525-8241. 
Marvel Comics Mega Tour Is Coming to Town 
</P>
<P>
 Whether your heroes are on the level of Wolverine, Storm and Cyclops, or more 
the speed of Ren and Stimpy and Beavis and Butt-head, they will all be a part 
of the Marvel Comics Mega Tour, coming to the Los Angeles Airport Hilton, 10 
a.m.-6 p.m. Saturday. Admission is $5, children under 6 free -- but there are 
also tickets available at comics retailers for $2.50 (try Comics Unlimited in 
Hawaiian Gardens, Forbidden Planet in Sherman Oaks or Hi De Ho Comics in Santa 
Monica, to name a few). Marvel creator Stan Lee and several Marvel writers and 
artists will be there. (818) 995-0151. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

THE GOODS; HITTING THE BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if you've left the K-12 years far behind, the back-to-school season is a 
perfect time to hit the books. Want to improve your grade-point average as a 
savvy consumer? The curriculum is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Just stop in any bookstore and take your pick from the new batch of how-to 
paperbacks that offer consumer guidance on everything from general-interest 
issues ("How to Read the New Food Labels") to specific predicaments ("How to Do 
Your Own Divorce in California"). 
</P>
<P>
 Although self-help books have been around for years, the spectrum of the new 
titles suggests some major shifts in consumer behavior, says Charles Winton, 
president of Publishers Group West. 
</P>
<P>
 He cites health books as a typical category. "The alternative health movement 
has moved into the popular culture," he says. "The average American is much 
more attuned to the mind-body-nutritional aspects of health today than ever 
before. One out of three people uses some form of alternative medicine today." 
</P>
<P>
 New consumer titles can also serve as a financial barometer, says Mark 
Hoffman, editor of Consumer Reports Books, a leading how-to publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popular how-to books have overlapped with the tightening economy and job 
uncertainty of the '90s," he says. "People are forced to spend more wisely, so 
they're looking carefully at their capital when buying a home or car or 
insurance policy." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Consumer Reports Books' bestsellers right now, he says, is "How to Sell 
Your House, Condominium or Co-Op." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, today's consumer is increasingly bombarded by advertising claims 
through television, telemarketing and catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the economic system gets increasingly complex, people are saying 'I don't 
want to get taken,' " Hoffman says. "So now we're talking about getting value 
for your dollar and getting your rights." 
</P>
<P>
 And the way to do this, he says, is to arm yourself with information. "Even a 
simple thing like buying tires requires doing your homework." 
</P>
<P>
 To make that homework easier, most of today's consumer paperbacks are 
extremely accessible. They use visual graphics, sample forms, sample letters, 
source lists and resource directories -- all without wasting words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a healthy trend," Hoffman says. "These books give you real 
value." 
</P>
<P>
 The books listed here are only a small sampling of the ABCs of consumerism.

 In the news: Jay Leno, on the President's inability to persuade Cubans not to 
try to come here: "He promises universal health care, he promises three million 
jobs, he promises no more crime. These people aren't used to our political 
system. . . . They think this stuff can actually happen."

 Comic Argus Hamilton, on why Cubans are ignoring Clinton's mandate: "They 
watch the news. They were so impressed with our invasion of Haiti that they 
decided to take their chances."

 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on detention facilities being expanded to house up 
to 60,000 refugees at Guantanamo Bay: "For those unfamiliar with bilingual 
slang, Guantanamo means close but no cigar ."

 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the Simpson hearings: "O.J. was hit with a double 
whammy. Scientists say his hair not only matches those found at the crime 
scene, he also has problem dandruff." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, on a planned visit by Prince Charles to L.A. in October: "Boy, there is 
something that L.A. women don't get enough of. Middle-aged guys flying in from 
out of town, acting like a king and claiming their wives don't understand them. 
. . . If I'm not mistaken, I think he's staying with Kato Kaelin."

 Comedy writer Bob Mills, on Jeffrey Katzenberg leaving Disney: "He was given a 
choice of how he could go: Be shot by a hunter, swallowed by a whale or 
trampled in a stampede." 
</P>

 Katzenberg may have given up $100 million in stock options and other future 
earnings at Disney, says Steve Clow: "But at least now he can grow a mustache 
if he wants." 
</P>

 Hamilton, on the health-care bill: "Various senators say we've turned the 
corner on universal coverage, turned the corner on mandates, turned the corner 
on single payer and turned the corner on health networks. We've turned four 
corners, so we're right back where we started."

INK: LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BOOKSHELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after Bantam Books hit a gusher with Jerry Seinfeld's "SeinLanguage" -- 
1.2 million hardcovers in print and counting -- the publisher this week stocked 
shelves with 500,000 copies of Paul Reiser's "Couplehood." 
</P>
<P>
 True to the formula that worked so well the first time, the new book presents 
the humorous observations of a major comedian whose role on a hit TV sitcom 
serves as a primary marketing strength. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, Reiser's breeze of a read mines the ever-shifting landscape of 
his own marriage and the silly turf wars that could have come right out of the 
TV show, NBC's "Mad About You," in which he plays a documentary filmmaker wed 
to another Manhattan yuppie portrayed by Helen Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 That is to say "Couplehood" is more literary merchandise than real book -- a 
way for fans to read the text of Reiser's stand-up and TV performances and all 
but hear him speaking the words himself. No surprises. And with a cover-charge 
price of $19.50, it's a chance to save on the two-drink minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser, for example, writes that he's a chronically lazy guy: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll watch a show I'm not enjoying for 30, 40 minutes because I don't feel 
like looking for the remote control. . . . Once we were watching TV and 
couldn't find the remote control. . . . Now, I sensed that I was sitting on 
something hard that may very well have been the remote control, but I didn't 
have the energy to get up and confirm. . . . Finally, my wife forcibly shoves 
me to one side and we find not only the remote control, but a pair of scissors, 
a glove she was looking all over for, and a tangerine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized I am either (A) really, really, remarkably lazy, or (B) I have no 
sensory receptors in my left buttock. Either way, it might be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, before introducing Reiser to an audience of booksellers at 
Caroline's comedy club, Bantam Publisher Irwyn Applebaum said that 
"SeinLanguage" had been such a hit that "suddenly comedians who had never read 
a book were talking about writing one." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other comedy books are two from Hyperion -- the new "You So Crazy" 
by Martin Lawrence, of Fox-TV's "Martin," and the upcoming "Don't Stand Too 
Close to a Naked Man" by Tim Allen, the star of ABC's "Home Improvement." 
Hyperion has announced a 500,000-copy printing for Allen's book, which has a 
publication date of Oct. 7. In addition, Bantam recently signed Ellen 
DeGeneres, star of the ABC's "Ellen," to write a book scheduled for release in 
the fall of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garry Shandling, Dennis Miller and Brett Butler also reportedly hold 
publishing contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seinfeld and Reiser books have the same price, same look, same size and 
almost the same weight, 14 and 15 ounces, respectively. A big difference is 
that "Couplehood" begins with Page 145. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too overwhelming to know there's so much left and you're only on Page 
8," Reiser explains. "This way, you can read the book for two minutes, and if 
anybody asks you how far along you are you can say, 'I'm on 151 -- and it's 
really flying. It just sails, baby.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Unknown Writer Wins 'Lottery': Carol O'Connell, a failed painter and sometime 
proofreader, was out of work and fretting about the rent on her shoe-box 
apartment in Greenwich Village. Not only that, but New York publishers clearly 
were not even reading the manuscripts she had been sending them. On to the 
slush pile they went. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, the phone rang. London calling. Hutchinson Publishers told O'Connell 
that it would buy "Mallory's Oracle," which she had sent abroad in a bid to 
bypass New York resistance to a novelist without an agent. Hutchinson, which 
was paying 25,000 pounds for O'Connell's thriller, then sold the American 
rights at auction last fall to G.P. Putnam's Sons for $800,000 -- one of the 
largest sums paid for a first novel (and a sequel now being written). Deals to 
publish in more than a dozen other countries followed. 
</P>
<P>
 A jubilant O'Connell scheduled root canal, knowing that she could finally pay 
for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luck, just a great stroke of luck," O'Connell, 47, said over lunch this week 
in a voice that whispers, almost inaudibly. "It was like winning the lottery. I 
had crawled out of the slush pile." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mallory's Oracle" introduces former street urchin Kathleen Mallory, now a New 
York police detective with a super fluency in computers. Someone is cutting the 
throats of rich old women who live on stately Gramercy Park. After the slasher 
also kills the detective who had taken Mallory in as a child and raised her, 
she pursues the case on her own. She enters an atmospheric world of old money 
and oddball heirs, as well as a network of magicians and psychics. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old Mallory, as she insists on being called, is a cool, gorgeous 
and compulsively efficient blond. She comes across as such an original but 
elusive character that it may explain why film rights to the book remain 
unsold. Jodie Foster? Bridget Fonda? It's hard to agree on who might play her. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell is pulling for an unknown. "When you get a piece of wonderful luck 
such as I did, you want to share it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mallory continues to live on the printed page as O'Connell works on 
a sequel. That Mallory might return in a series of books was a prospect that 
obviously excited Putnam Editor in Chief Neil Nyren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get millions of thrillers all the time," he said. "Most of them are 
competent, but the character of Mallory seemed different and fresh to me. You 
have a handful of solid female protagonists, such as in the books of Sue 
Grafton and Sara Paretsky, but none of them is quite as off-center as Mallory 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the search for enduring female characters runs throughout the 
publishing industry. In recent months, for example, it has produced New York 
crime reporter Kate Murray, introduced in "Strangers in the Night" (Crown) by 
Peg Tyre, and Los Angeles stockbroker/sleuth Iris Thorne, the creation of 
Dianne G. Pugh, author of "Cold Call" and the imminent "Slow Squeeze" (Pocket 
Books). 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory has earned O'Connell the luxury of being able to write all the time -- 
and still pay the rent on quieter Upper West Side digs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a natural hermit," she said. "I want to go on being one." 
</P>
<P>
 With Mallory for company.

 The name of the narrator isn't Babe, but she answers to it until the last page 
of her story, when she's ready to resume her interrupted life. For most of the 
novel, Babe is one of modern fiction's crazy ladies, out of her head with 
loneliness and despair. 
</P>
<P>
 In common with so many of her sisters in misery, Babe has lost the husband who 
was the center of their existence for 12 years, and she's attempting to cope by 
mixing Valium, liquor and black comedy. Unlike the rest of this growing 
literary community of wretched women, Babe hasn't been replaced by a popsy half 
her age or rejected by a man who can't commit himself to a permanent 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 43, Babe is newly widowed and virtually paralyzed with grief. 
She's not only buried a husband, but her entire identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Babe is a poet, but her poetry has been more of a diversion than a profession. 
She'd be the first to admit that she's lived most of her adult life 
vicariously, deriving her sense of self from Michael's acting career. 
</P>
<P>
 Babe is something of an anachronism in her generation, but realizing the fact 
doesn't help matters. 
</P>
<P>
 When her old friend and sometime psychotherapist Seymour invites her to Palm 
Springs, she accepts, hoping to find distraction and perhaps some direction, 
but Seymour isn't much help. He's a cartoon psychologist, nuttier than most of 
his celebrity patients. His prescription for Babe is a combination of illegal 
drugs and sex, both of which he is eager to supply before she's even unpacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Babe cooperates in this therapy, visiting Seymour on alternate 
weekends, she's always in tears by the time she reaches Riverside. "So take the 
Pomona Freeway," he says "You'll bypass it." "I can't bypass myself . . . I'm 
going to New York for two weeks. I have to find out who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 New York doesn't offer much in the way of enlightenment, although it does give 
the author a chance for some bi-coastal satire. Jerusalem is Babe's next stop, 
not because she expects to find solace in religion, but because she's met a 
Swedish theologian on the flight from New York to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 After delivering a paper on the "Ontology of a Messiah" in San Diego, Hjalmar 
is off to the Holy Land, where Babe will join him. While sex with Seymour 
wasn't particularly therapeutic, sex with Hjalmar seems more promising. By this 
time, Babe has added promiscuity to the already dangerous mix of booze and 
pills. Unfortunately, Hjalmar is worse than a caricature, he's a thief, and our 
hapless heroine winds up sadder, $3,000 poorer and no wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Babe tries a couple of alternative therapies, a course that allows 
simultaneous pot-shots at New Age channeling and Old Age Freudian analysis, 
neither of which are any improvement over Seymour. Matters look up somewhat 
when a chance encounter on a bus leads Babe to a job in an advertising agency, 
another standard venue for satire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In amazingly short order, Babe becomes the star copywriter, although not 
without paying a heavy price. In the course of her brief career, she meets 
still another false prophet, the writer Eric Rothender, who whisks her off to 
the Oregon wilderness, a steamy encounter that ends with Babe in a hospital 
after having overdosed on alcohol and pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric returns to Nicaragua, the setting for his blockbuster book and the place 
where his true love lives, but not before giving both Babe and the reader a 
basic course in Central American anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Betrayed again, Babe returns to Palm Springs and Seymour, who is celebrating 
his 69th birthday by inviting all his celebrity patients to his suicide. In the 
midst of the bizarre festivities, Babe suddenly finds her voice and speaks her 
mind, discovering that her misadventures with drink, drugs and men have finally 
effected a cure, although perhaps not one you should try at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last chapter, she's sober, successful and able to say her own true 
name, although the recycling process has been arduous for both the narrator and 
the reader. Even though her plight is genuine, Babe seems cloned instead of 
invented; one more in a line of pitiful, female Quixotes tilting at fallen 
windmills, shooting at riddled targets.

THE FORCE IS WITH POLICE PSYCHOLOGIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article "A Force of One" (July 18) is outstanding and true. Dr. Larry 
Blum is one police psychologist who definitely is a tremendous help to the thin 
blue line who serve and protect on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 I have known Larry for 16 years and he has helped untold numbers of officers 
and, yes, one police chief -- me -- to return from the brink of disaster 
because of the lifestyle we adopt in this stressful profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for sharing Larry with your general readership -- he is definitely one 
of our heroes.

COMPASSIONATE DOCTOR TREATS FROM THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While AIDS takes its toll on society, Dr. Scott Hitt refuses to stand by idle 
("Forever On Call," Aug. 14). He appears to be a man full of heart whose 
compassionate treatment of his patients is remembered by them. 
</P>
<P>
 On discrimination against gays, Hitt rightly points out: "There are lots of 
evil people out there who . . . believe that AIDS is retribution for an evil 
lifestyle and that being gay is against nature's laws. There is so much 
discrimination. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is reassuring and inspiring for me to know that Hitt continues his 
activities against AIDS, despite all the narrow-minded people out there. 
Wouldn't it be nice if there were more doctors like Hitt who take an active 
part in the community and who, in fact, truly care about people and not only 
money?

PICTURE SUMS UP A LIFETIME OF DEVOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beverly Beyette is to be commended for her Around Town column "Two Cultures 
and One Language: Respect" (Aug. 19). Her report of the Hollenbeck Home picnic 
that bridged the generation gap and the breaking down of barriers of language 
and color was heartwarming. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm wondering how many Methodist and Church Women United women in Southern 
California smiled in recognition of seeing Mildred Hutchinson, 99, being kissed 
by 6-year-old Jesus Leal. 
</P>
<P>
 A past president of the Methodist Women's Conference when Arizona was still 
joined with Southern California and long before the church joined with the 
United Brethren to become the United Methodist Women of the Pacific Southwest, 
Mildred is one of the great leaders of Methodism. 
</P>
<P>
 Known and admired by hundreds of women in the nationally known Church Women 
United movement, it is thrilling to see smiling Mildred Hutchinson alive and 
well and pictured in a social justice gesture that typifies her lifetime of 
Christian devotion.

ABCS OF NUTRITION PROVE A MEATY SUBJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The meat, poultry and egg industries were jumping with glee when they read 
"The ABCs of Good Health" (Aug. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 We are told that for 19 of the 28 vitamins and minerals listed (nearly 70%), 
some "good" sources are: pork (four times), liver (seven times), organ meats 
(three times), poultry (eight times), eggs (seven times).In case you haven't 
been reading your own articles, the above are poor sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do you think our government has recently changed the nation's food chart 
to having meats play a much smaller role in a daily diet? 
</P>
<P>
 A "good" source doesn't contain large amounts of fats, cholesterol, sodium and 
remnant pesticides, antibiotics and hormones, which is what you will consume if 
you eat most meats and, to a slightly lesser extent, poultry. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, research has demonstrated that if you define good as "percentage 
of vitamins and minerals available for absorption," you will always look to 
vegetables, fruits and grains. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do you think a cow gets its muscle from?

'THE LEAN' SENDS AN OLD MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Berardelli makes some interesting points in his article ("The Lean: It's 
an Angry World Out There," Aug. 9), but the driving posture he describes is at 
least 22 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 When I learned to drive in Ohio in 1972-'73, it was called the "Detroit Lean" 
and we saw it often.(In fact, Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, herself an Ohio 
girl, refers to it in the hit "Brass in Pocket.") 
</P>
<P>
 Berardelli is right about the message The Lean is sending: This is a driver 
who thinks he's cool and who doesn't care about anyone or anything in his way. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't seen it much lately -- maybe because you can't do it with a shoulder 
restraint buckled up, but I always wondered: 
</P>
<P>
 Do they adjust the mirrors so they can still see out from down there?

MUST THE CHILDREN BEAR THE COST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elizabeth Mehren's "New Salvo in Custody Wars" (Aug. 3) describes reactions to 
(Macomb County Circuit Court Judge Raymond Cashen's) ruling in Ireland vs. 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 If Judge Cashen was truly concerned that Maranda (Ireland-Smith) be "raised 
and supervised by blood relatives," shouldn't the ruling have been for joint 
custody so that Maranda's closest blood relatives, her mother and father, could 
nurture her? 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted were a family law professor, child-care provider and a women's law 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Each held opinions favoring either (mother Jennifer) Ireland's or (father 
Steven) Smith's plan for Maranda. One winner, two losers, if you count the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 Most divorce and adoption arrangements create adversarial instead of extended 
family relationships. Mehren provided stats in support of today's single 
working parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The following stat supports not aborting one or both biological parents from 
the child: 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults who were raised in foster, adoptive or divorce custody situations, 
where access to one or both of the biological parents is prevented, make up the 
majority, or numbers disproportionate to general population, in our nation's 
mental and penal institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps judges and the "experts" should reconsider "the child's best 
interests" in terms of the lifelong costs to both the individual and society.

MOVING UP; COURT OF APPEAL SETTLES INTO NEW $5.5-MILLION BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With workers still scraping stucco from the bricks and wiring the courtroom 
for sound, officials with the 2nd District Court of Appeal began settling into 
permanent quarters Thursday in downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's move to a new $5.5-million building on East Santa Clara Street 
ends an 11-year run of hearing oral arguments wherever and whenever a public 
room was free. 
</P>
<P>
 It also pleases city officials who see the two-story building as a cornerstone 
to redeveloping downtown, merchants who hope to benefit from noontime foot 
traffic and attorneys who will no longer have to wonder where to show up for 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have to be in a borrowed courtroom and people poke their head in 
looking for something else, it kind of lessens (the court's) dignity," said 
Wendy Lascher, a Ventura attorney who specializes in appellate law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law needs an institution that's handsome and people respect and realize 
it's important," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 To the city, the two-story gray-and-white building represents more than a 
stately addition to downtown. It means tapping into new revenue from a 
previously dry source. 
</P>
<P>
 A city parking lot, a sprinkling of apartments, two houses and two small 
businesses occupied the 1.5-acre lot where the courthouse now sits. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately owned portion of the parcel generated about $4,000 in property 
taxes. The courthouse, which is owned by a private developer holding a 
long-term lease with the state, is expected to bring in 10 times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely in keeping with the overall revitalization goal of the city, 
which is to spur new investment and develop a stronger employment base in the 
downtown (area)," said Pat Richardson, the city's redevelopment director. "Most 
of the people that will be working there are professional people that have a 
fair amount of disposable income." 
</P>
<P>
 The building, designed by Tustin-based Okimoto/Siu Architects and Associates, 
features a marble lobby flanked by stained oak columns, a traditional courtroom 
lined with wooden benches and lit with chandeliers, and justices' chambers 
framed by picture windows that look out into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the ocean off to my left, the mountains off to my right and the 
restaurant down below. What more could anyone ask for?" Presiding Justice 
Steven Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal architect Richard Okimoto said the challenge was designing a 
30,000-square-foot building to blend in with the patchwork of surrounding 
Victorian homes, businesses and the county's former courthouse, which now 
serves as City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a long time to evolve into what you see today," said Okimoto, whose 
previous design experience included five Coco's restaurants and a Riverside 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the project's tight $5.5-million budget, the developer, Hall, Moore 
and Associates of Newport Beach, decided to concentrate on a few key areas: the 
courtroom, the lobby and the justices' chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest benefit of the new quarters will be the consolidation of the 
court's offices and courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the three justices who make up Division 6 of the state's 2nd 
Appellate District have spent most of their time working out of a nondescript 
office building on South Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But twice a month, the justices and a clerk packed up their files and held 
court for a day in Ventura, Santa Barbara or San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we won't have to go through the waste of schlepping off somewhere and 
having to rush through court because we can only have the facility for a 
limited amount of time," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we've shown up and the room wasn't available. We have had 
air-conditioning problems, lighting problems. We've had problems unlocking the 
doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices hope to hold court twice as often in the new building, giving 
attorneys more time for oral arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, the finer points of law have not been top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the court's staff and justices have spent hours boxing up files and 
posting mover's stickers on each piece of furniture, picture frame and plant. 
On Thursday, the grand transfer got under way. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Stone said, the experience has led him to one conclusion: "There 
was lots of old stuff that . . . is not worth saving."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR GETS 6 MONTHS FOR SHOOTING; COURTS: NEWBURY PARK PASS 
RECEIVER LEODES VAN BUREN SHOT THROUGH A LOCKED DOOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's leading high school pass receiver will spend the next six months 
in jail instead of on a college football field after being sentenced Thursday 
for shooting through a door at his girlfriend's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Newbury Park football star Leodes Van Buren was also given five years 
probation for firing a handgun through a locked glass door in April as his 
girlfriend stood only three feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark said the 19-year-old deserved a 
jail term because of his lack of public remorse and for coercing his 
girlfriend, whom he married in July, to change her account of the shooting 
under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if Mr. Van Buren didn't fire the shot, he certainly was engaged in a 
conspiracy to commit the act," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, who broke all state receiving records last fall at Newbury Park 
High, had faced up to three years in state prison, but could have received a 
six-month suspended sentence. He had no previous felony record. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, who appeared in court wearing dark denim pants and a white shirt, 
asked to begin serving his sentence immediately, and did not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, John B. Miller Jr., said Van Buren lost his full scholarship to 
the University of Colorado after he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly disrupts his ability to go on with his education and his 
football career," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Buren hopes to win another scholarship to a different school in the 
spring or next fall, Miller said. No schools have extended offers, but two 
universities on the West Coast have expressed interest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His resources are extremely limited," Miller said. "In order to go to a good 
school and get himself an education . . . he's going to have to pay for it with 
his football abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, following a three-day trial, a Ventura County jury took less than 
three hours to convict Van Buren of firing into an occupied dwelling. Attorneys 
said the key evidence was audiotapes of the football player and his 
girlfriend-now-wife, Marcie James, identifying Van Buren as the shooter on the 
day of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Both later denied that account. 
</P>
<P>
 James, herself a former softball pitcher at Moorpark College, testified that 
it was a friend of Van Buren's from Los Angeles who fired the shot through her 
door. She said she made up the original version out of anger at Van Buren for 
cheating on her, according to a sentencing report prepared by a probation 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple have a 2-year-old daughter, Andreya Van Buren. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's hearing, James' father made an impassioned plea for the 
judge to spare his son-in-law jail time and allow him to enroll in a university 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this young man can do something, given the opportunity, . . . he 
right guidance, and the love of a family," said Curtis James, a battalion chief 
with the Los Angeles Fire Department. "He knows now there's a right and a 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was also attended by Marcie James, other members of her family and 
Van Buren's mother, Annie Carter, who sobbed and ran shrieking from the 
courtroom after the sentence was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda Groberg argued that Van Buren deserved an eight-month 
jail term because he has never admitted responsibility for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 She cited a passage from a letter Van Buren had written to the court: "I can 
only say that myself and God are the only ones who truly know of my innocence; 
however the jury believes otherwise, so I am ready to face the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Groberg also asked that Van Buren be ordered to attend a domestic violence 
diversion program, because he "reacts to problems with violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the prosecutor said Van Buren threatened to kill James after she 
told sheriff's deputies that he fired the shot while trying to enter her house. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Miller portrayed his client as a "streetwise" and rebellious 
youth from South-Central Los Angeles who overcame enormous difficulties 
adjusting to life with a guardian in predominantly white, suburban Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking for probation and no jail time, Miller described football as the 
cement that held Van Buren's academic and social life together. He quoted 
letters from football coaches and school officials who said Van Buren had 
matured both on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 George Hurley, Newbury Park's head football coach, wrote that Van Buren was 
only the second freshman in the school's history to play varsity football. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so strong on the field and yet so vulnerable socially and 
emotionally," the coach wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley described Van Buren as seeming out of place in his freshman year, often 
standing "with his fists clenched" and not trusting anyone enough to turn his 
back on them. 
</P>
<P>
 But by his junior and senior years, Hurley said, the difference was obvious. 
Van Buren had become a respected member of the student body who once broke up a 
fight between two younger students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the obstacles, he had succeeded in moving beyond the limits of 
his inner-city background," the coach wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had earned a chance to escape his past, to attend college, to dream of a 
future."

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; VOLUNTEER FINDS 51-YEAR HOME AT THE COUNTY FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For years, it seemed that Lena Simitzi was the home arts department. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just Miss County Fair," said Eva Sandoval, a home arts volunteer for 
35 years. "You saw her everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Simitzi has volunteered at the Ventura County Fair for 51 years -- longer than 
anyone else working at the fair this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can find Simitzi, a Ventura resident, still helping out occasionally 
as a hostess at the Professional Arts Building, as polite and friendly as she 
ever was as home arts superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 84, Simitzi is frail and tires easily. Fair colleagues say she is one 
of the last of the Old Guard, the women of Ventura County for whom the County 
Fair was not only a volunteer opportunity, but a series of social events and an 
outlet for the organizational energies that often found no other venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's such a lady, so soft-spoken and sincere," said Marcia Weaver, 
superintendent of the professional arts department. Weaver's mother, Adah 
Callahan, also volunteered at the fair for years alongside Simitzi. "People 
aren't ladies like that nowadays. That time is gone and it will never come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Simitzi began offering her services at the fair in 1943, when fair organizers 
came to a PTA meeting at her son's school in search of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 She signed up and was soon made a judge in the clothing and textiles division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I judged buttons, if you can believe that," she recalled, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 She eventually rose through the ranks to become superintendent of the home 
arts department in the 1970s. Home arts encompasses everything from homemade 
quilts to brownies to table-setting competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Simitzi, the ladies of home arts continued a tradition of holding a 
yearly tea, a luncheon and a fashion show. The women arrived in dresses and 
heels. Many wore white gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home arts was very social," said Barbara Schneider, the longtime 
superintendent of the floriculture department. "It was a different attitude, a 
different feeling all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all the departments operate by one set of standards -- considerably 
more casual than in earlier years. But when Simitzi ran home arts, it was her 
little kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of what brought her back every year was the satisfaction of organizing 
successful, meticulously organized exhibits out of the yearly jumble of entries 
and mothballed displays. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a pleasure," she said. "Everything is a mess, but by the time you 
cleaned it up and everything -- oh, that was beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you think all the work is worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, the same volunteers -- or "the girls" as Simitzi calls them -- 
returned each year, forming a home arts sorority of sorts with its own customs 
and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of the years, we would get a lot of the same people, and they were 
very dedicated," Simitzi said. "Now, many people will work for a few years and 
kind of quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Simitzi herself scaled back after her husband, John, grew ill in the early 
1980s. He died in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 She misses her summers supervising baking contests and display set-ups at home 
arts, but tries to be philosophical about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There comes a time when you have to give it up and let someone else take 
over," she said. "You can't monopolize." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers who know Simitzi from years ago continue to smile at the 
mention of her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very personable, a very loving lady," said Geneva McEwen, a home arts 
volunteer for 24 years. "To me, she's one of those ladies who never met a 
stranger."

SAT SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1994, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District declined for the fifth consecutive year. Here are the scores, compared 
with state and national averages. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. UNIFIED AVERAGES 03,06,08,06 Year Verbal Math 1993 356 432 1994 353 424 * 
</P>
<P>
 CALIFORNIA AVERAGES 03,06,08,06 Year Verbal Math 1993 415 484 1994 413 482 * 
</P>
<P>
 NATIONAL AVERAGES 03,06,08,06 Year Verbal Math 1993 424 478 1994 423 479 Test 
survey responses showed that Los Angeles senior are not studying as much as 
students in California and the nation. Course work in arts, music, English 
foreign languages, math and science is 1.2 years behind that of their peers in 
California and two years behind students nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-one percent of Los Angeles students do not speak English as their first 
language, compared to 20% statewide and 8% nationally. School officials says 
this contributes to lower verbal SAT scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to other students taking the test in the state and nation, Los 
Angeles students are poorer and their parents have less education. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of Los Angeles high school seniors are taking the test, 
rising from 33% in 1990 to 36% in 1994.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ELECTRIC CAR TO HAVE IMPACT ON COUNTY FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors' hot new prototype electric car is making the rounds in Ventura 
County and will land at the Ventura County Fair Agriculture Building today and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sleek silver two-seater with rack-and-pinion steering and anti-lock brakes 
bursts from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 8.5 seconds in a shiftless acceleration.Its 
cockpit-like console provides digital readouts for the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Except during acceleration, when the Impact produces a sound reminiscent of a 
tiny jet engine, the car is soundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an amazing little car," said Rob Davis, a Southern California Edison 
spokesman who is displaying the car. Edison, GM and 14 other utility companies 
are sponsoring a two-year marketing research program designed to let 1,000 
potential customers test-drive the prototype. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison and other utilities will benefit from the advent of electric cars with 
a greater demand for their product. And the environment will benefit as well, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier to clean up emissions from a generating plant than it is 
from thousands of vehicles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car features computerized systems such as one that checks and adjusts tire 
pressure for optimum mileage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead-acid batteries provide near pollution-free power to the car, which weighs 
about 3,000 pounds. Its range is about 90 highway miles and 70 in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only 50 of the prototypes will be built, GM plans to have the Impact 
in production by 1998 at a cost to the consumer of around $20,000, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prototypes cost considerably more to develop -- about $600,000 each. 
Consequently, Davis said, visitors at the fair this weekend won't be able to 
test-drive or sit in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that price, we probably don't want people sliding in and out of it with 
their ice cream," he said. JOANNA M. MILLER

OXNARD COUNCIL RESOLVES KOJIMA LAND DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council decided in a special meeting Thursday to close escrow 
on a $5.32-million land deal, despite the presence of DDT and other 
agricultural pesticides on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the advice of the city attorney and special counsel, the council 
approved several amendments to its agreement with real estate speculator Donald 
T. Kojima.The changes allow for the close of escrow before the completion of 
environmental audits on the 41-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
 The original agreement said that Kojima had to remove, or pay the city to 
remove, all pollutants on the land before the close of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmental testing by two consultants led to contradictory conclusions 
about the level of contamination on the site, said City Manager Tom Frutchey, 
and a final pollution analysis could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the amended agreement, Kojima will be required to pay for any necessary 
cleanup if the environmental tests show that the land is contaminated with 
hazardous levels of DDT or any other pesticides, said special counsel Margaret 
Sohagi. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kojima will also have the unusual option of rescinding the deal and giving 
the city its money back, Sohagi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would Oxnard make such a deal? 
</P>
<P>
 The city is eager to close escrow because it had agreed to advance hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to the financially troubled Kojima to pay interest on 
loans he took out on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every passing day we're paying more interest on the outstanding loans on this 
property," Frutchey said. "We're taking one step forward and two steps 
backward." 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima said he does not expect a cleanup to be necessary, and will not rescind 
the deal regardless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to see the transaction consummated, and we are happy that it was," 
Kojima said. "We'll do whatever cleanup is necessary." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; SUPERVISOR OF MARKET ROBBED IN HIS OFFICE

<P>
 A Moorpark supermarket supervisor was held at gunpoint in his office and 
robbed of an undisclosed amount of cash by a thief who fled on foot, sheriff's 
deputies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Service manager James Jolicoeur, 25, who had been on temporary assignment at 
the Moorpark store for less than a week, was robbed about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday 
by a man who followed him to his office, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to accounts given to deputies, the suspect had purchased groceries 
at the store at 101 W. Los Angeles Ave. and then inquired about a returned 
check belonging to his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jolicoeur went to his office to investigate the check, he was followed by 
the suspect, who brandished an automatic handgun when the door was opened, 
Deputy Jerardo Gomez said. At the gunman's orders, Jolicoeur filled the thief's 
paper bag with money and then got under a desk while the suspect continued 
rifling the office, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the store, the gunman was briefly but unsuccessfully pursued by 
store employees. GREG RIPPEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITIZENS SHAVE COSTS OF ARTS PLAZA 
GALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza could wind up October's grand-opening festivities more 
than $70,000 in the black, as ticket sales should easily cover the costs of a 
red-carpet reception and champagne toasts, according to recent budget 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens planning the gala have shaved expenses considerably since the initial 
budget of $317,500 was set earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 By saving money on the star performer's contract, the inaugural season 
brochure and an outdoor art display, they have chiseled their expenses to an 
estimated $260,782. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also bumped up revenue projections, anticipating sold-out crowds for 
shows featuring Bernadette Peters and the Conejo Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening profits could be used to pad the theater's endowment and 
help cover daily operating costs in the performing arts center. Or the money 
could flow to the city treasury to refund part of the council's $75,000 gift to 
the grand opening committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Virginia Davis, who heads the theater's board of governors, cautioned at a 
Wednesday night meeting that she's not yet ready to divvy up the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's wait until all the numbers come in and the bills are paid," she said. 
"If the (council members) ask for their money back, we'll tell them we're not 
ready to give it back yet." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Wednesday, the board of governors (formerly known as the Civic 
Theaters Commission) granted a volunteer group permission to sell souvenirs 
bearing the Civic Arts Plaza's logo. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Friends of the Civic Arts Plaza has more than 500 members eager 
to help usher during performances and sell mementos at intermissions, President 
Helene Ross said. Items for sale will probably include T-shirts, mugs and tote 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
 During the grand opening weekend, bottles of champagne and sparkling apple 
cider bearing the logo of a silhouetted dancer will also be on sale. STEPHANIE

 A 40-year-old employee of E.J. Harrison & Sons trash-hauling company was 
struck by a motorcycle and killed Thursday as he walked across a Santa Paula 
street to pick up some nearby trash cans, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federico Vargas of Ventura was pronounced dead of severe traumatic injuries at 
Santa Paula Memorial Hospital at 2:44 p.m., said a hospital emergency room 
nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the motorcycle, John Duncan, 26, of Ventura was not injured. A 
passenger on the motorcycle was also uninjured, the California Highway Patrol 
said. Both were wearing helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred shortly after 2 p.m., when Vargas was working on 
Foothill Road, east of Cummings Road, said Jim Wingate, Ventura County chief 
deputy coroner's investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "He walked out from the trash truck into the opposite traffic lane and was hit 
by the motorcycle as he went to pick up some garbage cans," the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas was thrown approximately 100 feet by the impact, and his body landed in 
a nearby lemon orchard, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas' brother-in-law, Antonio Luna, 38, said late Thursday that Vargas had 
been employed by Harrison for less than six weeks. He said Vargas was working 
with his cousin when he was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motorcycle was coming real fast and probably they didn't see him," Luna 
said. Grief-stricken family members had gathered at Vargas' home Thursday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did it happen? That's what everybody's asking," Luna said. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee of the Harrison company expressed sorrow Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just really sad, I don't know what to say," said recycling coordinator 
Tom Chiarodit. "Even though I didn't know the guy, I'm very sad about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas is survived by his wife Rebecca, 47, a 16-year-old daughter and a 
12-year-old son, Luna said. JASON GRANT

INEXPERIENCED SCUBA DIVER, 41, DROWNS; TRAGEDY: BOBBI JEAN GREENHEAD BECAME

 A 41-year-old Granada Hills woman who completed her scuba training only last 
Saturday -- and was described as a good athlete -- drowned during a night dive 
off the coast just east of the Ventura County line, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbi Jean Greenhead, who owned a Studio City video and audio post-production 
company with her husband, was entering the water Wednesday night with a group 
of divers near Neptune's Net restaurant north of Malibu when she became 
separated from her partner, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrisha Gyllenswan, 39, of West Los Angeles -- with whom Greenhead had shared 
a certification dive last Saturday in Catalina -- was holding Greenhead's hand 
as they entered the water when Gyllenswan's shoulder strap broke, according to 
Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Gyllenswan returned to the beach, assuming that Greenhead had swum past the 
breakers to meet the others, Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Lazz said. She then "noticed 
a diving light that was separate from the others," Lazz added. Gyllenswan 
alerted dive master Sigfus Sigurdsson of Manhattan Beach, who pulled the 
unconscious Greenhead from the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigurdsson immediately began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, authorities said, 
until paramedics took over and transported Greenhead to St. John's Regional 
Medical Center in Oxnard, where Greenhead was pronounced dead at 11:33 p.m. 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The original call to authorities occurred at 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Greenhead, the victim's husband, said his wife had taken training 
classes that involved "textbook stuff" and had dived in a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had made up her mind that she wanted to become a dive master," her 
husband said. "She loved the water." 
</P>
<P>
 After the autopsy on Thursday, Breese said, "There was no trauma and no 
injury. . . . Right now, we're baffled. . . . In other words, we have no reason 
for her to drown." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his office intends to investigate Greenhead's medical history and 
inspect her rented scuba equipment for a malfunction.

PROPOSED MUSEUM SITE MAY BE CHUMASH BURIAL GROUND; THOUSAND OAKS: BONES WERE 
FOUND IN 1990. NATIVE AMERICANS QUESTION WHY THEY WEREN'T NOTIFIED SOONER. 
</P>

 To the shock of local Native Americans, a Thousand Oaks parcel where they had 
hoped to build a native peoples museum may be the site of a Chumash burial 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Wednesday night meeting, city officials told backers of the Native 
Peoples Museum that human remains were discovered in 1990 at the proposed 
eight-acre site at Lang Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Several bones and part of a human skull were found during a routine 
archeological survey of the land, which is part of a major development area. 
Shortly after the bones were found, they were reburied under six feet of dirt, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans at the meeting said they were appalled that they had not been 
informed at the time of the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe that if we hadn't specifically asked about this site we may 
never have been notified," said Beverly Folkes, a board member of Oakbrook Park 
Chumash Corp., a group that represents local Native Americans. "We had no idea 
we would open up this whole can of worms." 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation creates a host of new challenges for backers of the Native 
Peoples Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of Thousand Oaks residents and representatives from several Native 
American groups have been planning the museum since last year, after an effort 
to bring the Los Angeles-based Southwest Museum to Thousand Oaks failed. The 
major hurdle has been the lack of a suitable site. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's main planner, museum designer Al Fiori, said organizers had 
finally settled on the site at Lang Ranch Parkway near Avenida de los Arboles. 
The land was ideal, Fiori said, because it is adjacent to the Chumash 
Interpretive Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the committee sat down Wednesday to vote on the site, Greg Smith, a 
Thousand Oaks city planner, disclosed the 4-year-old discovery. He said he was 
investigating whether the city had notified Ventura County coroner's officials 
when the bones were discovered. The law requires that the coroner be notified 
when human remains are found. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Smith's announcement, committee members requested that there be 
no development at the eight-acre parcel until they know more about the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the bones that were unearthed appeared to have been burned, which 
he said suggests they were not Chumash because the Chumash people did not 
cremate their dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chumash custom, the dead are buried in the fetal position facing west, 
said Paul Varela, who heads the Interpretive Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members said until there is more information about the find, even 
initial plans to put a park on the land should be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anything to happen until we can find out if this is a Chumash 
burial ground," said Leo Valenzuela, director of the Oakbrook Park Chumash 
Corp. "If it is a burial ground, we want it left in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee had hoped to persuade the Conejo Recreation and Park District to 
devote the land to the museum. At the meeting, however, park officials 
indicated they would not give up precious parkland because of buried bones.  
</P>
<P>
 Park district General Manager Tex Ward said he would not support a plan that 
would force the district to forfeit the land. He said without a park there, the 
children of about 5,000 residents living nearby would have no place to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those remains were capped and the earth was left in its natural state," Ward 
said. "There is no reason we shouldn't move forward with our park." 
</P>
<P>
 That left the museum's supporters fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you want people to have a barbecue on your parents' grave?" Fiori asked 
Ward. "I think if this is a burial site, it needs to be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
 At meeting's end, the group asked the city to provide more information on the 
find and agreed to discuss alternate museum sites at its next monthly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure where we'll turn next," said Councilman Frank Schillo, who has 
chaired the drive for a museum. "We're out of sites. This was supposed to be 
the one."

SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST PROJECT CALLED THREAT TO GRASSLANDS; NEWBURY PARK: BUT 
ANALYSTS CONCLUDE THE COMMERCIAL COMPLEX WOULD NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT 
TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Building a regional mall and private school on the Seventh-day Adventist 
property in Newbury Park would uproot endangered plants and destroy a valuable 
grasslands habitat, city analysts have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project would not significantly affect traffic, noise or air quality 
in nearby neighborhoods, according to a newly released environmental impact 
report. And while the blueprints call for substantial grading, the developers 
could preserve most of Newbury Park's scenic ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced in 1993, the huge commercial project has sparked concern from its 
neighbors in Newbury Park, who have predicted traffic jams, garish signs and 
late-night crime. They fear the project -- together with several new 
subdivisions -- would destroy the rural atmosphere of their community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seventh-day Adventist proposal would plunk a huge outdoor mall -- with 70% 
as much retail space as The Oaks -- just north of the Ventura Freeway at the 
Wendy Drive off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchored by a Target mega-store and a 12-screen movie theater, the development 
would feature traditional red-tile roofs and an old-fashioned town plaza. With 
infrastructure and road improvements, including a reconfiguration of the Wendy 
Drive off-ramp, the price tag will easily top $100 million, architect Francisco 
Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying there won't be traffic or pollution -- give me a break," 
Sierra Club activist Cassandra Auerbach said. "You look at those arguments and 
you say, 'Excuse me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 To build the 750,000-square-foot shopping center, the Seventh-day Adventist 
Church must relocate its private school, horse stables and senior citizen 
bungalows. Church officials plan to move all those facilities north, to a hilly 
campus with spectacular views. 
</P>
<P>
 That northern portion of the church's 400-acre property, however, contains the 
most delicate habitats, including oak woodlands and riparian corridors, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church school and retirement center would destroy 38 acres of grassland, 
which contains native species such as the chocolate lily. The project would 
also require some grading along the upper reaches of a creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dramatically, building the school would wipe out the local population of 
Blochman's dudleya, an endangered cactus-type plant that sprouts leaves in 
star-shaped formations and blooms with bright flowers after rains, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To save the dudleya flowers, church officials will try to transplant them, 
Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Auerbach said the only sure-fire solution would be to steer clear of the 
dudleya's turf altogether. "Putting buildings on the north side of that 
property is a big mistake," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While recognizing the presence of endangered species, church consultant Dale 
Ortmann said the vaunted grassland "is not a pristine meadow." Used for years 
as grazing land, the property is speckled with chunks of concrete, rusty car 
parts and an old water heater. 
</P>
<P>
 The biological damage, he said, could be minimized by good design and careful 
transplanting. And to make up for lost habitat, he said, the developer will 
provide miles of new trails crisscrossing through the property and connecting 
to National Park Service land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking at this like it's a project-stopping issue," Ortmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the biological issues, the Seventh-day Adventist project earned 
good marks throughout much of the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had tons of meetings, spent tons of hours and put in tons of work to 
design this project, and I think (the report's conclusions) reflect that," Behr 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's consultants have also held more than 30 meetings with residents 
to explain the project. And they say they have encountered little opposition. 
Among their most persuasive tools: an economic study indicating that the Target 
store could capture sales-tax dollars from shoppers who now trek to Oxnard or 
Simi Valley to browse through discount malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't consider this a controversial project," Ortmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with the City Council election just two months away, some residents 
predict the church's project could become controversial. Certainly, it could 
emerge as the focal point of a widely anticipated debate between slow-growth 
and pro-development candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I won't vote for anyone who supports this project," resident Marc 
Josephson said. "I think it's a terrible idea for Newbury Park." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hold a public hearing on the project Oct. 17. 
Residents have until Sept. 29 to submit written comments to the city on the 
environmental impact report. The City Council could hear the issue before the 
Nov. 8 election. And if approved, construction could begin by next spring, 
developers said.

CLINTON ALLIES REIN IN HEALTH BILL AMBITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stunning retreat, Senate champions of President Clinton's ambitious 
health reform agenda regrouped Thursday and began pushing privately for a 
modest proposal that they -- and the White House -- could call a small but 
vital first step toward comprehensive reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to deal with the reality of trying to get the very most we can," 
said John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), a new convert to the go-slow 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), another die-hard Clinton ally: "We ought to 
go as far as we can and recognize that there was always the expectation all 
along that we'd be right back here next year to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift came as the Senate decided to postpone consideration of health care 
reform until it returns in September from a shortened summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected concession by Clinton's allies substantially raises the 
likelihood that Congress will adopt insurance market reforms but forego until 
next year any attempt at broader change. The insurance reforms, which enjoy 
widespread support, would enable consumers to buy or retain affordable coverage 
even if they have existing illnesses or when they change jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Clinton's vows to veto legislation that did not make significant 
progress toward covering all Americans, the sentiment for compromise -- and 
taking what can be achieved -- seemed infectious Thursday on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Another convert to incremental reform was Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.), whose 
upset victory in 1991 galvanized the reform movement because he had made health 
care reform the centerpiece of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must concentrate now on what this Congress can do this year," Wofford 
said. He said that a "strong dose of practical realism is necessary" after two 
weeks of desultory Senate debate that he called "a classic case of Washington 
gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-week recess, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), 
whose own health reform proposal is all but dead, intends to continue 
negotiations with Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), co-leader of a bipartisan 
"mainstream coalition" of about 20 senators who have advanced their own 
proposal as an alternative to Mitchell's. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous unresolved issues between Mitchell and the "mainstream" 
group, and whether compromises can be forged is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Sens. Rockefeller, Wofford and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) are 
preparing a counterproposal to the "mainstream" alternative that would make 
insurance more accessible to small businesses, individuals and especially women 
and children -- a far cry from their long-held goal of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have many miles to travel," Wofford conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockefeller-Wofford-Harkin proposal may represent a last-ditch effort to 
salvage what's left of a movement that set out nearly three years ago to 
overhaul what is one-seventh of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people here are pretty discouraged," said one top Senate aide. "But 
nobody's willing to throw in the towel yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The House has already gone home, unable to form a consensus around any plan. 
And on Tuesday, Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) conceded that comprehensive 
reform is unlikely and said he would settle for insurance reforms and put off 
more ambitious efforts until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, asked if he thinks the recess would leave Congress with too 
little time to enact health care reform before it adjourns in early October, 
replied: "I wouldn't say that, no. I don't think you can say that and I don't 
think the recess will kill it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also told a news conference that he retains hope for health care 
legislation so long as senators are negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the less I say the better right now as long as Sen. Mitchell and Sen. 
Chafee and Sen. (John B.) Breaux (D-La.) and others are doing their best to 
continue this dialogue," the President said. "I think we just have to let this 
thing develop a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's plan aims to cover 95% of Americans by the year 2000, relying on 
voluntary measures and insurance reforms and subsidies to the needy. The 
legislation stipulates that in states where the 95% coverage level is not 
achieved by 2002, large businesses would be required to provide insurance and 
pay at least 50% of worker premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's plan has been criticized for its reliance on such an employer 
mandate and on government to oversee a redesigned health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The "mainstream" plan relies on insurance reforms but eliminates any 
provisions for an employer mandate. It aims to trim $400 billion from future 
growth of Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years to generate funds to help poor 
people buy insurance. It seeks to cover about 92% of the population by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say that the "mainstream" plan would lead to excessive litigation, 
that it lacks sufficient cost containment measures and that its structure for 
subsidies could cause employers to drop coverage for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockefeller-Wofford-Harkin proposal, according to Senate staffers, would 
allow small businesses, individuals, women and children access to the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Plan, which now offers 9 million subscribers a large 
choice of health plans at relatively low cost. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would cut the rate of growth in Medicare and use savings to provide 
the elderly with coverage for outpatient prescription drugs and long-term home 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, independent analysts warned that congressional inaction would 
hasten deterioration of the current system, renewing medical inflation and 
driving up the number of uninsured Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a Capitol Hill seminar organized by the nonpartisan Alliance for 
Health Reform, William Custer, director of research for the independent 
Employee Benefit Research Institute, noted that if current trends hold true, 
there will be about 48 million persons without insurance by the year 2000, up 
from 39 million now.

WEARY SENATE OKS CRIME BILL AFTER A GOP CHALLENGE FAILS; CONGRESS: 61-38 VOTE 
SENDS $30-BILLION MEASURE TO CLINTON AND ENDS WEEK OF FRACTIOUS STRUGGLE. 
HANDFUL OF REPUBLICANS BREAKS RANKS TO GIVE DEMOCRATS THE VICTORY .  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Capping a six-year congressional effort, a fractious and weary Senate late 
Thursday night passed sweeping crime legislation on a largely partisan 61-38 
vote, sending it to President Clinton's desk to be signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow victory was something of an anticlimax, however. The issue was 
actually settled on a procedural vote earlier in the day, when six Repubicans 
broke ranks to join the majority in advancing legislation that was a top 
priority for the Clinton Administration and Democratic lawmakers seeking 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 In that earlier action, the minority party failed by two votes to muster the 
41 votes needed to reopen the $30-billion bill to a series of amendments that 
likely would have been unacceptable in the House, thus dooming the legislation. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the measure was a much-needed victory for the President, who had 
made the crime bill a central element of his domestic agenda. Indeed, had a 
Democratic chief executive failed to win passage of legislation with such 
powerful public appeal from a Congress controlled by his own party, it would 
have thrown significant doubt on the party's ability to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-39 procedural vote came at the close of a difficult week of fraying 
tempers and partisan friction. In the end, an insufficient number of 
Republicans were willing to risk killing the bill during an election year when 
crime ranks at the top of the public's agenda. One Democrat abandoned his party 
to vote with the losing side. 
</P>
<P>
 A jubilant Clinton, having for the second time narrowly averted a devastating 
defeat on the bill, lauded "senators of both Republican and Democratic ranks 
who put law and order, safety and security, above politics and party." 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the six-year legislation is $13.5 billion to be spent on 
state, local and federal law enforcement. Of that amount, $8.8 billion would be 
matching funds, aimed at the hiring of 100,000 officers to carry out community 
policing. Republicans maintain that the funds would put only a fraction of that 
number of officers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also would ban 19 types of assault-style weapons, a provision 
strongly advocated by law enforcement officials and championed by Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.), and would enact a federal "three strikes, you're out" 
provision, which would require life sentences for those convicted of violent 
and drug offenses for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the bill authorizes $9.85 billion to be spent on prison 
construction, with almost $8 billion of that in state prison grants and the 
remainder going to reimburse states for incarcerating illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort required to pass the bill marked something of a setback for the 
White House and the Senate's Democratic leadership. The struggle took so much 
time that weary senators, already two weeks late in beginning their August 
recess, were unwilling to stay in session to continue their debate on health 
care. Now, health legislation will not be voted upon by either house until 
after Labor Day -- a delay generally regarded as boding ill for passage of the 
ambitious bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican opponents scoffed at the suggestion that the crime measure would 
make the nation more safe or secure and said it included a number of 
old-fashioned liberal social-spending programs wrapped in the guise of 
crime-fighting provisions. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) went so far as to call 
the bill a "gravy-sucking pig." 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is not tough on crime. Most of this money in this bill is going to 
be used to reelect people (the Democrats) want to reelect," by funneling 
billions of federal dollars into local communities, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) branded the bill "business as usual 
-- spend a lot of money and tell people you're going to solve their problems." 
He and others vowed to fight the issue again next year, when the money 
authorized under the bill must be appropriated. And they said the issue would 
continue to define a fundamental difference between the two political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans had sought to make 10 amendments to the measure, most of which 
would either strip it of spending or add tougher penalties for certain crimes 
tried in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 However, such changes would have forced yet another vote in the House, and 
Democratic leaders warned that the fragile coalition that passed the bill there 
last Sunday would collapse if it were altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Democrats insisted that the Republican effort was really an 
indirect campaign to eliminate the measure's ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the struggle in the Senate was a reprise of last week's battle 
in the House. There too, victory hinged on a procedural vote -- one that the 
Democrats lost the first time they tried it two weeks ago -- and on winning the 
support of a handful of moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) compared the four-day drama in the Senate to "a 
poker game" and, indeed, it was difficult to tell which side was bluffing and 
which actually had the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 By tying their demands to a procedural issue that required 60 votes, the 
Senate Republicans strengthened their hand and, until Thursday, it appeared 
that they might have the 41 votes they needed to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Dole produced a letter signed by 40 other Republican 
senators who had indicated that they would join their leader in the procedural 
maneuver "unless most of our concerns are resolved." Had they held together as 
a group, they would have been able to block the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) managed to peel off the 
votes he needed by raising the stakes a bit: He offered the Republicans a vote 
on the spending amendments they sought, but not the ones that would have 
stiffened penalties for federal crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 When their leaders rejected that proposal, two of the letter's signers -- 
Sens. Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island -- 
switched sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Kassebaum said she was "disappointed that a majority of the 
Republican Party rejected an offer to vote on an additional $5-billion cut in 
social-spending programs. On balance, however, I believe the positive aspects 
of the bill outweigh the negatives." Chafee could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the six Republicans who ultimately voted with the Democrats on the 
procedural vote, three, including Chafee, are up for reelection, and one is 
retiring from the Senate at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The retiring Republican, John C. Danforth of Missouri, said he felt "lousy, 
just lousy" about breaking ranks. But he noted: "What I liked about this 
legislation is what was so casually labeled pork," such as after-school 
programs aimed at keeping young people off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Republicans voting to let the bill proceed were James M. Jeffords of 
Vermont, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. 
They were joined in voting for the bill on final passage by Sen. William S. 
Cohen (R-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 The lone Democrat to side with the majority of Republicans on the procedural 
vote was Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, who is perhaps the most conservative 
Democrat in the Senate. On final passage, Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), an 
ardent foe of the death penalty, also voted against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 One senator, Republican Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, did not participate in the 
final vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) dismissed a 
suggestion that election-year politics accounted for the bill's passage after 
six years of failure. He noted that the years of political struggle had 
produced dramatic changes in the general thrust of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first bill ever, including the original one that I wrote six 
years ago, that actually had included significant commitment to local law 
enforcement, significant commitment to prisons, significant commitment for 
prevention -- a formula every single, solitary criminologist in America has 
agreed with," Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell called the bill "a good, strong, fair, balanced bill," that is "not a 
victory or defeat for any political party or any elected office-holder. This is 
a victory for the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 The section of the bill most harshly criticized by the Republicans would give 
$6.9 billion to crime prevention programs. While the $1.6 billion set aside to 
fight violence against women was widely praised, opponents zeroed in on the 
fact that the same amount would be spent for flexible grants to local 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The "midnight basketball" programs that could be financed under this section 
became a symbol of liberal excess in the bill, but in fact, they have won wide 
support from law enforcement officials as a means of giving potential criminals 
other pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would authorize the death penalty for more than 50 federal 
crimes, including carjacking slayings, drive-by shooting murders and 
large-scale drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault-weapons ban applies both to 19 named types of guns and scores of 
others that are deemed to have similar characteristics. Those already owned 
when the law takes effect would be exempt. Breakdown of Crime Bill Vote 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 61-38 roll call Thursday night by which the Senate voted to pass 
the crime bill. On this vote, a "yes" vote was a vote to pass the bill and a 
"no" vote was a vote to defeat the bill.

FINALLY, ENCOURAGING NEWS IN REAL ESTATE HITS HOME; ECONOMY: MANY MARKET 
INDICATORS SHOW THAT HOUSE PRICES IN THE STATE AND SOUTHLAND MAY HAVE BOTTOMED 
OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Kathleen Young decided earlier this summer to sell her Woodland Hills 
home, she figured she'd be lucky to get the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 She hadn't counted on getting more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been told that a good asking price was $259,000" for the four-bedroom, 
two-bath home, said Young, a property manager. Another agent suggested 
$279,000. Young chose to list the house at the higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, she had three firm offers, and accepted one for $283,000. "We 
were pleasantly surprised," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Young found out, there are signs that the long-awaited turnaround in 
California home prices may have finally arrived. While not all market watchers 
agree that the worst is over, and sharply higher interest rates or an economic 
slowdown could make things worse, the evidence is compelling that prices at 
least have bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price for an existing single-family house in California remains 
above its low in February of $180,978, according to the California Assn. of 
Realtors. The median price fell 1% in July to $185,040, down from June's 
$186,830, according to figures released Thursday by the association. But it had 
increased in three of four months before July. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, foreclosure activity is declining, indicating that financially 
troubled homeowners are getting better prices for their houses and thus are 
less likely to default on their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 And homes that are priced reasonably can draw multiple offers within days, 
including some above the asking price, real estate agents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in hard-hit Southern California, where falling real estate prices have 
been tied to the hemorrhaging of jobs in aerospace and other industries, prices 
seem to have stopped their steep descent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought prices were bottoming in most of the state, and by the end of the 
summer, believe that generally prices will have leveled out," said David 
Hensley, a real estate economist with Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents and economists cite a variety of reasons for the firming of 
housing prices: pent-up demand from first-time home buyers, a rush to buy 
before interest rates shoot back up, relatively good affordability and growing 
confidence that the local economy is on the mend. July's dip in prices 
statewide was attributed to higher mortgage interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to get in before they perceive the prices starting to turn around 
. . . and there's a fear that maybe this is the time to jump in before prices 
do start turning around," said Ava Better, a real estate agent in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Any turnaround would be the best sign yet that the California economy's 
fledgling recovery is continuing. "It means if you buy a house now, you're not 
going to instantly lose money by seeing it lose value," said John Karevoll, 
financial editor at Dataquick Information Systems in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 A rebound also would be a big relief for thousands of homeowners who bought 
their dwellings in the past four years -- only to see their values drop as much 
as a third below what they paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the decline does not mean the beginning of a new boom, however. 
Most economists doubt that prices will grow much faster than the rate of 
inflation, in part because the state's economic growth is still lagging that of 
the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Among further evidence of a turnaround: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles County, the median price of an existing house was unchanged 
in July at $189,400 and still above the low of $184,250 in February, the 
California Assn. of Realtors reported Thursday. In Orange County, the median 
price rose in July to $217,750, comfortably above the trough of $204,740 in 
February, the association reported. In Ventura County, the July median price 
was down 5.7% to $203,820, but still above the low of $199,150 in March. 
</P>
<P>
 * The median price per square foot paid for existing homes in Los Angeles 
County has been hovering around July's $127.42 for about three months, and 
remains above March's low of $124.48, according to Dataquick. (The square-foot 
measure is considered a better barometer of prices than the median price of 
homes sold, which can be affected by the mix of homes in a given month). 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreclosure activity is declining. The number of properties in the state 
that went into foreclosure in July was 8,802, the fewest since November, 1992, 
and down 14.5% from June, Dataquick reported Thursday. Foreclosures peaked at 
12,054 in June of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite higher interest rates, sales compare favorably to last year's 
levels. The California Assn. of Realtors reported Thursday that 453,400 
existing single-family detached homes closed escrow in the state during July, 
on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, down 8.3% from 494,220 homes in 
June. But the July sales pace was 4.6% above the rate in July, 1993, when 
433,580 homes were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that the worst is over. Michael Carney, executive director 
of the independent Real Estate Research Council of Southern California, 
believes home prices will continue to fall at least until the spring of next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are probably pretty close to the bottom of the cycle, but picking the 
actual bottom is tough," he said. Still, he said, "it's my guess that prices 
have at most another 5% to fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is a recovery likely to cover all areas and all kinds of homes. And any 
disruption in the state's nascent recovery -- severe job cuts, a sharp jump in 
mortgage interest rates -- could send housing prices back down in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a stealth recovery," Karevoll said. "It's very hard to track the 
positive indicators. There seems to be kind of a deep sigh going through the 
market, and people are wiping their brows and hoping for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Homes purchased by first-time buyers are holding their prices better than 
move-ups or mansions, real estate agents and economists say. Houses in older, 
middle-class neighborhoods are doing better than those in upscale areas. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Hensley estimates that prices in Los Angeles County have fallen as 
much as 35% from 1990 highs, after adjusting for inflation. That brings them 
back to their 1986 levels -- about the place they started when California's 
runaway real estate inflation began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Real Estate Research Council's index of market prices of existing 
single-family homes shows that prices in Southern California have fallen 15.3% 
overall from their peak in April, 1990. But the differences between regions are 
stark. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices in Southeast Los Angeles County have fallen only 5.8%. But prices in 
the San Fernando Valley have dropped 24.6%, and on the Westside and Santa 
Monica, they are off by 33.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, condominiums seem to be holding their value, in part because 
they did not benefit as much as houses from the rapid increase in prices in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Home buying activity has been encouraging, agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think prices have probably bottomed out, or come close," said Ricki 
Weinberger, a real estate agent with Podley Caughey & Doan in Pasadena. "But it 
depends now on the individual property. Houses in really good neighborhoods 
with good amenities do well. Houses in poorer or marginal areas are still maybe 
going down." 
</P>
<P>
 But a real estate agent in the Hollywood Hills, who handles homes in the 
$425,000 to $450,000 range, said things continue to look bad for him. "The 
sales have gone up, but the prices haven't," said the agent, who asked not to 
be named. "I don't think we've hit bottom yet."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON WILL HAVE LITTLE CHANCE TO SAVOR VICTORY; POLITICS: 
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ANALYZING PAST MISTAKES AS HE FACES A HOST OF CONTINUING 
STRUGGLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Thursday's climactic vote on the crime bill gave President Clinton 
another comeback victory, the win was so narrow and bitter that it leaves open 
the question of whether he gained any significant political leverage for the 
relentless series of other problems he now faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, he has taken to comparing himself to Ahab, locked in a death embrace 
with Moby Dick in the form of an unruly Congress. The beast keeps dragging him 
under, Clinton has complained to associates, and he can barely catch his breath 
before another dive carries him down again. 
</P>
<P>
 He and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a top adviser and leader of the 
campaign for health care reform, will get a brief respite now with the Senate 
leaving town for the Labor Day recess. The Clintons are expected to leave 
Washington shortly for a two-week vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Clintons have spent many hours during the past several weeks reviewing 
with aides and friends the first 20 months of his presidency, wondering aloud 
what corrections to make and how to make the most of his remaining time in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presidency allows little time for introspection. Having surmounted the 
crime bill, Clinton still faces the debilitating Whitewater investigation, a 
full-blown Cuban refugee crisis, the possibility of military action in Haiti, 
the continuing tragedy in the Balkans and the paralyzed health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons acknowledge privately that the President asked too much too soon 
from Congress and the nation. He follows each victory with a fresh fight, with 
no time for "victory laps" of self-congratulation. And he realizes that his 
efforts to "reinvent government," no matter how successful, will be met by a 
public grown cynical about the government's ability to do anything well. 
</P>
<P>
 The President complains that he gets no credit for what he considers his 
signal achievements -- a resurgent economy, substantial reduction in the 
federal budget deficit, conclusion of two major trade agreements, a family 
leave bill, handgun-control legislation and financial aid to support democracy 
in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons acknowledge a significant shortcoming spotted early in the 
Administration by friend and foe alike: too many young aides and inexperienced 
people serving in senior White House positions. They have been bringing in more 
experienced people, including Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, who plans a 
further shake-up that presumably will bring in more seasoned hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has already recruited former California congressman Tony Coelho as his 
top political adviser and longtime Illinois lawmaker and federal judge Abner J. 
Mikva as White House counsel. Both are what younger aides refer to as 
"grown-ups." 
</P>
<P>
 While the President and First Lady freely admit numerous errors in judgment 
and in tactics, they deeply believe that they have been unjustly vilified. They 
complain privately that powerful forces -- from congressional Republicans and 
the so-called religious right to talk-radio hosts -- are intent on destroying 
them personally. They describe the experience to friends as "a surreal 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans, they believe, turned on them with a vengeance after being 
denied the three major issues they had thrived on for years: communism, jobs 
and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "After communism collapsed, the economy rebounded and Clinton took the 
law-and-order issue away from them, the Republicans felt they had no choice but 
to go after the President personally," said a senior Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason for the attacks, Clinton and his senior aides were 
unprepared for the torrent of criticism. It has been difficult for Clinton to 
rise above what he has called the "static" of the media and present to the 
American people what he considers an accurate portrait of himself and his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next several weeks, aides say, Clinton will attempt to define for 
himself and for the country what he stands for. Although he rejects criticism 
that he has not paid enough attention to foreign affairs, he realizes his 
failure to spell out his foreign policy goals has hurt him at home and abroad. 
Aides say he can be expected to address that in major foreign policy speeches 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
 He also will attempt to distance himself from the Democratic leadership in 
Congress, which he believes deserted him in several of the most critical 
moments in his presidency -- particularly the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the ban on assault weapons in the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and First Lady both were irritated that House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) and House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), in 
proposing a concession to get the crime bill passed, urged the Administration 
to drop one of the measure's most popular provisions -- the ban on assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton felt that Foley and Gephardt "took a walk" when they should have been 
pressing for the gun-control measure. It was Clinton and two of his aides, not 
Foley and Gephardt, who worked to get approval of the bill by a Senate-House 
conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has repeatedly noted to associates that he was not elected prime 
minister -- the leader of his party and the head of government -- but President 
-- the head of state and the leader of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides say he is looking for ways to be more presidential, to rise above 
partisan squabbles and to divorce his fate from that of specific pieces of 
legislation. In part, this is a defense against the likelihood that Congress 
will not act on his health care plan this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton now says he wants his presidency to be about ideas, not bills. He has 
expressed those "new Democrat" ideas -- making government work for people, 
renewing a sense of community, fostering personal responsibility -- in 
countless speeches as candidate and President. But he despairs that he has not 
been heard above the din. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, even as he talks about rising above the daily grind of governing, 
Clinton cannot escape himself -- a person willing to talk endlessly and act 
only reluctantly, a policy addict who can get submerged in details, and a 
politician who can charm virtually anyone but is unable, finally, to convince a 
nation of his trustworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is intent on entering the fall political season by speaking less and 
saying more, picking "moments" that define his presidency, an aide said. He 
considers his speech on civil rights, made in Memphis, Tenn., last November, to 
be one of the high points of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 That speech to a group of Baptist ministers -- at the scene of Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr.'s last sermon -- was a heartfelt appeal to end the slaughter in 
American cities that was not about legislation, not about Bill Clinton but 
about a concern that many Americans feel about the direction of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The President can be expected to mount that pulpit again in coming months, 
aides say. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem weighing heavily on Clinton is the continuing character issue 
revolving around the Whitewater controversy and the plethora of conspiracy 
theories it has spawned, as well as Paula Corbin Jones' civil suit alleging 
sexual misconduct. The President is saddled with two sets of very expensive 
defense lawyers -- one for Whitewater and the other for the sexual-harassment 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is convinced that the President and the First Lady lost four 
precious months at the beginning of the year as Congress and the media were 
transfixed by Whitewater questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Those lost months took the steam out of the health care reform drive, the 
President and his advisers believe, a delay that has all but certainly cost 
them action this year on the President's central policy initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Republicans, having lost the crime bill fight, are likely to 
pull out all stops to defeat any health care reform bill acceptable to the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Clintons believed that Senate Republican leaders tried to use the 
crime bill as a weapon against the health care legislation, offering, in 
effect, to let the crime bill pass if Clinton would abandon health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the Senate passed the crime bill, a senior White House aide 
said, "People here feel that Republicans want to use the crime bill to kill 
health care reform. They are committed to assuring that the President doesn't 
have a success."

WILSON HITS CLINTON ON CUBA POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson criticized President Clinton on Thursday for moving quickly 
to stop Cubans from illegally entering Florida while ignoring the much larger 
and costlier problem of illegal immigration in California. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Wilson called on Clinton to beef up the Border Patrol 
and order a blockade in San Diego akin to that used effectively in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is being declared as an emergency in Florida is dwarfed by what is 
occurring here," Wilson told reporters at the UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that when Clinton ordered the Coast Guard and Navy to turn back 
Cubans, the number of people attempting to enter Florida illegally was about 
500 a day. About three times that many enter the United States illegally every 
night near San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the fault of the Border Patrol," he said. "It's the fault of 
Washington, the President, and the Congress, and it's time they cure this 
dereliction of duty." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the Clinton Administration has 
stepped up federal action on California's illegal immigration problems after 
years of inattention by Clinton's predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted increases in the number of Border Patrol officers and said the 
Clinton Administration "has done more than any prior Administration to help 
states cope with the costs of immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, which was faxed a copy of Wilson's three-page statement, had 
no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Boeker, director of the Institute of the Americas, a La Jolla-based think 
tank, said there are some obvious historical reasons Cuban immigration is being 
handled differently than Mexican immigration.  
</P>
<P>
 With Cuba, the United States is trying to topple a Communist dictator; with 
Mexico, the United States is grappling with a difficult social problem along 
the border shared with a friendly, democratic nation, Boeker noted in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. policy (in Florida) is about Fidel Castro, and not about immigration," 
Boeker said. "It is the (result) of a 30-year policy of not supporting in any 
way the Castro regime. We do not want to take his refugees because we want him 
to live with the pressures he's created." 
</P>
<P>
 A border blockade with Mexico as suggested by Wilson, Boeker said, "ignores 
all the historic and humanitarian complexities of two friendly nations with 
intertwined economies." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration promises to be a major issue in Wilson's reelection fight 
with Democratic opponent Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a million people were caught trying to sneak illegally into the United 
States near the San Diego border last year and Wilson contends that the annual 
cost of services to illegal immigrants in California is more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst said Thursday that, "on the issue of 
illegal immigration, Pete Wilson is a fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst criticized Wilson's immigration record in the U.S. Senate, 
including authorship of an amendment making it easier for illegal immigrants to 
stay in this country, and intervention with immigration officials on behalf of 
a hotelier who was under fire for hiring undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign said Brown had distorted his Senate record. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Wilson also said he will declare that a state of emergency exists 
in California because of illegal immigration as soon as the San Diego County 
Board of Supervisors requests such a declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are expected to make that request at a Sept. 20 meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Cuban boats began landing in Florida, Gov. Lawton Chiles declared a 
state of emergency. In ordering the Navy and Coast Guard into action, and 
reversing a policy of welcoming fleeing Cubans, Clinton cited Chiles' 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he is afraid that a border blockade in San Diego might be interpreted 
by the Mexican government as a hostile act, Wilson said, "If it is, that's too 
bad. I've got to tell you something: Our duty is to Americans, our duty is to 
Californians. I make no apologies about that."

U.S. WON'T PRESS ABORTION ON OTHER NATIONS, GORE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The Clinton Administration will not press other countries to adopt 
pro-abortion policies as a means of controlling population growth, Vice 
President Al Gore declared Thursday, hoping to defuse a confrontation between 
the United States and the Roman Catholic Church in advance of an international 
population conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us take a false issue off the table," Gore told reporters. "The U.S. does 
not seek, has not sought, and will not seek any international right to 
abortion. We do not believe that abortion should be a method of family planning 
. . . and we abhor and condemn any coerced abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were in response to the Vatican's criticism of some facets of a 
multinational plan that is being designed to stabilize the world's population 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the restrained clerics of orthodox Islam have raised a voice of protest, 
arguing that many of the conference's frames of reference on family lifestyles, 
women's inheritance rights and abortion run counter to the teachings of the 
Koran. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, still in draft form, is to be debated at the U.N. Conference on 
Population and Development in Cairo next month. Experts estimate that declining 
mortality rates and a high birthrate will push the world's population from the 
current 5.6 billion to 8.5 billion by the year 2025. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the programs in the plan would attempt to slow that growth by 
improving the economic and social status of women, expanding access to birth 
control and family planning advice, increasing literacy and improving health 
care for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Population planners reason that increased levels of literacy and greater 
freedom among women will result in more couples choosing to use contraception 
and limit the size of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 If health care for children is improved, these experts say, parents will 
become more confident about their offspring reaching adulthood and have smaller 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan also treads on more controversial ground by explicitly advocating 
the right of women to "safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of 
fertility regulation of their choice," and including "pregnancy termination" as 
part of the reproductive health services that should be made available to 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican has charged that the draft plan promotes abortion and encourages 
sex outside of marriage by proposing that birth control be made more easily 
available. In an effort to scuttle adoption of the plan, the Vatican has 
dispatched diplomats to several Islamic countries, including Iran and Libya, in 
search of allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, who is chairman of the U.S. delegation to the conference, acknowledged 
that differences in the American and Vatican positions on abortion rights 
probably cannot be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 But he cautioned that "we are in danger of losing the remarkable agreement" if 
the Vatican and its Islamic allies seek to block adoption of the plan because 
of their opposition to abortion under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Appealing to the Vatican's commitment to essential parts of the draft 
agreement, Gore called for conciliation, not confrontation in Cairo. "It is 
essential," he said, "that the partial agreement that may be within reach not 
be thwarted by misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore also denied repeated criticisms that the United States has sought to 
dictate population policies to other countries by making aid conditional on 
acceptance of family planning programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the charge "outrageous," Gore said that the United States strongly 
supports the right of other nations to set their own abortion policies. He 
noted that 173 nations permit abortion under some circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 25 million abortions are performed annually worldwide. In many 
countries where contraceptives are not widely available, woman may undergo the 
procedure seven or eight times.

U.S. MILITARY SCALING BACK MODEST RWANDA AID FORCE; AFRICA: TROOPS REOPENED 
AIRPORT, SET UP WATER SYSTEM. SOME RELIEF GROUPS CALL PROGRAM TOO LITTLE, TOO 
LATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Amid signs of returning normalcy here in the capital, the U.S. military's 
humanitarian task force has begun a gradual, quiet pullout -- just a month 
after President Clinton promised a "massive" American relief effort for this 
small country and its troubled people. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the American commitment has lived up to the President's promise is 
likely to remain a question of debate and perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers and Air Force personnel on the ground here and in Goma, Zaire, 
although modest in number, said they believed that after a rocky beginning, 
their deployment ended up saving lives and putting Rwanda on the road to 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 But some private humanitarian groups, themselves overwhelmed by Rwanda's flood 
tide of refugees, remained critical of how little was devoted to the crisis and 
how slowly the response came from American and other Western military forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a single nation of the world has decided that Rwanda matters," said John 
O'Shea, director of the Irish relief agency GOAL. "It's been like trying to 
keep the tide back with our bare hands." 
</P>
<P>
 "I reject that," said U.S. Army Col. James R. McDonough, commander of the 210 
American troops still on duty Thursday in Kigali. The deployment was down from 
a high of 280 and will steadily decline as more of the Americans' work is 
turned over to the United Nations and Rwandans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we had to do here was stop the dying in Goma," McDonough 
said. "The key to that was water. When we got there, 5,000 people a day were 
dying. When we left, that was down to fewer than 500. Stopping the dying was a 
mission given, and met." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops were ordered into Central Africa to assist in humanitarian efforts 
on July 22, two days after a cease-fire was reached in Rwanda's civil war. The 
first American soldiers arrived the next day to begin establishing water 
purification and transportation systems in Goma, where almost 1 million 
refugees fled. Troops began pumping water on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the operation was turned over to private contractors and Goma-based 
troops pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kigali, the mission of U.S. forces was to bring the capital's war-damaged 
airport back into service. As of Thursday, up to 40 flights a day were arriving 
with food, medicine and other relief supplies. By American count, 20 million 
tons of goods and equipment had passed through the airport since it reopened 
for relief flights. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Goma, the military now is incrementally turning over its airport duties 
as private and U.N. workers can be trained. 
</P>
<P>
 And by all accounts, the airport was operating as smoothly this week as any in 
this part of Africa, if not better -- with a working baggage system, clean 
floors and running water. Commercial flights here are to begin in days. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of Kigali still suffers from lack of power and water -- both of 
which may be a month away, because of damage from the bitter 3 1/2-month civil 
war. But other signs of a rebounding capital were evident this week: Shops and 
restaurants were opening, gasoline was available at service stations and hotels 
were in business, even if some rooms remained ripped apart by shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a crust of normalcy over the place, but if you walk around, suddenly 
your foot falls through into the suppurating mess below. You've got to remember 
that nearly everyone here has lost half of their family," said David Shearer, a 
relief worker with Save the Children. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, the American contribution to Rwanda and its refugees has 
been the subject of some confusion. Although his advisers emphasized that the 
American mission would be limited, Clinton initially promised an aid effort 
that would rival the Kurdish relief operations after the Persian Gulf War. On 
July 30, the President said, "The United States must not cease its efforts 
until the dying stops and the refugees have returned." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the midst of a cholera epidemic that was killing hundreds by the hour, 
the American effort had put only 75 people on the ground in Goma, far fewer 
than private relief agencies that had little of the U.S. military's logistic 
capability. And a U.S. emergency airlift of supplies turned out smaller than 
promised and included needless items, such as mittens. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of July, Defense Secretary William J. Perry traveled to the region 
and said the American deployment could last a year or longer. But a week later, 
Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived and 
began to talk of turning the military duties over to contractors and pulling 
out. "Shorter rather than longer," was how he described the U.S. commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Americans are in a measured retreat but with no final departure date 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we leave, we don't want anyone to notice," said Army spokesman Capt. 
Ryan Yantis. "That doesn't mean we are sneaking out, only that we want a 
systematic, logical and sequential transition." 
</P>
<P>
 In one regard, the Americans can congratulate themselves for avoiding, so far, 
the violence that overtook U.S. relief efforts in Somalia. "No one has been 
hurt. No one has been seriously ill, no serious disease. There have been no 
incidents with weapons, no one stepped on a mine, no traffic accidents and no 
fights with locals," said McDonough.

COLUMN ONE; VANISHING VACATIONS IN E. EUROPE; UNDER COMMUNISM, NEARLY EVERYONE

LEAVING MANY WORKERS FEELING CHEATED.

<P>
 Tadeusz Durzynski has a bad case of vacation blues, even though he is one of 
the lucky ones not marooned at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Durzynski is spending two weeks with his family at this woodsy resort in 
central Poland, just as he has every August for the past 15 years. The problem 
is that none of his friends are here, and the no-frills holiday is setting him 
back nearly two months' pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is capitalism," the bushy-browed tractor mechanic moaned during a stroll 
through a cluster of deserted cabins. "This used to be like one big family. We 
knew everyone. Now, no one has the money to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Summer vacations, once as customary for workers in Eastern Europe as the 
annual May Day parade, have become an anachronism for people of everyday means 
under the new -- and abruptly less obliging -- rules of the free market. 
</P>
<P>
 As with almost everything in the former Soviet Bloc, it is the rich or lucky 
who can afford vacations, and the pinched proletariat, finally free to travel 
the world, is feeling angry and cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone thought it would be better and easier when we were given democracy," 
said Edward Nowakowski, who works at the same tractor factory as Durzynski and 
has not gone away on vacation in four years. "I don't know when I'll be able to 
get away again." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three-quarters of Poles say they are leaving home for less than a week 
this summer, surveys show, and many of those fortunate enough to get away are 
staying with friends and relatives because of tight budgets. In contrast, about 
half of Poles in the late 1980s took a vacation of more than a week, and most 
of those who stayed home did not blame their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism and government officials say the situation is comparable throughout 
the former Soviet Bloc, including in Russia, where widely publicized accounts 
of Russians sunning on Italian beaches and dining in French cafes tell only a 
fraction of the story. The exception is the prosperous Czech Republic, where 
one official estimated that 80% of people still can afford a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is just not there anymore," said a spokesman for Balkan Holidays, 
the national tourist agency in Bulgaria, where private vacationers at popular 
Black Sea resorts pay 10 to 15 times more than they did under socialism. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjustment has been agonizing, particularly for families with young 
children, since nearly everyone under socialism was allowed a summer holiday -- 
a long one, at virtually no charge -- courtesy of behemoth state enterprises. 
The companies, which often also provided schools and other social services, 
owned hundreds of holiday centers from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, and 
workers were assigned a time and place to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 Children had it especially good: They joined their parents on the official 
family holiday in addition to escaping for several weeks to subsidized summer 
camps. About 450 children used to attend camps sponsored by the Zakady Azotowe 
fertilizer company in southwest Poland, but this year only 10 families could 
afford the expense, even though the company covered half the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have only one child, and both her parents work, so we can afford to send 
her," said Grazyna Sokalska, who volunteers as a chaperon at a camp for 
teen-age dancers near Warsaw. "But fewer and fewer parents are able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Communist Party officials and other privileged groups, including writers and 
artists, also had exclusive getaways, some of them prewar mansions and summer 
villas seized by authorities from private owners. The Polish government alone 
operated more than 450 such centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a majority of East Europeans working for private companies with no 
tradition of holiday giveaways or for state-owned enterprises teetering on the 
brink of insolvency, the free ride is over for vacationers of limited means. In 
Russia, the cost of flights between Moscow and once-jammed Crimean vacation 
resorts is $200, more than most Russians make in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the typical two-week vacation, you now have to pay what the average 
person earns in two months," said Ilie Ivan, a Romanian government official. 
"That is a substantial amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the most popular vacation resorts have been handed over to private 
operators, who have jacked up prices and opened doors to anyone who can pay top 
dollar -- usually Germans and the richest East Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Druzba health spa in Bulgaria, once the exclusive playground of top East 
Bloc Communists, is so popular with foreigners that it is booked through the 
end of November. The story is the same at resorts in Hungary, Poland, Romania 
and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that can be said for the Communists is that they reserved the best 
things for themselves," said Edyta Mazur of the Hungarian travel agency Ibusz. 
"But there is now a free market in tourism, and at the good centers you will 
meet more foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
 In the secluded Mazurian lake district in northern Poland, the Lansk holiday 
center was for years a clandestine hideaway for the highest Communist Party 
officials from across the former Soviet Bloc. The center's guest list used to 
read like a Who's Who of communism, including such names as Nikita S. 
Khrushchev, Leonid I. Brezhnev, Erich Honecker and Fidel Castro. The 750-acre 
lakefront resort was too secret to appear on maps. Guests found their way by 
following the occasional cryptic road sign. Today the center is one of the most 
popular resorts still owned by the Polish government, but at $25 a night per 
person it is so unaffordable that only the richest East Europeans can visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of people from foreign embassies and businesses," said director 
Slawomir Kociszewski, who still posts a Polish soldier at the unmarked front 
gate and a Secret Service officer at the indoor swimming pool and weight room. 
"There is no other place like this." 
</P>
<P>
 At a three-bedroom lakeside cottage not far from the main lodge, Krysztof 
Farecki and his family were settled in for a two-week August holiday. It was 
their second visit to the resort in a year, and the family typified the 
privileged few in the widening leisure gap across Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Two late-model foreign cars and several shiny dirt bikes were parked outside. 
Asked how much the holiday cost, Farecki and his wife, Grazyna, began 
calculating the bill for the first time, unable in the end to come up with a 
definitive tally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would certainly recommend it to my friends," Grazyna Farecki said, adding 
as an almost embarrassed afterthought: "If they can afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Krysztof Farecki owns a fishing equipment business in Warsaw, has more than 
100 employees and displays little patience with those who complain that they've 
been shortchanged by capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of my employees go on vacation," said Farecki, his beefy arms tanned from 
fishing in the afternoon sun. "They work hard all year long, so they deserve a 
nice vacation. I don't have time for people who reminisce about the old times. 
You have to make yourself successful." 
</P>
<P>
 On a nearby trail cutting through a thick grove of birch and evergreen trees, 
Malgorzata Berndt walked her year-old daughter in a stroller. It was her sixth 
stay at Lansk in 18 months, and the highlight of this trip was running into 
former Polish Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. Berndt says she makes a custom of 
asking the staff "who important is among us today." 
</P>
<P>
 Berndt earns $250 a month, the average Polish salary, as a gynecologist at a 
Warsaw hospital, and she knows she could never afford such a vacation if her 
husband were not a private -- and hugely successful -- car dealer. Many of her 
colleagues, she said, have trouble saving even for bare-bones holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them send their children, and they stay behind," Berndt said. 
"Everything is so very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even with dramatically higher prices and a small but entrenched class of 
wealthy wanderers, the precipitous drop in vacationing among East Europeans has 
pushed many former state-run holiday centers toward bankruptcy. Upscale centers 
rarely charge enough to cover their costs, and some low-end resorts, having 
lost their captive audience, are desperate for visitors. The most hopeless ones 
have been turned over to local authorities for public housing or recreation, 
while others have been abandoned and boarded shut. 
</P>
<P>
 The working-class centers have no running water or toilets in rooms and 
cabins, little money to keep up deteriorating buildings, and no drawing card 
for affluent travelers, who can simply go abroad to satisfy their developing 
taste for luxury accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very mobile now," said Anna Mazurkiewicz of Cedok, the state-run 
Czech travel agency. "They go elsewhere, to Italy and Greece." 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to compete for a shrinking pool of vacationers, the new owners of the 
East European holiday centers are forever concocting gimmicks. Newspaper ads 
for former Communist Party resorts boast about their onetime exclusivity in 
hopes of attracting curiosity seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 One center offers a room where Castro once slept, while another rents the 
quarters where Polish President Lech Walesa supposedly stayed during his 
internment under martial law. (In fact, the room is down the hall from Walesa's 
room, which had to be closed because the parquet floor buckled and repairs were 
too costly.) 
</P>
<P>
 The 150-acre Intershow Park here in Popowo, for years an overcrowded company 
resort for workers at the Ursus tractor plant, cannot even afford to pay its 
electricity bill. Because of its proximity to Warsaw, Intershow's new private 
operators offer specials to attract weekend visitors to its large swimming pool 
and recreation facilities, but it is still a struggle to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely lost in the bumpy transition toward the bottom line have been the 
employees of the former state-run enterprises -- the people for whom the 
getaways were originally intended. In the old days, most workers took advantage 
of the centers, or traveled -- sometimes to other socialist countries -- on 
company-sponsored holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Under socialism, about three-quarters of summer holidays in Poland were 
arranged by companies or employee associations; today the number is one in six. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers still get time off, so they are learning to make do with recreation 
close to home. Cities and schools are trying to fill the void by sponsoring 
everything from carnivals to computer classes. Gardening has surged in 
popularity, as have family gatherings, home repairs and day trips to the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like when the price of vodka suddenly goes up, there is a shock at first 
but people adjust to it," said Mieczyslaw Zawadzki of the Tourist Institute, a 
Warsaw organization that tracks vacation trends. "For health and psychological 
reasons, people have a need to get away, so they are finding ways to do things 
with less money." 
</P>
<P>
 As wages increase and East European economies grow healthier, Zawadzki said, 
workers will be happier and more productive because they will be free to choose 
how to spend their holiday rather than follow the dictates of their employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Durzynski, the Polish tractor mechanic, says that since Intershow has been 
privately managed he rarely runs into a familiar face from the Ursus factory, a 
situation confirmed by company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in fortunes has left many East Europeans disillusioned, but on the 
Ursus assembly line one warm August afternoon, several workers active in the 
local Solidarity union were taking the changes in stride. In the 1980s, they 
said, they seldom took vacations anyway because the company not-so-mysteriously 
left them off the list of assigned holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems, they said, that only good Communists -- or at least those who didn't 
raise a fuss -- got rewarded with time off. Now the rewards go to good -- or at 
least well-off -- capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really isn't much difference for us," said Tadeusz Krogulec, a 24-year 
employee and shop foreman. "Before we couldn't go. Now we can't afford to go."

 DEJA VU: Northridge's march to Saturday's World Series title game (A1, C1) 
brings back a lot of memories for David Sehnem, a 44-year-old Canoga Park 
realtor. Sehnem was the winning pitcher the last time a Valley team -- Granada 
Hills -- won the series in 1963. . . . He'll watch the game with a few 
ex-teammates. "Like most 12-year-olds, I felt like I was in a fog," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 BOOK IT: There's more good news in Northridge. Today, CSUN celebrates the 
renovation of Oviatt Library, which will reopen Monday for the fall semester 
(B1). . . . It may be the most important symbol yet of the school's rebound 
from the January quake. "Without a library you are not a university," says 
faculty president Nancy Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR: What do World Class Wrestling and high-speed lawn-mower racing have in 
common? Not much, really. But both are part of the 56th annual Antelope Valley 
Fair (B9, Valley Life! Page 8), which starts today at the fairgrounds (above) 
in Lancaster. . . . Over the years, the fair has drawn talent like Johnny Cash 
and Kenny Rogers. This year, Randy Travis and Clint Black will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME SWEET HOME: The only home Paula Harrington cares about these days is her 
own. She's the Val Verde realtor who was kidnaped and assaulted a few months 
ago. The memories are too painful for her at work, so she's taking some time 
off (B1). . . . To show thanks for the dozens who searched for her after she 
disappeared, she'll host a party Oct. 1 in Val Verde. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MARKET: More Valley residents are taking stock in themselves -- they've 
joined investment clubs. No great amounts of cash hang in the balance, but 
they're not just fooling around, either. . . . One all-woman club, the Magnolia 
Investment Group, meets monthly to play the market. "I really like the idea of 
a bunch of women getting together to do something serious," said member Terry 
Snyder. See Valley Life! Page 10. Michael Arkush

'COPYCAT' GUN BAN SURVIVES CRITICAL VOTE; FIREARMS: ASSEMBLY PANEL AGREES TO 
TOUGHEN CURRENT ASSAULT WEAPONS LAW BY PROHIBITING NEAR-REPLICAS FROM BEING 
MADE OR SOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A bill to broaden California's assault weapons ban survived a critical test 
Thursday when it passed an Assembly committee by the narrowest of margins after 
a flurry of last-minute lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill (SB 46X), by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), would plug 
loopholes in the existing ban by adding a generic description of the 
military-style rapid-fire weapons to the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the law lists banished firearms by name, allowing manufacturers and 
sellers of the guns to legally market "copycat" weapons under different names 
or slightly altered designs. 
</P>
<P>
 National Rifle Assn. lobbyists, joined by other gun group representatives, 
pressed members of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee to defeat the bill. 
They argued that it would only create headaches for law-abiding citizens who 
keep the high-powered weapons for sport or protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But a survivor of last year's high-rise massacre in San Francisco weighed in 
with an emotional plea for legislators to outlaw the type of copycat gun that 
left her wounded and eight others -- including her husband -- dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a matter of minutes, I had been shot and my husband had been killed," said 
attorney Michelle Scully, noting that if an effective ban is in place, 
"hopefully . . . (assailants) won't be able to kill as many people at one time 
as this gentleman was able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The gun that disgruntled Woodland Hills mortgage broker Gian Luigi Ferri toted 
into Scully's legal offices July 1, 1993, was a TEC DC9, a near-replica of the 
TEC 9, banned in California since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In urging passage of his bill, Roberti -- who fought off a recall attempt by 
gun groups in April -- cited the San Francisco case and the shooting death 
earlier this year of Los Angeles Police Officer Christy Hamilton as "two of the 
most flagrant examples" in which killers used copycat assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 After both sides made their cases, several legislators withheld their votes 
while they were being courted by the bill's supporters and opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's camp focused on wooing Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), with 
Scully slipping her a personal note to ask for a yes vote on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told her the language in this bill was just a way to clean up and 
tighten what we already have," Scully said afterward. "And that it would go a 
long way toward saving lives and toward saving other people the grief and 
sorrow that I've been going through the last year." 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic break with her self-described "100% 2nd Amendment vote," Allen 
split with fellow Republicans on the committee and provided the swing vote 
needed to send the bill to the Assembly floor. The bill passed 12 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said she was less swayed by Scully's appeal than by a falling out she 
had with firearms rights groups over one of her own bills. She said gun 
lobbyists tried to sabotage her bill to ensure a 1,000-foot "gun-free zone" 
around schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was treated in a poor manner by these people whose position I've always 
supported," Allen said. "Intimidation and bullying does not make it with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The full Assembly will take up the bill, which has already passed the Senate, 
next week.

PRESSING THEIR CASE; WHAT WOMEN CAN WEAR IS THE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight Democratic assemblywomen, most wearing slacks or pantsuits, marched from 
the Assembly chamber to the Senate on Thursday to dramatize their support for a 
bill to assure the right of California women to wear pants in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill (AB 3672) was defeated twice this week in the Senate after being 
approved in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 They immediately picked up the support of Senate President Pro Tem Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward) and Assembly Speaker Willie  
</P>
<P>
 Brown (D-San Francisco), who promised to use their considerable influence to 
enact such a law. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would make it illegal for an employer to prohibit a woman from 
wearing pants on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) and members of the legislative Women's 
Caucus demanded that the bill be resurrected and selected today, Women's 
Equality Day, as the day for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson told reporters, "The issue is bigger than just wearing pants. It goes 
to our basic right to choose and not be discriminated against because of our 
sex." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's author, Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park), said she 
introduced the measure at the request of a woman who wrote a letter complaining 
that "her employer ordered her to go home because she was wearing pants in the 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said she researched the law and found that there was nothing stopping 
an employer from requiring women to wear dresses and skirts at work. She said 
she introduced the bill believing that it would be "a simple little thing that 
would just go sliding through. I thought it was a slam-dunk." 
</P>
<P>
 It cleared the Assembly and got through two Senate committees before 
encountering resistance in the full Senate, including opposition from three of 
five women senators. It was also opposed by the California Manufacturers Assn. 
and General Telephone and Electric. They said it would impinge on their rights 
to set dress standards. 
</P>
<P>
 It first failed on a 19-16 vote against the bill Monday, five short of the 21 
required for passage. Watson tried again for passage Wednesday, but failed for 
lack of one favorable vote, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen Democrats and one Republican, Sen. Tom Campbell of Stanford, voted 
for the bill; 14 Republicans and two independents voted against it; four other 
members did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and 
Lucy Killea (I-San Diego) voted against the bill. Bergeson and Wright said 
Thursday that they believed the bill unnecessarily interfered with an 
employer's right to establish proper dress standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Killea said she considered the whole matter a non-issue. "The bill trivializes 
what we (women) are doing and the successes we are having," she said. "This is 
the kind of thing we had to do in the 1970s. It isn't a great societal 
problem."

2 GUILTY OF KILLING TEEN-AGER AT BEACH; COURTS: DEFENDANTS WERE IN A MOB THAT 
HURLED OBJECTS AT THE YOUTH AND HIS FRIENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two youths were convicted of second-degree murder and nine other felonies 
Thursday for a mob attack at an Orange County beach last year that resulted in 
the death of a teen-ager after a paint roller rod pierced his skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors could not prove that Hector Penuelas, 17, and Julio Perez Bonilla, 
18, hurled the paint roller that fatally wounded a San Clemente High School 
senior. But Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey said the young men are as 
guilty as the killer because they joined their friends in throwing pipes, 
bottles, wood chunks and other objects at the victim and his friends.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Woods, 17, died 25 days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack sent shock waves through San Clemente, where outraged residents 
demanded tough treatment for the defendants and held rallies and protests to 
complain about crime and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy also exposed racial divisions in the beachside neighborhoods. A 
group of Latino activists complained that race was behind the murder charges 
and that the killing was being used to unfairly stereotype Latinos as gang 
members and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Kathy Woods, the mother of the slain youth, said she was pleased 
with the verdicts and wants the defendants sent to prison for as long as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for the parents (of the defendants), but their sons are alive," 
she said. "I feel my son lost at least 60 years of his life. I would like to 
see at least 20 of theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Arturo Montez of the League of United Latin America Citizens decried the 
judge's decision, saying the Latino defendants were being punished too harshly 
for the death of Woods, who was white. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is how quickly the court system moves to incarcerate Latinos," 
Montez said. "I think the whole court system is one-sided and lopsided. Justice 
is definitely colored behind the Orange Curtain." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 15 attack was sparked when Bonilla, a gang member, and a friend 
pushed and punched one of Woods' friends. Later, when Woods and his friends 
tried to flee the parking lot at Calafia Beach County Park in San Clemente, 
their cars were pelted with pipes and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was riding in the passenger seat when a paint roller rod crashed through 
the window and lodged in his skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla and Penuelas -- two of six defendants charged in Woods' killing -- 
said they acted in self-defense because they believed that Woods and his 
friends were driving toward them and planning an attack in revenge for the 
earlier fight. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said the defendants provoked the attack and noted that the 
victims had no choice but to drive past the defendants -- who were congregated 
near the park's only exit. 
</P>
<P>
 During the non-jury trial, defense attorneys for Penuelas and Bonilla asked 
Dickey to convict their clients of involuntary manslaughter, arguing that the 
killing was a freak accident and their clients never intended to hurt anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey set sentencing for Jan. 13. The defendants were juveniles at the time 
of the attack, but were tried as adults because of the serious nature of the 
charges. They each face a minimum sentence of 15 years to life in prison, but 
the judge also has the discretion to sentence them as juveniles to the 
California Youth Authority, where they could be released when they turn 25. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant, Arturo Villalobos, 19, pleaded guilty Jan. 11 to voluntary 
manslaughter and gang involvement charges. He faces up to 14 years in prison 
when he is sentenced Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The three remaining defendants are Rogelio Solis, 18; Juan Enriquez Alcocer, 
20, and Saul Penuelas, 18, Hector Penuelas' older brother. All are charged with 
murder and being gang members or associates.

U.S. ORDERS STATE STUDENT AID AGENCY TO REPAY $62 MILLION; FINANCE: FIRING OF 
TOP MANAGERS IS DEMANDED BY FEDERAL OFFICIALS, WHO SAY 21,427 DEFAULTED LOANS 
WERE MISHANDLED. COMMISSION ADMITS TO SOME PROBLEMS BUT SAYS LESS THAN $1 
MILLION IS OWED. 
</P>

<P>
 Federal education officials have demanded that the California Student Aid 
Commission repay $62.6 million worth of defaulted student loans and fire its 
top administrators because of "unprecedented" snafus in how it handled student 
accounts during the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter the commission received Aug. 19, the U.S. Department of Education 
demanded refund of the loans plus interest after concluding that the obscure 
California agency, which guarantees billions of dollars in student debt, 
mishandled 21,427 bad loans because of computer problems or unwillingness to 
repay lenders during the state's 1992 budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has also taken the unusual step of ordering the 15-member 
commission to reinvent itself by junking its $14-million computer system and 
replacing Executive Director Sam Kipp III and his top managers. Federal 
officials also want unusual power to name the agency's new management team. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission refuses to go along, the federal government "will have no 
choice but to terminate" its relationship with the agency and find someone else 
through which to operate the guaranteed federal student loan program in 
California, which accounts for about 10% of all the loans given out, said David 
A. Longanecker, assistant U.S. secretary for post-secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) may render all of 
that moot. An aide to the powerful legislative leader said Brown called Kipp 
into his office Tuesday and said he was "looking seriously at abolishing the 
commission because of the $62-million fine that's been imposed by the federal 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 The aide, who asked not to be identified, said legislative amendments to 
eliminate the commission are being drafted by Brown's staff and "very likely" 
could be passed by the time the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they acknowledge that there have been problems processing student 
loans, commission members say they owe the U.S. Department of Education less 
than $1 million and they called a closed-door meeting for Sept. 2 to discuss 
the possibility of suing the federal government, said commission Chairman Mike 
Carona. 
</P>
<P>
 Carona said he and another commission member met in Dallas on Aug. 8 with 
federal education officials to iron out an agreement for repayment and 
restructuring the agency. But there was no agreement because a "major sticking 
point was that the Department of Education wanted to run the Student Aid 
Commission by telling us who we could hire and who we could fire," he said. 
"It's a states rights issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission serves as guarantor for the federal student loans, which are 
made directly to students by private institutions but are turned over to the 
agency if there is a default. The agency, which is responsible for the 
bookkeeping, steps in to pay off the bank and then requests reimbursement from 
the federal government. Last year, it handled 451,000 loans worth $1.7 billion, 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission must report defaults within 90 days, but the federal government 
said it missed that deadline and failed to repay lenders on time for more than 
21,400 loans between 1990 and 1993 -- a transgression that made the loans 
ineligible for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, federal officials say, the commission missed the deadlines 
because of the state's 1992 fiscal crisis, during which California was without 
a budget for 63 days and most workers had to be paid with warrants. But because 
the reimbursements required federal -- not state -- money, there was no excuse 
for the delay, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, the agency's conversion to the computer system, done mainly in 
1993, was blamed for massive foul-ups in tracking the loans. Longanecker also 
said his office found that the agency, which is supposed to act as a check on 
lenders, allowed "lenders to go in and override their system at will. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to have that kind of relationship with my bank," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carona said the commission itself informed the Department of Education about 
the problems with the computer system, called the Financial Aid Processing 
System. In June, the commission received an internal audit recommending that 
the agency replace the system because it was "muddled, convoluted and . . . 
archaic." 
</P>
<P>
 Carona also said the agency was prevented by the budget crisis from repaying 
on defaulted loans because all federal funds are routed through the state 
general fund, which was frozen during the 63 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carona said the agency has enough in its reserves to pay for the 
$62-million fine, it is only one of several potential liabilities. State and 
federal officials are conducting unrelated audits that could bring the total to 
more than $200 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longanecker said the $62-million dispute would not imperil loans for students, 
but one financial aid counselor said the issue has colleges and lenders "in 
turmoil" because of the uncertainty, especially at the peak of the season as 
students come back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest sources of anxiety . . . is not knowing how it may affect 
the program," said Patricia Hurly, president of the California Community 
College Financial Aid Assn. "Until that information is available, we're all 
making big guesses."

SCIENTIST AIRS PLAN TO 'DUST' U.S. BORDER; IMMIGRATION: PROPOSAL TO USE 
FLUORESCENT MATERIAL TO HELP DETECT ILLEGAL CROSSERS DRAWS CRITICISM FROM 
ADVOCATES. INS REACTS CAUTIOUSLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a proposal likely to add to the angry debate about illegal immigration in 
California, a well-known scientist is calling for the U.S. Border Patrol to 
sprinkle fluorescent dust at the U.S.-Mexico border in order to detect and 
track down illegal border-crossers. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-cost, low-tech plan would improve border enforcement dramatically and 
pose no danger to people "tagged" by the glowing dust, according to an article 
in today's edition of Science magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the somewhat surreal, politically charged image of the U.S. government 
exposing illegal immigrants to chemicals and then tracking them down with 
lasers and ultraviolet lights provoked criticism from immigrants' advocates 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible," said activist Roberto Martinez of the American Friends 
Service Committee in San Diego. "It's like something out of 'The Twilight 
Zone.' The symbolism is that these are not humans, that these are insects to be 
sprayed." 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials reacted cautiously to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McDonald, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 
Washington, said he was aware of the article but knows of no such plans or 
studies conducted by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's obvious concerns that would have to be looked at: toxicity, impact on 
the environment," McDonald said. "While we would look at all possibilities to 
enhance our enforcement operations, we look at them all in the perspective of 
the impact on people, the environment and the community. It's nothing we would 
take lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The author of the article is Bill Wattenburg -- a respected physicist, 
inventor and radio talk show host based at Cal State Chico. Wattenburg said 
Thursday that he and the editors of Science magazine know full well that they 
are advancing a provocative idea at a sensitive time. Proposition 187, a ballot 
measure proposing tough immigration enforcement measures, has intensified the 
controversy over the issue statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said, authorities have a responsibility to consider technology 
that is feasible. And Wattenburg rejected charges that it would be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at what they are doing now: you have to chase people with helicopters 
and dogs, use chain-link fences," Wattenburg said. "What's the difference if 
you mark them with something that's harmless? . . . There is an enormous range 
of commonly used, nontoxic, biodegradable substances." 
</P>
<P>
 Such fluorescent chemicals have been utilized for identifying currency to 
guard against theft and marking the hands of voters in the recent South African 
elections as well as patrons in nightclubs, Wattenburg said. Some of the 
materials are also present in medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the operation -- which Wattenburg calls "fluorescent tagging of 
infiltrators" -- tractors or hand-propelled dispensers would lay down bands of 
invisible material in highly traversed crossing zones at the border, where 
passing vehicles and people would pick up the particles. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents in planes and vehicles could then track down illegal crossers and 
identify them with lasers or ultraviolet lights that make the particles glow, 
according to the article. The chemical could be prepared to last for hours or 
for days, although Wattenburg said the intent would be to detect illegal 
immigrants close to the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't suggest you go scour cities with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol, which has long suffered from lack of funds and technology, 
uses an array of infrared night scopes, closed-circuit cameras and motion 
sensors. But Wattenburg said his plan could double the agency's effectiveness. 
He said he is prepared to conduct a six-month, $500,000 experiment in San 
Diego, where agents make almost half of the million-plus arrests border-wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo De La Vina, chief agent of the San Diego sector, said such a decision 
would have to be made at the highest levels of his agency. "We try to keep an 
open mind, but there are a lot of sensitivities involved, especially when we 
are dealing with people who are not involved in criminal activity" other than 
illegal crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 The origins of the proposal only emphasize what Wattenburg readily describes 
as its "politically explosive" content. It is based on experiments Wattenburg 
had done to devise methods for detecting enemy guerrilla fighters in Vietnam 
and, more recently, in Somalia. And it has drawn timid reactions from 
politicians and government officials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The INS is being given no help by politicians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wattenburg has grown used to the public spotlight, cultivating an image as a 
thoughtful maverick whose inventions have been heeded by the government on 
several occasions. His advice played a role in the Pentagon's decision last 
year to change the way it air-dropped supplies into war-torn Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is stepping into treacherous turf with his border enforcement plan. 
Even if the technology proves harmless, critics say, the concept would spark 
fierce opposition on both sides of the international line. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said the proposal contributes symbolically to an increasingly harsh 
and dehumanizing view of immigrants. He cited a recent statement by Rep. Randy 
Cunningham (R-San Diego), who said illegal border-crossing was "like locusts 
coming across down there." And Martinez said advocate groups would fight tooth 
and nail to stop implementation of fluorescent dusting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would stop it at the proposal stage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, a spokesman for the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform said he would like to know more about the potentially 
powerful enforcement tool. But he said its scope sounds limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly it's not going to solve the problem all by itself," said Ira 
Mehlman of FAIR. "We are interested in more comprehensive measures, such as a 
national Social Security card. Still the best way is to discourage people from 
what they want, which is a job."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER: MEET THE KINDER, GENTLER SENATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early this month, when the Whitewater hearings shifted over to the Senate, 
things had nowhere to go but up. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Banking Committee's performance was roundly criticized as a partisan 
charade. With members strictly limited to five minutes at the microphone, 
Democrats lobbed home-run pitches to White House aides while Republicans sought 
quick attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Banking Committee, however, showed some backbone. Democrats, along 
with Republicans, were angry at the cozy ties between White House and Treasury 
officials and let it show. 
</P>
<P>
 One notable exception was Sen. Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat, who had 
a kinder view. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, the White House-Treasury contacts stem from an all-too-human 
desire to ensure that something that happened eight years ago not interfere 
with the urgent tasks of governing. No one of us is perfect, and I hope these 
hearings will help all of us to do a better job for the American people," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer's sympathetic attitude stood out against the roughhouse manner of many 
of her colleagues, and her remarks cropped up in news articles and 
commentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Republic, the liberal weekly magazine, found Boxer to be "just plain 
pretentious" when she lectured the committee on the horrors of depression. This 
was in connection with the suicide of Vince Foster, the White House lawyer 
whose self-inflicted death continues to fascinate conservative conspiracy 
theorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lessons to be learned from the Foster suicide," Boxer said. "The 
first is that every person needs to be alert to the signs of depression in 
family, friends and colleagues and to recognize that depression is a real 
illness and requires professional help." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times, in a list of "drolleries" culled from the Whitewater 
hearings, also tweaked Boxer for "finding a silver lining in the suicide of 
Vincent W. Foster Jr." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer landed hard on Treasury counsel Jean E. Hanson ("incompetent") for 
failing to correct erroneous testimony by her boss, Deputy Treasury Secretary 
Roger C. Altman, and both have since resigned their posts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Boxer's remarks to 28-year-old Joshua Steiner, the boyish Treasury 
Department chief of staff with the incendiary diary, that piqued the most 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner, whose assiduously collected meditations and remembrances ("the last 
Washington diary -- ever," the New Republic wryly predicted) provoked some of 
the hearing's most barbed questioning, disavowed virtually everything he had 
written. These weren't factual observations, he rationalized to the senators, 
but only impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato blasted Steiner's recantation as 
"lamebrained," and Alabama Democratic Sen. Richard C. Shelby said, "You've got 
a convenient memory, but the diaries speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer ("senator and mother," the Washington Post dubbed her in an op-ed piece) 
came to Steiner's rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 To her, Steiner was reminiscent "of two people I have great respect for . . . 
my son and daughter. I look at you and I see the exuberance of youth, the 
exaggeration of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these phrases in (the diary) are quite dramatic," Boxer said. " 
'Powerless. Fateful. Disaster unfolds. Tortured day.' Did anyone sit there and 
torture you, pull your fingernails out? Of course not. You're just using 
language here to indicate your feelings about it. And I respect the fact that 
you have a lot of feelings, because you're not old like we are, and you're not 
numb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you're young doesn't mean your opinion doesn't count," she 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer's spirited defense of the Bambi-like Steiner no doubt tightened some 
neck muscles of some of her male colleagues and left her open to criticism that 
she was acting as an apologist for the Administration. (She is, after all, 
related to the First Family. In May, her daughter, Nicole, married Anthony 
Rodham, the younger brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton.) 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just so . . . squishy," lamented an aide to a veteran Republican 
committee member. "All that talk about feelings. " 
</P>
<P>
 To some Capitol Hill observers who came to know Boxer as the fiery liberal 
House member from Marin County, her senatorial incarnation seems pallid by 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer has no regrets about her performance at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was criticized for being too harsh on (Hanson) and too easy on (Steiner)," 
Boxer explained this week. "But I am what I am. I did think that, in general, 
the witnesses were really harangued. 
</P>
<P>
 "No laws were broken, no rules were violated. But I believe mistakes were made 
throughout this whole matter. If you're asking, 'Were you fair?' I called it 
the way I saw it."

IRREGULARITIES UNLIKELY TO AFFECT MEXICAN VOTE; ELECTION: GOVERNMENT CITES 
FLAWS AT 11% OF POLLING PLACES. OBSERVERS NOTE URBAN-RURAL POLITICAL GAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Electoral monitors continued to enumerate voting irregularities Thursday, 
although virtually no one here -- except opposition party activists -- said 
they believe the problems were serious enough to substantially change the 
outcome of Sunday's federal election. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the issues surfacing was the government's recognition that flaws in 11% 
of the 96,415 polling places were serious enough that those votes will not be 
included in the preliminary tally, which shows the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) sweeping the election. 
</P>
<P>
 And election monitors noted difficulties in the voting Sunday that illustrate 
some of the major challenges of democratizing a country that has been governed 
for six decades by a single political party. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, despite massive publicity about election procedures, many 
Mexicans, particularly in rural areas, did not know how to mark their ballots 
-- nor did they realize they had the right to make their choices in secret. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasted sharply with the growing political awareness in cities, 
creating a split in the Mexican electorate as deep as the more obvious economic 
gap between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The modern concept of a democratic culture, in which one may choose freely 
between political parties, has not penetrated as much into rural areas as it 
has in urban centers," said Rodolfo Stavenhagen, a noted Mexican anthropologist 
and human rights activist. "But behind that is a whole system of violent 
repression and class bias." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, city dwellers have grown increasingly more involved in 
civic groups and neighborhood organizations fighting for change. The 
government, especially in the capital, has tolerated peaceful sit-ins and 
marches. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the countryside, peasant leaders are still regularly assassinated and 
protests are repressed violently. And the countryside is where the PRI 
consistently wins the most votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the contrast that observers saw on election day," Stavenhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medea Benjamin, a coordinator for Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based group 
that organized travel plans for more than 100 foreign poll watchers, observed: 
"There was a huge difference between the rural and urban areas. The cities were 
well monitored by educated, Mexican observers. In the countryside, there were 
often no observers except us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City polling places, walls were hung with colorful posters that 
showed the steps in voting, from checking credentials against registration 
lists to stamping voters' thumbs with indelible ink to prevent repeat 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously well-trained precinct officers explained procedures to each voter. 
As required by law, party representatives watched ballot counting in the 
upper-middle-class Colonia del Valle neighborhood without participating, except 
to acknowledge that all votes were properly removed from the three ballot boxes 
-- one each for president, senator and deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasted sharply with rural areas, where precinct officers often 
appeared as bewildered about procedures as voters, observers said. More than a 
third of the poll watchers fielded by the Civic Alliance, an umbrella group for 
Mexican observers, said the secrecy of the vote was not respected in the 
precincts they covered. Voters did not bother to fold ballots before dropping 
them in the transparent boxes. Some even took friends or relatives with them 
into voting booths. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the problem was cultural. "In the (northern) state of Sonora, among 
the Yaquis, and in the (southern) state of Oaxaca . . . the custom is that 
women do not go (into the voting booth) alone," said Salvador Ordaz Montes de 
Oca, director of the National Assn. of Election Observers, another umbrella 
group for poll watchers. "We saw that the husband went with her and told her 
how to vote. But this is part of their tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, the problem was ignorance. Voters "knew the credential was power. 
They just weren't educated to know how to use that power," said Loreto Curti, a 
San Francisco resident who was a poll watcher in Altamirano, one of the towns 
occupied by Chiapas rebels on Jan. 1. "People not being educated was one of the 
biggest problems of these elections." 
</P>
<P>
 But often the line between aiding peasant voters and intimidating them 
blurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, (ruling party officials) were legitimately helping people who 
did not know how to vote," Benjamin said. "In others, PRI representatives were 
showing people how to mark their ballots." 
</P>
<P>
 Even foreign visitors watching the election under strict guidelines not to 
interfere in sovereignty-conscious Mexico sometimes could not resist the 
temptation to help. In one rural polling place, a poll watcher ended up 
counting ballots because none of the four precinct officers could do so, 
Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of all this? A far-from-perfect election day, symptomatic of the 
obstacles to bringing democracy to the countryside, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The culture of domination has deep roots," Stavenhagen said. "This system has 
been maintained for more than 60 years. It is a machine." 
</P>

INDIA; IN LAND OF SACRED COW, PLAN TO IMPORT MANURE SEEN AS WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In India, where cows are sacred, one commodity should exist in abundance -- 
besides milk, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dutch company, Seaswan, begs to disagree and has devised an ambitious scheme 
to ship some of that other product, generated by the Netherlands' cows, to 
India for fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oil tankers go to Europe and then come back empty," explains Albert van der 
Struik, agricultural counselor at the Royal Netherlands Embassy in New Delhi. 
"Couldn't that excess capacity be used to carry manure?" 
</P>
<P>
 Small and densely populated, the Netherlands has serious soil and water 
pollution problems caused by its large dairy and animal-husbandry sector. 
Strict environmental laws limit the amount of manure that farmers can produce 
per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 When they increase their milk or meat output by breeding more animals, Dutch 
farmers must get rid of the excess dung, Van der Struik said -- hence Seaswan's 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 A feasibility study, financed in part by the European Union, is considering 
whether the plan makes business sense. One idea is that bio-gas be extracted 
from the manure in the Netherlands first, and perhaps used to generate 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the dung, which could be mixed with water into a slurry to make it easier 
to transport, would be loaded onto tankers in Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, the reception given Seaswan's scheme ranges from the commercially 
curious to the downright hostile. A small but vocal group of Indians views the 
plan as just another way for a rich country to dump its trash in the Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposal is seen as part of the reckless opening up of the economy to all 
kinds of imports ranging from Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Kellogg's 
breakfast cereals to McDonald's hamburgers (which are to be free of beef), 
Hollywood soap operas through satellite television and obsolete American 
automobile technology," fulminated the Telegraph newspaper of Calcutta, which 
is largely hostile to the free-market reforms being carried out by India's 
ruling Congress Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Shekhar Singh of the New Delhi environmental group Kalpavriksh said he 
couldn't understand the logic of Seaswan's scheme, because India already has 
more manure than any other country in the world. Because of Hinduism's ban on 
cow slaughter, India has the world's largest cattle population, with 192 
million cows. 
</P>
<P>
 It is equally true, however, that a lot of manure in India is now dried and 
used for fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a country with an enormous need for organic matter in the soil," Van 
der Struik contends. Supporters of Seaswan's proposal note that manure is a lot 
more ecologically sound than chemical fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Telegraph, an Indian company, EID Parry, has already joined 
hands with Seaswan and is seeking more local partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The reported plan is for the Dutch manure to be shipped to Gujarat, a western 
Indian state, in quantities averaging 6 million tons annually to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds very absurd to me," Singh said. "Who is going to buy it at this 
end? And you can't just come and dump it at the port in Gujarat. A lot of 
people will object, because it will seem like waste dumping." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody in the Netherlands must have anticipated problems with the project. 
Initially, the proposed export item was given the snazzy name "eco-dung"; it 
has since been changed to "organic fertilizer." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in a very early stage," Van der Struik said. "Nothing may come of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, religious taboos -- but not the religion that believes cows are holy 
-- could torpedo the whole project. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaswan had originally eyed Saudi Arabia as its most promising market, Van der 
Struik said, but had to back off that idea because "eco-dung" will also contain 
manure from pigs, an animal that Muslims hold to be particularly unclean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine that being used for fertilizer here," Singh said. "India has 
far more Muslims than Saudi Arabia."

BALKANS; BOSNIAN SERBS LIKELY TO SPURN PEACE PROPOSAL; WEEKEND REFERENDUM IS 
EXPECTED TO RESULT IN REJECTION OF A PLAN THAT WOULD FORCE REBELS TO GIVE UP 
SOME CONQUERED TERRITORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite being isolated, demoralized and condemned, Bosnian Serbs are expected 
to flout the will of the outside world this weekend and vote overwhelmingly to 
reject a proposed peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement formula that has already been spurned three times by the rebel 
leadership would give Bosnian Serb warlord Radovan Karadzic and his nationalist 
gunmen uncontested rule over half of this country and ostensibly stop a war 
that even its instigators in Serbia have tired of. 
</P>
<P>
 But following the same logic that has driven the insurgency, most Serbs living 
in the conquered and "ethnically cleansed" territory under the control of 
Karadzic forces are likely to heed his advice and vote "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Fatalism, martyrdom and the uniquely Balkan inat -- self-destructive spite -- 
have combined to convince most of the estimated 700,000 residents of 
Serbian-occupied Bosnia-Herzegovina that they should press on with the flagging 
campaign to forge a Greater Serbia with territory seized from Bosnia and 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb fighters have recently suffered their first territorial setbacks 
of the 28-month-old war, exposing erosion of their fighting spirit and a new 
vulnerability to offensives by the strengthening Bosnian government army. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels also face an increasingly realistic prospect of seeing a U.N. arms 
embargo lifted from the Bosnian government as punishment for Bosnian Serb 
refusal to make any compromise in the name of peace. That would allow the 
Muslim-led Bosnian troops to import heavy weapons to balance the rebel arsenal 
supplied by nationalist patrons in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that support from the Serbian and Yugoslav capital is at stake in the 
Saturday and Sunday referendum: Belgrade authorities have purportedly cut off 
supplies to their Bosnian Serb proxies in a much-publicized effort to pressure 
the rebels into signing the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics left in rump Yugoslavia, appear 
willing to settle for half of Bosnia, instead of the 70% the Serbs now hold, in 
return for getting severe U.N. economic sanctions lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Karadzic and his radical military chieftain, Gen. Ratko Mladic, have 
refused to heed the pressure from Belgrade, probably fearing that an end to the 
war could lead to their prosecution by a war-crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic denounced the peace plan at a pre-election rally in the nationalist 
stronghold of Banja Luka as "tantamount to capitulation." He argued that 
compromise on the issue of territory would dishonor the lives of Serbs who died 
in the land-grab. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Serbs constituted less than one-third of Bosnia's prewar population, 
they claim at least two-thirds of its land on the argument that Bosnian 
Muslims, who made up 44% of the population, are really Serbs whose ancestors 
converted to Islam during the 500-year Turkish occupation of the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who instigated the deadly Balkan 
conflict with his rallying cry of "all Serbs in one state," initially sought to 
muffle the Bosnian Serbs' defiant propaganda by blocking television 
transmissions. He appears to have relented, however, after concluding there was 
too little time to turn around public opinion before the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 With rejection of the peace plan a virtual certainty, what remains unclear is 
the rebels' strategy for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Sarajevo government troops eat away at the territorial spoils of the 
rebels, the first signs of a Serb-versus-Serb power struggle have emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic, a Milosevic ally, unleashed a scathing attack 
on Karadzic and his followers last weekend, accusing the rebel politicians of 
war crimes and rampant corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the harsh remarks are judged by Western diplomats to be too little 
and too late to discredit Karadzic and convince Bosnian Serbs to support the 
peace plan, they may marginally dent the majority of "No" votes cast in the 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 The last internationally mediated settlement offer, drafted by former U.N. 
envoy Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen of the European Union, was rejected by a 
reported 96% of the Bosnian Serb population in a similar referendum in May, 
1993. A Nation Redivided 
</P>
<P>
 The areas held by Bosnia's Serbs and Muslim-led government would be altered 
under a proposed peace plan. Shaded areas indicate Serbian control

MEXICO QUESTIONS FORMER OFFICIAL IN COLOSIO MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican authorities questioned a former high-ranking government official here 
Thursday regarding his contention that federal officials in Mexico linked to 
drug lords took part in the assassination of presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the six-hour testimony of Eduardo Valle Espinosa in secret in 
the Mexican Consulate, Alejandro Encinas, a congressional deputy, said Valle 
had "given us a number of clues that must be followed." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Antonio Diaz de Leon, a member of the special prosecuting team 
investigating the Colosio case, said Valle had "presented an ample and very 
important declaration that must be evaluated in Mexico with great care." Valle 
also provided prosecutors with documents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle -- a former journalist, congressman and top aide to the attorney general 
-- has become a key figure in the Colosio investigation. He has created a stir 
with published interviews and letters alleging that drug cartel interests and 
corrupt politicians were linked to Colosio's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Diaz de Leon said investigators accepted Valle's offer to testify 
because "the exposure in the media made it necessary for us to clarify what he 
meant." 
</P>
<P>
 Before his deposition, Valle distributed a two-page "public declaration" to 
reporters amplifying his original charges. He said there was "concrete 
evidence" that Mexican federal authorities were protecting the "Gulf Cartel" of 
kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego and that these authorities participated in the 
planning and execution of the March 23 assassination of Colosio at a Tijuana 
campaign rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle, 47, said no one believes that the accused gunman, Mario Aburto 
Martinez, acted alone. He derided the theory that local politicos of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party killed Colosio in revenge for the party's 
loss of a 1989 gubernatorial race in Baja California. "To assassinate a person 
of such importance," he said, "it is absolutely indispensable to have the 
complicity of the federal authorities in infiltrating the security team of the 
presidential candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Valle called for authorities to investigate the conduct of the heads of 
Colosio's security detail, including Domiro Garcia Reyes -- a general in the 
Mexican equivalent of the Secret Service -- and former federal police 
commanders Fernando de la Sota and Jorge Vergara Verdejo. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the consulate, Valle stressed to reporters that he had given his 
deposition "to Mexican authorities on Mexican territory." He grew testy when a 
reporter asked him if he was in exile in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle, whose duties in the attorney general's office included supervising an 
elite unit investigating Mexican drug lords, resigned abruptly last May 
claiming that the pervasive corruption made his duties impossible. He has moved 
to the United States for his personal safety.

bustling capital to Japan's postwar rebuilding four decades ago, pledged 
support for Hanoi's free-market reforms.Murayama was making the first visit to 
Vietnam by a Japanese leader since the Vietnam War. Vietnamese Premier Vo Van 
Kiet asked Murayama for more Japanese investment and economic aid, and even 
added a pitch for a Hanoi-Tokyo air route. Japan gave Vietnam $600 million in 
aid last year, but is only the seventh-largest foreign investor in the country. 
Murayama told Kiet that Japan wants to play a part in Vietnam's economic 
development but warned of a need to improve Hanoi's investment climate.

ZAIRE GANGS LOOT AID AFTER PULLOUT

 Zairian gangs looted aid supplies after American troops pulled out of a base 
near the Goma airport Thursday during a day of violence that left at least two 
Zairians dead and 10 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the raid on the unguarded base, but it created new fears 
among the 800 foreigners working for 45 aid groups in Goma and further 
disrupted relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be operating in the camps in a virtual state of war," said Ray 
Wilkinson, a U.N. refugee agency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers have urged that U.N. peacekeepers be sent to the Goma region, but 
no such force is under consideration. A U.N. force is patrolling across the 
border in Rwanda, but its mission is limited to trying to stabilize that nation 
after a brutal, 3 1/2-month civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporadic gunfire was heard throughout the day as gangs of Zairian soldiers 
looted homes of civilians and then fought with each other over the booty. 
Witnesses said they saw the bodies of at least two Zairian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting added to violence that has been escalating in the camps around 
Goma that hold about 800,000 Rwandan refugees.

 The government said it is planning to expel about 1 million illegal immigrants 
living in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and commercial center."A strategy is 
being finalized to expel these immigrants," Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar 
said in reply to a question in the National Assembly. Officials and welfare 
organizations have complained that large-scale illegal immigration has 
contributed to violence and drug trafficking in Karachi. Most of the immigrants 
are from India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Iran.

 A dissident imprisoned for drafting a "Peace Charter" and opposing Beijing's 
bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games has been savagely beaten by his guards, 
according to his wife.Li Jinfang, wife of Qin Yongmin, asked the National 
People's Congress to intervene to allow her husband to undergo medical 
treatment, investigate the incident and punish the guilty. She said prison 
guards in Wuhan twice beat Qin until he became unconscious because he was slow 
to act on their orders. He was kicked in his genitals, she said, adding she 
feared he may have suffered permanent injury.

JUDGE DISQUALIFIES KUNSTLER, KUBY FROM N.Y. BOMB CONSPIRACY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge disqualified civil rights lawyers William Kunstler and Ron Kuby on 
Thursday from representing men accused of conspiring to bomb New York City 
landmarks, saying they faced potential conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, whose ruling likely will force a delay in 
the scheduled Sept. 19 trial, noted that the lawyers had represented four 
defendants and several other people connected to the case, relationships that 
posed insurmountable problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they also were potential unsworn witnesses in the case, in part 
because of public statements they made out of a "perceived need to correct a 
hostile public view of blameless clients." 
</P>
<P>
 "No one forced these lawyers to test-fly their defense theories in public and 
in court documents, and to say and do things that could be proved against their 
client at trial," Mukasey wrote. When faced with the conflicts of interest, the 
lawyers have "either denied the existence of the problems . . . or trivialized 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge indicated, as prosecutors had a week ago, that some of the 13 
defendants are likely to testify, including Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. 
Prosecutors allege that the 56-year-old cleric guided the conspiracy to bomb 
landmarks including the United Nations, a building housing the FBI and two 
tunnels and a bridge connecting Manhattan to New Jersey.

INDICTED LAWMAKER DID NOT LIST SOME PAC MONEY, DATA SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Campaign reports for Rep. Mel Reynolds (D-Ill.), indicted last week on sexual 
charges, fail to list thousands of dollars in contributions since 1991 as 
required by law, a review of election records found. 
</P>
<P>
 A spot check of the unreported political action committee donations turned up 
some that were deposited at two banks that at the time were not registered to 
handle his campaign accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicagoan's campaign finances are being investigated by federal 
authorities. State officials last week charged him with child pornography and 
sexual assault of a 16-year-old campaign volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The government imposes strict rules requiring campaigns to quickly disclose 
donations and spending to ensure no political money is misused. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law imposes penalties up to $5,000, or 100% of the campaign money 
involved, for failure to disclose donations. The Federal Election Commission 
can double those fines and also recommend criminal prosecution if the 
violations were knowing and willful. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds and his former campaign treasurer, who has filed a complaint against 
the congressman with the FEC alleging campaign irregularities, differ on who is 
to blame for the finance problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said any unreported PAC contributions were spent on the campaign. He 
blamed former treasurer Earl Worthington. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't on the report, that means that either Mr. Worthington 
deliberately didn't put it on or it was an oversight," Reynolds said. He said 
he is reviewing all campaign records and would file amended reports to disclose 
any donations that previously were not. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington, however, said he was "just a ghost treasurer" who followed 
Reynolds' instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington said he believed the congressman frequently converted all or 
portions of contribution checks into cash instead of depositing the entire 
donations and writing out checks to cover bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably just wanted to use my name so that if anybody caught on . . . he 
would use me as a fall guy. And that's what he's trying to do," Worthington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 PACs, the political arms of special interest lobbies, can contribute up to 
$10,000 to a candidate per two-year election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 PACs and candidates are required to report to the FEC. Through a 
computer-assisted search of those reports, the Associated Press compared what 
PACs said they contributed to Reynolds with what Reynolds recorded on his own 
reports.

WOMAN KILLED IN CAR CRASH DONATES HEART, TO HER FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chester Szuber had waited nearly four years for a heart transplant and finally 
got one -- from his own daughter, who was killed in a car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Szuber, the youngest of his six children, was an exuberant 22-year-old 
nursing student who had insisted that she wanted her organs donated if she 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 The father decided that "it would be a joy to have Patti's heart," Patti's 
brother, Bob Szuber, remembers him saying. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, her heart was flown from the Tennessee hospital where she had died 
only hours earlier to Michigan, where it was implanted and restarted in her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester Szuber, 58, was off a breathing machine by the morning after the 
surgery and was in good condition Thursday, said Dr. Jeffrey Altshuler, who 
performed the transplant operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester Szuber had been suffering life-threatening heartbeat irregularities 
and had undergone three open-heart surgeries and two angioplasties in the last 
20 years to clear blockages. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Newman, spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing in Richmond, 
Va., said the network doesn't keep track of whether donors and recipients were 
related. But he said he was unaware of any other cases of a heart being 
designated for transplant to a blood relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Szuber said the fact that his sister's heart gave their father new life is 
helping the family cope with the tragedy. Her liver and kidneys were donated to 
other recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure down the road there will be some tough times," he said, but he said 
his sister is "the happiest little angel in heaven."

COUPLE FROM ITALY SURVIVES NEW FLORIDA TOURIST ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Italian couple celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary were shot 
repeatedly but survived a robbery near Walt Disney World in this tourist 
mecca's second recent attack on foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men sped off in a car after the couple were shot Wednesday night near a 
hotel, sheriff's Lt. July Rivers said.The two were in stable condition Thursday 
at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors lost their bearings as they walked on a road toward the hotel 
after shopping at a nearby mall, the 47-year-old woman said through an 
interpreter. The couple apparently were trailed by two men. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting began after the 49-year-old man resisted the holdup, his wife 
told investigators. Witnesses said the two men jumped into a waiting car after 
shots were fired, leaving the victims lying on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe they took some personal items," Rivers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osceola County officials were trying to contact the couple's relatives in Rome 
before releasing their names, Rivers said. Each was shot several times. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said they arrived in Orlando on Sunday to celebrate their 25th 
anniversary. They had been scheduled to fly to San Juan, Puerto Rico, today to 
take a weeklong cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 16, a British tourist was shot and wounded in the left arm when she 
and her sister-in-law resisted an armed robber outside their motel room in the 
same tourist area. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime against tourists -- 10 foreign visitors were killed in Florida between 
October, 1992, and April, 1994 -- is believed to be a major reason for a drop 
in Florida travel by Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials say the state is experiencing its worst tourist season in 
two decades.

NEW TEST FOR MEAT BACTERIA ANNOUNCED; HEALTH: AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT SAYS QUICK 
SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURE WOULD REPLACE 'SEE-TOUCH-SMELL' METHOD. BUT SOME 
SCIENTISTS REMAIN SKEPTICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Agriculture Department announced the development of a test Thursday that 
will allow federal meat inspectors to use science rather than the 87-year-old 
"see-touch-smell" method for detecting bacteria in meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The new test, which comes amid rising concern about the safety of meat and 
poultry after the deaths last year of four children from E. coli bacteria, 
permits meat inspectors to determine the bacteria level of meat within five 
minutes. That is a marked change from the current practice of meat inspectors, 
who use their sense of smell, touch and sight to assess whether meat in 
processing plants might be contaminated and merit a laboratory test. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists, however, have questioned whether the new test is specific 
enough to be useful. It only registers the "generic bacteria level" rather than 
detecting whether the bacteria found are harmless or not. If high levels are 
found, inspectors still must rely on other tests to determine whether the 
bacteria are harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have suggested that Agriculture Department officials are rushing to 
use this test for political reasons when other tests may be available soon. 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who has championed the "rapid microbial test" 
and announced its development in Washington, is under investigation for 
allegedly accepting improper gratuities. 
</P>
<P>
 The new test, which has been in use for two decades in the pharmaceutical and 
beer industries, would require meat inspectors to run a small sponge dipped in 
a special solution over selected carcasses at processing plants. The solution 
from the sponge would then be placed into a hand-held meter that would provide 
a bacteria reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists from the Agriculture Department's Meat Animal Research Center in 
Clay Center, Neb., developed the new test in response to an Espy request after 
the outbreak of contaminated hamburger killed four and made 700 others ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This test is not the end-all, be-all accomplishment for us as we continue to 
improve and reform the meat and poultry inspection systems," Espy said. "It 
represents one of many developments that will help us bring the meat and 
poultry inspection systems into the next century. As I have said many times 
before, we can no longer rely on the 1930s methods of inspection in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month a panel organized by the American Gastroenterological Assn. 
Foundation declared that new strains of bacteria had become a serious health 
threat and argued that federal meat inspection methods were out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 Americans are known to have died from E. coli infections since the 
bacteria was first identified in the early 1980s and about 20,000 are infected 
each year, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview earlier this month, Espy accused some of his agency's 
employees of behaving as though a certain number of deaths from food poisoning 
is "inevitable and expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy also has said that, when he took over the department, there was a "zero 
tolerance" standard for fecal material on red meat that was not enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 The new test has become part of a fight between Espy and veterans of the 
Agriculture Department's Food Safety Inspection Service who are charged with 
monitoring the meat industry and are the focus of much of Espy's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Agriculture Department scientist in charge of the Meat 
Animal Research Center that developed the new test wrote a memo accusing 
federal food inspectors of trying to block its development. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the food inspectors have called on President Clinton to replace 
Espy on the grounds that he has lost the confidence of USDA employees. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be more than a year before the new test is used by inspectors, since 
it may take that long to become part of federal regulations.

NEWS ANALYSIS; AS PARTISAN LINES HARDEN IN SENATE, LEVEL OF DEBATE HITS 
TRAGICOMIC LOW; LEGISLATORS: THEATRICS AND BILE HAVE DROWNED A SPIRIT OF 
COMPROMISE. SOME CALL IT EMBLEMATIC OF CAPITAL CLINTON-BASHING, OTHERS CITE A 
NEED FOR SOUND BITES.

<P>
 In the view of some lawmakers, the decorum of the Senate reached a new nadir 
this week, political acrimony and partisan bile having become the defining 
characteristics of the institution in the Clinton era. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Senate struggled to resolve a weeklong impasse over President Clinton's 
crime legislation, its members waxed theatrical, unloosing oratory ranging from 
the silly to the sublime and displaying emotions worthy of classic tragedy or 
comedy, or perhaps both. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the week's most audacious performance was rendered Thursday by Sen. 
Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who embellished his arguments against the bill's 
crime prevention programs by brandishing a large picture of a pink pig and 
belting out his own version of the children's classic:  
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton had a bill. E-I-E-I-O. And in that bill was lots of pork. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato's ambitious a cappella prompted an acid retort from a normally 
restrained Democrat, Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the barnyard all right," Lautenberg observed. "But it's not the pig 
we're looking at. It's the other stuff. It's the other stuff. And if it looks 
like it and it feels like it and it smells like it, we know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Some senators complained that the pitched, emotional tenor of the crime debate 
signals a new low in legislative etiquette and an end to the days when 
Republicans and Democrats would compromise for the good of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, congressional decorum has deteriorated sharply during the 
Clinton presidency as the new Administration has prodded the country in a new 
direction, giving greater voice to some constituencies at the expense of others 
and upsetting a status quo that largely prevailed for 12 years under the Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush presidencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a sea change in politics, partisanship and people's attitudes 
toward one another. It's a living tragedy," Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) said, 
his voice cracking with emotion. "We even got E-I-E-I-O." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of senators attribute recent mood swings to the life-or-death 
implications of the crime debate. Others said that members of the chamber are 
merely cranky after being forced to cancel the first two weeks of a planned 
August recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars said that the dramatics were merely ploys to obtain free time on 
national television. "It has everything to do with the television cameras," 
said Larry Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia.  
</P>
<P>
 The catchy phrases and dramatic charades were part of the senators' 
competition to make the nightly network news with the most compelling sound 
bite, he said. This game is especially tempting for senators facing reelection 
campaigns this fall, since appearing on national television makes them look 
important and their opponents cannot get equal time. "It's free air time," 
Sabato said. "It's worth its weight in gold videotape." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday capped an exceptionally emotional week in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Monday, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) held up a copy of the 
crime bill and ripped out the pages detailing the assault rifle ban, which many 
Republicans oppose but the President considers critical. If that part of the 
legislation were removed, he declared, "I will bet you I would pass this bill 
in 12 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 As for D'Amato, antics such as his singing performance are not new. Last year, 
in his battle against the President's budget bill, he took a huge pencil to the 
floor and bashed it against a poster of a "Taxasaurus" dinosaur. That time he 
made the evening news on all three major commercial networks, Sabato recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 One Senate historian said that such outbursts are hardly unprecedented. While 
Senate rules are crafted to foster a polite, genteel atmosphere, he said, 
emotions have been known to peak toward the end of sessions since the founding 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end of the session tends to get a little punchy, agitated and humorous," 
said Don Ritchie, assistant historian for the Senate. "You get emotions coming 
out in ways they don't normally come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Such behavior is most prevalent when lawmakers have been kept in Washington 
long after a scheduled adjournment day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1913, the Senate was in a particularly foul mood because 
lawmakers were denied a summer recess and had been at work on weighty bills 
such as income tax legislation for eight months, Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Ben (Pitchfork) Tillman of South Carolina, who was fighting for the 
interests of the agrarian states, entered into the record a cartoon of a cow 
that showed farmers feeding it and Wall Street bankers milking it. 
</P>
<P>
 The gesture so outraged other senators that they put off their work on income 
tax legislation and passed a measure banning cartoons and other such graphic 
material from being entered into the official record. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear throughout the week that eagerness to get out of Washington for 
at least part of their summer recess was one of the biggest reasons for short 
tempers among the senators. Among the tourists and congressional staffers who 
crowded the Senate galleries during climactic moments of the debate, the most 
anxious faces belonged to the families of senators, including Stewart Boxer, 
husband of California Democrat Barbara Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 A casual conversation on a Capitol elevator between senators from opposite 
sides of the aisle -- both of whom gave passionate speeches on the crime bill 
-- gave a clue to the primary issue of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumpers turned to Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) and asked: "You think we 
might get out tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I sense it in the air," she said.

EXPANDING REFUGEE HOUSING POSES RISKS; IMMIGRATION: U.S. OFFICIALS FEAR CUBANS, 
HAITIANS MAY FOMENT VIOLENCE AT GUANTANAMO. THEY'RE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT 
POLITICAL IMPACT ON CLINTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is facing a daunting and politically risky 
challenge as it prepares to expand the refugee detention centers at Guantanamo 
Bay Naval Base: how to hold Cuban and Haitian refugees there indefinitely 
without inviting violence and riots. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of disturbances already has erupted among Haitians at the base on 
Cuba's southeast shore. Although U.S. security forces have quelled them all 
successfully, both Haitians and Marines were injured in one fray last Saturday 
and military experts concede that more such incidents are almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, U.S. officials are mindful that the incidents occurred among a 
refugee population of only 14,000 people who had been in U.S. custody only a 
few days or weeks. Current plans call for expanding the camps to hold up to 
60,000 people and to keep the Cubans there for months, allowing them little 
freedom of movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Administration planners worry that serious violence on Guantanamo -- with 
the predictable nightly TV footage of rioting refugees and near-daily 
casualties among Cubans and U.S. security troops -- would be politically 
damaging to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Marine Corps Lt. Gen. John Sheehan, operations director for the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the Pentagon is considering the 
possibility of calling up reserves in a few months to relieve active-duty 
troops at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not need to do this right now in a near-term basis. But with the 
possibility that this will be a long-term commitment, there is a distinct 
possibility that we'll use reserve forces to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton already has had one bad experience with such disturbances. During the 
Mariel boat lift in 1980, then-Gov. Clinton agreed to let the federal 
government house Cuban refugees at Ft. Chaffee, Ark. A few weeks later, they 
rioted. The episode is believed to have contributed to Clinton's loss when he 
sought reelection as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Marine Brig. Gen. George H. Walls Jr., who commanded the joint task 
force that oversaw the detention of Haitians at Guantanamo Bay in 1991 and 
1992, warned that the Administration's current plan "has the potential to be 
dangerous" as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With no sign of any immediate solution to the Cubans' plight, restlessness 
could build quickly, Walls cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that you can play enough baseball and soccer there to keep the 
Cubans happy" at the naval base, he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon already has begun preparing for the increase in the refugee 
population at Guantanamo Bay. Officials announced plans Thursday to construct 
tent cities designed to hold up to 35,000 persons. 
</P>
<P>
 To beef up security, U.S. officials are poised to deploy 8,000 more U.S. 
troops -- mainly Marines -- to the naval base over the next few days. Families 
of U.S. sailors stationed there are being sent to Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that many of the additional troops and other U.S. 
military personnel being deployed to the naval base would be berthed aboard the 
hospital ship Comfort, which was ordered to Guantanamo Bay on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Administration is trying to organize the camps in a way 
that discourages violence: 
</P>
<P>
 * The refugees are being segregated into a spate of small, fenced-in camps. 
Haitians and Cubans already are housed separately. Young men will be in their 
own compound and families will be put in another. 
</P>
<P>
 * The naval base's soccer and baseball fields will be used for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Educational programs (including language, math and history classes), games 
and religious services are being established for the refugees. Private relief 
organizations are being asked to help. 
</P>
<P>
 But veterans of previous detention efforts say that the most important step is 
to establish local governing bodies for each camp, staffed by the Cubans and 
Haitians themselves, which could serve a liaison function between the military 
and the refugees and help run each facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps' Gen. Walls said that local governments helped keep order in 
the 1991-93 detention effort. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that their operation in Guantanamo may be hampered by 
post-Cold War military cutbacks, which have left the Pentagon with fewer civil 
affairs officers, psychological operations experts and military police. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortage may force a reserve call-up, although Sheehan stressed Thursday 
that the decision need not be made immediately. Such a move could be 
politically difficult for the White House, and officials suggested that Clinton 
may ask reservists to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Military police forces also can be hampered by the inevitable restrictions on 
use of force to quell disturbances. Walls recalled that during the 1991-93 
detention effort, MPs were permitted to carry only nightsticks. Side arms and 
rifles were locked up in the base armory a half-mile from the detention camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Don M. Snider, a former Pentagon planner now with the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, agreed that much of the outcome will depend on luck. 
"Common sense says there isn't a hell of a lot you can do" to prevent 
disturbances, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the possibility of violence, the Administration's plan faces several 
other dangers: Hurricanes, rife in late summer, could force a hurried 
evacuation of the base's tent cities. The tropical climate could spread disease 
quickly. And water and power plants could fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction problem itself is a challenge. Although the Pentagon plans to 
fly in some of the needed equipment in C-5 and C-141 transports, most of it 
will have to be brought in by barge -- a slow and cumbersome trip from the 
continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
 And the operation will cost money. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis L. Boxx, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Thursday that preliminary 
estimates show start-up costs for the detention effort could be as much as $100 
million, with operating costs of $20 million a month -- just to house 45,000 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would increase proportionately for additional detainees, either at 
Guantanamo Bay or in one of the Caribbean or Central American countries that 
are expected to agree to provide similar safe havens. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxx said that the Pentagon is paying the cost out of the regular budgets of 
the armed services, with the Navy taking the bulk of it out of its operations 
and maintenance funds. But, he said, Clinton may ask Congress for additional 
appropriations later this year.

OFFICIALS ARREST, HOLD 36 CUBANS TRYING TO ENTER U.S. FROM MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 36 Cubans have been arrested in recent days trying to enter the 
United States along Mexico's border with Texas, federal authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials say they believe that the Cubans had left for Mexico 
before the flood of boat people began toward Florida, they expressed concern 
that more Cubans may seek to enter the United States by first traveling to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The distance between Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula is roughly the same as the 
distance from the island nation to the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the foreign ministry announced Thursday that Mexico is 
prepared to take in Cuban citizens who wish to leave their island nation if 
they have family members in Mexico who are willing to support them. It was not 
immediately clear how many Cubans would be able to take advantage of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 24 Cubans were arrested Sunday in Laredo, Tex., after arriving by 
boat on the Yucatan Peninsula sometime in July and then traveling by land to 
the United States, U.S. Border Patrol Assistant Chief Guadalupe Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group of 12 Cubans made their way to the border this week after 
apparently arriving in Mexico by plane. They were arrested after crossing the 
Rio Grande near Laredo. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Cubans trying to reach Florida, those arrested in Texas will appear 
before federal officials, who will consider applications for political asylum 
because they were arrested in the United States, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubans are being held at a detention facility in Port Isabel, near 
Brownsville in southern Texas, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities also said Thursday that other Cuban refugees may be sent 
to the Port Isabel facility.

GOVERNOR TO DEFY FEDERAL 'MOTOR-VOTER' LAW; ELECTIONS: WILSON INSISTS THE STATE 
CANNOT AFFORD TO IMPLEMENT THE RULES ON REGISTRATION WITHOUT FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has ordered his Administration to defy the federal government 
and refuse to implement the so-called motor-voter registration law unless 
Congress forwards the money to pay for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, intended to boost citizen participation in elections, requires 
the state by Jan. 1 to begin providing voter registration material to driver's 
license applicants and at a host of state and local government offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who opposed the law as an unwelcome intrusion into state affairs, 
signed an executive order Aug. 12 that allows state offices to prepare for the 
expanded voter registration program but implement it only "to the extent 
federal funding is made available for such purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 The order, obtained by The Times on Thursday, designates the Department of 
Motor Vehicles, county welfare departments, the state Department of 
Rehabilitation, the Franchise Tax Board and the State Board of Equalization as 
agencies that will participate in the program if funding is forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Finance Department estimates that it will cost the state $35.8 
million annually to implement the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor said in his executive order that the law "compels 
states and local governments to enact a federal program by diverting resources 
from existing programs and services already facing funding shortages." 
</P>
<P>
 The order also complained that federal and state laws do not require adequate 
verification of the citizenship status of those seeking to register to vote. 
Wilson, according to Administration sources, believes that expanded 
registration efforts will increase the level of voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 But Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, a Democrat, said the new system 
will cut down on abuse. He said he has been trying to implement the law, but 
has been stymied by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is actually designed to help maintain the integrity of the election 
process," Miller said. "Most registration now occurs through bounty hunters who 
are paid based on the number of people they register. Sometimes greed overcomes 
good conscience and they register people without the niceties of asking them 
whether or not they are a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motor-voter will move registration off the streets and into government 
offices where we will be relying on trained civil servants rather than 
mercenaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said Wilson is wrong to try to defy the federal government. "If the 
governor's departments refuse to do so, then a federal court will compel him to 
comply," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration source said Wilson believes that the state will be 
well-positioned to defend such a lawsuit if it does everything necessary to 
plan for the program but then balks and demands federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the event of a lawsuit we feel that the steps we've taken will best 
prepare the state for any litigation," the source said.

J. RICKARD; CREATED FIRST BLACK BALLET GROUP IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph Rickard, a white dance teacher who created and ran the nation's First 
Negro Classic Ballet in Los Angeles from 1946 to 1959, has died. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard died Wednesday at Glendale Adventist Hospital of heart failure after 
several bouts of pneumonia, said his friend and former student, Sunny Asch. 
</P>
<P>
 The innovative Rickard was moved to organize an African American dance group 
when he watched a receptionist turn away a little black girl who had sought 
ballet lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The child and her mother both signed up for Rickard's classes. He went to 
African American communities, literally walking the streets to recruit more 
people who wanted to learn ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard's motives, he told The Times years later, were professional as well as 
social. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this drive to create," he said. "I wanted to be a choreographer, not 
just a dancer." 
</P>
<P>
 He first showcased his troupe in the Hollywood High School Auditorium and, as 
they gained a following, in Los Angeles' old 2,000-seat Philharmonic 
Auditorium. An early review in the Los Angeles Herald & Express applauded: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Negro troupe struck the enthusiasts with originality of material, 
first-class dancing, competent staging, music, costumes and sets." 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard took his company to Santa Barbara and San Francisco, earning more rave 
reviews. National magazines, including Look, Ebony and Dance magazine, hailed 
the unique troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 But impresario Sol Hurok discouraged hopes of broader touring, Rickard 
recalled in 1992, saying "the country was not ready for a Negro ballet." 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard, however, credited publicity about his dancers for encouraging other 
African Americans to aspire to ballet across the country. He continued to work 
with African American dancers even as they gained professional ground 
elsewhere. He was proud to train dancers who went into the American Ballet 
Theater, San Francisco Ballet and National Ballet of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leading American ballet companies all have a Negro or two as a gesture," 
he joked in 1968. "I've been thinking of adding a token Caucasian or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard was an unusual dancer and teacher. A native of Ann Arbor, Mich., he 
spent some time in Chicago working for an insurance company before moving to 
Los Angeles, where he found work in the mail room at Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 One night he chanced to go to a performance of Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at 
the Philharmonic Auditorium. He was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard was well into his 20s, a very old age for a beginning ballet student. 
But Irina and Bronislava Nijinska were willing to teach him, and, with their 
encouragement, he soon set about developing his own studio, finding students 
and creating his special company. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard is survived by a sister, Gretchen Berlew of Glendale; a brother, 
Thomas Rickard of Ann Arbor, Mich., and nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are pending.

TOWN EVACUATED AS 2,000-ACRE FOREST FIRE DRAWS NEAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities ordered the evacuation of the 400 residents of Big Creek on 
Thursday afternoon as a precaution against a forest fire started when a 
squirrel shorted out an electrical conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 Erratic winds changed a voluntary evacuation of the old utility community 50 
miles east of Fresno to a mandatory evacuation, said Phil Strand, a Sierra 
National Forest information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was about one mile east of Big Creek and two miles west of Huntington 
Lake, a popular high country resort where voluntary evacuations of campgrounds 
began Wednesday. One mandatory campground evacuation was ordered Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest spokeswoman Susan Exline said that a squirrel caused the electrical 
short at a Southern California Edison Co. substation, and the short ignited 
brush about noon Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire had blackened 2,000 acres by late Thursday afternoon with no 
containment in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters tried to put a line around the southeast corner of the fire to 
protect Big Creek. To spread to the town, the fire would have to jump a creek 
of the same name, said Robin Smith, a forest information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the fire continues the way it's going, it could get enough momentum to 
reach Big Creek," Smith said.

GEN. RAMON J. CAMPS; AIDED SLAUGHTER OF ARGENTINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gen. Ramon J. Camps, 67, one of the most notorious figures in Argentina's 
"dirty war" against leftists.During the country's military dictatorship from 
1975 to 1983, Camps was chief of the Buenos Aires provincial police. He helped 
the right-wing junta lead a brutal campaign of abductions, torture and summary 
executions in which at least 9,000 people died. Rabidly anti-Communist, Camps 
once claimed personal responsibility for the "disappearance" of about 5,000 
suspected leftists. When the country returned to elected rule in 1986, Camps 
was tried on human rights charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was 
pardoned in 1990. On Monday in Buenos Aires of prostate cancer.

JOHN P. DOBBINS; LED SAN MARINO'S CITIZEN DONATION DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John P. Dobbins, 80, who led a post-Proposition 13 campaign urging citizen 
donations to support the San Marino city government. Dobbins devised his plan 
after learning that the 1978 property tax-cut proposal would leave the city 
$1.5 million in the red.Fearing cutbacks in police, fire and public works 
services, and with the City Council's blessing, he asked the city's well-heeled 
residents to donate 15% of the $2,000 he estimated each would save on property 
taxes under the new state law. Residents responded with their checkbooks, 
earning Dobbins national publicity and praise. The multifaceted Dobbins worked 
40 years as a research scientist for Rockwell International, developing the 
liquid crystal and equipment to launch the microfiche industry. For the past 
two decades, the retired Dobbins has devoted himself to studying metabolism and 
its relationship to degenerative disease, and was a consultant on health 
preservation. He served as San Marino chairman of the Red Cross, was a science 
counselor to San Gabriel Valley Boy Scouts and was a local host to foreign 
guests for the Pasadena Sister Cities Committee. On Aug. 19 in San Marino of 
liver failure.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BID TO LIMIT LAWYER COMMENT ON ONGOING CASES ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Senate has unanimously approved legislation instructing the State Bar to 
adopt rules restricting attorneys from making statements to the news media 
relating to ongoing cases, as have been made by both sides in the O.J. Simpson 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 A 32-0 vote sent the bill (SB 254) by Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) 
to Gov. Pete Wilson's desk. The governor's office said Wilson has no position 
on the measure at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most important guarantees of a democratic society is the right to 
a fair trial," Kopp said. "Selling or leaking potential trial evidence to the 
media by attorneys clearly prostitutes the judicial system. This bill will 
curtail the media circus that has pervaded a number of court cases, most 
recently the O.J. Simpson case."

<P>
 Hundreds of homes were evacuated for more than seven hours Thursday after 
several cases of old explosives were found in a vacant house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reported injuries, said city spokesman Fred Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities removed more than 300 pounds of the explosive, believed to be 
dynamite, from the home. The explosives were detonated at a city beach about 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The north Monterey home where the explosives were found had been vacant for 
some time and was recently sold, Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosives were found about 10 a.m. by house cleaners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities evacuated several hundred nearby houses and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 California 1 was closed until about 7 p.m.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; MAN CHARGED IN FATAL STABBING AT 
MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors on Thursday charged a 32-year-old Port Hueneme man 
with fatally stabbing an employee at a convenience market during a botched 
robbery last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolfo Lopez Carrillo was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of killing 
Mohinder Bassi who worked at the B-Mart on East Pleasant Valley Road, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassi, 42, of Canoga Park was stabbed several times in the chest and stomach 
about 9:30 p.m. Aug. 19. He then staggered next door to a bar where patrons 
called an ambulance. After Carrillo's arrest, police said the stabbing happened 
during a failed robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 9 in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to charging Carrillo with murder, prosecutors also filed 
allegations that he used a deadly weapon and inflicted great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo was being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SUSPECT FLEES BAILIFFS BEFORE CASE IS 
CALLED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura man who had shown up in Ventura court to face about $17,000 in 
outstanding traffic- and narcotics-related warrants had a sudden change of 
heart Thursday -- and fled from stunned bailiffs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the possibility of being remanded to deputies' custody, Rodney Page 
changed his mind about 3 p.m. in Division 10 of Ventura County Municipal Court 
and "split out the door with deputies giving chase," Sgt. Kenton Rainey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Page, 19, fled before Judge Roland N. Purnell even had a chance to call his 
case, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court bailiff Dan Russ joined the pursuit as it led authorities through a 
condominium complex at Telephone Road and County Square Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies and Ventura police, with the assistance of at least two canine units 
and a helicopter team, subsequently set up a perimeter that included an orange 
grove near Telephone Road and Victoria Avenue, but Page eluded them and 
remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also were searching the neighborhood where some of Page's 
relatives live, Rainey said. GREG RIPPEE

THE SCENE: NEO-PUNK; IT'S NOT JUST A LOOK. THESE OFFSPRING SHARE TUNES AND 
'TUDE WITH ANOTHER GENERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can't re-create a revolution, a friend blurted when I told him that this 
latest column spotlighted high school punk rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 When punk rock slammed into youth consciousness in the mid-to-late '70s, it 
revolutionized music, attitudes and fashion. Punk rock shattered standards of 
good taste and decency, mocking the Establishment from government to corporate 
rock 'n' roll. In its truest sense, of course, it was rock 'n' roll, stripped 
down and raw. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost two decades later, its legacy continues in the "alternative" arena. 
Local punk melody-makers Offspring recently hit platinum with their third 
album, "Smash." If sales continue, it could become the biggest selling album in 
punk-rock history. It's just tangible proof on a nationwide scale of the many 
young enthusiasts who are (still) into punk. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the record and T-shirt sales of other bands, both new and long 
gone. At independent music stores such as Underdog Records in Laguna Beach, 
Vinyl Solution in Huntington Beach and Noise Noise Noise in Costa Mesa, 
inventory of seminal acts such as Black Flag, the Sex Pistols and the Germs is 
continuously replenished. So what if those bands dismantled before most of 
today's fans were in kindergarten? 
</P>
<P>
 The '90s teen punks keep the movement's flame burning -- much to the chagrin 
of some old-timers who lived it the first time around. Through their own bands, 
present-day punks imitate the original sounds from the vintage recordings they 
buy -- usually on re-released compact discs. They wear T-shirts splattered with 
the names of the old groups; a few go so far as to embellish them with safety 
pins. They dye their hair every hue of a Crayola box. 
</P>
<P>
 The colors should no longer shock, but they still do. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Orange County claims a part in shaping punk rock history as far back 
as 1979, and probably has more tattooed and pierced kids than any other suburb 
on the planet, green or purple tresses still get a reaction here. 
</P>
<P>
 Which suits high-schoolers such as Leilani Huebner, 16, and Candace Potts, 15. 
Integral to punk has been the personal liberation achieved by making a 
statement, through attire and words, that sets one apart from the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 To Candace and Leilani, the response they get for their sartorial choices 
instantly reveals to them how open- or close-minded a person is. 
</P>
<P>
 Leilani might strike some as being just another long-haired groovy gal, but 
the Newport Harbor High sophomore has been listening to punk and its variations 
courtesy of her older sis since she was 10. She goes to gigs and rollicks in 
the slam dance pit. Though her hair is a little too auburn, it's closer to a 
natural color than the hot pink, flaming red, electric blue and blue black 
she's tried over the past five years. "I got tired of the fake colors," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her pal, Laguna Beach High sophomore Candace, her obvious passion is 
purple. Her nails, short shag and bra straps peeking from her tank top are all 
purple. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple hair? "Actually, it's plum," she corrects. 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorite comments come from little kids. "They just look at me kind of 
confused," Candace says. "The best part is they don't hold back. They just yell 
it out, while their parents pretend not to look your way." Her 4-year-old 
brother loves it, she says, while her other siblings, 10 and 12, deem her 
bonkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say I don't care what other people think, because we should 
care," Candace says. "But when it's about hair color or clothes, well, then I 
just laugh. We should worry more about what's on the inside. If someone doesn't 
want to hang out with me because of my appearance, then we really do have 
nothing in common." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Leilani: "Some kids are jealous because they're parents don't let them 
express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Like this girl in Candace's P.E. class who confided to Candace that she envied 
her and her circle for being so bold. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside lies with folks' preconceived notions that such punks must be 
druggies or scumbags, they say. The price one pays for not being a preppy. 
Fortunately, they add, their parents don't fall into that category. 
</P>
<P>
 Candace, who just moved to Laguna Beach from Newport Beach, doesn't fear that 
she will have to choose between purple locks and not attending school, unlike 
yours truly. I was threatened with expulsion from Fountain Valley High a decade 
ago for coloring my hair bright blue. Candace has already discovered her new 
neighbors more accepting. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Punk fashion has entered the mainstream, courtesy of aging punks who are now 
in the position of pushing the pop culture agendas they grew up with -- kind of 
like what the boomers have been doing for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 And while some Woodstock fogies complained about the violent nature of 
"moshing" at the recent fest, the new generation didn't blink. The perceived 
violence, they say, is just that. Granted, the pit can be a danger zone for the 
easily bruised. But it is just an outlet for rowdy behavior, says Leilani, 
which is better than acting out in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she adds, "you wouldn't ballroom dance to this kind of music. Punk 
rock just gets your adrenaline jumping." And if you get knocked down in the pit 
of swarming, slamming bodies? "Mostly everyone is friendly enough to help you 
get back up," Leilani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another element of punk that's become user-friendly is the fashion. Indeed, 
most genuine punk style, ripped fishnets and all, looks neat compared to 
grunge. Big name designers went punk last season, even adding new spin-offs of 
vintage gear to their collections; a favorite was the "Never Mind the Bollocks, 
Here's the Sex Pistols" T-shirt of the British band's first album. 
</P>
<P>
 But does this mean the current punk culture is a counterfeit, rehashed for the 
masses of a new generation who should admit that this is just another retro 
scene along with rockabilly or mod? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, punk rock has always been filled with contradictions. From the 
start, the Sex Pistols were signed with major recording labels. And time would 
only honor the genius of the co-creator of the Sex Pistols' "God Save the 
Queen" 1977 logo (you know, the one with the words taped over Queen Elizabeth's 
eyes and mouth). The designer, Vivienne Westwood, has since made it to the 
Paris runways and has twice been named England's designer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no longer about acting out rebellion and anarchy," admits Dathan 
Ahrentzen, 15, a sophomore at Laguna Hills High School and the drummer for the 
band Kids From Space. Dathan put together KFS with three other school friends 
who share his enthusiasm for punk's fast, haphazard form of rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad thinks the whole punk attitude is screw authority," Dathan says. "It's 
still about questioning authority, but it's also about fun. We're not out there 
to force-feed anything to anyone. We're not singing about 'do this' or 'be 
that.' We're just here to have fun, make our friends happy. Our motto is 'we 
don't care if you like us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An outcome of the punk revolt has been the fruition of hundreds of bands such 
as KFS and just as many do-it-yourself record labels, most of them 
home-recording projects. Consider KFS among the ranks, with the quartet 
distributing its four-track demo tape through independent record stores and 
alternative clothing boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the influence of newer acts such as Naked Aggression and FYP, it's the 
oldies but goodies such as the Dead Kennedys, Adolescents, Circle Jerks, Minor 
Threat and the Germs who are considered the masters. Dathan's hero is the 
Germs' abrasive Darby Crash, who overdosed in 1980, joining Sid Vicious in 
legendary death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm personally into the old stuff, but we play the new (brand of punk)," he 
says, adding that new punk features songs that are longer and "happier" in 
tone. Vintage punk style is fast, with shorter songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dathan once favored Offspring or Green Day. That is, before they "sold out" 
their punk roots, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Make it big on the charts and MTV and you're suddenly considered a sell-out? 
I'm reminded of a comment made by Mike Lohrman, owner of Underdog Records, who, 
at age 26, has spent the better part of his life living the punk lifestyle. 
"These kids need something to be angry about," he says. "Their parents are cool 
about what they're doing; their teachers have seen it all and probably grew up 
on it. So they need something to rebel against." 
</P>
<P>
 What Dathan, like many before him, is rebelling against is any perceived 
closeness with the Great Establishment, a hit record included and all the cash 
that comes with it. He points out that old adage that "punk rock isn't about 
the money, it's about what you believe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Back when punk started," he begins, "when you saw someone with a green 
Mohawk, you knew they were your soul mate." (Dathan has tinted his cropped 'do 
red, white, yellow and black. It's now peroxide orange.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Now if you saw them, you couldn't know for sure. They probably just saw it on 
MTV and thought it was cool." He sounds like my friend; maybe the two punks 
from different eras -- hell, different generations -- do have something to talk 
about, like how the revolution hasn't quite finished its cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Dathan, quoting one of his favorite old bands, "It's like Exploited says: 
'Punk's not dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, neither is disco. 
</P>

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; PUSHING FOR A 'LEMON LAW' WITH MORE BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Automobile quality has increased so much in the last 10 years that many buyers 
mistakenly believe that they no longer have to worry about getting stuck with a 
lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, thousands of new cars sold in California each year are the subject of 
arbitration. An unknown number of additional cases end up in various courts. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, consumer advocates are fighting to strengthen California's "lemon 
law," which is widely regarded by consumer organizations as among the weakest 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, auto makers can offer arbitration to dissatisfied 
motorists, but some of these arbitration programs do not meet state guidelines. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by the California Public Interest Research Group showed marked 
discrepancies in the records of those auto makers that do offer certified 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn far outperformed all other makes, having just one arbitration complaint 
for every 2,623 cars sold in 1993. Volkswagen had the worst record with one 
dispute for every 37 vehicles sold. 
</P>
<P>
 In rising order of complaints per car sold in California, the others were 
Infiniti, Lexus, Nissan, Toyota, General Motors, Chrysler, Ford and Isuzu. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda, Acura and Hyundai have uncertified arbitration programs, while BMW, 
Mazda, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Subaru and Suzuki have no programs at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, when California car owners do file for arbitration, they are likely 
to fare worse than motorists in other states. Just 25% of arbitration 
complaints led to a refund or replacement in California, compared to 48% in New 
York, 50% in Florida and 64% in Washington, according to a study by Motor 
Voters, a Sacramento consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) introduced a bill in the California 
Assembly this year that would mandate a state-run arbitration program covering 
all car makers, financed by a $3 tax on every new car sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill allows a motorist to arbitrate if a car maker was unable to fix a 
defect after three attempts in the first 12 months, among other tough 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry has been fighting the bill and may yet defeat it. Jane 
Lightfoot, an attorney for the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn., said 
auto makers do not oppose arbitration, but the Speier bill has provisions that 
"would be injurious to the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Lightfoot expressed concern that the $3 tax is too high and auto makers would 
not get a fair chance to fix a problem before getting into arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly passed the measure in June, but the bill faces stiff Senate 
opposition as the session draws to a close.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; ONE ON ONE; EVERY KID HAS A COUNSELOR AT ST. 
MARGARET'S SUMMER CAMP FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. IN A FIRST-PERSON 
ACCOUNT BY A FIRST-TIMER, A STUDENT TELLS ABOUT THE FEARS AND CHALLENGES SHE 
FACED LEADING A GIRL WITH CEREBRAL PALSY THROUGH A WEEK OF ACTIVITIES AT THE 
SCHOOL'S SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO CAMPUS. THE PAYOFF? THE FUN -- AND THE EYE-OPENING 
EXPERIENCES -- WERE MUTUAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN FREEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Jean Freeman will be a junior this fall 
at St. Margaret's Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a compliment that came with the unspoken understanding that there would 
be much work involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaplain at St. Margaret's Episcopal School told me he thought I would 
make a great counselor for the school's Special Camp for Special Kids, held 
each summer for children with physical and mental impairments. 
</P>
<P>
 Was I willing to give up several precious weeks of summer for this? After 
thinking it over, I decided it would be a great experience and signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 The day camp, founded in 1992, is headquartered on the grounds of St. 
Margaret's school in San Juan Capistrano. There are four one-week sessions 
during the summer with a one-to-one camper-counselor ratio. About 25 campers 
attend each week and range in age from 6 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors, drawn from the student body at St. Margaret's and nearby high 
schools, must attend a week of training before camp starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of us was assigned to one camper. We called the camper's parents before 
the session began to talk about the child's special abilities or needs. Some 
campers, for example, would require help in eating, walking and using the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 I was nervous before camp began. Many "what ifs" entered my head: What if my 
camper didn't like me, what if she would not eat? I had never had any 
experience with the handicapped.  
</P>
<P>
 During our training, we had to answer the question, "What do you want to get 
out of this camp?" I focused on the fact that a handicap is not a barrier to 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 I was still scared, though, hoping that I could handle the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie was my camper. She has cerebral palsy, a nervous system disorder that 
impairs motor skills. When I called and talked with her mother, I found out 
that Katie, who is 12, had attended camp last year and was excited about 
returning this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, since she was a camp veteran, it was more like Katie showing 
me the ropes. Although Katie could not speak, she could use a couple of signs. 
They were "I love you" and "eat." And she could blow kisses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though we never talked, the relationship we formed in one week was 
unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie was always smiling, pointing and clapping. Every day there was an 
off-campus activity. Our group went to Knott's Berry Farm, bowling and 
rope-climbing. And we ate plenty of pizza.  
</P>
<P>
 I think Katie enjoyed the horseback riding the most. Even though it took three 
of us 35 minutes to coax her into wearing a helmet, once she got on the horse 
she couldn't stop smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 At times I would get frustrated -- when Katie wouldn't eat, go to the bathroom 
or ended up getting food all over her clothes. But when she would blow me a 
kiss, all my frustrations would vanish. And she always knew how to make me 
smile. By midweek, she started grabbing my shirt, indicating that she knew who 
I was.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone enjoyed Katie. If you clapped, she clapped. If you were wearing a 
hat, she would pull it off and laugh. By the end of the week, I felt confident 
that I had indeed gotten to know Katie. Gone was my anxiety from earlier in the 
week. It was hard to believe how fast a connection was made. And I wasn't the 
only counselor with this feeling. By the end of the week, counselors and 
campers were very close. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an eye-opening experience, a reminder that these kids are like all 
kids. They like pizza, they like to play tricks and they fight with mom and 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though my job was to be a counselor, I didn't feel like a counselor. I 
felt like a friend. On the last day, each counselor gave their camper an award. 
I gave Katie the "blowing kisses" award. She then gave me a kiss on my cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 My week as a counselor was hard work and my patience was definitely put to the 
test, but it was a great experience. Katie was to attend the other three 
sessions of camp and I hoped her next three counselors could keep up with her. 
</P>
<P>
 As I said goodby to Katie, she blew me one last kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't wait for next year.

OC HIGH: NEWS AND VIEWS; NEW MUSEUMS ARE MORE THAN DIORAMAS AND STUFFED 
DINOSAURS; EDUCATION: CENTERS FOR LEARNING, INCLUDING ONE PROPOSED FOR SANTA 
ANA IN 1997, INCLUDE PLENTY OF HANDS-ON EXHIBITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG DALTON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Museums and learning centers around the country are trying to turn students on 
to science by encouraging them to touch, grab and yank the exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s there were about 20 facilities with interactive exhibits 
primarily for science education, including the acclaimed Museum of Science and 
Industry in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are more than 280 such user-friendly science centers and another 
40 on the way, mostly outside major metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
 (Among the proposed new centers: A Discovery Science Center in Santa Ana that 
would cost about $19 million to build and is expected to draw more than 600,000 
visitors annually. Proposed for opening in 1997, the center would include 
76,000 square feet of interactive science exhibits and an IMAX theater.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The big cities have usually had one for a number of years," says Ellen 
Griffee, spokeswoman for the Assn. of Science-Technology Centers. "And now 
mid-size cities are saying 'we need one, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Science Imaginarium in Waterloo, Iowa, is one recently established museum. 
Others include Headwaters Science Center in Bemidgi, Minn., and Science 
Spectrum in Lubbock, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trend doesn't stop in Lubbock. India and other countries are also 
discovering less traditional science museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the fastest kind of museum growth in the world," says Alan J. Friedman, 
a board member of the association and director of the New York Hall of Science. 
</P>
<P>
 At the New York museum, fun is the name of the game, and visitors don't have 
to memorize any scientific names -- though plenty of them are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can gain a subtle appreciation for scientific principles by playing 
with interactive exhibits such as a 400-pound pendulum or a hoop for making 
bubbles big enough to swallow a person. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exhibits are props to be used in learning experiences, controlled or 
not," Friedman says. 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to the lively museum, originally built for the 1964-65 World's Fair, 
doesn't necessarily offer "a specific fact or curriculum you can learn and 
master the rules of nature," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules you learn to make (the exhibits) work are nature's rules. You will 
get a sense that there are rules in nature," he says enthusiastically. "Later, 
you'll learn the names of the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest exhibit at the user-friendly museum is "SoundSensations: The Inside 
Story of Audio." 
</P>
<P>
 The most innovative of the dozen or so interactive displays, "Singing Shadows: 
An Artist's Piece by Ron Kuivila," is a dark room in which beams of light are 
focused on three translucent panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can become part of an ensemble by walking or dancing in the light, 
which is recorded by video cameras linked to a synthesizer that produces 
synchronistic sound. Though they are not given a scientific explanation of what 
is happening, kids get a sense of the connection between light, movement and 
sound, relationships at the heart of audio technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Another nearby display, "Vocal Variety: An Artist's Piece by Paul DeMarinis," 
is a phone booth equipped with 12 different sound effects to transform your 
voice, while you watch a visual trace of both your normal and your distorted 
voice on a video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Press the "Monotone" button and you sound like political adviser Mary Matalin. 
</P>
<P>
 Touch the "Whisper" button and you sound like John Malkovich talking to Clint 
Eastwood in the movie "In the Line of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Hit "Regular" and you are yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 That's cute, but skeptics may wonder how much of this translates into 
measurable results. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman says a recent study indicates people often cite museums as their 
reason for becoming scientists, something this country needs. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those who don't make science their life, Friedman and his colleagues 
have a very simple goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know people are afraid of science. Our goal is to give them both the 
ambition and the confidence to learn."

OC HIGH: STUDENT; VIDEO GAME REVIEW; DOUBLE DRAGON V: THE SHADOW FALLS; FOR 
SUPER NINTENDO BY WILLIAMS ENTERTAINMENT. NO SUGGESTED RETAIL COST.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM SCHIFFMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy and Jimmy Lee, proud products of the Dragon Dojo, have returned as the 
stars of their own martial arts fighting game. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls, there's a lot of fighting to do. 
</P>
<P>
 DD5 drops the Lee boys into the now-familiar Street Fighter II combat mode -- 
mano-a-mano with a bizarre series of martial monsters. Defeat the 10 men and 
women who stand in the way and your champion earns the right to fight the 
Shadow Master, martial meanie deluxe and the guy who personally started World 
Wars I and II. 
</P>
<P>
 The game gives you four modes -- tournament, a vs. battle, quest and a demo 
section. You also have two "administrative" modes -- options and dossiers, in 
which you learn interesting things about your enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, did you know that Countdown, a cyborg assembled during Mardi 
Gras and sold as rejected scrap, plays accordion with a zydeco band when he's 
not trying to disassemble the Lee twins? 
</P>
<P>
 Options include variable difficulty, adjustable time limit, continues (up to 
five) and a chance to customize the controller. Pay attention to this one and 
try several alternatives until you find one that's comfortable. Remember that, 
like Street Fighter II, your fighter has more than two-dozen moves, and some 
involve major controller contortions. 
</P>
<P>
 The L, X and Y control the hard, medium and light punch, respectively, with R, 
A and B handling matching kicks. The directional pad controls a variety of 
jumps, crouches and attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 And you can play as either of the Lees, or as one of the Shadow Master's 
flunkies, in the vs. mode. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a dozen venues available, including the Dragon Dojo, a chemical 
factory, the Metro City Hotel and three views of the Shadow Dojo, including 
that popular vacation destination, the Shadow Dungeon. You can select from 
among them if you are in the two-player mode; otherwise, the CPU will pick an 
opponent and location for you. 
</P>
<P>
 DD5 plays like most of the martial arts games that followed SFII, but it has 
its own charm. Graphics are clean, colorful and crisply drawn. The combat, 
especially in the Hard mode, is rough-and-tumble, and the controls work 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't generally talk about the instruction manual, but DD5's booklet is 
special. Jimmy and Billy, who have their own syndicated TV show, appear in a 
comic strip explanation of how everything works, written in plain English and 
aided by the drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, DD5 is a solid, entertaining addition to the list of fighting 
games, one that will give you hours of fun pounding baddies to paste. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 There have to be millions, maybe billions, of Game Boy carts moldering on 
shelves or in boxes at homes where a Super Nintendo is now the focus of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo had those tiny, orphan carts in mind when it created Super Game Boy, 
an add-on that plugs into the cart slot on your SNES. A slot at the top of the 
SGB is just the right size for Game Boy carts. 
</P>
<P>
 Slip one in and you'll be amazed at what happens. Those teenie little images 
explode in size, and you can even pick from a selection of colors -- shades of 
four colors with GB carts you already own and up to 256 with new carts designed 
for SGB. 
</P>
<P>
 The first SGB cart is a revival of one of the most popular of the early video 
games, Donkey Kong. Putting it on the big screen really makes a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a drawer full of GB carts you rarely look at, spend $59.95 and get 
yourself a Super Game Boy. It will give those little games a big new lease on 
life.

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; VOICES OF RAGE, PAIN AT WOUNDED KNEE PIERCE THE HEART; 
BULLET HEART BY MICHAEL DOANE ; ALFRED A. KNOPF $23, 316 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do we remember of Wounded Knee? Not the battle in 1890 that was later 
recognized as a massacre, but the confrontation with American Indian Movement 
activists on the Pine Ridge Sioux reservation in South Dakota in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 We remember that two FBI agents were killed, that AIM leaders were imprisoned 
and that Native Americans were still agitating years afterward for their 
release. That's about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Doane brings those faded news clippings back to life in "Bullet 
Heart," a novel that tells the story of Wounded Knee and related conflicts 
through the voices of white people and Native Americans alike, then dares to 
leave the apparent climax in the middle and go on to trace its effects on the 
lives of participants and witnesses two decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet Heart is the name of a boy wounded in the Bones War before he is even 
born. His mother, Delores Her Many Horses, is Sioux; his father, Tyrone Little, 
is a white sympathizer distrusted by members of the tribe.  
</P>
<P>
 Her Many Horses leaves the fictional Clay Creek reservation; Little finds her 
in a bar in a neighboring town with a man named Harold Bad Hand. Bad Hand tries 
to pull a gun and Little shoots him. The bullet passes through him, hits the 
pregnant woman and lodges next to the unborn baby's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Doane pauses here. We don't know who Bad Hand is, why Little shot him, why Her 
Many Horses left Little, or whether the victims lived or died. We backtrack to 
an account of the Bones War, which begins when developers of a golf course next 
to the reservation town of Choteau dig up a pioneer cemetery. Bones of whites 
are ceremoniously reburied, but the bones of a Sioux girl are declared state 
artifacts and taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrations at Pierre, the state capital, achieve nothing. Native American 
anger mounts. On the reservation, AIM militants and "traditionals" square off 
against supporters of Bureau of Indian Affairs rule. Drunken men in pickups 
roam the dirt roads with rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, across the line, on hundreds of thousands of acres that belonged to 
the reservation before whites nibbled them away, young Gaetan Avril allies 
himself with Little and Sioux leader John Fire Smith as a way of dismantling 
his father's empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Isaac McCaslin in Faulkner's "The Bear," who refused to inherit land 
tainted by slavery, Avril broods over records showing that his father snapped 
up 19,000 acres from Native Americans during the Depression. The former 
landowners live on the government dole, in trailers and tar-paper shacks 
surrounded by weeds and junked cars, drowning their despair in alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 As Her Many Horses says: "There's a black hole we're always staring into and 
after a while we just jump in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bones War terrorizes but reinvigorates Choteau. Noah Lame, a college 
graduate who tried and failed to live in the white world, sees his skin "turn 
red again." Lame's son, Herman, builds a sweat lodge and becomes a spiritual 
leader. Old men and women relive the tortured past; young people discover their 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Doane describes the violence through multiple points of view, as if in 
fragments of a broken mirror. When it's over -- when two FBI agents and two 
Native Americans, including Herman Lame, are dead; when Smith and Little are in 
prison -- we know some things. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, we know that Bad Hand, who shot one of the agents, is a killer 
who was paroled in return for agreeing to spy for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 But major questions remain. We still don't know who Little is, where his true 
sympathies lie or why Avril gave him a farm and a house to live in. Nor do we 
know why Avril, aside from the land-grabbing issue, hates his father and his 
father's friends so intensely. 
</P>
<P>
 A documentary would have to stop here, though, because the shooting is over. 
At most, it would add a brief epilogue. Doane risks another 100-plus pages. 
He's betting on the power of Little's and Avril's stories. They are powerful, 
even melodramatic, although his shifting back and forth in time and his 
fragmented way of telling their stories tends to play down the melodrama. Most 
of all, he's betting on the voices. 
</P>
<P>
 He wins. Doane's voices -- terse and eloquent, bitter and authoritative -- are 
a triumph of imagination. The sweetest of them is the voice of Joseph Her Many 
Horses, a.k.a. Bullet Heart, who has indeed survived to mow the fairways of the 
golf course where yet more Native American bones lie buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet Heart's eventual meeting with Little and Smith only confirms what his 
very existence has suggested: that Wounded Knee was less an end than a 
beginning.

MOVIE REVIEW; STONE REMOVES THE GLOVES IN 'KILLERS'; A MURDERING COUPLE BECOMES 
MEDIA DARLINGS IN THE DIRECTOR'S RELENTLESS WORK OF VISUAL DEXTERITY 
</P>

<P>
 "Natural Born Killers" is the movie Oliver Stone was born to make, and if that 
statement is a knife that cuts both ways, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 A filmmaker celebrated and excoriated, recipient of a pair of best director 
Oscars for "Platoon" and "Born on the Fourth of July" as well as the contempt 
of the political establishment for "JFK," Stone has not exactly had a tranquil 
career. Yet nothing he's attempted before is adequate preparation for the 
over-the-top savagery and carefully controlled madness that is "Natural Born 
Killers." 
</P>
<P>
 The picaresque, satirical adventures of till-death-do-us-part serial murderers 
Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis) and their road to 
international celebrity, "Natural Born Killers" is both audacious and 
astonishing, a vision of a charnel house apocalypse that comes close to defying 
description. 
</P>
<P>
 So unyielding violent and blood-splattered it took five trips to the ratings 
board to earn its R, "Killers" (which carries an advisory label unprecedented 
in its length and detail) is too consumed by carnage to be to everyone's taste. 
But it is also, and perhaps more lastingly, a tribute to the power of film and 
the skill of a director who, for the first and perhaps the only time in his 
career, has taken the gloves off with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of Stone's previous work can be seen as a prolonged attempt to 
pretend, with varying degrees of success, that he is an orthodox filmmaker. But 
after continuously trying to squeeze his crazed/visionary sense of the medium 
into Hollywood's inelastic forms, of making at times awkward films that were 
equal parts conventional and maniacal, Stone has found subject matter that can 
tolerate his style at its most outrageous and disturbing. The effect has been 
liberating. 
</P>
<P>
 Screen violence poster boy Quentin Tarantino, whose Palme d'Or-winning "Pulp 
Fiction" seems almost tame compared to this, wrote the original script for 
"Killers." But Stone, working with co-screenwriters David Veloz and Richard 
Rutowski, has so made this project his own that Tarantino has kept his 
aesthetic distance, settling for no more than a "story by" credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many loners-on-the-loose films before it, "Natural Born Killers" opens 
in a bleak roadside diner. Mickey, a slight grin playing behind his rose-tinted 
granny glasses, is sitting at the counter deciding to "give the key lime pie 
its day in court," while Mallory, in a skimpy halter top that reveals her 
scorpion tattoo, is dancing provocatively by the jukebox when some 
rough-and-ready locals slam through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't require much intuition to figure out that no good will come from 
this unforeseen meeting. But though the ensuing slaughter is inevitable, Stone, 
cinematographer Robert Richardson (a Stone regular) and editors Hank Corwin and 
Brian Berdan bring things off with so much visual panache we don't know whether 
to be impressed or horrified. Or both. 
</P>
<P>
 While this kind of "Badlands on speed" opening is outrageous, how far Stone 
and company are willing to go is not apparent until the next set piece, when 
what might have been an ordinary look at Mallory's tortured childhood is shown 
as a warped TV sitcom called "I Love Mallory," complete with heart symbol, 
laugh track and a wisecracking, malignant Rodney Dangerfield startling as a 
sexually abusive toad of a father. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Mickey, forever after to be her knight, who shows up to deliver 50 
pounds of beef and rescues Mallory from this pit. And the almost continuous 
murder spree that follows is intercut with juvenile protestations of endless 
love and a goony joining of vows that includes Mickey's wistful determination 
"not to murder anybody on our wedding day." 
</P>
<P>
 As unnerving as "Killers' " plot is, relating it can only hint at what the 
experience is like on film. For Stone, in a brilliant display of visual 
dexterity, has so heedlessly, even recklessly, piled image on top of image -- 
color, black and white, tinted stock, video, double exposures, animation and 
more -- that surrender to the onslaught seems the only option. 
</P>
<P>
 More than showing highlights of M&M's three-week murder spree and their 48 (or 
is it 52?) victims, "Killers" is intent as well on visually taking us inside 
their minds. This means that a constantly changing array of images is projected 
on any surface that is handy, everything from shots of animals having sex to 
Edward Curtis' vintage ethnographic footage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Equally eclectic, and just as essential in creating mood, is the "Killers" 
redoubtable soundtrack, containing more than 75 selections including Nine Inch 
Nails (whose Trent Reznor put it all together), Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the 
Shangri-Las and the story's poet laureate, Leonard Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Unusual for a film whose effects are so dependent on the bombardment of 
stimuli, the cast's satiric acting is on target as well. Not only are Harrelson 
and Lewis all they should be, they are matched by both Tom Sizemore as twisted 
criminal investigator Jack Scagnetti and Tommy Lee Jones as a feisty prison 
warden. Best of the lot is Robert Downey Jr. as Wayne Gale, the blabbering 
Australian host of TV's hottest show, "American Maniacs," intended, he fondly 
admits, for "the nitwits out there in zombie-land." 
</P>
<P>
 And the nitwits, "Natural Born Killers" amusingly and horrifically points out, 
are eating it up. Mickey and Mallory become the ultimate international media 
darlings, cover subjects for Newsweek and People and captivating fans like the 
wanna-be victim who holds up a hopeful "Murder Me, Mickey" sign during one of 
M&M's courtroom appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, not surprisingly, the chance to examine the how and why of this kind 
of celebrity-hood that initially motivated Stone to make "Killers," and, aside 
from his technical wizardry, that is the element that makes the excesses 
palatable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For unlike any number of films, the excruciating violence and gore here is not 
done to titillate. The idea, witness O.J. Simpson and the Menendez brothers, is 
to mock our societal fascination with blood-letting, to hold up a cracked 
mirror and literally force a reconsideration of what we're doing as a culture 
and where it seems to be leading. This nightmare world in flames that's making 
you wince, Stone is saying, it's the one we live in right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this all come off as planned? Of course not. "Natural Born Killers" lacks 
the rigor of the similarly themed, little seen Belgian film "Man Bites Dog," 
and it has twinges of its own kind of sentimentality, especially in the scenes 
involving Russell Means as an all-knowing (is there any other kind?) tribal 
shaman. Plus, if you don't find yourself on the film's often warped wavelength, 
the nonstop violence will sicken and offend you. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the frisson of directorial energy Stone infuses this film with, 
we can't help but be affected by its sensory barrage. Watching "Natural Born 
Killers" is like sitting next to a wild man driving at 90 m.p.h. in order to 
convince you to wear a seat belt. You may wish he'd slow down a bit, but it's 
hard to argue with the effectiveness of the tools at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R for extreme violence and graphic carnage, for shocking 
images, and for strong language and sexuality. Times guidelines: Although the 
violence is not literally nonstop, it feels as though it is. 'Natural Born 
Killers'

MUSIC REVIEW; JARVI, DETROIT SYMPHONY OFFER RUSSIAN WORKS AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Variety and versatility are important facets in an orchestra's credentials. 
Wednesday night at the Hollywood Bowl, the Detroit Symphony expanded the strong 
profile it had projected Tuesday, sounding like an even more accomplished 
ensemble. Part of the reason lay in repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Music Director Neeme Jarvi had led an elegant, unhackneyed pops program at the 
ensemble's first concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, his Russian program, offering first the novelty of a suite 
from Tchaikovsky's incidental music to the play "The Snow Maiden," then 
Rachmaninoff's ubiquitous Third Piano Concerto and finally Shostakovich's Sixth 
Symphony, focused on different virtues of his orchestra. It also revealed some 
of the conductor's own, serious aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Shostakovich's Sixth may remain a work of emotional enigmas, but Jarvi's 
performance had strong and definite ideas, compellingly presented. Moreover, 
for all the aural satisfaction the Detroit Symphony had provided at its first 
performance, this one showed the orchestra off to even better advantage. 
Balances became reliable, and singlemindedness was achieved with some 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 A genuinely integrated symphonic sound, plus measurable contrasts of color and 
dynamics, characterized the long opening movement in the Sixth; Jarvi held 
tight reins over continuity throughout the piece, letting it speak and neither 
pushing nor impeding its natural pace. The work emerged effectively emotional 
and at the same time restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 For an extended opener, six excerpts from the "Snow Maiden" score became a 
welcome alternative to more usual Tchaikovsky fare. The competent mezzo-soprano 
soloist was Russian opera singer Irina Lekhtman; she sounded pleasant enough, 
but lit no fires. 
</P>
<P>
 As the soloist in the D-minor Concerto, British pianist Peter Donohoe again 
showed himself a charmless and prosaic Rachmaninovian, one who plays lots of 
notes efficiently, but colors this music seldom. 
</P>
<P>
 Donohoe produces a tone that combines dullness with stridency, and remains 
constantly monochromatic. As a result, the work on this occasion seemed longer 
than we know it is. Even so, a crowd of 8,971 gave him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of both evenings, encores capped the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Jarvi and his Detroit orchestra played the Romance from 
Shostakovich's score to the film "The Gadfly." Wednesday, that piece was again 
offered after the program proper, along with Prokofiev's March from the opera 
"The Love for Three Oranges."

MOVIE REVIEW; 'KILLING ZOE': AN IN-YOUR-FACE STORY ABOUT A BANK HEIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bank heist genre has made it into a new generation with its nose bloodied. 
"Killing Zoe" is a raucous, arty little neo-film-noir that comes equipped with 
a bucket of blood to splatter the halls of convention. It's not terribly good 
but you keep expecting it to take off in unexpected directions. Writer-director 
Roger Roberts Avary does have a genuine gift for hysteria -- not exactly the 
most welcome gift these days -- but his film finally collapses into a 
hyper-driven snit fit. 
</P>
<P>
 We're introduced in the beginning to Zed (Eric Stoltz), a stringy-haired 
American safecracker recently arrived in Paris to hook up with a childhood 
friend, Eric (Jean-Hugues Anglade), who is planning a bank robbery with his 
heroin-hooked gang on Bastille Day. Zed starts things out with a languorous 
tryst with a peppy prostie, Zoe (Julie Delpy), who, post-passion, informs Zed 
they both have "Z" names. (This film should carry a bumper sticker, Warning: We 
Brake for Symbolism.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Avary is American, as well as a few of his actors and his 
co-producers (one of whom is Quentin "van Gogh" Tarantino), and even though an 
L.A. bank doubled for most of the interiors, the film at its worst still has 
the luridly vapid tone of a real French neo-noir like "Subway." (A lot of it is 
subtitled into English.) Avary converts his in-your-face attitude into an 
aesthetic. Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers," which has a story credited to 
Tarantino, has the same swagger, but it's much bossier about buzz-sawing you 
with its bad ideas. At least "Killing Zoe" swaggers to a simpler beat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's jazzy and hot-footed in its early sequences, when Zed goes on a 
robbery-eve joy ride that turns into a druggies' delirium. Avary keeps things 
loose and wiggy in these opening sequences, and so it's a letdown when the bank 
heist kicks in and we're left with a lot of hollering and gunplay and cornball 
Theater of the Absurd theatrics. Anglade, in particular, seems hellbent for 
glory. He's trying to turn his character into Antonin Artaud with an Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
 The film sides with Zed throughout, and when he begins to realize that his old 
friend is a raving psychopath, the action takes on some resonance. But, for 
someone as wised-up and world-weary as Zed appears to be, this realization 
comes painfully late. (If it came earlier there wouldn't be a movie.) And since 
the bank robbers -- who also include Gary Kemp, who was chilling as Ronnie Kray 
in "The Krays" -- are such out-of-control incompetents, there's not much 
suspense about how it will all turn out. The heist rapidly becomes existential 
-- i.e. boring. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why Avary juices the screen with ultra-violence. He couldn't 
figure out a clever way to get his guys out of there. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for strong violence and language, drug use and a sex scene. 
Times guidelines: It includes lots of nasty, close-up violence and explicit 
sex.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'WAGONS EAST!' -- CANDY'S FINAL FILM -- JUST POKES ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Candy has one truly funny moment in "Wagons East!," the Western comedy 
that had nearly finished shooting when he died suddenly early this year. As the 
reluctant wagonmaster James Harlow, he turns back to the barful of 
eager-for-exodus townsfolk who're counting on him and proclaims, "We leave at 
dawn." The cloud of a second thought passes over his face, then a shrug: ". . . 
Noonish," he wavers. 
</P>
<P>
 That perfect kicker was improvised by Candy on the set, so clearly the great 
comic had some of his best instincts intact to the end. But these instincts 
obviously rarely extended to picking projects, and "Wagons East!" is a 
typically rickety vehicle, just dumb enough that it actually submerges Candy's 
sweet, perky persona in what's basically a sullen, grizzled straight-man role. 
He'd made worse, but fans hoping against hope for a worthy career kicker might 
want to get their horses turned around now. 
</P>
<P>
 The script takes off from an all-too-promisingly rich premise: The pioneers of 
a Western town -- fed up with bank robberies, a lack of culture and dust in 
general -- become the first Americans to turn tail and head back east en masse. 
"This country was founded by quitters," co-star Richard Lewis explains to his 
kids. "English quitters, French quitters. . . ." A tribe of initially warlike 
Native Americans even opts to help with the settlers' reverse wagon drive. "I 
just like seeing them go in that direction," the chief explains to his confused 
son, in subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, though, the picture slips out of satire into listless, sub-Brooksian 
spoofery and scatology -- it's "Snoozing Saddles," all the way down to a 
shameless re-creation of its obvious antecedent's campfire-fart scene. There 
are anachro-Western types aplenty: a gold-hearted hooker (Ellen Greene, 
sounding as if she might any moment break into "Suddenly Seymour"); an effete, 
terribly tasteful gay settler (John C. McGinley, saying "super!" a lot and 
wearing lavender); a Wile E. Coyote-like villain sent by the railroad barons to 
stop the settlers' return (Ed Lauter), and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Peter Markle is a little too busy balancing this scattershot ensemble 
to devote quality time to leads Lewis and Candy, who both seem unnaturally 
tamed. The movie could have used more of Lewis' neurotic shtick ("I'm 
anti-handgun," he explains, challenged to a duel) to get across just how much 
these bi-continental wanna-bes really belong back Manhattan way. And Candy's 
countenance is curiously buried beneath a frontiersman's bushy beard and long, 
floppy bangs; without much to do but look haggard and withdrawn, he seems 
vaguely ghostly before his time. 
</P>
<P>
 After some of the summer's bigger-budget comedy busts, "Wagons East!" feels 
fairly painless, at least, though Matthew Carlson's script ought to have 
screamed "small screen" to the green-lighters who let this convoy pass. As for 
last chances for fearless Candy fans, there's always the (long-delayed) 
"Canadian Bacon" still on the burner. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for language. Times guidelines: It contains mild 
language, comedy violence and sexual innuendo mostly surrounding an exaggerated 
gay character. 'Wagons East!'

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CHILDREN' A DEEPLY EMOTIONAL MEMORY-DRIVEN FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As hard as it is to be a father, being a son can be more difficult still. Well 
into his 70s, master Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman is still struggling with 
his personal history, trying to come to terms with the painful, conflicted 
relationship he had with his father, and exceptional films continue to result. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he no longer directs, Bergman has not stopped writing scripts about his 
family and passing them on to deserving pinch-hitters. He gave the Palme 
d'Or-winning "Best Intentions" to Bille August, and the director of "Sunday's 
Children" is Bergman's own son Daniel, which makes its father-son theme more 
poignant. The younger Bergman's feature debut, it is a remarkable beginning, 
simple, unhurried, yet deeply emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 This is more than a matter of having the best of scripts to work with, which 
Daniel Bergman does. Only in his early 30s, the younger man avoids missteps and 
displays the kind of ease with intense material that argues for the inheriting 
of directorial talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "Best Intentions" dealt with the courtship and early married years of 
Bergman's mismatched parents, "Sunday's Children" picks the story up in 1926, 
with 8-year-old Ingmar, nicknamed Pu, occupying an uneasy spot as the middle 
child of the stern preacher Henrik (Thommy Berggren, the star of "Elvira 
Madigan") and his more worldly wife, Karin (Lena Endre). 
</P>
<P>
 Set during a summer vacation in rural Sweden, "Sunday's Children" establishes 
its theme immediately, with the Bergmans gathering at the train station to 
welcome the head of the family home after a day spent preaching to the king and 
queen in Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially distant, refusing to stand near anyone, young Pu suddenly breaks 
into a mad run and leaps passionately into his father's arms. It's all there in 
that brief sequence, the separation and mistrust he feels toward his family and 
the parallel, almost painful need to be loved without reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The only person who can manage that, however, is the family's unaffected young 
servant Maj (Maria Bolme). Pu's mother is a distant figure, his older brother 
Dag (Jakob Leygraf) is a pitiless tease, and his father, though loving in his 
own way, is also rigid, unyielding and at the mercy of a hateful temper that is 
terrifying when unleashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Making things more difficult for Pu is that, like his father, he is a Sunday's 
child, gifted by tradition with special sight. Young as he is, he sees what 
others do not, what he is not meant to, picking up emotional currents to which 
his elders seem oblivious. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of characterization is only as believable as the actor who plays it, 
and young Henrik Linnros is marvelous at projecting an air of melancholy 
unexpected in one so small. With sadness and hurt visible in his eyes, Linnros 
possesses a naturalness that makes you believe he is being, not acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunday's Children" is an episodic, memory-driven film, with the Bergmans 
presenting a series of vignettes of incidents remembered and influences never 
forgotten. Many of these, not surprisingly, were troubling to young Pu, 
including a servant's reciting of a dark tale of violence, sexuality and 
suicide. Pu then visits the spot where the story's subject hanged himself and, 
in a vision, asks the corpse, "When will I die?" The answer, "Always," is 
especially haunting given what we know about who the lad grew up to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The most daring aspect of "Sunday's Children" is its periodic flash-forwards 
to 1968, some 40 years later, when a glum 50-year-old Ingmar pays back these 
old scores by pitilessly lecturing his lonely and dying father. It is only now, 
a quarter of a century later, that the elder Bergman is able to take the 
tentative steps toward forgiveness that this film represents. 
</P>
<P>
 For though it can't shake its air of sadness, "Sunday's Children" by no means 
ends up a dour picture. Director Daniel Bergman has the gift of being able to 
recapture lost time, especially time as it is viewed through the special lens 
of childhood, and there are elegiac moments in this film that will stay with 
you forever. For all its melancholy, this is a world we do not want to leave. 
</P>
<P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CAMP NOWHERE': A PLACE TO SHOWCASE ACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ingenious and amusing "Camp Nowhere" fulfills every summer camp veteran's 
dream of escaping all those killjoy rules, while spotlighting the antic talents 
of Christopher Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd, the eccentric Doc of the "Back to the Future" trilogy and Uncle Fester 
in "The Addams Family" movies, plays anarchic Dennis Van Welker, an exuberant 
former junior high drama teacher relieved of his duties after he thought it 
would be a good idea to attempt a musical version of "Silence of the Lambs." 
</P>
<P>
 He's living in a ramshackle trailer when he's recruited by Morris "Mud" Himmel 
(Jonathan Jackson), a bright adolescent who's come up with a grand scheme to 
set up an alternative summer camp so that he and his classmates can escape 
those dreaded places their parents have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is that Van Welker will impersonate a computer nerd camp director to 
impress Mud's rigid father (Peter Scolari), who wants to send his son off to 
Camp Microchippewa. He will then impersonate directors of military, diet and 
theater summer camps so that Mud's closest friends -- and virtually all his 
classmates -- will likewise be free of such regulated summers. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Welker does so well that Mud is able to collect sufficient parental funds 
to rent the run-down Camp Nowhere, where he and his pals will be able to enjoy 
a summer of fun without adult regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids soon discover that there aren't any good times without responsibility 
-- somebody has to be a leader, everybody has to pitch in for KP duties. 
</P>
<P>
 This provides the background for Lloyd to carry on gleefully as Van Welker, 
whom writers/executive producers Andrew Kurtzman and Eliot Wald deftly bring 
back into the action after the youngsters have had a chance to experience the 
exhilaration of total freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Van Welker is always an eager participant in the kids' evasions from 
all representatives of authority, he's not as irresponsible as he seems, 
keeping an eye on the campers while stimulating their imaginations. Under 
feature debuting director Jonathan Prince, the film proceeds jauntily to its 
inspired climax, involving a complicated series of Parents' Day hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A painstaking, well-crafted effort, "Camp Nowhere" showcases Lloyd's winning, 
offbeat presence to maximum advantage while providing an opportunity for a raft 
of young people to shine. 
</P>
<P>
 No less impressive than the highly focused Jackson are Andrew Keegan, as a 
rebel more sensitive and intelligent than he likes to acknowledge; Marne 
Patterson, as a pretty, ultra-popular girl whose mother (Kate Mulgrew) is 
pushing her hard into an acting career; and Melody Kay, whose perfectly normal 
amount of baby fat sets her mother (Maryedith Burrell) into diet frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other adult roles are capably played by, among others, Wendy Makkena as an 
attractive and delightful physician who attracts Lloyd, M. Emmet Walsh as a 
comically intrepid repo man and Burgess Meredith as the laid-back owner of Camp 
Nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for some mild adolescent language and sensuality. Times 
guidelines: The awakening of sexual attraction is treated with exceptional 
sensitivity and taste.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; IL MORO: 'IT'S GOOD, CHEF-LESS FOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the more inexplicable restaurant names in recent days has to be Il 
Moro, the new cafe in the Executive Life building on Olympic Boulevard in West 
Los Angeles, brought to you by the Locanda Veneta/Ca'brea folk. 
</P>
<P>
 This moderately priced, casual spinoff is named for Shakespeare's Othello, the 
Moor of Venice, whose jealous heart was whipped to a frenzy that culminated in 
a grisly murder/suicide. Why name a restaurant, even a vaguely Venetian 
restaurant, after this character? The menu offers a muddled explanation: 
Othello, a Venetian who was made the ruler of Cyprus, lived in a time when 
Venice was a seat of enormous political power. 
</P>
<P>
 The name certainly doesn't give customers pause; even on a Monday night, it's 
hard to get a reservation before 8:45. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard elements in countless L.A. Italian restaurants are here given a 
new, classy spin. A small cafe area in the front of the restaurant is cozy as a 
living room. The requisite Italian grocery display is locked into lovely wood 
and glass cases lining a long entryway. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining room, with its rolling fabric ceiling, open kitchen and comfortable 
wicker chairs is appealing, but the jewel of this restaurant is the garden 
patio with its pepper trees, ferns and trickling stream. A grove of tall palms 
shields it from Olympic, and water falling from a tall terra-cotta spout 
dissolves much of the traffic noise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The service can be good-hearted and fun, but it's scant; sometimes, you'll be 
offered cheese with your pasta, sometimes not. Obtaining another bottle of 
mineral water is a challenge. The kitchen, a well-oiled machine, does send out 
food promptly, usually before the service staff is ready for it: Runners 
invariably clear salad plates as they serve entrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern Italian, faintly Venetian cooking is consistently edible if not 
memorable. As one friend says, "It's good, chef-less food," meaning there's 
nothing complex or particularly unique in these easily assembled plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a heavy coat of tomato sauce, shrimp cakes have a pleasing, springy 
bounce in each bite. Paper-thin beef carpaccio forms a moist, fragile skin 
under rumpled arugula, strands of celery root and shaved Parmigiano. In pasta e 
fagioli , beans and limp strands of fettuccini are suspended in a velvety, 
vegetal puree, but why fettuccini and not the sturdier, more pleasurable 
traditional macaroni? 
</P>
<P>
 Some salads are so big and juicy, they may be the best things here, 
particularly a special salad with frisee, slivered artichokes and arugula in a 
thirst-quenching lemon vinaigrette. The rich insalata garga brings back some of 
our favorite anachronisms from the '80s: Roasted pine nuts and hearts of palm 
are tossed with watercress, avocado and tomatoes. Only the Caesar -- limp, 
fishy and underdressed -- is uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon also informs one of the best pastas, a tagliolini so thinly dressed in 
mascarpone, Parmigiano and lemon, it appears virtually naked, but has just 
enough richness and tang to seduce. It's fabulous. Less impressive are some 
novelty pastas, whose various tomato sauces I found acidic, almost brine-y. 
Truccioli , allegedly shaped like wood-shavings, are more like toothsome hair 
curlers. Pope hat-shaped pasta, cuffie del papa , look like fluted finger 
puppets.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosaic roasted potatoes and skeins of sauteed spinach weigh down every 
entree. Grilled salmon is OK. Likewise the lamb chops, topped with a miserly 
portion of oyster mushroom. Patties of good chicken and duck sausage on smoky 
wedges of grilled polenta -- pretty darn good. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza patate seems ill-proportioned, the crust very light and bubbly, the 
browned potatoes and rosemary buried under a thick blanket of mozzarella and 
gobs of Gorgonzola. Another curiosity, pizza Americana , with hot dogs, Swiss 
cheese and onions, might be a hit with kids; not so with us. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert is a good idea here. The chocolate almond tart is as airy and 
delicately crusted as a souffle. Vanilla creme custard perhaps signals the 
welcome waning of the tyranny of creme brulee and its stick-to-your-fillings 
burnt sugar. Tiramisu is perfect in adorable individual ceramic pans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Il Moro, 11400 W. Olympic Blvd., West Los Angeles, (310) 575-3530. Open 
Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner. Beer and wine served. Valet 
parking. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only $28-$57.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: PATINETTE AT MOCA OFFERS PALETTE OF LUNCH OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA, TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What top L.A. chef has opened a humble lunch counter downtown? Two clues from 
the savvy, well-priced menu: peppered roast beef sandwich with slivered 
potatoes and caramelized onions on toasted baguette, and sweet potato salad 
with raisins and fresh coriander. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an easy guess: Potatomeister Joachim Splichal of Patina and Pinot 
Bistro.Set in the Museum of Contemporary Art, his spanking-new Patinette has a 
handful of white-clothed tables inside, more seating in the courtyard outside. 
Pick up soups, an array of salads, sandwiches and desserts at the counter. The 
surprise is the luxury of real china and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Attractive, fresh salads like Middle Eastern lentil and garbanzo or an 
Asian-accented farm-raised turkey salad can be ordered by the half-pound or in 
combinations of two or three. The guy knows how to make a sandwich too: Witness 
the moist roasted garlic chicken on country loaf with grilled scallions and 
Parmesan cheese dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Patinette's excellent price-quality ratio is definitely a sign of the times, 
one that makes Splichal's third restaurant an appealing downtown lunch option. 
Welcome to the neighborhood. (And did I mention, almost everything on the menu 
can be had to-go as well -- hey, fax your order, it's faster. However, they 
cannot, as yet, fax the food.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Patinette at MOCA, Museum of Contemporary Art, 250 S. Grand Ave., Los 
Angeles. (213) 626-1178; fax 626-0773. Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesday through 
Sunday; until 8 p.m. Thursday evenings when museum admission is free. Visa, 
Mastercard and , starting next week, American Express. Parking in museum lot. 
Appetizers $4.25-$5; sandwiches $4.95-$6.50; salads $4.95 per half-pound; 
desserts 95 cents-$3.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MANU DIBANGO PARTIES AT HOUSE OF BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA OUMANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A bit fatigue ," commented an audience member after Manu Dibango strolled 
onstage at the House of Blues Wednesday, blowing his saxophone over his band's 
laid-back, jazzy noodlings. But the funkmeister from Cameroon was just pacing 
himself.By the third number, an up-tempo Senegalese reggae tune, Dibango and 
his Pan-African band had built up a solid head of steam, and the dance floor 
was packed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been 22 years since Dibango's Afro-disco single "Soul Makossa" was a U.S. 
hit. Wednesday's benefit concert for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital 
-- also featuring a lackluster performance from South African trumpeter Hugh 
Masekela and his new band from Cape Town -- proved that while the Paris-based 
Dibango may no longer be the intrepid musical adventurer he once was, he still 
throws a great party. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the constellation of African stars (Youssou N'Dour, Ladysmith Black 
Mambazo, King Sunny Ade, Salif Keita, et al.) whose vocals and songs receive 
the Dibango treatment in his latest album, "Wakafrika," Dibango drew mostly on 
his own wealth of material to deliver in full on his stated promise to take the 
audience on a musical tour of Africa. His deep bass rap-chants seemed, as 
always, to bubble up from the Earth's core, and his two singers contributed 
sweet, if not soaring, harmonies, particularly on the evening's set-pieces -- a 
rollicking interpretation of Miriam Makeba's "Pata Pata" and an 
enthusiastically received reinvention of "Soul Makossa." ELENA OUMANO

THEATER REVIEW; BLURRED LOOK AT 'AFTERSHOCKS' OF ADOPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doug Haverty's "Aftershocks," at the Colony, is one of those sow's-ear plays 
that can't be whipstitched into a silk purse, despite the most diligent efforts 
of the cast and production team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the play, Daphne (Sandra Kinder) and her best friend Olive (Kathryn Kates) 
have left their alcoholic husbands behind in Cleveland to make a new life in 
Hollywood -- if a trailer park in Sun Valley qualifies, that is. Daphne and 
Olive have snagged a regular gig as Hollywood extras -- the fulfillment of a 
dream for fanatical film buff Daphne. Even the recent earthquake or its 
continuing aftershocks cannot shake Daphne's enthusiasm for her new life. 
</P>
<P>
 What does shake Daphne up is the arrival on her doorstep of Beth (Rachel 
Sheppard), the baby Daphne gave up for adoption 32 years ago, when she, at age 
17, was a mere baby herself. What follows is an endless litany of recollection, 
recrimination and remorse, punctuated by laughs that grow ever fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 The actresses gamely try to inject some sparkle into Haverty's unwieldy 
characterizations, but blurred motivation and forced conflict plague the play 
throughout. Daphne is so floridly flamboyant that she frequently strikes one as 
more demented than whimsical. Beth's petty accusations and childish deceits 
seem shockingly sophomoric. Never sufficiently developed or explained, these 
character quirks remain nothing more than the playwright's window dressing, a 
failed attempt to make his creations appear more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters express their innermost emotions with the ease of group therapy 
veterans. Never mind that they have just met. There's no holding back on 
dramatic outbursts. Beth's mother Anne (Betty Vaughn), supposedly a sensible 
and reserved woman, erupts into a public display of agonized penitence shortly 
after her arrival on the scene. Even the wonderfully dry and pragmatic Olive -- 
the sole oasis in this desert of whining -- eventually gets into the act, 
berating Daphne bitterly and threatening to move out because Daphne didn't 
confide in her about her early pregnancy.  
</P>
<P>
 As usual at the Colony, the production values are excellent. Robert Wilson's 
set is handsome and versatile, with just the right touch of trailer-park 
tackiness. Debra Garcia Lockwood's lighting expertly evokes sun-drenched 
mornings in the north San Fernando Valley. Director Carol Newell has adorned 
this sow's ear with some fine needle work, but her thoughtful staging is 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the program notes, Haverty states that "Aftershocks," while not based on 
fact, was inspired by his own experience of having a long-lost family member 
"search out" his biological relations. Unfortunately, Haverty's drama never 
makes the leap from personal experience to art. As Daphne says in the play, 
"Just because it happened doesn't make it true." For once, Daphne makes good 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Aftershocks," Colony Studio Theatre, 1944 Riverside Drive, Los Angeles. 
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Oct . 2. $18-$20. (213)

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; GRIFFITH'S 'BIRTH OF A NATION' RE-EMERGES ON LASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Garbage in, garbage out. Even laser technology can't overcome bad source 
material. If the original materials are poor, all the modern technology in the 
world can't make it that much better. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the inescapable conclusion after watching two different laser-disc sets 
of D. W. Griffith's 1915 groundbreaking film, "The Birth of a Nation." One 
presents the innovative director's astounding cinematic achievement in 
amazingly clear, crisp images. The other, mastered from a dismal copy, offers a 
shadow of the real thing, a blurred collection of sometimes indistinguishable, 
muddied pictures. The first does full justice to Griffith's three-hour-plus 
epic. The second leaves the impression that Griffith shot some of the film with 
mud on the lens. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you detest Griffith's film as a racist piece of propaganda or laud it 
as a landmark in the history of filmmaking isn't the issue here. It is 
difficult to separate the innovative director's astounding cinematic 
achievement from the racist attitudes that undergird it if you can't at the 
very least see Griffith's vision as he intended it to be. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pity that the latest attempt to offer a comprehensive look at 
Griffith's monumental work has been undercut by the source material. Image 
Entertainment has produced a handsome, special-edition boxed set ($80) with a 
reproduction of the original souvenir program and a documentary featuring rare 
outtakes from the film. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two-disc set was mastered from an original tinted print from the 
Blackhawk Films collection that looks as if it had been stored underwater all 
these years. Because it is a silent film made 80 years ago, many viewers will 
think it is remarkable that the film was saved at all in any condition. But 
when compared to a special laser edition produced by Lumivision a few years 
ago, it becomes apparent that the problem is in the source print, not the 
original film. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lumivision release, still available at $50, was struck from a 
35-millimeter black-and-white safety print manufactured in the 1950s from a 
1927 dupe nitrate negative stored at the International Museum of Photography at 
the George Eastman House. It is as different from the Blackhawk Films' print as 
a clear day from a smoggy one, capturing Griffith's cinematic vision in sharp, 
clear tones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lumivision print shows details in scenes hopelessly murky in the Image 
transfer made from the Blackhawk version. Tints, digitally reproduced by 
Lumivision, add emotional coloring to the scene without losing the scene 
itself. Image's tints blanket scenes like heavy washes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a shame, because the Image soundtrack of the original Joseph Carl 
Breil score features a full orchestra, while Lumivision's soundtrack is a tinny 
reproduction using computer-generated digital sounds that seem artificial and 
gimmicky. The atmospheric score strings together folk songs, battle songs and 
hymns with great hunks of familiar classical music, including Wagner's "Ride of 
the Valkyries" ushering in the film's heroes, and society's racist villains, 
the Ku Klux Klan. The Image orchestral score in digital stereo sound does it 
full justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Both editions, however, offer separate bonus material that helps put this 
highly charged, controversial, distorted view of the South during and after the 
Civil War in slightly better perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Image's fascinating 24-minute documentary on the production of the film offers 
a rare look at Griffith outtakes and provides a unique opportunity to see the 
cinematic innovator at work. Among the most illuminating moments are battle 
scenes shot in the San Fernando Valley (which will never see such open spaces 
again) and rehearsal shots of the lovely young Lillian Gish. Scenes of the 
riots and Ku Klux Klan revival that this film sparked during its roadshow 
engagements in the 1920s demonstrate vividly that it always provoked protest 
and cries for censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumivision includes a 10-minute version of "The Birth of a Race," a 1918 
African American attempt to defuse Griffith's inflammatory racism. (The film 
was based on Thomas Dixon's "The Clansman," and originally released under that 
title.) Unfortunately, the film went through several backers and hands during 
its production and never lived up to its intent. It clearly shows, however, 
that black filmmakers never accepted Griffith's skewed version of history and 
from the beginning saw that they had to fight film with film. 
</P>
<P>
 Image's 22-page reproduction of the original souvenir program from the film's 
world premiere reveals that it always read like an apologia, a cry for freedom 
of expression anticipating the cries for censorship that were to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking through the literature, eight decades later, it's daunting to realize 
that, when the film was made, the Civil War had ended only 50 years earlier, 
and that many who had lived through it were still alive. Griffith used 
eyewitnesses and historical prints and photographs to give his film a 
verisimilitude that makes the racist propaganda that unfortunately underlines 
its message so much more effective and unforgivable.

 In most productions of Shakespeare, one role per actor is plenty. So you can't 
help admiring the unstinting ambition of the "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at 
Theatre 40 in Beverly Hills, where each of the five cast members plays no fewer 
than four parts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tricky experiment, but director Flora Plumb pulls it off with aplomb, 
recycling her resourceful actors as a kind of wry counterpoint to the text's 
look at identity and the nature of love. 
</P>
<P>
 More so than most, this production is deeply rooted in the imagination, both 
ours and the performers'. The stage is virtually empty, save for a few chairs 
and an upstage synthesizer for music and sound effects. The actors, meanwhile, 
leap in and out of their many roles with pluck. 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the bravest example, William Frankfather plays Demetrius, Hermia's 
would-be lover, at the same time he plays Egeus, Hermia's imperious father. 
This means that in certain scenes Frankfather is literally talking to himself 
-- a stunt that the actors accomplish through mime and movement, not to mention 
some well-earned good will from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the fine ensemble are Michael Gough (Puck and Theseus), Michelle 
Manning (Hippolyta and Helena), Jennifer Parsons (Hermia and Titania) and Paul 
Mercier (Lysander and Oberon). 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, the staging at times feels a little static and, well, 
underpopulated. But for the most part, this "Dream" is splendid make-believe, 
the purest expression of theater.

'Little Mikey': An Activist Grows Up 
</P>
<P>
 Any musical that features a show-stopping production number set in a men's 
room can't be all bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ballad of Little Mikey," composer-librettist Mark Savage's long-running 
look at a gay activist's coming of age, is now at the St. Genesius Theatre in 
West Hollywood with a revised book and a new director, Mark Bringelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its title character (Mark Smith), the show has a little trouble finding 
itself. The early musical numbers depicting Mikey's halting entry into gay life 
at UCLA during the late '70s are a lot of fun, albeit probably too naughty for 
some, with one song devoted to the joys of anonymous sex in public restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the charm fades as Mikey and friends mobilize for a protest against 
homosexual stereotypes in the 1980 film "Cruising." Savage treats this episode 
as the high-water mark in the struggle for gay rights, although AIDS activists 
and many others would likely disagree. The trouble with "Mikey" is that its 
slap-happy farce is undercut by tired agitprop. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight cast members act and sing their hearts out, though, with 
wisecracking John Price breathing welcome cynicism into the proceedings. And 
Smith is a divine gift to the musical theater, graced with a commanding singing 
voice and a boyish innocence quite in keeping with the show's theme. He is one 
of the few actors who could get away with Savage's fortuitous rhymes of, say, 
"mud" and "stud."

STAGEBEAT: FRESH, AMBITIOUS 'SARITA' IN AN OLD VENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Built in 1931, the time-worn Labor Temple in Pasadena is an unprepossessing 
facility to house a theater. However, the Dramatic New Arts, an up-and-coming 
company midway through its first season at the Temple, displays a youthful 
freshness that contrasts dramatically with the battered building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sarita," Maria Irene Fornes' play with music about a young Puerto Rican girl 
growing up in 1940s New York City, is an ambitious choice for this young 
company -- and in some aspects, the production falls short of a professional 
standard. The threadbare tenement setting has a slipshod quality that seems 
more the result of overall carelessness than creative intent. Also, the actors 
are, in the main, ill-equipped to handle the vocal requirements of Leon Odenz's 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mary Tomlinson directs with a rough urgency that suits the play's 
offbeat blend of camp and melodrama. The diminutive Georgina Padilla amply 
fleshes out her character as the feisty Sarita, a victim of rampant hormones 
and limited opportunity. Among the capable supporting cast, Stefan Lysenko 
particularly shines as the magnetic Julio, a smarmy opportunist who exploits 
Sarita's sensual nature and blights her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Fornes' deeply feminist period piece, which takes us inside the life of a 
powerless young woman on the fringe of American society, is funny, unabashedly 
emotional and ultimately very moving. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sarita," Dramatic New Arts, 42 E. Walnut, Pasadena. Fridays-Sundays, 8. 
$10-$12. Ends Sept. 11. (818) 568-9850. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes. 
'Palm Fever' Bravely Bites the Big Orange 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is a study in contradiction, a tract of lush desert where the 
freeways flow alongside arid riverbeds and opulence dwells in the shadow of 
squalor. Ever-shifting, ever-mutating, the object of envy and derision, Los 
Angeles is ineffable. Any attempt to define or categorize it is innately 
problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 In her attempted evocation of Los Angeles life, "Palm Fever," at Playwrights' 
Arena, playwright Jean Colonomos bravely takes a bite of the Big Orange -- and 
chokes. A highly stylized melange, "Fever" dramatizes the most obvious images, 
events and conditions associated with L.A., from the Rodney G. King trial to 
the burgeoning gun culture to the homeless problem to the omnipresent palm 
tree, which Colonomos employs as the primary archetype in her stilted 
symbology. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonomos' occasional flashes of wit fail to illuminate what is admittedly a 
difficult subject. Director Jon Lawrence Rivera is unfortunately collegiate in 
his staging, which puts one in mind of a remedial class on theater game 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of this elusive city can be found in its sprawling ebullience, a 
vital component that is sadly missing from this somewhat claustrophobic 
production. 
</P>
<P>

EVIDENCE STRONG THAT LONG FALL IN HOME PRICES IS OVER; HOUSING: THE MEDIAN 
PRICE IN O.C. ROSE IN JULY TO $217,750, COMFORTABLY ABOVE FEBRUARY'S LOW OF 
$204,740. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Kathleen Young decided earlier this summer to sell her Woodland Hills 
home, she figured she'd be lucky to get the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 She hadn't counted on getting more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been told that a good asking price was $259,000" for the four-bedroom, 
two-bath home, said Young, a property manager. Another agent suggested 
$279,000. Young chose to list the house at the higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, she had three firm offers, and accepted one for $283,000. "We 
were pleasantly surprised," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Young found out, there are signs that the long-awaited turnaround in 
California home prices may have finally arrived. While not all market watchers 
agree that the worst is over and sharply higher interest rates or an economic 
slowdown could make things worse, the evidence is compelling that prices at 
least have bottomed out. Indeed, prices have recently risen in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price for an existing single-family house in California remains 
above its low in February of $180,978, according to the California Assn. of 
Realtors. The median price fell 1% in July to $185,040, down from June's 
$186,830, according to figures released Thursday by the association. But it had 
increased in three of four months before July. In Orange County, the median 
price rose in July to $217,750, comfortably above the trough of $204,740 in 
February, the association reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, foreclosure activity is declining, indicating that financially 
troubled homeowners are getting better prices for their houses and thus are 
less likely to default on their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 And homes that are priced reasonably can draw multiple offers within days, 
including some above the asking price, real estate agents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in hard-hit Southern California, where falling real estate prices have 
been tied to the hemorrhaging of jobs in aerospace and other industries, prices 
seem to have stopped their steep descent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought prices were bottoming in most of the state, and by the end of the 
summer, believe that generally prices will have leveled out," said David 
Hensley, a real estate economist with Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents and economists cite a variety of reasons for the firming of 
housing prices: pent-up demand from first-time home buyers, a rush to buy 
before interest rates shoot back up, relatively good affordability and growing 
confidence that the local economy is on the mend. July's dip in prices 
statewide was attributed to higher mortgage interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to get in before they perceive the prices starting to turn around 
. . . and there's a fear that maybe this is the time to jump in before prices 
do start turning around," said Ava Better, a real estate agent in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales are up, and affordability remains high," said Patricia Neal, president 
of the California Assn. of Realtors and a real estate broker in Garden Grove. 
"From February to July, Orange County's prices were up 6.4% over the same 
period a year ago. . . . That's considerably higher than in Los Angeles or the 
statewide figure." 
</P>
<P>
 Any turnaround would be the best sign yet that the California economy's 
fledgling recovery is continuing. "It means if you buy a house now, you're not 
going to instantly lose money by seeing it lose value," said John Karevoll, 
financial editor at Dataquick Information Systems in La Jolla. "If you're 
selling a house, you'll be able to get closer to what you paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 A rebound also would be a big relief for thousands of homeowners who bought 
their dwellings in the past four years -- only to see their values drop as much 
as a third below what they paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the decline does not mean the beginning of a new boom, however. 
Most economists doubt that prices will grow much faster than the rate of 
inflation, in part because the state's economic growth is still lagging that of 
the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Among further evidence of a turnaround: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles County, the median price of an existing house was unchanged 
in July at $189,400 and still above the low of $184,250 in February, the 
California Assn. of Realtors reported Thursday. In Ventura County, the July 
median price was down 5.7% to $203,820, but still above the low of $199,150 in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 * The median price per square foot paid for existing homes in Los Angeles 
County has been hovering around July's $127.42 for about three months, and 
remains above March's low of $124.48, according to Dataquick. In Orange County, 
the median price per square foot rose to $128.23 in July from $126.90 in June 
and from the low of $124.45 in February. (The square-foot measure is considered 
a better barometer of prices than the median price of homes sold, which can be 
affected by the mix of homes in a given month). 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreclosure activity is declining. The number of properties in the state 
that went into foreclosure in July was 8,802, the fewest since November, 1992, 
and down 14.5% from June, Dataquick reported Thursday. Foreclosures peaked at 
12,054 in June of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite higher interest rates, sales compare favorably to last year's 
levels. The California Assn. of Realtors reported Thursday that 453,400 
existing single-family detached homes closed escrow in the state during July, 
on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, down 8.3% from 494,220 homes in 
June. But the July sales pace was 4.6% above the rate in July, 1993, when 
433,580 homes were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that the worst is over. Michael Carney, executive director 
of the independent Real Estate Research Council of Southern California, 
believes home prices will continue to fall at least until the spring of next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are probably pretty close to the bottom of the cycle, but picking the 
actual bottom is tough," he said. Still, he said, "it's my guess that prices 
have at most another 5% to fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is a recovery likely to cover all areas and all kinds of homes. And any 
disruption in the state's nascent recovery -- severe job cuts, a sharp jump in 
mortgage interest rates -- could send housing prices back down in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a stealth recovery," Karevoll said. "It's very hard to track the 
positive indicators. There seems to be kind of a deep sigh going through the 
market, and people are wiping their brows and hoping for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Homes purchased by first-time buyers are holding their prices better than 
move-ups or mansions, real estate agents and economists say. Houses in older, 
middle-class neighborhoods are doing better than those in upscale areas. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Hensley estimates that prices in Los Angeles County have fallen as 
much as 35% from 1990 highs, after adjusting for inflation. That brings them 
back to their 1986 levels -- about the place they started when California's 
runaway real estate inflation began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Real Estate Research Council's index of market prices of existing 
single-family homes shows that prices in Southern California have fallen 15.3% 
overall from their peak in April, 1990. But the differences between regions are 
stark. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices in Southeast Los Angeles County have fallen only 5.8%. But prices in 
the San Fernando Valley have dropped 24.6%, and on the Westside and Santa 
Monica, they are off by 33.6%. Single-family homes in Orange County lost an 
average of 15.7% of their value from April, 1990, to April, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, condominiums seem to be holding their value, in part because 
they did not benefit as much as houses from the rapid increase in prices in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes that are priced reasonably can draw multiple offers within days, 
including some above the asking price, real estate agents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've not heard of anyone getting more than they asked, but we are getting as 
many as five or six offers on some properties," said Tom Samuelson, assistant 
office manager at ERA Real Estate Store in La Palma. "We're getting more cases 
where the sellers are getting what they asked for." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal of the realtors association said that interest is especially heavy in 
"affordable properties," which translates into "entry-level housing." More 
sellers are reporting multiple offers on their homes "because there's less 
affordable property that's appealing, that's in a good location with good 
schools," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said this year's figures are probably running about the same as those 
from last year, when 51% of home sales involved first-time buyers. That trend 
should benefit owners of more expensive homes as buyers begin to trade up into 
more expensive housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southern California real estate agents also report that home-buying 
activity has been encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think prices have probably bottomed out, or come close," said Ricki 
Weinberger, a real estate agent with Podley Caughey & Doan in Pasadena. "But it 
depends now on the individual property. Houses in really good neighborhoods 
with good amenities do well. Houses in poorer or marginal areas are still maybe 
going down." 
</P>
<P>
 But a real estate agent in the Hollywood Hills, who handles homes in the 
$425,000 to $450,000 range, said things continue to look bad for him. "The 
sales have gone up, but the prices haven't," said the agent, who asked not to 
be identified. "I don't think we've hit bottom yet."

CONROY VIOLATED ASSEMBLY POLICY, PROBE FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A legislative investigation concluded that Orange County Assemblyman Mickey 
Conroy (R-Orange) violated the Assembly's sexual harassment policies by 
embracing, kissing and making comments to a former aide. 
</P>
<P>
 But the probe, which was performed under the auspices of the legislative 
counsel, could not conclusively determine whether Robyn Boyd -- a former 
part-time aide in Conroy's Capitol office -- was fired as a retaliatory move 
after she complained about the alleged harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusions were contained in a 15-page report by the Assembly Rules 
Committee that was released Thursday by a lawyer who represents Boyd in a 
sexual harassment lawsuit against Conroy and his chief of staff, Pete Conaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said both men did not deny that a satirical sign (reading "Sexual 
harassment won't be tolerated, but it will be graded") was posted over another 
female aide's desk and that a "sexual harassment consent form" was circulated 
in the office as a joke. By failing to squelch such activities, Conaty did not 
uphold Assembly policy, the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Rules Committee reprimanded Conroy for his behavior and 
docked Conaty a week's pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Those revelations came as the Capitol continued to buzz about the Conroy case 
and another sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Assemblyman Rusty Areias, 
45, (D-San Jose), and his chief of staff, John Barry Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
 In that suit, filed by Deborah Simpson, 39, Wyatt is accused of making 
unwelcome sexual advances and Areias is accused of ignoring Simpson's 
complaints. Wyatt and Areias have said the Assembly Rules Committee found that 
the allegations were without merit, but Simpson's lawyer, Curtis Leavitt, on 
Thursday called the denials "an attempt to whitewash" the complaint. He cited a 
letter dated June 17 from the Rules Committee's legal counsel that chastised 
Wyatt for his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Assembly reacted Thursday by overwhelmingly approving a bill 
hailed by backers as an important step in broadening the ground rules for 
sexual harassment lawsuits brought against doctors, lawyers and other 
professionals who provide services to clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, SB 612, by Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), was approved by a 56-14 
margin and will be sent to the Senate for concurrence on amendments. Both 
Areias and Conroy voted for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd's allegations against Conroy surfaced earlier this week when her 
attorney, Carolee Kilduff, leaked word of the lawsuit. The suit was filed in 
neighboring Amador County last March to avoid publicity while settlement 
negotiations were underway with the Assembly Rules Committee, which is also 
named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy and Conaty have repeatedly denied the allegations but have declined to 
give their version of events until the case is settled in court. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in an "open letter to constituents" sent Thursday to Orange County 
newspapers, Conroy said that "on occasion, it is true that I have placed my arm 
around an employee's shoulder, male or female -- but never with any sexual 
intention." 
</P>
<P>
 "I also have on occasion paid compliments to an employee who is looking 
particularly sharp or well-dressed -- but never in a suggestive or demeaning 
manner. I do not live my life in a plastic bubble, afraid to interact or touch 
people, but I do respect my employees, male and female," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy added that "the tragedy of this lawsuit, and similar claims brought 
against public figures, is that such cases tend to make a mockery out of real 
instances of sexual harassment. Although neither I nor my staff did anything 
shameful or malicious, Robyn's complaint was taken very seriously by my 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, 35, began working for Conroy, 66, in March, 1993. In her lawsuit, she 
alleges that within days Conroy began acting inappropriately by occasionally 
kissing and hugging her, requesting back rubs and making comments laced with 
sexual innuendo. Boyd complained to Conaty in June, 1993, but alleges that she 
was ostracized after she refused to back off her complaints. She was fired by 
Conroy and Conaty that November. She then filed a complaint with the Assembly 
Rules Committee, prompting the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, Conroy on several occasions put his arm around Boyd. 
On one occasion, he kissed her in his car and asked if his behavior bothered 
her, but her lack of objection "was understandable given that Mr. Conroy was 
her employer," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conaty on one occasion showed Boyd an X-rated weekly newspaper distributed on 
the Assembly floor by a lawmaker pushing an anti-pornography bill, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy did not "specifically" deny Boyd's claims that he asked her to "spoil 
him," that he joked about hotel rooms or that he called her "special" and his 
"bookend," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report determined that Conroy "lacked sensitivity" when Boyd complained 
about his behavior. She claims in her lawsuit that he made a derogatory comment 
about her age and told her he would turn to another female employee instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy and Conaty told investigators they had no knowledge that Boyd was 
uncomfortable with their conduct, which they felt "was not of a sexual or 
inherently offensive nature," according to the report. Conroy said he treated 
Boyd "like a daughter, that she reciprocated and that he was unaware that she 
was offended," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they found that Conroy and Conaty "made a concerted effort 
to change their behavior" once Boyd complained. Moreover, Boyd acknowledged 
that neither man "had reason to suspect, other than through common sense and 
common courtesy, that she was uncomfortable" with their behavior before she 
complained. Their actions, the report concluded, were the product "not of 
malice, but of ignorance and/or poor judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also said that Conroy disputed Boyd's interpretation of several 
comments she felt were suggestive and that his explanations were "plausible." 
In addition, the report said there are "simply no facts" proving that Conaty 
reduced Boyd's work hours in retaliation for her complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Conaty said he sought to fire Boyd because her part-time schedule could no 
longer be accommodated and her performance had deteriorated, reasons 
investigators found legitimate and non-discriminatory. But they took Conaty to 
task for failing to notify Boyd of her perceived performance problems, calling 
the firing "badly mishandled" and an event that "violated and undermined" 
Assembly policy on sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommended that sexual harassment and sensitivity training be 
conducted for Conroy and his staff.

VERDICTS MET WITH PRAISE AND CRITICISM

 Tears and smiles. Anger and cries of bias. 
</P>
<P>
 A second-degree murder conviction Thursday against two teen-agers in the paint 
roller spearing death of Steve Woods provoked strong reaction in a case that 
had already touched a nerve in Orange County, sparking rallies against gang 
violence and claims of racial divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Woods' mother, Kathy, said she was satisfied with the 
verdict, especially the judge's finding of gang involvement in the case that 
could add more time to the teens' prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to stop these gangs from controlling our streets," she said. "We 
can't go for an evening stroll anymore. We have to get some deterrents to 
prevent it from getting to this point. That's really my message. That's what I 
pray for." 
</P>
<P>
 But others decried the verdicts as an injustice for Julio Perez Bonilla, 18, 
and Hector Penuelas, 17, the two Latino defendants convicted of second-degree 
murder and nine other felonies for their roles in the death of the white youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez of the League of United Latin America Citizens said he hopes the 
verdicts will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is how quickly the court system moves to incarcerate Latinos," he 
said. "I think the whole court system is one-sided and lopsided. Justice is 
definitely colored behind the Orange Curtain." 
</P>
<P>
 As they waited for the verdicts, the friends and family of the teen-agers on 
trial huddled in prayer. After Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey had 
declared Bonilla and Penuelas guilty on all charges, family members rushed from 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes brimming with tears, Bonilla's father said he did not want to speak 
about the verdict. Neither did other family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla and Penuelas were among six defendants charged in the death of the 
17-year-old San Clemente High School student. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was a passenger in a vehicle that was pelted by bottles, rocks, beer 
cans, blocks of wood and other items including the paint-roller rod that lodged 
in his head as the vehicle was driven toward the only exit at Calafia Beach 
County Park in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Woods testified that they were trying to flee the beach and did 
nothing to provoke the confrontation. The defendants said they threw items in 
self-defense because they thought they were going to be run over. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Shellie Woods, the victim's sister, said she was afraid the judge 
would go along with the defense request for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting for so long," she said, tears in her eyes. "I was really 
relieved when I heard (the verdict). I want them to rot." 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict also brought an emotional response from Glo Scharringhausen, whose 
son Paul was with Woods that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to send a message to all teen-agers, good and bad, that crime 
doesn't pay," said Scharringhausen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino leaders who have criticized the handling of the case by police, 
prosecutors and media said the verdict sends a different message. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund executive 
director in Orange County, contended that the facts in the Woods case did not 
merit a second-degree murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the issue as one of being self-defense," Palacio said. "One incident 
that occurred in the spur of the moment in the heat of passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacio contended that investigations by the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department and the district attorney's office were suspect due to the tenacity 
of authorities in labeling the Latino defendants as "gang members." Yet, when 
the suspects are white and the victim is a member of a minority, Palacio said, 
there is no similar outcry. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer, however, said race played no role in the case. 
He said the uproar overlooks the real victim: Steve Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's absurd to say race had anything to do with this case," Paer 
said. "They would have been prosecuted if they were black or white. This issue 
is what they did that night. We would have prosecuted whoever was responsible. 
This crime did not commit itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Paer said the defendants are not unfairly being labeled gang members. He said 
gang graffiti was found in the home or vehicles of several defendants in the 
case, and noted that Penuelas and several other defendants readily admitted 
gang membership or association. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer said his office has been stepping up its use of gang membership 
allegations to enhance sentences in the wake of spiraling gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I hear this about treating these guys unfairly, and I think, 'What 
about Steve Woods?' "

 HERE'S THE KEY: Shirley Piha, 65, of Newport Beach went to Santa Ana Chrysler 
Plymouth to have her car appraised. Before she left, she says, she was 
pressured into buying a car she didn't want by salesmen who kept stalling when 
she asked for her keys back. Piha settled her lawsuit this week for $35,000. . 
. . Dealership owner Mike Shepard, who denies her version, is steaming: "You 
can't afford to take a chance in court in this country any more." But Piha's 
lawyer, Aurora Harris counters: "It's an old sales tactic that's being used 
more often."

 NO TORTOISE: Were you around the Huntington Beach Pier when those 14 people 
took off on the Trans America Footrace June 18? Five of them crossed the finish 
line at New York's Central Park -- 2,925 miles away. The winner: Istvan Sipos, 
35, of Hungary, who made it in 68 days, beating the second-place finisher in 
handy fashion -- by 45 hours. . . . If you're thinking about entering next 
year's race, it's in June, and the starting point again is Huntington Beach.

 TAKING STALK: When Julie Gianatassio, a senior at Western State University law 
school in Fullerton, worked with its domestic violence clinic this past year, 
she decided to put together a California stalking laws booklet. . . . The law 
school was so impressed it's now making it available to the public. It tells 
you whether you qualify as a stalking victim, and what legal remedies are 
available. "People think only of celebrities as stalking victims," says 
Gianatassio, who recently took the bar exam. "But many women out there face 
this threat."

 CONCEPT SURFING: Maybe it helps to see what you're doing when you windsurf, 
but it's not really necessary to make it fun. . . . The Braille Institute in 
Anaheim has sent 30 teen-agers on a camping outing at Newport Dunes in Newport 
Beach for a three-day outing -- sailing, windsurfing, and setting up their own 
tents. "We call it conceptual development," says youth coordinator Peggy 
Comstock. "When you're blind, it's much easier to understand what you're 
reading if you've actually experienced it."

2 CONVICTED IN ATTACK WITH PAINT-ROLLER ROD; COURTS: THEY COULD GET 15 YEARS TO 
LIFE IN PRISON. STEVE WOODS, 17, DIED IN GANG INCIDENT ON SAN CLEMENTE BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two youths were convicted of second-degree murder and nine other felonies 
Thursday in a gang attack at a San Clemente beach last year that ended with the 
death of 17-year-old Steve Woods after a paint-roller rod pierced his skull. 
</P>
<P>
 The case ignited public outrage over gang violence in Orange County and 
enraged some Latino leaders who complained that prosecutors had overcharged the 
Latino defendants in the case because the victim was white. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors could not prove that Hector Penuelas, 17, and Julio Perez Bonilla, 
18, hurled the paint-roller rod that fatally wounded the San Clemente High 
School senior. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey said the young men 
are as guilty as the actual killer because they were acting as a "gang 
operation" when they joined their buddies in throwing pipes, bottles, wood 
chunks, paint rollers and other objects at the victim and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge held up a paint roller as he explained his verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure these things are going to 
be dangerous to a human being in a close quarters battle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey rejected defense contentions that Penuelas and Bonilla had acted out of 
fear when they confronted Woods and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is not about an accident," he said at the close of the non-jury 
trial. "This case is not about self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 "They created the circumstance, in other words, under which they now claim 
they were acting in fear," the judge said, adding that Woods and his friends 
never threatened or committed an act of violence that evening. "The defendants 
can't start the trouble and then claim because of the victim's reaction they 
were provoked." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was in the passenger seat of a friend's Chevrolet Suburban when a 
paint-roller rod crashed through the window and lodged in his skull Oct 15. He 
died 25 days later, never regaining consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Kathy Woods, the dead teen's mother, said she was pleased with 
the verdicts and wants her son's killers sent to prison for as long as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for the parents (of the defendants), but their sons are alive," 
she said. "I feel my son lost at least 60 years of his life. I would like to 
see at least 20 of theirs."  
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla and Penuelas, both of San Clemente, were among six defendants charged 
in Woods' killing.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling means they each could face up to 15 years to life in prison 
on the second-degree murder convictions, plus additional time on felony charges 
of conspiracy, assault and throwing objects at a moving vehicle, and an 
enhancement of belonging or associating with a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla was additionally convicted of misdemeanor assault stemming from an 
earlier fight with Steve Breckenridge, a friend of Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 During trial, Bonilla and Penuelas contended that they acted in self-defense 
because they believed Woods and his friends were driving toward them and 
planning an attack in revenge for the earlier dispute between Bonilla and 
Breckenridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said the defendants provoked the attack and noted that the 
victims had no choice but to drive past the attackers -- who were partying near 
the park's only exit -- and were effectively "trapped" by them. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys asked Dickey to convict their clients of involuntary 
manslaughter, arguing that the killing was a freak accident and their clients 
never intended to hurt anyone. "I'm not really surprised," attorney Dennis 
McNerney, who represents Penuelas, said of the verdict. He said he had no 
second thoughts about asking the judge -- rather than a jury -- to decide the 
case. "Mr. Penuelas is very upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer said the verdict should sent a strong message to 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do something like this, you're going to be charged with murder," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was sparked when Bonilla, a gang member, was hanging out with a 
large group of friends near one end of the parking lot in Calafia Beach County 
Park, while Woods and his friends were partying elsewhere in the park. Bonilla 
and a friend pushed and punched Breckenridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Breckenridge testified he merely asked whether Bonilla and his friends knew of 
any parties in San Juan Capistrano later that evening, leading prosecutors to 
theorize the gang members were set off by the mention of "San Juan," because 
their rivals live in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonilla testified he and another friend pushed and punched Breckenridge 
because Breckenridge had made an obscene gesture at Bonilla a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey said it really didn't matter what sparked the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notwithstanding what the credo may be for a gang, that is not the law," 
Dickey said, explaining that a person's use of obscene language or shouting of 
a rival gang's name does not give someone else the right to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey said he does not believe the defendants went to the park looking to 
kill someone. He said the incident was especially tragic because if not for the 
confrontation involving Breckenridge, "chances are this whole thing would never 
have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey said the defendants were clearly gang members or associates who were 
acting as a "gang operation" when they willingly participated in a conspiracy 
to attack the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each member of the conspiracy who knowingly enters into it is liable for the 
reasonable and probable outcome of any crime," he said, holding up a 
paint-roller rod and noting that its shape clearly made it a dangerous weapon.  
</P>
<P>
 The attack sent shock waves through San Clemente, a community known for its 
pristine beaches and as home to the Western White House during Richard Nixon's 
presidency. Outraged residents demanded tough treatment for the defendants, and 
held rallies and protests to complain about crimes and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tragedy also exposed racial divisions in neighborhoods beside the 
beaches. A group of Latino activists complained that race was behind the murder 
charges in the case, and alleged that the killing was being used to unfairly 
stereotype Latinos as gang members and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey set sentencing for Jan. 13. The defendants were juveniles at the time 
of the attack, but were tried as adults because of the serious nature of the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and gang 
involvement charges, while three remaining defendants are awaiting trial.

Spearing Case 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: On Oct. 15, 1993, Steve Woods, 17, and several friends had been 
drinking beer at Calafia Beach County Park. Julio Bonilla, 18, Hector Penuelas, 
17, and their friends were doing the same, partying near the only road leading 
from the parking lot. Woods' friends said they were trying to avoid trouble and 
were leaving after one of their group was pushed and punched by Bonilla and a 
friend. The caravan of cars was forced to drive past the defendants, however, 
and Bonilla and Penuelas testified that they began hurling bottles, wood blocks 
and other objects to protect themselves because they believed the other group 
was returning for revenge. One of the objects thrown -- a paint-roller rod -- 
speared Woods through the head. 
</P>
<P>
 * The charges: Penuelas, 17, and Bonilla, 18, were charged with second-degree 
murder following the confrontation that resulted in Woods' death 25 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 * The defense: Attorneys for Penuelas and Bonilla contended that the death was 
an accident and say their clients acted in self-defense. They asked that their 
clients be found guilty of the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * The verdicts: Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey, 
presiding in a non-jury trial, found Penuelas and Bonilla guilty Thursday of 
second-degree murder. The defendants also were convicted of nine other felony 
counts, including conspiracy, assault, hurling objects at a moving vehicle and 
an enhancement charge that they belonged to a street gang. In addition, Bonilla 
was convicted of misdemeanor assault. 
</P>
<P>
 * Possible sentences: Penuelas and Bonilla were juveniles at the time of the 
attack, but were tried as adults. Each faces up to 15 years to life in prison 
for the murder conviction and possible additional time for the other counts. 
The judge has the discretion to sentence them as juveniles, which would mean 
release from the California Youth Authority when they turn 25, at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's next: Bonilla and Penuelas will be sentenced Jan 13. A third 
defendant, Arturo Villalobos, 19, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and 
faces up to 14 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 30. Three other 
defendants -- Rogelio Solis, 18; Juan Enriquez Alcocer, 20; and Saul Penuelas, 
18, Hector Penuelas' older brother -- are awaiting trial.

<P>
 Stock and bond markets reversed course Thursday after Wednesday's big rally, 
as concerns again shifted to the potential for higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields jumped as some traders focused on a report showing still-strong 
home sales -- even after five Federal Reserve Board credit-tightening moves 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials keyed off the bond market and eased 
16.84 points to 3,829.89, after soaring 70.90 points Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders also began to question Wednesday's surprise stock rally, which 
was concentrated in blue chip issues and was said to have been fueled in part 
by technical trading by one or more large institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty points of the Dow's gain Wednesday was added literally in the final 
seconds of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalyst for Wednesday's rallies in stocks and bonds was the government's 
report that durable goods orders tumbled in July. That revived belief that the 
economy is slowing and that the Fed may refrain from engineering further 
interest rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, a report that existing home sales remained fairly firm in July 
dashed some investors' expectations for a marked economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields rose across the board. The yield on the bellwether 
30-year Treasury bond retraced almost all of Wednesday's slide, rising from 
7.45% to 7.53%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders, however, said activity was so light Thursday that they were 
reluctant to attach much significance to it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, activity was mixed. The Dow, which had far outpaced other 
indexes Wednesday, also lost more than most indexes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nasdaq market of mostly smaller stocks, the composite index continued 
to advance, rising 3.08 points to 754.80. That index has led the market higher 
this month, gaining 4.5% so far, compared to the Dow's 1.7% rise. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, falling issues edged winners by 11 to 10 as 
volume contracted to 284.2 million shares from 310.5 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the market's probably a little overextended here on the short term," 
said Edward Collins, head block trader at Daiwa Securities America. He noted 
that the Dow's total gain of nearly 100 points Tuesday and Wednesday came 
"after a very lethargic summer. That's a lot to digest in a short period of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite Thursday's setback -- and suspicions about the influence of 
technical trading games -- the Dow remains well above 3,800 and at levels not 
seen since spring. Some analysts say the broad market's resilience, especially 
among smaller stocks, is a good sign heading into September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still view it as some risk out there," said Steven Goldman, market 
strategist at Weeden & Co. "But I also think that a bear market wouldn't show 
this type of resilience." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks that were big winners Wednesday were pared back. 
Caterpillar fell 2 3/8 to 112, International Paper lost 1 1/2 to 73 3/8, 
Eastman Kodak declined 1 to 49 3/8, DuPont was off 7/8 to 59 1/8 and 
Georgia-Pacific gave up 3/4 to 70 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some financial stocks also gave ground. Federal National Mortgage dropped 2 
to 87 3/8, Wells Fargo lost 1 7/8 to 157 3/8, BankAmerica eased 1/2 to 48 1/2 
and Federal Home Loan Mortgage sank 1 1/2 to 60 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's winners, technology stocks resurged. IBM soared 2 to 69 3/8 
in heavy trading as some investors responded positively to the company's 
decision to cut prices on personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech stocks rising sharply included Compaq, up 2 1/4 to 38 3/8; EMC, up 
1 1/2 to 17 5/8; Autodesk, up 3 1/4 to 62 1/2; Texas Instruments, up 2 7/8 to 
81 5/8; Oracle Systems, up 1 5/8 to 43 1/4, and Novell, up 7/8 to 15 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walt Disney slipped 1/2 to 42 3/4 on news that Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman 
of its film studio, was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, Frankfurt's DAX index jumped 25.84 points to 2,152.21, 
while London's FTSE-100 index surged 29.0 points to 3,234.2. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tokyo's Nikkei-225 average slipped back 68.31 points, closing at 
20,443.29. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index closed at 2,776.21, down 22.01 points after 
the peso, recently strong, dropped sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the peso was depressed in part by concerns over post-election 
protests and fraud charges by opposition candidates. "Everybody is thinking 
about the opposition's reaction," said a trader at Banco del Sureste. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 3.373 pesos to buy $1 on Thursday, up from 3.355 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in currency markets, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen as 
speculators continued to bet that the United States and Japan will manage to 
reach a trade deal by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar was quoted at 99.55 yen, up from 98.85 on Wednesday. 
But the dollar eased to 1.5418 German marks from 1.5448. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodity markets, wheat prices soared to six-month highs after an 
influential trade group forecast a decline in the world wheat crop due to 
drought in Australia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 September wheat futures jumped 8.25 cents to $3.55 1/4 a bushel.

DELEGATES SEE CHINA VISIT AS A GOLDEN STATE OPPORTUNITY; TRADE: CALIFORNIANS 
ACCOMPANYING COMMERCE SECRETARY HOPE TO STRIKE DEALS AND STRENGTHEN TIES ON THE 
CLOSELY WATCHED TRIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the 25 executives accompanying Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown on his 
trade mission to China today, nine are from California -- and all are looking 
at the trip as a chance to cement deals, prospect for new ones and strengthen 
trade ties that promise to create new jobs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 What they don't want to do is talk about anything that might get in the way of 
such deals -- such as linking commerce with changes in China's policies on 
dissidents, labor union activists, child labor or the environment. They'll 
leave that to Brown, who has promised to "raise human rights issues in the 
appropriate way in the appropriate forum." 
</P>
<P>
 But observers on both sides of the Pacific will be watching the trip 
carefully. It is the first by a Cabinet member since the Clinton Administration 
extended China's most-favored-nation trade status, or MFN, in May over protests 
from human rights groups, which said the move was a tacit endorsement of that 
nation's repressive policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration denies that, arguing that strengthening ties is the best 
way to effect positive changes in the populous nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President indicated when he made his announcement on May 26th that one of 
the reasons for the decision (on MFN) was that we believe that we can have more 
impact on issues like human rights in China if we are commercially engaged," 
Brown said at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a position the traveling executives, eager to tap into China's vast 
potential markets, have backed wholeheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, when the middle class emerges and develops in China as 
economic development progresses, we will see the society open up," said David 
K. Lam, president and chief executive of Expert Edge Corp. in Palo Alto and a 
member of Brown's delegation. "The middle class will naturally move in that 
direction and demand a more open society." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It remains to be seen . . . how they are going to express human rights 
concerns in an effective manner and in a way that avoids the pitfalls of quiet 
diplomacy . . . which has been a spectacular failure in influencing the Chinese 
government's human rights practices," said Richard Dicker, associate counsel 
with Human Rights Watch in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, for the lucky executives chosen to accompany Brown -- especially 
those heading small businesses -- the trip will mean a big boost in prestige 
and a chance to rub elbows with high-ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The business men and women in the delegation represent a broad range of 
leaders in industries considered crucial to China's future. That nation's 
economy is growing at a torrid pace, and it must upgrade its manufacturing 
plants, telecommunications, power plants, airports, roads and other 
infrastructure with the help of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the chosen firms already do business in China. The disproportionate 
representation of California companies is a sign of the state's importance in 
the emerging trade relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being diverse ethnically, the delegation also includes firms -- 
such as Atlantic Richfield Co. and SCEcorp -- whose political action committees 
have been big contributors to Democratic Party causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from exploring new deals, Brown's mission is intended to address nagging 
problems such as intellectual property rights protection and access to Chinese 
markets. The United States says its trade imbalance with China reached $23 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Wednesday that the Administration is considering lifting 
most of the remaining economic sanctions against China stemming from the 1989 
crackdown on democracy protests in Tian An Men square. Later in the day, Brown 
said there were no plans to lift the sanctions during this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the California companies expect to close deals while in China. Tandem 
Computers Inc. of Cupertino will sign a contract with China Great Wall 
Industries Corp. to resell its computers in China, a deal that could be worth 
tens of millions of dollars over the next several years, said Tandem President 
Jimmy Treybig. 
</P>
<P>
 Grigsby, Brandford & Co., a San Francisco investment bank, will be signing a 
contract for the second phase of a joint venture construction project for the 
Port of Miami with a Chinese maker of cranes, a deal worth $24 million, said 
Calvin Grigsby, president and chief executive. The firm will also be looking at 
ways to finance major construction projects in China through public financing, 
a concept that is still new to the communist nation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others firms are going along to cultivate new business. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bryson, chairman of SCEcorp, Southern California Edison Co.'s parent, 
would like the company's Mission Energy subsidiary to take part in building 
power plants in China, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco Chairman Lodwrick Cook, meanwhile, will explore further energy-related 
projects, possibly a joint venture on a refinery. Arco is already a partner in 
the development of the massive offshore Ya-cheng natural gas field, with the 
first natural gas to be delivered to Hong Kong in 1996, spokesman Albert 
Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based AST Research Inc., already the No. 1 purveyor of personal 
computers in China, wants to get its machines into Chinese schools, an immense 
new market, said Chairman Safi U. Qureshey. He said an advisory education 
council in Shanghai, China's largest city, recently recommended placing AST 
computers in about 450 schools there. 
</P>
<P>
 Expert Edge, which produces software to help manufacturers of sophisticated 
equipment deal with customers, sees a market in providing software to aid in 
aircraft maintenance at China's many airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're exploring a joint venture of some kind," said Lam, a native of China 
who was raised in Vietnam and Hong Kong and immigrated to the United States 
nearly 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Systems Integrated, an Orange-based maker of automation control devices for 
power generation and other purposes, would like to sell its equipment to be 
used in new water management systems. The company has already sold equipment 
for use in Chinese hydroelectric power plants, President Susan Corrales-Diaz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights activists have called on Brown and the business leaders to make 
sure the issues are not forgotten in the rush for new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Human Rights Watch met with Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary for international 
trade, earlier this month to urge Brown to raise questions about what it calls 
the "deteriorating human rights situation" in China and the treatment of 
specific dissidents, such as opposition leader Wei Jingsheng. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, Wei was released after 15 years in prison but was taken back 
into custody in April after talking with foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Dicker also urged U.S. companies to adopt policies regarding the ethical 
treatment of their Chinese employees to avoid situations like that of Gao Feng, 
a Christian activist and employee of Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep plant in Beijing, 
who was suspended from his job after being taken into custody for conducting a 
private religious service observing the anniversary of the Tian An Men 
protests. After pressure from international groups, Gao was reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 But executives seemed reluctant to commit themselves to any rigid code of 
ethics, arguing that they already adhere to internationally recognized 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do want to work for multinational companies all over the world because 
of the standards and ethics we follow," AST's Qureshey said. "That is what 
really creates long-term, positive change."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: LEG ROOM FOR 1 MORE CHICKEN CHAIN? MILKEN TRUST 
THINKS SO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world may not be sure it needs another chicken restaurant chain, but 
former junk bond financier Michael Milken apparently sees room for at least one 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Koo Koo Roo Inc., a small chain operating mostly on the Westside of Los 
Angeles, is in talks to receive a $55-million capital infusion from a 
partnership whose principal investors include a trust for Milken's three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Milken himself is not a party to the transaction, but his belief in Koo Koo 
Roo's potential has already become well-known in investment circles around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Fell, who heads Archon Capital Partners on behalf of the Milken 
trust, said both he and Milken have eaten at Koo Koo Roo, "and we both had come 
to the (conclusion) independently that this was a damn good concept." 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal between Archon affiliate Casual Dining Concepts Inc. and Koo Koo 
Roo is completed, it could provide the capital and impetus to finally expand 
the chain nationwide after several false starts in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Koo Koo Roo's major menu items are flame-broiled skinless chicken, turkey and 
various salads, geared to health-conscious -- and price-conscious -- diners. 
The chain was the brainchild of restaurateur Michael Badalian in 1987, who sold 
control to former New Jersey mortgage banker Kenneth Berg in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg, a multimillionaire after selling his mortgage business to Primerica 
Corp. (now Travelers Corp.) in 1985, has been struggling for the past three 
years to find the right menu, store look and management for Koo Koo Roo. 
</P>
<P>
 In that period, he has opened new stores and closed others, leaving Koo Koo 
Roo with just eight restaurants currently. Six are in Southern California, 
including a Beverly Hills store that will open Saturday. One is in Miami and 
another is in the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores offer eat-in and take-out service, and prices are comparable to 
those charged by competitors such as KFC, Boston Chicken and El Pollo Loco. But 
while Koo Koo Roo's food has many loyal fans on the Westside, Berg's slow pace 
in expanding may have given competitors in the nationwide chicken-restaurant 
war a leg up in finding choice sites and financial partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken, for example, plans to open 300 sites in Southern California 
alone via a franchise deal with CKE Restaurants, parent of Carl's Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Koo Koo Roo's sales were just $1.4 million in the quarter ended March 29, the 
latest reported. That was up from $772,937 in the first quarter of 1993. The 
firm's net loss in the first quarter of this year: $804,784, versus $438,740 a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In need of deeper pockets and management help, Berg hooked up with Fell, whose 
Casual Dining Concepts Inc. was formed specifically by Archon to invest in 
restaurants. Koo Koo Roo would be Casual Dining's first investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fell, who like Milken is a Wharton MBA, is a founding partner of InterActive 
Partners, a venture capital firm funded by venture giant Kleiner Perkins 
Caufield & Byers. Fell has also been a longtime consultant in Hollywood; he was 
involved in the restructurings of Columbia Pictures and 20th Century Fox and in 
the RKO Pictures buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 His Archon partners include veteran merchant bankers Steven P. Fink and Ronald 
N. Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 While some Wall Streeters worry that the chicken restaurant concept has been 
over-hyped, Fell still sees chicken as "the food of the '90s." And he argues 
that Koo Koo Roo's food "is far superior to any other products I've seen" in 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also adds that the deal between Casual Dining and Koo Koo Roo so far 
amounts to a letter of intent and that he and his partners have yet to complete 
a full review of Koo Koo Roo's potential. "We've got to be absolutely 
comfortable that you can expand this concept" nationwide, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 As structured, Casual Dining's $55-million investment in Koo Koo Roo would 
give it a controlling stake. The investment would include a $45-million loan 
from Casual Dining to Koo Koo Roo in the form of senior secured notes, $5 
million in exchange for preferred stock and $5 million from the purchase of 1 
million new common shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Casual Dining would also get enough stock warrants, exercisable at $6 apiece, 
to guarantee it 51% ownership of Koo Koo Roo. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg, who owns 3.2 million of Koo Koo Roo's 11.1 million shares (fully 
diluted), would be expected to stay on, though probably not as CEO long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Koo Koo Roo's potential hasn't been lost on Wall Street: Its stock, at $8.375 
on Nasdaq on Thursday, has risen from $5.125 earlier this year. The initial 
stock offering was in 1991 at $5 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 More telling is that the firm's total stock market capitalization now is $93 
million, which values each of its restaurants at $11.6 million -- a whopping 
price tag. With that kind of valuation, the stock price arguably already 
reflects much of the future payoff from expansion. And given the structure of 
the proposed deal, ordinary shareholders should realize that Archon/Casual 
Dining stands to reap the bulk of any future returns. Concept Value 
</P>
<P>
 One way to look at the market's excitement over a restaurant chain is market 
capitalization per store: a company's total market capitalization (stock price 
times number of shares outstanding) divided by number of stores operated. The 
numbers for various chains: 04,20,08,13,16 No. of Market cap. Cap. per store 
Chain stores (millions) (millions) Cheesecake Factory 9 $198 $22.0 Koo Koo Roo

COMPANY TOWN: SHAKE-UP AT DISNEY; A WHOLE NEW WORLD; KATZENBERG'S DEPARTURE 
SETS CHANGE IN MOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER and ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The imminent departure of longtime Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg is expected to bring revolutionary changes to both the style and 
structure of the movie and TV empire. 
</P>
<P>
 During Katzenberg's 10 years at the helm, the studio largely reflected his 
famous over-the-top energy and religious zeal for saving money. Meetings 
routinely started at 7 a.m. or earlier, and executives marched in lock step to 
tough business mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the studio separated into three divisions, the singular image will 
fade. Disney also falls off the exclusive list of Hollywood studios that have 
maintained their stability. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing Katzenberg's departure, Disney said animation will report to 
Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner and board Vice Chairman Roy E. 
Disney. Live-action movies have been placed under the aegis of Disney-based 
producer and former 20th Century Fox movie chief Joe Roth and television and 
telecommunications under ex-studio President Richard Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 While the management shift is not expected to have a major impact on Disney's 
TV operations, there is widespread speculation and trepidation that Roth's 
appointment will lead to executive upheaval in the motion picture ranks -- 
including production, marketing and business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's fear in the air here for the first time in 10 years," said a highly 
placed Disney executive. "Nobody has ever been afraid for their job, and now 
everybody is." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds another, "There's a sense of total depression. We're wondering where do 
we go from here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg lunched with his successor in the studio's executive dining room 
Thursday. Conspicuously seated in the center of the rotunda, the two seemed to 
be sending a clear message that the baton was being cordially passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the day after a very sudden, shocking set of events," said Roth, who 
also met with Disney divisional heads. "People have to deal with their 
feelings. Jeffrey was the father of the group. It's unrealistic to expect them 
to blink and say, 'OK, next.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted calmly to the changing of the guard. Disney shares fell 50 
cents Thursday to $42.75 in modest trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Sources said Disney launched an all-out campaign Wednesday to assure the 
investment community that the company is on solid footing, with Eisner 
personally calling brokerages and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was less sanguine at the Burbank studio. After a decade at the helm, 
Katzenberg said, the reality of leaving is traumatic. In contrast to the stoic 
demeanor he adopted Wednesday, when Eisner told him he would not be getting the 
company's No. 2 spot, Katzenberg came across as openly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an emotional basket case today," he conceded in an interview. "Since I 
lived my job, this was my shadow family -- essentially the same one with which 
I grew up at Paramount -- and I feel an overwhelming sense of loss." 
</P>
<P>
 If Team Disney voiced reservations about the changes, Hollywood's creative 
community was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Releasing Jeffrey Katzenberg on the industry will produce as much energy as 
the explosion of the first atomic bomb. It gives new people opportunities and 
established people the opportunities to reinvent themselves," said Joan Hyler, 
senior vice president of William Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite continued speculation that Katzenberg will land at Sony Pictures 
Entertainment or MCA Inc., there was no movement on that front Thursday. And 
Katzenberg seemed in no hurry to make his next career move. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers point out that it was nearly 10 years to the week that a 
similar scenario occurred at Paramount. When Barry Diller left the studio, 
Eisner was overlooked for the top job by his boss, parent company Chairman 
Martin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a clear case of the abused child turning around and abusing his 
child," said a source who was at Paramount then. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Katzenberg and Eisner spent a good-natured hour together Thursday 
morning discussing the transition, loyalists of the departing studio chief 
insist that matters could have been handled more delicately. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real ugliness to it all," said one. "Whatever the board members 
happen to think of him, whatever ego clashes the two of them had, Katzenberg 
was the chief architect of an amazing rebirth of the studio. He met with 
(Eisner) on Wednesday morning and expected that to be the beginning of 
discussions about his future. Right after the meeting, he was handed a press 
release." 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue that things worked out for the best. "If Jeffrey had taken the 
next step, it would have been a good example of the Peter Principle: everyone 
rising to his level of incompetence," said a leading producer. "(Frank) Wells 
was a lawyer with great Wall Street relationships. That isn't Jeffrey . . . but 
I don't think Jeffrey knows that." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Roth has been affiliated with Disney as a producer for nearly two years 
under his Caravan Pictures deal, his anointment is viewed with concern by some 
studio executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The downside of Joe is he is an unknown," said one. "For starters, Joe and 
(Disney motion pictures President) David Hoberman don't have a lot of mutual 
respect, and (Roth's partner) Roger Birnbaum is clearly in the on-deck circle." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Caravan has a 25-picture deal with the company, which Birnbaum will 
reportedly oversee, speculation has him moving into Hoberman's spot at some 
point. Because Roth will have less responsibility than Katzenberg (who also 
oversaw animation, home video, Hollywood Records and the company's legitimate 
theater ventures) and is also mandated by Eisner to decrease live-action 
production, insiders fear that some senior production and marketing heads might 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoberman, who met with Roth on Wednesday, acknowledged that tensions exist 
between him and Roth, primarily because "Jeffrey put us in a situation where we 
were competitors."  
</P>
<P>
 As for rumors that Birnbaum might succeed him, Hoberman was philosophical: 
"Certainly, that's Joe's prerogative," he said, "I'm happy to collect a check 
-- I just signed a long-term contract -- and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth categorically denied that Hoberman will be replaced. "I'd love for 
Hoberman to stay, but we have to figure out the partnership," Roth said. "He's 
not Roger and I'm not Jeffrey. Besides, Roger wants to be a producer and be 
autonomous." 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders point out that Roth's operating style is very different from 
Katzenberg's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe's independent production experience has given him a broad view. He runs 
the show -- every aspect of it," said Fox Senior Executive Vice President Tom 
Sherak. Another Fox executive added: "Joe is a one-man band, which is not the 
traditional Disney way." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Disney executive forecasts changes in the company's infrastructure, 
drawing an analogy with the breakup of the Soviet Union into separate 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The studio has been disbanded. There was one integrated division that 
reported directly to one person (Katzenberg), and that's what made us different 
from other studios. Now there is a motion picture division and TV division that 
won't work hand-in-glove." Shaping the Post-Katzenberg Era 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of Disney Studio Chief Jeffrey Kaztenberg Wednesday, Walt 
Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner has split Katzenberg's responsibilities 
into motion pictures, television and animation. A look at the new 
organizational structure: FILM

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JAMES BATES: COMPANY TOWN; FOR ROY DISNEY, LEGACY IS 
EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Michael D. Eisner installed the Seven Dwarfs atop Team Disney 
headquarters in Burbank as enduring symbols of the company's heritage, he might 
just as well have added the image of Roy E. Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The painfully shy and enigmatic executive with the uncanny resemblance to his 
Uncle Walt has a habit of popping up at critical junctures in the company's 
history to somehow help sway events his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Disney's fingerprints were all over the management coup that ushered in 
the Eisner-Frank G. Wells regime 10 years ago. Now he's helped to derail the 
ambitions of Wells' would-be successor -- studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roy's a very clever, skillful man," one associate said Thursday. "He's not 
openly aggressive, but he always gets what he wants. Maybe the cardigan 
sweaters lull people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the company say that from the start, Disney was openly 
hostile to Katzenberg succeeding Wells as president. As a close friend of 
Wells, he resented Katzenberg's intense lobbying for the corporate post. But 
even before that, the Disney heir and Katzenberg were on troubled ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say the two executives rarely if ever spoke in their 10 years together 
and that Disney, whose job includes overseeing the animation department, 
zealously guarded from Katzenberg's eyes his work on the sequel to the animated 
classic "Fantasia."  
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg loyalists attribute Disney's actions to jealousy, saying he was 
intimidated and overwhelmed by the studio chief's gale-force energy and intense 
interest in the animation business. "Roy Disney doesn't run animation," one 
Katzenberg friend said. "He's on a boat in Ireland half the year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney told friends that the dispute boiled down to Katzenberg's ego. In 
conversations in recent years, he repeatedly complained that the studio chief 
was hogging all of the credit for the spectacular success of animated features 
such as "The Lion King" and "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been to Roy Disney's benefit that Katzenberg's all-star executive 
and news media schmoozing skills did not extend to corporate politics. Sources 
say the studio chief never bothered to develop close personal ties to the 
members of the board, which undercut his chances of overcoming Disney's 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Katzenberg's phenomenal success in managing the Disney studio 
operations -- annual filmed entertainment operating income alone rose from $2.2 
million in 1984 to $622.2 million in 1993 -- Eisner and the other board members 
shared Roy Disney's reservations about putting the studio chief in a corporate 
role. Sources say Disney's behind-the-scenes work -- augmented by the 
vociferous anti-Katzenberg rhetoric of director Stanley P. Gold, who heads the 
Disney heir's Shamrock Holdings -- clearly greased the path for Eisner to push 
Katzenberg out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Raymond L. Watson said Thursday that Disney "has a legitimacy 
that comes from both the amount of stock he owns and his heritage," adding, 
"When he speaks at the board meetings or speaks to animators, they know this is 
not just a paid executive but someone whose life has been nurturing the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 At 64, Disney holds the title of vice chairman of the board, but his role is 
much more expansive than that. He demanded and received the job of supervising 
animation in the 1980s, when Eisner and Katzenberg wanted to scrap the 
division. He has since become a trusted adviser to Eisner, who sees in him a 
non-threatening corporate presence who also carries the prized family name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael has gone out of his way to give Roy his dignity," said one source. 
"He's been loyal to Roy for bringing him to the company, and he's been a smart 
politician." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say the pair's bond has grown even stronger since the company was 
shaken by two dramatic recent events: Wells' death in a helicopter crash in 
April and Eisner's emergency quadruple heart bypass surgery last month. Disney 
rushed in from his seaside castle in Ireland to be at Eisner's side, and a 
company statement pointedly named him as Eisner's stand-in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unaccustomed moment in the sun. Despite inheriting Walt Disney's 
physical features, Roy has practically none of his late uncle's famous 
charisma, close friends readily concede. 
</P>
<P>
 Puffing on an ever-present cigarette, he can usually be found holding up the 
wall at corporate events. One entertainment analyst says Disney has played no 
visible role in the company's investor gatherings in recent years, though 
Eisner and Wells may have been throwing him a bone at the annual meeting in 
Florida earlier this year when they allowed him to make the formal announcement 
that the company was finally releasing the animated "Snow White" on 
videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, sources say Disney has become more vocal at board meetings 
and that his opinions are taken seriously by colleagues. Aside from his work at 
the family store, he has profited handsomely from Shamrock Holdings, the 
investment company led by Gold. The firm made a fortune buying and selling 
soybean-processing giant Central Soya. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While he has cut back on his work schedule the last three years, people close 
to Disney say his passion for protecting the company's legacy is what keeps him 
going long after he could have retired on a nest egg valued at $540 million. 
</P>
<P>
 His ties to and love of the company's animation date back to before Eisner, 
Katzenberg and most other Disney executives were even born. 
</P>

 Roy's mother inked and painted animation cels of Mickey Mouse while she was 
pregnant with him. As a boy in the 1930s, he watched "Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs" 20 times while it was moving through the production process. At age 7, 
he was too sick in bed one day to attend a "Snow White" screening. So Uncle 
Walt dropped by to try out a story on him about a puppet named Pinocchio that 
he was thinking of making into a film. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Disney, whose father co-founded the studio while never drawing anywhere 
near the attention of Walt, later went to work on the Burbank lot as a film 
editor, producer and writer. But he was resented be some colleagues because of 
his family connection and derided by others as the "idiot nephew" for his 
diffident and uncommunicative style. 
</P>
<P>
 Even while serving on the board before the 1984 power shift, he rarely said 
much in meetings, something friends now attribute to the overall lack of 
respect he was accorded then. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed drastically 10 years ago, when Disney and Gold engineered the 
ouster of the company's beleaguered management team in favor of Eisner and 
Wells, who orchestrated one of the most successful turnarounds in U.S. 
corporate history. 
</P>
<P>
 While Disney spends much of his time at his vacation home in Ireland, sources 
say he is still involved in the day-to-day operations of the company's vaunted 
animation department, which was supervised by him, Katzenberg and animation 
chief Peter Schneider before the recent upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 People close to the studio say it was Roy Disney who pushed the company into 
paying for the expensive automated equipment that allowed its animators to move 
into the modern age.  
</P>
<P>
 Responsibility for success or failure is always a murky thing in Hollywood. 
But on the creative side, one executive describes the Disney heir as "a 
big-picture guy," whereas Katzenberg focused on the finer points of character 
and script development. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one plays the bully role in animation. It's too collaborative for that," 
said one source. "But Roy puts forward ideas. He's very creative, he gives 
great notes and he's certainly no idiot. It's not just by luck that all this 
this has happened to him."

JUDGE WAIVES A KEY BARRIER IN AT&T'S BID TO BUY MCCAW; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE 
$12.6-BILLION DEAL FACES ONE MORE REGULATORY HURDLE. ONE BABY BELL VOWS IT WILL 
APPEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Clearing the next-to-last regulatory hurdle, AT&T won federal court approval 
Thursday to proceed with its $12.6-billion acquisition of McCaw Cellular 
Communications -- the nation's largest cellular telephone provider. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene in Washington waived parts of a 1984 
Justice Department consent decree that would have prevented AT&T from acquiring 
cellular telephone properties co-owned by McCaw and several regional telephone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, the judge who presided over the breakup of the old AT&T monopoly a 
decade ago, said a more competitive telecommunications marketplace has produced 
"changed circumstances" that justify granting the waiver to AT&T and McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for BellSouth Corp., one of the "Baby Bell" companies divested by 
AT&T, had argued in a lawsuit that a provision of the 1984 decree prohibited 
AT&T from acquiring the stock or assets of any of the regional Bells. The 
company claimed that AT&T could not acquire McCaw cellular properties, located 
in California and nine other states, in which BellSouth and other Baby Bells 
hold a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene rejected the argument, saying the decree "was never intended to prevent 
AT&T from competing in the cellular marketplace." But the judge reserved the 
right to require AT&T to divest itself of the contested cellular properties if 
he finds that a related consent judgment proposed by the Justice Department "is 
not in the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal must still be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission, 
which will examine the parties' application for transfer of various 
communications licenses. And BellSouth said it will appeal Greene's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, AT&T is an important step closer to entering the fast-growing 
cellular business, which has been adding an average of 1,000 new customers a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the big hurdle," said Mark Lowenstein, an analyst with the Yankee 
Group consulting firm in Boston. "The decision sends a pretty clear signal that 
Judge Greene expects the overall (telecommunications) environment to become 
more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 With AT&T's marketing and financial muscle behind cellular phones, Lowenstein 
added, there will be a lot more "awareness about wireless services." The 
company for weeks has been running TV ads depicting a futuristic era of 
go-anywhere communications. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, AT&T was unchanged at $54.375. 
McCaw added 37.5 cents to $53.50. 
</P>
<P>
 BellSouth general counsel Walter Alford vowed to appeal Greene's decision 
unless the Baby Bells are given the same freedom as AT&T to compete in the 
long-distance and cellular phone businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently they are restricted from doing so by federal and some state laws. 
Legislation aimed at lifting those restrictions has cleared the House of 
Representatives and is before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene acted a month after the nation's largest long-distance telephone 
company and McCaw signed a pact with the Justice Department that would permit 
the combination, subject to conditions guaranteeing competing long-distance 
carriers equal access to the McCaw cellular network, and AT&T safeguards 
ensuring that its cellular equipment customers -- who often compete 
head-to-head with McCaw -- are not left at a disadvantage.

 Lloyd's Sued, Accused of Fraud: A Newport Beach man and his two daughters 
filed suit this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accusing Lloyd's of 
London of gulling them into investing in the world's oldest insurance market. 
The lawsuit claims Lloyd's concealed the risks involved, particularly the 
danger of large losses from asbestos and pollution liability cases. David F. 
West and his daughters, Deborah and Susan, also charge that Lloyd's violated 
California securities laws by failing to register with the state before it 
solicited their investments.

 Unocal Settles With Air Resources Board: The Los Angeles-based oil company 
agreed to pay $2,088,666 in cash and to sponsor various clean-air projects to 
resolve the air board's complaint that it had failed to add enough detergent to 
its gasolines to meet state rules. Unocal is required to spend most of the 
settlement money on improving its bulk terminal facilities "to help assure 
future compliance with ARB clean-gasoline specifications," the agency said in a 
statement.Unocal must also buy and take off the road 167 vehicles built before 
1975 without receiving the clean-air credits ordinarily due with such 
purchases. The company must pay $345,666 to the state and $50,000 to a 
scholarship fund at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.

 Computer Associates Slashing Key Program's Price: The maker of software for 
big computers announced price cuts of up to 95% on its CA-Unicenter, a program 
that helps unite the data in older computers with new machines. The price cuts 
apply to workstations and minicomputers that use the Unix operating system. 
Several other developers of so-called enterprise software have also cut prices 
recently or offered cheaper versions of products for the smaller powerful 
computers.

 Robert Dupre Convicted of Fraud: The Newport Beach businessman was found 
guilty of charges resulting from a three-year federal investigation into the 
1991 failure of Oak Tree Savings Bank, Louisiana's largest thrift. Dupre and 
Houston lawyer W. Harold Sellers were convicted on 14 counts of conspiracy, 
bank fraud and money laundering on Aug. 19 in federal court in New 
Orleans.Before their trial, San Juan Capistrano businessman Michael Barrack had 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy after a federal probe of a $69-million loan Oak 
Tree made to La Jolla Pacific Equities Inc., a company operated by Dupre, 
Sellers and Barrack. The jurors determined that Dupre and Sellers should 
forfeit $7 million in assets, the amount they allegedly took from the savings 
and loan. The three men also face prison terms and fines. They are to be 
sentenced Nov. 16.

 Tension Grips U.S.-Japan Talks: Discord was heightened after a senior Clinton 
Administration official said Tokyo's auto industry may fall victim to U.S. 
sanctions unless trade talks next month break new ground.Washington maintains 
that Japan's domestic auto market is stacked against exports from the United 
States, so the industry might be a target of a punitive strike. Any move 
against Tokyo's prized export car market would hurt both sides, by further 
driving up the Japanese yen and putting new pressure on U.S. interest rates. 
Two days of bilateral trade talks in Seattle have produced little progress. The 
United States has set a Sept. 30 deadline for Japan to open its markets to more 
foreign goods.

 Drug Production Interrupted at Amgen: The company said it has curtailed 
production of Epogen, one of its two main drugs, while it upgrades the 
water-filtering system at its Thousand Oaks factory. Amgen, the world's largest 
biotechnology company in terms of sales, said it expects to restart the system 
early next week and resume full production of Epogen within days after that. 
The company said the interruption will not affect Epogen sales, because there 
is adequate inventory of the drug, a genetically engineered protein designed to 
stimulate production of red blood cells in kidney patients who must undergo 
dialysis.

 Chrysler to Recall Jeep Wranglers: The No. 3 auto maker said it plans to 
recall virtually all the 230,000 Jeep Wranglers ever built to eliminate 
potential leaks in fuel tanks. The recall covers Wranglers introduced in the 
1987 model year through the middle of the 1994 model year.Chrysler Corp. 
spokeswoman Terri Houtman said a gasket on the fuel tank may have been 
over-tightened and this can cause it to crack and leak vapors and fuel. Such 
leaks can catch fire when exposed to an ignition source. The gasket has been 
redesigned and the assembly process has been corrected to avert the 
over-tightening, she said. Chrysler knows of no accident, fire or injury 
related to the condition, Houtman said. The company plans to notify owners 
soon, and dealers will replace the gaskets free of charge, she said.

 Buoyed by a strong performance in its main engineering and construction 
business, Fluor Corp. said Thursday that third-quarter profit surged 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three months ended July 31, the Irvine-based company posted earnings 
of $48.3 million, or 58 cents a share.That compares to a profit of $40.8 
million, or 50 cents a share, for the period a year earlier. Revenue was $1.96 
billion, up 6% from $1.84 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The report "was very much on target," said Herb Hart, a San Francisco analyst 
who follows the company for S.G. Warburg Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news therefore caused little stir on Wall Street. In New York Stock 
Exchange trading, Fluor stock closed at 53.125 a share, up 62.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor quarterly results were lifted by a 23% increase in operating profit at 
its low-sulfur coal subsidiary, A.T. Massey. The overall operating profit at 
Fluor's core engineering, construction and diversified services business was up 
17% from a year earlier. DON LEE

 FCC Request Puts QVC Takeover on Hold: Comcast Corp. and Liberty Media Corp., 
which made a tender offer Aug. 11 for shares of home shopping network QVC Inc., 
said the Federal Trade Commission has asked for further information on the 
proposed takeover.Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act, the FCC's request 
will extend the waiting period for 10 days after the information is provided. 
Comcast and Liberty -- already large shareholders of QVC -- have offered to buy 
all the QVC shares they don't already own in an arrangement that would leave 
Comcast the controlling shareholder, with 57.4%. Liberty, a subsidiary of 
Tele-Communications Inc., is the controlling shareholder in Home Shopping 
Network, QVC's main competitor.

 United Auto Workers union members approved a contract with General Motors 
Corp. on Thursday night to end a 2-day-old parts plant strike that shut down 13 
assembly plants and idled nearly 43,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The factories building some of GM's most popular vehicles had to close as they 
ran out of bumpers, exterior lights and light controls supplied by the plant, 
where 3,500 workers struck for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the parts factory, GM's Inland Fisher Guide plant in Anderson, 
Ind., would resume operations with the third shift Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 GM officials did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment on the 
settlement pact. 
</P>
<P>
 The assembly plants closed by the strike build full-size pickups, the new 
Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo and other models. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike began Tuesday after bargainers were unable to settle local issues, 
among them GM's transfer of work from the parts plant to outside contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said that in the settlement they won a promise that the auto 
maker will continue making the same product lines at the parts plant through 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were after the jobs, and that's what we got," said Ron Gettelfinger, the 
UAW's Region 3 director and chief negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement wasn't likely to head off further assembly plant closings, 
since refilling the parts pipeline will take a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anderson plant supplies most of the more than two dozen GM vehicle 
assembly plants in North America. As they shut down, their other suppliers of 
parts might also have had to close. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd start shutting down in two or three days if the plants we sell to are 
down," said a vice president of one GM parts supplier with plants in several 
states and Mexico. He spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 GM makes most components at its own parts divisions. They, too, were likely to 
have closed if the strike had continued and additional assembly lines had been 
forced to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It begins to hurt right away," said Joseph Phillippi, an automotive analyst 
with Lehman Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the GM assembly plants closed by the strike: 
</P>
<P>
 * Flint Truck Assembly, Flint, Mich.; builds full-size Chevrolet and GMC vans; 
4,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ste. Therese at Boisbriand, Canada; Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird; 
2,800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Detroit-Hamtramck, Detroit; Cadillac Seville, Eldorado and DeVille; 4,500 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orion Assembly, Lake Orion, Mich.; Oldsmobile 98, 88 and Aurora, Buick 
Riviera and Pontiac Bonneville; 4,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buick City, Flint, Mich.; Buick LeSabre and Park Avenue, Oldsmobile 88 
Royale; 4,200 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oshawa No. 1, Oshawa, Canada; Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo; 3,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers from the closed plants were not eligible for the supplemental benefits 
they would get during a layoff. Had the strike continued, they could have 
applied for unemployment pay in the states where they live.

AMERICA WEST EMERGES FROM BANKRUPTCY; AIRLINES: CLOSING OF INVESTMENT DEAL 
MEANS ALL OF THE MAJOR U.S. CARRIERS ARE FREE OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS FOR THE FIRST 
TIME THIS DECADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 America West Airlines emerged from a three-year stay in Bankruptcy Court on 
Thursday, marking the first time this decade when all of the nation's major 
carriers are flying free of federal bankruptcy proceedings and protections. 
</P>
<P>
 America West Chairman William Franke announced that the 11-year-old carrier 
had emerged from its Chapter 11 reorganization with the closing of a 
$244.9-million cash-and-loan investment from AmWest Partners, which includes 
Ft. Worth attorney David Bonderman, Continental Airlines, Mesa Airlines and 
mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals from the Phoenix-based airline and Dallas-based AmWest Partners 
signed closing documents to complete America West's reorganization, which had 
been approved Aug. 10 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Mooreman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This marks the end of a three-year journey through Bankruptcy Court that was 
sometimes tumultuous," Franke said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, America West must still compete against the likes of low-fare 
carriers such as Southwest Airlines and Reno Air. In addition, United Airlines' 
plan to launch low-fare service along the West Coast in October could also put 
more pressure on America West fares and profits, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "America West has shrunk to a level where it's not bleeding red ink, and its 
near-term outlook is OK," analyst David Hoppin said. But the beginning of a 
costly West Coast fare war "would be bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim of a costly overexpansion and a deep industry depression, America 
West was one of six major airlines that flew under Chapter 11 protection this 
decade. Three of those carriers -- Pan American World Airways, Eastern Air 
Lines and Midway -- failed in 1991. Continental and Trans World Airlines 
emerged from bankruptcy protection last year. 
</P>
<P>
 AmWest Partners' investment includes $114.9 million in stock purchases and up 
to $130 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal gives the group 33.5% of the common stock and 71% of the voting 
shares. The reorganized company's Class B shares will begin trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange today. Continental will own 4.1% of America West under the 
deal, but both airlines will remain independent. However, both airlines plan to 
market each other's flights, beginning with 29 destinations Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization has raised the ire of many America West employees, who have 
endured a 10% wage cut, layoffs and substantial losses in the value of their 
old company shares. Most of the airline's employees were required to purchase 
stock under the terms of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Mooreman said he had received about 671 letters from employees 
protesting what they saw as the inequity in proposed bonuses. America West 
wants to hand out an estimated $2.7 million in cash and stock bonuses to 30 
executives and managers. Non-management employees will split $9.5 million in 
bonuses, with the maximum $1,000 bonuses going to those who have worked 
full-time since before the airline filed for Chapter 11 protection on June 27, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for America West, its creditors and AmWest Partners argued that 
employees will be given competitive wages after America West leaves Bankruptcy 
Court.

EARNINGS: MATSUSHITA REPORTS RISE IN GROUP PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., owner of the Panasonic and National brands 
and of MCA Inc., said its group profits climbed in the first quarter of its 
fiscal year, despite the steep rise in the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita's sales at home fell 3% to $7.95 billion, hurt by the persistent 
slump in the Japanese economy, but those abroad increased 9% to $8.63 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sales in Matsushita group's entertainment business declined 2% to 
$1.29 billion, the drop was largely due to the strong yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost-cutting efforts and better sales in U.S. and Asian markets helped the 
Japanese company earn $379 million in pretax profit for the three months ended 
June 30, up 12% from a year earlier, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The film "Schindler's List," which swept this year's Academy Awards with seven 
Oscars, provided steady profits to Matsushita's entertainment business through 
its MCA Inc. unit. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA, which accounts for about 70% of the entertainment group's sales, posted a 
16% increase in sales, to $970 million, from January to March, and its earnings 
for the period were transferred to Matsushita's first-quarter group earnings, 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A negative factor was the yen's appreciation, while positive factors were 
streamlining and sales increases overseas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar stood at an average of 107 yen in the first quarter, contrasted 
with an average of 121 yen a year earlier.

DEPT. OF REAL ESTATE INVESTIGATING RETIREMENT FUND FOR TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Real Estate confirmed Thursday that it is 
investigating Teachers Management & Investment Inc. in the wake of a civil 
lawsuit that alleges the fund has lost at least $100 million of teachers' 
retirement money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern is that everything be on the up and up at TMI," said Randy 
Brendia, regional manager in Los Angeles for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, a judge granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting the 
Newport Beach firm from altering or destroying documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation and restraining order follow the suit filed Tuesday that 
claims TMI, which raised as much as $1 billion from 60,000 investors, is 
insolvent. Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard W. Luesbrink, besides 
approving the restraining order, said he will decide by Sept. 7 whether to 
appoint a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI's owners, James R. Martin and Maurice Shuman, have said they "absolutely 
deny" the allegations in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI attorney David Sprowl said the investment fund did not contest the 
restraining order. "Since TMI had no intention of losing or destroying any 
documents, we had no problem with that," he said. DEBORA VRANA

DELTA TO IMPOSE SMOKING BAN ON ALL FLIGHTS ACROSS ATLANTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines said Thursday that it will ban smoking on all transatlantic 
trips beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta said a survey of its transatlantic passengers found the airline would 
risk losing 7% of those customers if it banned smoking, but the carrier said it 
also expects to attract new business by adopting the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 250 daily flights across the Atlantic, Delta has been one of 
the largest U.S. carriers to Europe since it bought routes from Pan Am. But it 
has been looking for ways to distinguish itself from competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Other airlines have a few "smoke-free" flights on a few routes, but Delta is 
the first U.S. airline to ban smoking across the board in such a large market. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta's policy also applies to flights within Europe and between New York's 
John F. Kennedy Airport and Mexico. Delta decided against extending the policy 
to Pacific routes because it would have risked losing too many passengers. Its 
competitors on Far East routes already offer many nonsmoking flights.

 Money magazine's Sept. 6 issue ranks the nation's Top 100 colleges in terms of 
costs and academic value. Nine California schools are on the list, but only 
Caltech in Pasadena ranks among the Top 10.Factors used in determining the 
rankings include entrance exam results, graduation rates, faculty resources and 
deployment, budgets for instruction and student services and default ratios on 
student loans. The magazine then compares those figures to each college's 
tuition and fees. Here are the 10 highest-rated schools in the survey, followed

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: A TIMELY SURVEY OF BANK ATM FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Need cash? Use your ATM card here!" suggests a large banner displayed outside 
a First Nationwide Bank branch strategically located 1 1/2 miles from the Santa 
Anita Park racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-bank customers who take First Nationwide up on its offer will pay for it 
-- $1 to be exact. That is what the thrift charges non-customers for automated 
teller transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Such charges aren't unusual, as a survey out this month shows. West Palm 
Beach, Fla.-based Bank Rate Monitor reports that ATM transaction fees at the 
country's 25 largest banks and 25 largest thrifts are rising, becoming a bigger 
source of revenue for financial institutions. The trade publication said its 
survey shows that ATM fees have risen an average of 15 cents in 1994 from a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is timely. Two consumer organizations that have long complained 
about the fees disclosed this week that the Justice Department is looking into 
allegations of antitrust law violations in how ATM fees are set. The inquiry is 
also said to concern fees for bounced checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Consumer Federation of America and the U.S. Public Research Group say ATM 
fees vary little from bank to bank -- and that banks make 78 cents for every $1 
they take in on such fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking industry representatives have consistently denied the allegations. 
</P>

 Name watch: The label on a bottle of Niagara water boasts it is the "champagne 
of bottled water." That should make the folks in Irvine proud. The reason: The 
source for Niagara drinking water is Irvine tap water.  
</P>
<P>
 A fluid sense of geography plays a role in other brand names. The source for 
Rocky Mountain drinking water is a well in Santa Fe Springs, according to a 
company spokesman. Mount Shasta water comes from a spring 165 miles from the 
mountain in Baxter, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Whence the names? A spokesman for Niagara explains the name has less to do 
with the source of water than the source of management. The company's founder 
hails from Niagara Falls, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said Mount Shasta water takes its name from its bottler, Shasta 
Beverage Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Humphreys of Rocky Mountain Industries said the name "came off the top 
of the owner's head." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Odds and ends: Support group watch: A display at Raging Waters invites 
visitors to join the water park's "support group." The San Dimas company is 
seeking approval from Los Angeles County to expand. Meanwhile, the licenser of 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers reports that parents who can't find the scarce 
action figures are forming support groups around the country. . . . Relief for 
landfills: The makers of the Lifetime Filter boast it "greatly" benefits the 
environment because users no longer need disposable filters for their 
air-conditioning and heating units.

 Clarification: MCI said some of its existing long-distance rates are a third 
lower than local long-distance rates tentatively approved for Pacific Bell by 
the state Public Utilities Commission. But MCI said it has not pledged to 
underprice Pacific Bell by a third in the local long-distance market, as 
reported here July 29. Automated Teller Fees 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at what consumers pay for certain ATM transactions at some of 
California's largest banks and savings and loans. No institution listed here 
charges its own customers for ATM deposits or withdrawals. Point-of-sale fees 
are charged on purchases made with the card, such as buying gas at an Arco 
station. Some institutions waive fees for customers who meet certain 
conditions, such as meeting a minimum account balance. 04,18,14,15,11

 Television: Savoy Pictures Entertainment said it has agreed to purchase three 
more TV stations from Burnham Broadcasting Co. through a joint venture formed 
earlier this year with Fox Television Stations Inc. The venture, called SF 
Broadcasting, has agreed to pay $229 million for WVUE in New Orleans; WALA in 
Mobile, Ala., and KHON in Honolulu, which also boasts a video-film production 
facility. Last month, SF Broadcasting agreed to its first station purchase with 
a deal to buy WLUK in Green Bay, Wis., for $38 million, also from Burnham.Under 
terms of the joint venture, Savoy will own 74% of the stations. Savoy, formed 
in 1992 as an independent movie company, has raised nearly $400 million in 
capital and searched for diverse investments. SF Broadcasting said it plans to 
switch the stations' affiliation to the Fox network. Savoy shares closed at 
$11.875 on Thursday, down 12.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading. KATHRYN HARRIS

FLUOR'S 3RD-QUARTER PROFIT UP 18%; EARNINGS: THE RESULTS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO 
STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRM'S CORE ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Buoyed by a strong performance in its main engineering and construction 
business, Fluor Corp. said Thursday that profit surged 18% for its latest 
fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three months ended July 31, the Irvine-based company posted earnings 
of $48.3 million, or 58 cents a share. That compared to a profit of $40.8 
million, or 50 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Revenue for 
the period, the company's third quarter, was $1.96 billion, up 6% from $1.84 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The report "was very much on target," said Herb Hart, a San Francisco analyst 
who follows the company for S.G. Warburg Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news caused little stir on Wall Street. In New York Stock Exchange 
trading, Fluor's stock closed at $53.125 a share, up 62.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's quarterly results were lifted by a 23% increase in operating profit at 
its low-sulfur coal subsidiary, A.T. Massey. The overall operating profit at 
Fluor's core engineering, construction and diversified services business was up 
17% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also noted that Fluor's international sales in the latest quarter 
represented about 50% of its overall business -- the highest percentage in some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Les McCraw, Fluor's chairman and chief executive officer, said that the 
company is continuing to strengthen its position by restructuring its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months ended July 31, Fluor said, its earnings rose 18%, to $140 
million, or $1.69 a share, from $118.5 million, or $1.44 a share, in the 
comparable period a year earlier. Nine-month revenue totaled $6.1 billion, up 
8% from $5.7 billion. Fluor Reports Healthy Quarter

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: K.V. GROCERY CHAIN DENIES VIOLATING LABOR LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 K.V. Mart Co., owner of 13-store grocery chain accused in a lawsuit of labor 
violations, responded Thursday by denying the allegations and criticizing the 
Buena Park-based union that helped prepare the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ty Hitt, chief financial officer of K.V. Mart in Long Beach, said his company 
pays "fair wages" to its 1,050 employees.A lawsuit filed Wednesday by six 
former employees contends that K.V. Mart violated state minimum wage, overtime 
and other labor regulations at its Top Valu/Top Plus grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitt said the United Food and Commercial Workers union, whose regional office 
is in Buena Park, has an ongoing campaign to disrupt business at Top Valu/Top 
Plus. Union officials say they are trying to stop Top Valu/Top Plus from 
gaining an unfair advantage in the marketplace by not paying fair wages.

BUSINESSMAN CONVICTED OF FRAUD; COURTS: ROBERT DUPRE OF NEWPORT BEACH IS FOUND 
GUILTY IN CONNECTION WITH A FEDERAL PROBE INTO THE FAILURE OF LOUISIANA'S OAK 
TREE SAVINGS BANK. HE AND TWO OTHER MEN FACE SENTENCING IN THE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Beach businessman Robert Dupre has been convicted of fraud in 
connection with a three-year federal investigation into the 1991 failure of Oak 
Tree Savings Bank, Louisiana's largest thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupre and Houston lawyer W. Harold Sellers were found guilty on 14 counts of 
conspiracy, bank fraud and money laundering on Aug. 19 in U.S. District Court 
in New Orleans. Before their trial, San Juan Capistrano businessman Michael 
Barrack had pleaded guilty to conspiracy after a federal probe of a $69-million 
loan made by Oak Tree to La Jolla Pacific Equities Inc., a company operated by 
Dupre, Sellers and Barrack. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 19, jurors determined that Dupre and Sellers should forfeit $7 million 
in assets, the amount that the defendants allegedly took from the S&L. The two 
businessmen also face prison sentences and fines of up to $4 million. Barrack 
faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing for the three men is set for Nov. 16 before U.S. District Judge 
Ginger Berrigan in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The three businessmen told S&L executives that they wanted the $69 million to 
refinance $55.8 million in debt held by a Texas lender. But federal 
investigators alleged that Dupre, Barrack and Sellers illegally transferred $3 
million of the money to numbered accounts in the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also alleged that Dupre and Sellers defrauded the now-failed S&L 
out of an additional $4.2 million that was earmarked for purchasing property in 
Southern California. In fact, investigators alleged, Dupre and Sellers already 
owned the land under a corporate name. The $4.2 million was eventually 
transferred to their personal bank accounts, investigators, alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Tree, with $2.2 billion in assets, was Louisiana's biggest thrift when the 
Resolution Trust Co. seized it in 1991. The S&L was owned by Landmark Land Co. 
of Carmel, Calif., and Oak Tree subsidiaries held Landmark Land's various real 
estate developments. The RTC seized the thrift two days after half a dozen 
Landmark Land subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection.

PARENTING; JUST THE WAY YOU ARE; SOME KIDS ARE BIGGER, SMALLER, HEAVIER OR 
THINNER THAN OTHERS. THEY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO PUT LESS WEIGHT ON LOOKS. 
</P>

<P>
 Growing up is hard to do. 
</P>
<P>
 What with raging hormones, erupting acne, budding breasts and cracking voices, 
it's no wonder preteens could just die from embarrassment about, well, 
everything. The pubescent years are especially tough for kids who feel they 
look different from their peers -- the husky girl who towers over her 
classmates, for example, or the diminutive boy who gets bypassed when 
basketball teams are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 But adolescents aren't the only ones to suffer angst about their appearance. 
At the tender age of 5 or 6, youngsters have already learned to be 
self-conscious, according to Sondra Goldstein, a Van Nuys clinical psychologist 
who specializes in children's issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they enter first grade, children are aware of differences in 
faces, height and body types," Goldstein said. "They are sorted by size for 
school photographs. Little boys who watch sports on television are bombarded 
with statistics on the height and weight of athletes. Children who are 
overweight get pressured by their parents to not eat. I see little girls as 
young as 6 who are bothered by their weight, and I see little boys who are 
aware of their height differences." 
</P>
<P>
 While such youthful concerns often disappear with time, it is important to 
take them seriously, according to Dr. Mary Moebius, a UCLA assistant clinical 
professor who practices child psychiatry in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 "If kids are teased and scapegoated too much," she said, "they can become 
depressed, or they may adapt a wallflower or bully stance. They may act out by 
being mean and nasty to other kids because they feel bad about themselves. In 
extreme cases, it can lead to long-term -- even lifelong -- problems, such as 
withdrawal, social phobias or difficulty establishing relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 The first -- and most devastating -- remarks children hear about their bodies 
often come not from the schoolyard, but from the household, according to 
Moebius. "The father or brother may be giving an overweight daughter a hard 
time, or the mother may be putting her on a diet," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But parents don't have to be objective about their kid's appearance. If a 
daughter says, 'My breasts are too big,' or 'My thighs are too fat,' the mom 
should not agree with her and say, 'Yes they are; let's put you on a diet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she suggests that parents shift the conversation to the children's 
positive attributes. "Talk about how strong they are or how gorgeous their eyes 
are," she said. "Help kids focus on areas they excel in. When children express 
that they are feeling bad, they are really asking for comfort and verbal 
cuddling." 
</P>
<P>
 This approach may be difficult for parents with specific concerns about their 
child's appearance. Merri Casper, an Agoura parent, admits that she is more 
worried about her chubby 12-year-old daughter's weight than the girl is. "It 
doesn't seem to bother her; but it bothers me," said Casper. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Lauren, is popular, athletic and utterly unself-conscious in a 
bathing suit. But Casper, who was overweight as a child, worries that the 
youngster will feel stigmatized as she matures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember how my family called me 'pleasingly plump,' " she said, "and I 
hated it. We live in such a skinny-conscious world. I try not to nag, but I am 
afraid Lauren will not grow out of her weight problem. I want the best for her 
and I am concerned in a loving way." 
</P>
<P>
 In cases of childhood obesity, anorexia, or other conditions that can be 
remedied with medical help and counseling, experts suggest that parents seek 
advice from a physician or psychologist, rather than try to fix the problem on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 By allowing a professional to suggest treatment options or dietary 
modifications, parents can support their child without taking on the role of 
food cop or critic. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, youngsters at the extreme ends of the weight spectrum aren't the 
only ones who feel badly about their bodies. Kids who hit puberty several years 
before or after their peers -- the 9-year-old girl who spills out of a B cup 
and the teen-age boy who still speaks in a falsetto -- are also likely to feel 
awful. Those who believe their noses are too long or a birthmark too 
conspicuous may be equally anguished. 
</P>
<P>
 Older girls may be mortified over facial hair or flat chests, while their male 
classmates are distressed about their own smooth faces and noticeable breasts. 
(It's fairly common for boys to develop breast tissue during puberty. While 
harmless and normal, the temporary condition, called gynecomastia, makes for 
misery in the locker room.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure to look like everyone else is overwhelming," said Tarzana 
pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Norman Lavin, a clinical professor of pediatrics 
and endocrinology at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "One mother came to see me because her daughter has a weight problem. She had 
the same kind of tears as if the girl had cancer. And the other day I saw a boy 
who was just this side of suicidal because his genitalia is smaller than his 
friends'." 
</P>
<P>
 Childhood obesity, as well as accelerated or delayed sexual development, may 
be the result of an underlying medical problem, according to Lavin, but such 
situations are rare. "If a child's growth curve changes suddenly -- for 
example, if he was in the 50th percentile and suddenly drops to the 10th 
percentile -- one should be concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child should be evaluated by a physician to rule out a hormonal 
imbalance, tumor or chronic disease." 
</P>
<P>
 In the vast majority of cases, though, the children are simply early or late 
bloomers, or they are genetically programmed to look as they do -- and they are 
perfectly normal, according to Tarzana pediatrician Dr. Nan Zaitlen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most kids are growing just like they are supposed to," she said. "I tell 
them, 'You are the perfect size for you; you are on your own time clock.' 
Someone will always be the shortest in the class; someone will always be the 
tallest; and some kids will always be heavier than others."  
</P>
<P>
 If a child continues to be excessively distraught over a particular feature, 
cosmetic surgery may be recommended. "I often hear children and adolescents 
say, 'When I am 16, I will have my nose fixed,"' Goldstein said. "They have the 
idea that they are not stuck with an unacceptable body part, that it can be 
modified, and that is the way they are able to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But plastic surgery should not be regarded as a panacea for whatever is 
bothering a troubled youth. A better solution, Goldstein said, is to help the 
teen-ager build his or her self-image. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teen-age years are the hardest time for kids in terms of being extremely 
sensitive," she said. "That's why it is really important for teen-agers to be 
aware of their personal strengths, to establish a positive self-concept -- and 
to not accept the negative assessment of peers or others as necessarily valid 
or meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
 While it is important to pay attention to children's concerns about their 
appearance, experts say parents should not bring up or criticize their 
perceived defects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids interpret criticism as a pulling away of love," Lavin said. "They 
believe if they were taller or thinner, their parents would love them more. 
Parents must reassure their children that they love them no matter what, and 
they can be whatever they want to be -- whatever size they are." Making a 
Difference 
</P>
<P>
 Children who believe they look different from their friends are likely to have 
a low self-image. Here are some ways that parents can bolster fragile young 
egos: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay attention when your child expresses discomfort about his or her 
appearance. "Sit down, listen and be supportive," said Tarzana pediatrician Dr. 
Nan Zaitlen. "Don't dismiss the child by saying, 'Oh, no, you're fine.' 
Children need to know they are cared about, loved and listened to."  
</P>
<P>
 * Point out positive role models, such as entertainers, athletes, public 
figures or family friends who have similar physical characteristics as your 
child. "Give the child living proof that differences don't have to preclude 
success and happiness," said Van Nuys clinical psychologist Sondra Goldstein. 
"Many people use their differences to their advantage. Look at Danny DeVito, 
who is shorter than most men and is a superstar, or Janet Reno, who is very 
tall and also successful, dynamic and bright." 
</P>
<P>
 * Pull out the old family album and show your kids your childhood pictures. As 
a parent, you are your child's first and most important role model, and chances 
are, you suffered through -- and overcame -- the same insecurities and 
anxieties your child now faces. "In general," Zaitlen said, "tall parents have 
tall kids, short parents have short kids, so reflect back to your experiences. 
Say, 'I remember when I was worried about that." 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage children to focus on their strengths, talents and positive 
attributes. "Teach them to develop self-soothing statements," Goldstein said, 
"such as: 'I may be the tallest, but I am also the best at handball. I may be 
overweight, but I am the best speller. I am kind. I am generous. I have a 
wonderful smile.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Enlist the support of teachers to help your child's classmates learn to 
empathize with and embrace differences in one another. Puppet shows, guest 
speakers or biographies of famous people who overcame adversity all help 
children learn about the wide range of "normal." "Everyone has parts of 
themselves they wish they could change," Goldstein said, "and learning about 
people who believed in themselves despite their differences is inspirational to 
all children."

BANDS ON REWIND; PERFORMERS FIND SUCCESS, AND PAYCHECKS, RE-CREATING ROCK ACTS 
FROM RUSH TO KISS FOR FANS WHO SHUN GANGSTA AND GRUNGE.

 The man in the leather pants, with the bandannas wrapped around his wrists, 
was shouting and singing and jumping like Diamond Dave himself. And the crowd 
was screaming back, singing along to songs like "Jump" and "Hot for Teacher," 
pausing only for some solos from that guitarist in the black leather vest. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the band Van Halen (circa 1984) on stage, or singer David Lee 
Roth or guitarist Eddie Van Halen. Those days are long gone. But for this crowd 
of 300 on the floor of Pelican's Retreat, the original lineup of Van Halen had 
miraculously returned, without that Sammy Hagar guy who replaced Roth in 1986, 
or any other evidence of time having passed. 
</P>
<P>
 That singing acrobat in the long blond hair was actually Ralph Saenz, who is 
only in the early stages of his own musical career, fronting this band called 
the Atomic Punks in tribute to the hard rock act he idolized while growing up. 
By the third song of the night, Saenz assures the crowd that the Atomic Punks 
don't actually believe they are Van Halen, or suffer from any other identity 
crises. "We're just here to have a good time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute Atomic Punks concert last week was just the first of a monthlong 
series of performances by a variety of acts paying tribute to popular rock 
groups at the Calabasas nightclub. It continues Saturday with Sheer Heart 
Attack, a tribute to Queen; followed by a Rush tribute called Caress of Steel 
on Sept. 9; Parasite, a re-creation of Kiss in all its high-heeled, 
heavy-makeup glory, on Sept. 17, and the self-explanatory Led Zepagain on Sept. 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were really into it," says Dave Hewitt, who books talent at Pelican's. 
"They were yelling and singing like they were at the Forum or something." 
</P>
<P>
 But he's hardly surprised. The regular Pelican's crowd has already 
demonstrated a willingness to look back. The club's regular Thursday night 
re-creation of the disco era via the Boogie Knights band is already one of the 
week's busiest nights. Hewitt also has plans to bring in a band that plays 
nothing but KROQ-FM (106.7)-style '80s pop later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 On a broader scale, tribute albums featuring major recording artists singing 
the songs of Curtis Mayfield, Kiss, Neil Young, even the Carpenters, among 
others, is a trend that has accelerated in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 So reflecting on older music, Hewitt suggests, is an alternative for those 
unable to identify with some newer forms of pop, whether it is the roar of 
grunge rock or the seething aggression of gangsta rap. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do is something you can't see anymore," says Atomic Punks guitarist 
Bart Walsh, referring to Van Halen's original lineup, which influenced a 
generation of hard rock acts. "And it's a very viable form of music that's no 
longer being made. I'm like a kid in a candy store when I'm doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Atomic Punks were born just eight months ago when Walsh's band found 
itself without a singer for a fast-approaching club gig. He invited Saenz to 
sing with the band that night, and spent it playing mostly Van Halen songs, 
since all the players were fans and already knew the material. While each of 
the band's members continue to pursue more traditional rock careers in other 
acts, they've discovered a huge demand for resurrecting the old Van Halen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anywhere we play everybody already knows the words. We play all their hits 
and everybody goes crazy," says Saenz, who was enough of a fan to attend five 
Van Halen concerts before Roth left the band. "David Lee Roth was an 
exceptional entertainer, and that's what the Atomic Punks try to capture." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Walsh says he has enjoyed the aid of Eddie Van Halen's guitar 
technician in re-creating some of the guitarist's unique sounds, though none of 
the original band has yet to witness any of their performances. "First of all, 
we love Van Halen," says Walsh, who lives in Burbank. "They were a big 
influence on all our lives. It's out of respect that we try to make it as 
authentic as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt says he chose the five acts for his "Rock Tribute Month" series out of 
a large, growing field of tribute bands of varying quality. The built-in 
popularity of the material being performed has made the tribute-band racket a 
profitable career move for many musicians. "It's kind of a bandwagon," says 
Walsh. "A lot of guys are jumping on it now to make money" because the music is 
already popular. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For rock players who have spent years struggling, or have even paid promoters 
for the opportunity to perform, the growing demand for tribute acts is an 
irresistible new sensation. Sheer Heart Attack guitarist Steve Zukowsky has 
watched as demand for his band's performances as Queen takes them to clubs 
across California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is we can get paid for doing this," Zukowsky says, comparing 
Sheer Heart Attack to his other experiences as a working musician. "It's nice 
because we're playing to an audience that knows all the music. And there are no 
ego problems within the band because no one writes the music. We just have to 
decide what music we're going to play in each set." 
</P>
<P>
 The members of Sheer Heart Attack (which also includes drummer Jeffrey 
Maxwell, singer Enrique Segura, bassist Peter McGowan, and keyboardist Steve 
Ramada) were already heavy Queen fans. But it still took several months of 
practicing the group's operatic pop before they felt comfortable enough to face 
audiences, and other Queen fanatics. The tribute band performs music from 
throughout Queen's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are really big Queen fans," says Zukowsky. "I don't think we could 
pull it off if we weren't. People come up to us and ask obscure questions about 
the history of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part they've accepted us. They had to make sure we were doing it 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 At Pelican's, says Hewitt, "The first criteria is that you've got to sound 
exactly like these bands. Any variation and you get shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to take on the persona of whatever band they are doing. That's 
half the show. With Kiss it's the fireballs and the whole thing. Without that, 
it would be like an Elvis impersonator who didn't dress like Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that many of these bands are seeking the same sort of campy persona common 
to Elvis impersonators. "Most people," says Walsh, "when they hear about a Van 
Halen tribute, they go, 'Yeah, right .' " He says if a tribute act is "done 
with integrity I respect it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Atomic Punks, "We could do it for a couple years, or even longer. . 
. . But it's not a career." But Zukowsky of Sheer Heart Attack says it doesn't 
necessarily have to end. "We can't all do original music," he says. "That's a 
real tough thing, and takes a lot of dedication. But we have so much fun doing 
this I don't care." WHERE AND WHEN

PARENTING; NEW SCHOOL, NEW WORRIES; MAKING THE TRANSITION MEANS A JOURNEY INTO 
THE UNKNOWN. UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE AND SURROUNDINGS TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO.

 Josh Noland, 10, hasn't started school yet but already worries about the 
prospect. "I'm nervous that kids won't play with me because I'm new," he 
recently admitted as he toured Germain Street Elementary School in Chatsworth, 
where he'll enroll next month. 
</P>
<P>
 He worries partly, he said, because he's transferring from a private school, 
and he has heard that public-school students fight a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 It's common knowledge that being a new kid can be tough, whether the change of 
status is a result of a move, the switch from private to public, or middle 
school to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, change, while a challenge for everyone, said Elaine Massion, an 
elementary school psychologist with the L.A. Unified School District, is 
"especially hard for children because they lack the experience and coping 
skills developed over years. Changing to a new school disrupts their routines 
and friendships -- the world as they know it. Don't be surprised if little ones 
regress, or older children act out."  
</P>
<P>
 To help kids with the transition, Linda Noland, Josh's mother, advises parents 
to remember that "the more you become familiar with a situation, the better you 
feel." She found that visiting the new campus alleviated many of Josh's 
anxieties, as did plans to attend new-student orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also recommend that new students and parents meet with the principal, 
counselor and teacher to discuss a child's specific concerns. Parents should 
inquire, too, as to whether there are any subjects their child should brush up 
on, or new challenges he or she could practice working on.  
</P>
<P>
 "If your child has a learning disability, let the school know," advised 
Massion. "Arrangements can be made for special services." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources of information for both parents and children are school 
newspapers, other parents, and officers of the Parent-Teacher Assn., who can 
answer a wide range of questions about the school.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As to the challenge of making friends -- one of the keys to a smooth 
transition -- it can help for a youngster to join a sports team or other 
extracurricular activity at the new school. Parents can discuss with their kids 
strategies for making friends and can even arrange "play dates" with the 
children of parents they meet at orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, teachers will sometimes assign a "buddy" to a child who has 
difficulty making friends, especially if a parent requests it.  
</P>
<P>
 Also important to a youngster's adjustment is observing how students dress in 
a new environment, since anyone who departs from the norm can become a target 
of teasing. Jan Arney, for instance, after a recent move from Northridge to 
Boulder, Colo., recalled how her 11-year-old daughter was ridiculed by new 
schoolmates because she wore skirts and ate tuna sandwiches. (All the other 
girls wore pants and seemed to think tuna was for nerds.) 
</P>
<P>
 But while acceptance is precious, parents should be on the lookout for 
children who seek it at any cost, perhaps falling in with a crowd whose values 
they don't share. Grown-ups can help, advises Massion, by being aware of their 
children's special interests and guiding them into groups that focus on those 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can also be of use by maintaining an upbeat attitude throughout the 
period of change. Brenda Winter, assistant principal at Lawrence Middle School 
in Chatsworth, counsels moms and dads that their attitudes set the tone for a 
successful transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't transmit your fears to your child," Winter said. "Present a positive 
picture. Perhaps the new school offers classes unavailable at the old school. 
Plus, your child is starting with a clean slate. Here's an opportunity to 
become whatever he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabrielle Sein, 13, of Calabasas agreed. "Although I realize high school won't 
be as nurturing, and I'll have to be more independent," she said, "I'm looking 
forward to going to Louisville (High School in Woodland Hills). I've always 
been shy, but now I have a chance to try to be more outgoing." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts caution, however, that in their fervor to help children adjust, 
parents should not encourage kids to break their ties with the past. Noland, 
for example, made sure that Josh, before he moved on, had a sense of "closure 
with the old school. We took pictures of Josh's friends and had everyone sign 
the yearbook. We also wrote down addresses and phone numbers so Josh can keep 
in touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important is that children -- and parents -- have realistic 
expectations about the changes they face and try not to panic if the initial 
adjustment is bumpy.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are living in an age when there's constant change," said Winter. "Anytime 
we get the chance to teach our children to be flexible and confident with 
changes, we are doing them a favor." How to Relieve 'New Kid' Jitters 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow a young child to bring a transitional object to school if it isn't 
against school rules. "A favorite stuffed animal may be just the thing to give 
security to your youngster," said Elaine Massion, an L.A. Unified school 
psychologist.  
</P>
<P>
 * Practice relaxation exercises with your child. "Ask her to close her eyes 
and picture herself happy and confident. She is smiling at classmates and 
introducing herself to them," Massion said. "She should take deep breaths and 
feel relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 * Read books about moving. Younger kids will enjoy "The Berenstain Bears' 
Moving Day," by Stan and Jan Berenstain (Random House, $2.50), and older ones 
will like "This Place Has No Atmosphere Here," by Paula Danziger (Doubleday, 
$15; Dell paperback, $3.99). 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage children to express their feelings. "I'm going to suggest that 
Josh write and illustrate a story about a new boy in school," said Linda Noland 
of Chatsworth. "Hopefully, this will be a good jumping-off point for a 
discussion of his concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish a routine before the first day of school. "Set patterns during a 
non-stressful period," advised Brenda Winter, assistant principal of Lawrence 
Middle School in Chatsworth. "For example, several days before the first 
semester, set the alarm at the time your child will wake up for school." 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepare school materials. Have notebooks, pencils and gym clothes ready to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 * Participate in your child's school. Joining the Parent-Teacher Assn. or 
volunteering in class gives your child a feeling of belonging and gives them 
the message that school is important to the entire family.

A FRESH LOOK AT ANTIQUITIES; THE FIRST PUBLIC SHOW OF CYPRIOT ARTIFACTS AT CSUN 
WILL BE IN A TRAILER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a paradox in Cal State Northridge's first art exhibit of the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, one can see some of the most enduring artifacts ever to 
grace CSUN in the show, "Cypriote Antiquities in Southern California." Among 
almost 40 jugs, bottles, bowls, plates and oil lamps are several pieces dating 
to the Bronze Age, some of them as old as 2100 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 But one must view these ancient objects in the most temporary of spaces. Since 
the January earthquake, the Fine Arts building that contained CSUN's three art 
galleries has been closed. To follow through on presenting this year's gallery 
schedule, an exhibit space was set up in a trailer near the corner of Nordhoff 
Street and Etiwanda Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Most pieces in the show come from two local collections held by 75-year-old 
twins James Stewart Bruce and Janet Bruce-Nathason. This is the first time the 
objects have been available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think of the history of this material, and what happened to the 
campus, it's ironic doing it here," said Catie Dede-Mihalopoulos, exhibit 
curator.  
</P>
<P>
 The show was planned more than a year ago, having evolved out of 
Dede-Mihalopoulos' master's thesis. She completed the thesis this year at CSUN 
under the supervision of Birgitta Lindros-Wohl, professor of Greek and Roman 
art history. (Lindros-Wohl is the daughter of John Lindros, the architect and 
photographer of the Swedish Cyprus Expedition, 1927-1931. It was during that 
expedition that the first systematic, stratigraphical excavations of the island 
of Cyprus were made.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dede-Mihalopoulos, originally from Athens, explained that Cyprus, lying 
between southern Europe and the Near East, has served as a link between East 
and West for several millennia. She became intrigued with Cypriot artifacts 
because, despite the island culture's close connection to Greek culture, "what 
you see there is so different from what you see on the mainland," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evident are influences of Greek as well as Eastern peoples -- Phoenicians, 
Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians -- and the Romans, who held Cyprus within its 
empire from circa 30 BC. "It's like a cocktail. You start with the Greek and 
then you pour all these other things in," Lindros-Wohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clay, limestone and glass objects in the show made their way to Southern 
California with the twin collectors, who grew up on Cyprus during the 1920s and 
'30s while their father served as manager of the Cyprus Mines Corp. United 
Nations troops now occupy the house that the twins lived in, a result of the 
1974 invasion of the island by Turkish troops.  
</P>
<P>
 There are seven other Cypriot antiquities collections in the area, including 
those at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Getty Museum, the Claremont 
Colleges, the Philosophical Research Society in the Los Feliz neighborhood and 
the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that people become aware that this heritage is here," 
Dede-Mihalopoulos said. "Archeologists like me are able to study them 
firsthand. As a person who studies these artifacts, I see the uniqueness of 
them. The uniqueness comes from the cosmopolitan-ness" of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more ancient pieces in the exhibit is a Cypro-Mycenaean vessel of 
the Late Bronze Age, 1400-1230 BC. A Bichrome Ware Dish dates between 850 and 
700 BC, the Late Cypro-Geometric period. Works from the earliest of times were 
"consistently limited to geometric patterns, but endless patterns. The shapes 
are pleasant to touch and have a tremendous sense of aesthetic form," 
Lindros-Wohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plate-like oil lamps from the Cypro-Archaic period (750-475 BC.) evolved to be 
made from two molds, the top mold enclosing the oil in the bottom one. The 
votive terra-cotta "Bearded Horseman" of the Cypro-Archaic period, from the 
Royal Athena Gallery collection, represents a significant aspect of Cypriot 
antiquities -- the depiction of the human figure in rather specific forms. The 
Late Cypro-Archaic "Head of Aphrodite," from Lindros-Wohl's collection, stands 
as a symbol of the Cypriot's connection to Greek mythology.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the numerous examples of Roman glass circa 50 BC-150 AD are small tear 
bottles, used by professional mourners at funerals, and the substantially 
larger "Unguentaria," bottles that resemble the shape of candlesticks.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Cyprus artisans throughout the centuries assimilated outside 
influences, their artwork has "remained uniquely Cypriot," Dede-Mihalopoulos 
said. WHERE AND WHEN

PLANTING SEEDS OF LEARNING; STUDENT GARDENS REAP A HARVEST OF BENEFITS. THEY

 "Oh, gosh!" Krystal Lerner, 10, wailed. "This is dying!" She caressed the 
wilted leaves of a fading flower. "It's pretty dry. Oh, wait! I spotted a green 
part!" 
</P>
<P>
 Awkwardly maneuvering a watering can, she sprinkled the plant. "If we give it 
water and keep it in shape," she explained, "maybe it will live." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with her schoolmates at Woodlake Elementary School in Woodland Hills, 
Krystal, a fourth-grader, is tending the Woodlake-Community Children's Garden, 
planted last spring with the support of local businesses, residents and 
parents. The garden, which replaced a long-ignored front lawn, is composed of 
several distinct sections, each marked by a sign: "Desert," "Mediterranean," 
"Australia," "Herb Garden," "Grassy Gulch," "Succulent Ground Cover" and 
"Butterfly Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 A California native plant area, featuring wildflowers and 
hummingbird-attracting blossoms, is planned for fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the rectangular garden is filled with more than 150 drought-tolerant, 
low-maintenance, "kid-friendly" (that is, nontoxic, thorn-less and fun) plants, 
with an emphasis on flowering perennials and ornamental grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away at Welby Way Elementary School in West Hills, students, 
parents and teachers are fussing over their own flower and vegetable garden. 
The "Life Lab," as the fenced-in square of land is called, is rumored to have 
once corralled a pony and was later abandoned to weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the old weed patch bursts with color. Each class has its own plot with 
the students' choice of flowers or vegetables. Children who want fresh-picked 
bouquets in their classrooms plant sweet peas, petunias, marigolds, zinnias, 
sunflowers, snapdragons and wildflowers, while those who prefer to feast on the 
fruits (and vegetables) of their labor grow strawberries, tomatoes, squash, 
radishes, cucumbers, Brussels sprouts, lettuce and corn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The students had no concept of where vegetables come from," said Welby Way 
fifth-grade teacher Dianne Rosen. "They see them on a shelf in a grocery store 
or in a box in the freezer. One student asked, 'You mean you can grow 
potatoes?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences in flora and appearance, the Woodlake and Welby Way 
gardens achieve many of the same goals. They beautify schoolyards, serve as 
teaching tools and bring communities together. 
</P>
<P>
 "A children's garden is educational," said parent Lynette Mathis, who 
spearheaded the Woodlake effort. "It is fun. It is beautiful. It gets the kids 
excited about the environment. It is the perfect vehicle for community 
involvement. And it is a model of the exciting things that happen when kids get 
out of the classroom to do hands-on learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis, who as a child attended Woodlake, said the idea for a garden came to 
her when she realized the school looked just as boring as she remembered. "I 
wanted to transform the plain and institutional facade into something 
beautiful," she said. "The school needed a face lift, and everyone could use a 
morale boost. A garden was something we could feel proud of and inspired by." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis' proposal was embraced by parents, teachers and the community. Parents 
built bridges and bird baths. Local businesses donated supplies, plants and 
cash. Landscaping students at West Valley Occupational Center replaced the old, 
inefficient sprinklers with a new, water-saving irrigation system. And students 
-- wielding brooms, hoes and kid-sized plastic wheelbarrows -- dug in and 
planted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone also pitched in for Welby Way's Life Lab. The school earned "seed 
money" for the project from a local mall. A teacher brought a wheelbarrow and a 
rototiller from her garage; local nurseries contributed manure, planter mix and 
flowers and a school secretary hauled the load in her pickup truck. Parents 
built compost bins, dug holes and helped plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers pull weeds after school as a nice stress-reliever," said Welby 
Principal Gigi Edler, "and it's wonderful how so many community members have 
come to water, offer advice or help monitor children." 
</P>
<P>
 Such gardens form the basis for a variety of hands-on science lessons, 
according to Woodlake teacher Nancy Firestein. "The children learn how plants 
grow from seeds, cuttings and bulbs," she said. "They learn about root systems. 
They learn how smog affects plants and how plants replenish oxygen." 
</P>
<P>
 Reading, writing and arithmetic assignments also stem from the gardens. 
Ecology has become a favorite topic in classroom discussions and essays. Art 
projects are based on garden finds. Spelling words come from plant names. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children really feel they are doing something vital and relevant to real 
life," Firestein said. "They have become very aware of the importance of the 
environment -- and when children are involved in conserving the environment, 
they are not going to be the ones who destroy it." Be a 'Gardening Angel' 
</P>
<P>
 You can help create a garden at your local elementary, middle or high school 
by volunteering as a "Gardening Angel" through the federally funded Common 
Ground program. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardening Angels, who spend one or two hours a week at their assigned school, 
help plan, design, install and maintain gardens. They are trained in site 
selection, soil preparation, plants, insects and irrigation. They learn how to 
work with children, parents, teachers and businesses. Typical activities may 
include throwing a classroom "salad party", leading workshops for teachers and 
parents or arranging for field trips.

Angeles, CA 90007; (213) 744-4349. SOME ADVICE 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips for gardening with children: 
</P>
<P>
 * Stick with easy-to-grow plants. Radishes, tomatoes, squash, zinnias and 
marigolds are good choices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kids get bored quickly, so limit any one activity to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow children to participate. They learn by doing -- not watching. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't demand perfection. Young children aren't interested in straight rows 
or detailed plans. Encourage them to experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inspire youngsters by taking them to such places as Descanso Gardens in La 
Canada Flintridge, Huntington Library, Art Collection and Botanical Gardens in 
San Marino or the L.A. State and County Arboretum in Arcadia. 
</P>

CORPS ENGINEERS 'LAFFS'; YARMY'S ARMY, A GROUP OF SHOW-BUSINESS VETERANS AND 
LONGTIME FRIENDS, WILL PERFORM AT THEATRE WEST.

 If you like your humor in large doses, Yarmy's Army has just the cure for you. 
This weekend, the all- star group of comedy performers, writers, directors and 
producers is presenting "An Evening of Laffs . . . " at Theatre West as a 
two-night benefit for the theater and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps grew out of an informal series of restaurant get-togethers 
established by the late comic actor Dick Yarmy after he was diagnosed with 
inoperable cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Army" includes Don Adams, Shelley Berman, Gino Conforti, Tim Conway, Bill 
Dana, Pat Harrington, Don Knotts, Harvey Korman (who will emcee the shows), Jim 
MacGeorge, Chuck McCann, Pat McCormick, Howard Morris, Gary Owens, Tom Poston, 
Bob Ridgely, Jack Riley, Ronnie Schell, Tom Sharp, Dick Van Patten and Chris 
Weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 All except Knotts are scheduled to appear; only Adams (brother of the late 
Yarmy) and Van Patten are listed as "maybes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, it was Dick getting some pals together -- there were just five of 
us then -- saying, 'Let's have some dinners, some laughs,' " Harrington 
explains. "After (Yarmy) died, we decided to stay together, do some work for 
charity." 
</P>
<P>
 Their first public foray took place in April, a benefit for The Holiday 
Project at Santa Barbara's Arlington Theatre. This weekend's stint at Theatre 
West will duplicate that format: In the first half of the show, each performer 
will have five minutes to do his own sketch or monologue (Harrington will 
reprise his vintage golf-pro character "Guido Panzini"). In the second half, 
the performers sit onstage in director's chairs, reminiscing, sharing stories 
and anecdotes -- and fielding questions from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just kind of happened," Sam Denoff says of the group's evolution. "And 
it's been a very loving, giving situation. The image of comedians is (one of) 
being very competitive -- which they are -- but everyone is really pitching in, 
trying to help each other out." 
</P>
<P>
 Denoff, who's sharing producing and directing duties with Howard Storm, notes 
that the group still gets together the second Tuesday of every month at 
L'Express in Sherman Oaks. "They've dedicated a separate room to us," he says, 
"because the screaming, yelling and hysteria gets a little much." 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick, whose first-act offering will be a comedy bit with Riley ("I'm from 
the Information Superhighway; he can ask me anything") likens the feeling among 
the group to "jazz players riffing -- the fun is the camaraderie of people on 
your wavelength." 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's performances are also being held in memory of McCormick's 
sister, Mona, who died a few weeks ago at 57 due to complications of diabetes. 
"She had a good sense of humor," McCormick says, "and she really enjoyed these 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 "My five minutes is a piece about an actor at an audition who'll do anything 
-- anything -- to get a part," says group member Schell. Schell (who's also the 
honorary mayor of Encino) believes what distinguishes Yarmy's Army from other 
groups of comedians "is that we're all working actors, producers, writers and 
directors -- no one's retired. The problem is, since we're all working, getting 
our schedules together is tough. But this show was a priority. We were 
determined to get together because Dick was a member of Theatre West -- and 
also for Pat's sister." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER REVIEW; 'SECRETS' TOLD AS JOURNEY UNFOLDS; BRIAN MALLON TAKES A POETIC 
WALK THROUGH CELTIC LITERATURE AND LORE IN A CELEBRATION OF HEROES AND 
BEAUTIFUL, FLOWING LANGUAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Late in the second millennium BC, the Celtic peoples moved west from north- 
central Europe and set tled in Brittany and across the water in Ireland, 
Scotland and Wales. They brought with them a strong, mystical understanding of 
life forces and societal stability. 
</P>
<P>
 That sense took root in the rich Western soil and blossomed into a body of 
lore and literature that has continued to thrive into this century. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not religious, nor is it philosophical, but as Brian Mallon illustrates 
in his evening of "Secrets of the Celtic Heart," at the Lionstar Theatre, it is 
most probably just a very special and lucid way of looking at life. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallon, who gathered these literary leaves into the bouquet of a multihued 
heritage, has chosen particularly insightful fragments, ranging from writings 
of the 5th-Century Irish Druid Amergin to modern Welsh poet T.H. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a great deal of another Welshman, Dylan Thomas, in his program, and 
that is probably very wise. Thomas, more than any other modern poet, understood 
the mystical core of the Celtic heart and the Celtic mind. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mallon first appears, in the darkness of the auditorium, he wears a scarf 
and carries a suitcase, for he is on a journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on stage, he is continually surprised by his discoveries: a flagon of 
ancient wine, the primitive mask and cloak of Amergin, the laurel wreath and 
gleaming sword of the 6th-Century hero-bard Taliesin, the alchemist's bench and 
mysterious incantations, the book-piled corner where Mallon uncovers the Celtic 
lays of today, along with a convenient bottle of Jameson's. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mallon's supple, resonant tones, there is a vast range of flavor. 
Taliesin's heroics contrast with the tender, giddy humor of a modern young man 
watching a couple making love, the 14th-Century "Girls of Llanbadarn" with 
Dylan Thomas' heartbreaking paean to his slowly dying father, "Do Not Go Gentle 
Into That Good Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Mallon's affectionate, highly theatrical readings are accompanied by original 
music by Jonathan Sacks, particularly attuned to the many periods of the works, 
and are evocatively framed in an interesting lighting design by Clive Henrick. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an evening of remembrance, of a time when people could still pause to 
praise their existence, hail true heroes, and remember the value of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a tribute to language, beautiful, flowing and full of the wisdom and 
innocence of which we sang when the world was young. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Secrets of the Celtic Heart."  
</P>
<P>
 Location: Lionstar Theatre, 12655 Ventura Blvd., Studio City.

<P>
 Hours: 7 p.m. Sundays. Ends Sept. 26.

 No need to go to a smoke-filled arena that reeks of stale beer to watch grown 
men slam into one another. World Class Wrestling is coming to the Antelope 
Valley Fair and Alfalfa Festi val. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-maligned professional spectator sport is just one of a plethora of

"Yesterday," a tribute to the Beatles, on Saturday and singer Alvaro Torres on 
Sunday. Rob Hanna offers "A Salute to Rod Stewart" on Sept. 3 and Freddy Fender 
will perform Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the usual pygmy pigs and cuddly chicks, an exhibit of large animals 
will showcase a 3,000-pound horse named Hercules; a steer that is more than 11 
feet long and tips the scales at 3,300 pounds; and a 12-foot, 1,000-pound 
alligator.

PARENTING; GEARING UP; MOST TEEN-AGERS ARE EAGER TO DRIVE, BUT PARENTS ARE 
CAUGHT BETWEEN WELCOMING THE HELP AND WORRYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Danielle Minsky, 16, of Northridge couldn't wait to get her driver's license 
-- it was her ticket to freedom. Her mother, Michele, on the other hand, saw it 
as an indefinite sentence to a life of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 When children start to drive, she says, "parents lose a lot of peace of mind. 
Before, you knew exactly where they were. Now, you have more to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, most parents want their 16-year-olds to be able to drive, 
according to Tom Richards, who has been teaching driver's education on and off 
since 1969 at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other benefits, having another driver in the house relieves mom and dad 
from being a slave to a teen-ager's schedule. It also gives teen-agers an added 
measure of responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think most parents know their kids and know if they're responsible enough 
to drive," said Jean McCalla of Northridge, who is training her third child, 
Kevin, 15, behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 With each of her children, before lessons began, she assessed their 
reliability, attention span and maturity. She said Kevin, who recently got his 
learner's permit, pays attention, is trustworthy in other areas of his life and 
is very aware on the road, so she is calm now as she lets him drive her on 
errands. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mom, who lives in North Hills but asked that her name not be used, 
wouldn't let her daughter, now 28, drive until she was 17 because "she didn't 
seem to know where the dangers were. She thought that everyone else would take 
care of things. Just because it's a green light, you can't automatically go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever a parent's timetable may be, a teen-ager approaching driving age is 
often impatient to hit the road. Eileen Shuster, co-owner of Bob's Driving 
School in Northridge, joked, "You know he's ready when he doesn't quit nagging 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "When most of their friends are driving, when they show an interest 
in the driving process, pay attention when you drive and ask why you are doing 
this or that," these may be signs that it's time to investigate driver's ed. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Ortega, who works full time as an RTD bus driver and has been 
teaching at Bob's part time for about 12 years, said teen-agers are actually 
quicker studies in driving than older adults, who tire faster and have slower 
reflexes. Because teen-agers are "very motivated," they take direction well and 
handle correction better. Adults like to see demonstrations before they get 
behind the wheel, he said, but teen-agers "learn by doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 But if a student approaches driving "as if it were a game," Ortega said, he 
knows they haven't realized the full potential -- or danger -- of driving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of concentration and lack of experience are what make teen-agers "slam 
into each other," Richards said. Ortega agrees that behind-the-wheel practice 
time is vital. "We can teach them the basics in six hours, but they need to 
drive a little bit each day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers report that the scariest tasks they face as new drivers involve 
making left-hand turns -- especially across oncoming traffic -- and lane 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of navigating through a sea of speeding cars is, in fact, so 
intimidating to some teen-agers that they resist learning to drive at all. 
</P>
<P>
 One Granada Hills youth explained that he just didn't want the responsibility. 
"You always hear about accidents," he said. "And there are some really bad 
drivers out there." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother finally convinced him to take his driving test when he was 16 1/2, 
and now, a year later, he finally feels comfortable driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can be most helpful to their children by serving as model drivers, 
said West Valley CHP traffic Officer Dave King. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents must be as responsible as they want their children to be," which 
means staying within the speed limit and obeying all traffic rules, said King, 
who often lectures to driver's education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The three biggest dangers of driving, he emphasized, are speeding, speeding 
and speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 To set the tone for sensible driving, King advised, parents should tell 
youngsters "right off the bat that driving is not only a privilege from the 
state but from the parent." Rules of the Road 
</P>
<P>
 Although establishing driving rules for a teen-ager is an individual matter, 
here are some tips from parents, driving instructors and other experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Draw up a contract that lists driving rules, a teen-ager's responsibilities, 
and the consequences should any rule be broken. Rules might cover common-sense 
taboos -- no drinking and driving -- as well as guidelines for car care: 
keeping it clean, filling the gas tank, etc. Consequences might include paying 
for all traffic fines and any damages incurred during an accident.  
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss car rules before handing over the keys.  
</P>
<P>
 * Have teen-agers post all driving plans and destinations in a prominent 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask them to phone home if plans change and they are going to be late.  
</P>
<P>
 * Extend driving privileges in increments, initially limiting trips to school 
and back or allowing only daytime driving before granting after-dark 
privileges.  
</P>
<P>
 * Limit passengers to the number of seat belts a car has and stipulate that 
everyone buckles up before the engine starts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Link driving privileges to school work. If grades drop, confiscate the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stress road courtesy, warning teen-agers not to get into altercations with 
other drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage new drivers to be security conscious, locking car doors, for 
example, especially at night. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discourage them from driving when they are angry, frustrated or crying.  
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure their friends know your driving rules. Getting Started 
</P>
<P>
 In California, minors may get a learner's permit at age 15 if they are taking 
driver's education. Indeed, they must have a permit before they get behind the 
wheel of an auto. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for a permit, applicants are required to take an eye exam and a 
written test. This is the same 46-question test on traffic laws and signs that 
all new drivers must pass with a score of 39 or better. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to drive with a learner's permit, teen-agers must be accompanied by a 
California-licensed driver age 25 or older. At 16, provided they have had a 
permit for at least 30 days, completed driver's education and six hours of 
driver's training, and paid a $12 application fee, minors may take the driver's 
test. They must repeat the written exam (if a year has passed since they first 
took it) and undergo a road test, which, in L.A. County, includes freeway 
driving.  
</P>
<P>
 To those who pass, the Department of Motor Vehicles issues a provisional, 
under-18 license, which can be taken away more easily than an over-18 license. 
Sufficient cause for revocation includes a range of offenses, from driving 
under the influence to habitual school truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 To get either a learner's permit or a driver's license, a minor must have the 
signature of a parent or guardian, who must assume full financial 
responsibility. Any adult 18 or older may apply independently for a license. 
</P>
<P>
 Most public and private high schools still offer driver's education (although 
funding is constantly in doubt). They no longer provide in-the-car driver's 
training, which used to be paid for out of the state's traffic penalty 
assessment fund. Now, students must take a private driver's training course, 
available through state-licensed schools and costing about $120 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 A free driver's handbook may be requested from the DMV by phone. Appointments 
for all exams, which are given at DMV offices, may also be made by phone.

WHEELS OF FORTUNE; A WORRIED BUS TRIP TO THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL ENDS HAPPILY -- AND 
WITHOUT HASSLES OF PARKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BAKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Kathryn Baker is a regular contributor

<TEXT>
<P>
 My summer ritual of attending one Hollywood Bowl concert is looming and 
already I'm thinking about the traffic. You know, traffic that's so bad that on 
concert nights the neighborhood takes on the aspect of a small Latin American 
country during a coup: uniformed guards standing grim-faced watch over 
blocked-off street entrances with the terse warning -- "No Theatre Parking." So 
this year, I'm considering the alternative. I'm considering taking the -- 
choke, gasp -- Bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Bowl offers two kinds of buses, a Bowlbus Shuttle (which sounds 
like a medical condition or a line dance, I'm not sure which) and Bowlbus Park 
& Ride. The shuttles run from parking lots relatively near the Bowl every 10 
minutes and cost $2 round-trip. The Park & Ride is available in various 
farther-flung neighborhoods, has fewer departure times and costs $4. I opt for 
the 6:30 p.m. Park & Ride bus that leaves from the Sunkist Building at 
Hazeltine Avenue and Riverside Drive in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 I arrive at 6:15 p.m. and bring a book, expecting to wait. But no. Two buses 
are parked along the curb and one of them is already filling up, so I quickly 
get in line. I realize with alarm that many of those waiting to board are 
clutching tickets. I don't have a ticket. Turns out you can order tickets in 
advance, which will give you preference over non-ticket holders if the bus is 
full, but you can also pay when you arrive at the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these riders are obvious veterans, so this must be a good deal. We'll 
see. Anyway, what with all the picnic baskets and beverage coolers, the trip 
has something of a summer-camp feel. The bus pulls out at 6:25 p.m. "Now I know 
why it leaves so early," observes my seatmate, indicating the turn we're making 
up the entrance ramp. "He's takin' the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the god of the Ventura Freeway smiles upon us, and we are soon smugly 
passing lines of cars waiting to enter the various parking lots around the 
Bowl. These insistent drivers are about to experience stacked parking. "Stacked 
parking" means that after the show you can't leave until some sort of 
mathematical Rubik's cube equation of unparking liberates your vehicle, which 
might occur sometime about dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 We pull up in front of the Bowl at 6:40 p.m. So far, things have gone 
smoothly. Now they grind to a halt. We receive a lecture from a Bowl staffer 
regarding payment for the trip and directions on how to locate the bus for the 
ride home: Enter the tunnel behind the marquee, take the second exit, turn 
right, find the bus parking lot, go to the second row and look for 651 Sherman 
Oaks. At least I think that's what he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I would have been perfectly happy to get off the bus now and walk up the hill 
to the Bowl, but our bus begins to grind its way up the driveway -- and 
immediately becomes stuck in a line of cars waiting for more stacked parking. 
After about a five-minute ride that covers maybe 200 yards, we are finally 
released in front of the box office. Worried that this might be the last I will 
see of 651 Sherman Oaks, I consider myself lucky to be meeting a friend who -- 
shuddering at the loss of control over his own destiny that public 
transportation symbolized -- brought his car. So I could at least ride home 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 We tiptoe through the picnickers squatting on the concrete beside the ticket 
booths, and have plenty of time to purchase our own picnic dinners before 
taking our seats. 
</P>
<P>
 As "Brazil Night" music pulses through the Bowl under the now-pleasant summer 
evening sky, my thoughts keep drifting toward the bus, the tunnel, the parking 
lot, the crowds. Will I ever find the bus? What if I can't find the bus? I 
picture pictures of the bus on milk cartons. I picture my picture on milk 
cartons. I imagine wandering, lost in the middle of the night in an eerily 
vacant Hollywood Bowl parking lot, the only sound coming from the leaves 
skittering across the asphalt in the darkness. I think I might become the 
premise of a film noir. 
</P>
<P>
 After the concert, we join the river of flesh flowing toward Highland Avenue. 
My friend takes my hint -- a well-placed comment or two with just a touch of 
whining -- and offers to make sure I find my bus before he leaves me. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:15 p.m., I locate 651 Sherman Oaks exactly where the Bowl staffer said 
it would be and get on board. Our bus begins filling up, but we are stack 
parked behind an empty bus. At 11:25 p.m., our driver gets on, though the bus 
in front of us is still empty. By 11:30 p.m., our bus is full and the driver

COVER STORY; TAKING CHARGE; INVESTMENT CLUBS ARE GROWING AS MORE VALLEY 
RESIDENTS JOIN FORCES TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR FINANCIAL 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's a ritual for Roz Rosin. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the Encino woman gets the paper in the morning, she turns to the 
stock tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Rosin thought of Blockbuster, if she thought of it at all, as 
a place where she could rent videos. Today she and a group of her friends own 
shares in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a growing number of Valley residents, Rosin belongs to an investment 
club. Once a month, she meets with 10 of her friends and spends a couple of 
hours arguing the pros and cons of buying Cifra or some other growth stock. Not 
a great deal of money hangs in the balance -- $50 per person per month. But the 
debate is as serious as if millions were riding on the women's ability to pick 
stock-market winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magnolia Investment Group, as the women call themselves, includes an 
attorney, a real-estate agent and several teachers like Rosin. Most are married 
and have teen-age children. "I really like the idea of a bunch of women getting 
together to do something serious," says member Terry Snyder, who lives in 
Encino and practices law in Sherman Oaks. Since Rosin started the club in 1992, 
the women have put together a portfolio of seven stocks, worth about $11,000 
(recent purchases include Marvel, the comics company). The group also has about 
$2,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the club, Rosin has become something she never expected to be -- a 
confident investor, proud of her ability to parlay the money she earns as a 
substitute teacher into a growing nest egg. "It's given me the courage to 
invest on my own," says Rosin. But the club has had other surprising benefits 
as well. Now when she goes to a party with her attorney husband, Rich, she 
often finds herself talking with his friends about the vagaries of the stock 
market. "I have a lot of self-confidence now that I didn't have before." Best 
of all, Rosin says, teen-age son, Kenny, and college-age daughter, Melissa, 
treat her with greater respect since she became the family expert on such 
weighty matters as whether to buy, sell or hold Telefonica de Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Rosin got serious about stocks, she has been known to spend hours in the 
library, poring over price-earnings ratios and other data reported and 
evaluated in the investors' bible, Value Line. She clips news stories about 
companies she's following and keeps them in a loose-leaf binder dedicated to 
stocks that have piqued her interest. "There's a gambling, fun part of me that 
loves the stock market," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed Rosin says she only recently realized how profoundly the investment 
club had affected her. The occasion was a trip the group took to South Coast 
Plaza for a day of power shopping. In the course of their outing, Rosin spotted 
a gorgeous St. John suit that she tried on to the oohs and aahs of her fellow 
investors. The black knit suit was luscious, she recalls, but she decided to 
pass on it. "It was $800 with tax. And I thought, 'I'm going to buy 
McDonald's!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like many others locally, Rosin's club is a member of the National Assn. of 
Investors Corp., a nonprofit organization based in Michigan that has been 
encouraging and educating groups of small investors since 1951. According to 
the NAIC, there are some 25,000 investment clubs in the United States, 12,000 
of them members of the organization. NAIC clubs have slightly more women 
members than men, and, for reasons that have yet to be plumbed, all-female 
clubs tend to outperform all-male or mixed-gender ones (1993 was the exception, 
with men's clubs edging the women out). The average NAIC group has 17 members 
who invest an average of $37.23 a month. It holds 12 different stocks and saw 
its portfolio gain 13.9% last year, significantly better than the S & P 500's 
gain of just over 10%. Currently, the top five holdings of NAIC clubs are Aflac 
(an insurance company), McDonald's, AT & T, Wal-Mart Stores and PepsiCo. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year more than 2,000 new clubs started up under NAIC auspices. Clubs have 
been increasing by 10% to 12% a year. Indeed, the proliferation of investment 
clubs seems to be part of a larger trend, as more and more people take personal 
responsibility for their fiscal health, just as they have for their physical 
health. There's abundant evidence that financial planning is being democratized 
and demystified -- look at the proliferation of magazines devoted to money 
management and the boom in mutual funds, which individuals can buy without a 
broker. But this is a relatively recent phenomenon. Decades ago, before IRAs 
and 401(k) plans appeared and encouraged modest earners to begin making 
investment decisions, picking stocks was largely the purview of the wealthy, or 
their stockbrokers. "This was perceived as a rich, white, male-dominated 
endeavor," observes Barry Murphy, director of marketing for NAIC. If working 
people invested at all, they tended to eschew the market and put their money 
into super-safe United States savings bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Bernard, who is NAIC's coordinator in the San Fernando Valley, remembers 
wanting to learn more about investing but not really knowing how to go about 
it. Then he read an article about an investment club in Ebony magazine. An 
electrical engineer and consultant in Lake View Terrace, Bernard decided that 
he would do what his own father had not been able to do -- teach his children 
about the stock market. So Bernard and his wife, Melanie, started a family 
investment club. That was almost a decade ago when their now grown children 
were 12 and 14.  
</P>
<P>
 "We named our club the Buttonwood Four because the stock market started under 
a buttonwood tree in 1792," Bernard recalls. "We held our monthly meetings in 
our bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to tweak the children's imaginations, the Bernards made one of their 
first investments in McDonald's. "You've got to get that for the kids, that or 
Disney," Bernard advises other parents who want their children to catch 
investment fever. "You tell them, 'You're going to own some of this company.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once the children were hooked, they lapped up such investment truths as the 
value of dollar cost averaging -- the investing of a set amount at regular 
intervals, which results in the investor buying more shares when prices are low 
and fewer when prices are high. The Better-Investing-Through-Big-Macs approach 
worked like magic, according to Bernard. Both Henry Jr., their 21-year-old son, 
and their 23-year-old daughter, Tanisha, have solid investment backgrounds, and 
they've both begun investment programs of their own. For the last several 
years, Bernard has fielded any questions that members of the Valley's 30 or so 
NAIC investment clubs may have. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lipschitz of Sherman Oaks started his first investment club seven years 
ago, when he was a 22-year-old accounting major at Cal State Northridge. He and 
friend Alan Schnaid remember the very day. It was Oct. 19, 1987, the Black 
Monday on which the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508 points. Lipschitz 
recalls that he and Schnaid, now 27, had the same thought: "Hey, this is a 
great time to get into the market!" When they began, the young men recall, they 
didn't even know how to read the stock tables in the newspaper. But within a 
year, Crusader Enterprises, as they called their club, had 36 members, each 
investing $30 a month; a mentor in the person of a helpful stockbroker who kept 
steering them away from risky ventures; even a monthly newsletter. The club 
eventually accumulated a portfolio worth $70,000 and branched out into 
non-stock investments, including half interest in a rental property in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The CSUN club was a great success in many ways, but its organizers were not 
happy. Too many members wanted to contribute their money but not their time or 
effort. So after five years the original club was disbanded, its assets 
distributed and Lipschitz and Schnaid started over with five other young men 
who were as committed as they were.  
</P>
<P>
 "We found in our first group that three people were doing the work of 36, and 
we wanted to avoid that with the second group," Lipschitz explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized last year, the new Crusader Enterprises includes only members who 
have some professional expertise to offer the group and are willing to do their 
homework -- each of them researches a new stock for consideration at their 
monthly meeting. Club member Gary Lieberman is an attorney and wrote the club's 
shareholders agreement (the group formed a corporation). A computer consultant, 
Guy Nadivi worked with Lipschitz and Schnaid, who are both certified public 
accountants, to develop software tailored to the specific needs of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've built an infrastructure so if we have substantial growth, we're 
prepared for it," says Lipschitz. All the members are on-line and can access 
and analyze stock data electronically. They also have their own seven-member 
users' group so they can flash club-related messages to each other, which they 
often do daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven men invest $110 each per month and meet, as most local groups do, at 
members' homes. In just 18 months they have accumulated close to $25,000 in 
stocks (their biggest stake is in the electronics firm Novell) and a no-load 
mutual fund, Fidelity Asset Manager Growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, who would like to add three more equally skilled and dedicated men or 
women to their club, take their investing very seriously. "This is my 401(k) 
plan," says Schnaid, who expects his club holdings to grow over time into a 
significant part of his retirement fund. Although the club is a member of NAIC, 
the seven often ignore the umbrella group's advice to invest for the long term 
in non-volatile stocks that are growing faster than the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a much more aggressive approach," says Lipschitz. Crusader 
Enterprises likes speculative technology stocks, such as Micrographics. The 
group is also on the lookout for good real-estate buys to program into its 
highly efficient investment machine. Los Angeles real estate is currently 
selling low, notes Nadivi, "and land ownership is a historically successful way 
to build wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 Lipschitz says he expects the new, improved club to continue indefinitely. 
"It's probably something we'll always do," he says. The men like the networking 
aspect of the group, and they even have fun. "We have barbecues on weekends," 
Lipschitz says. "We've developed friendships." 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, members of investment clubs report that what they have learned 
through the group has encouraged them to build their own portfolios. According 
to the NAIC, the average club has stock holdings worth $83,000, while members' 
individual portfolios average three times their club holdings. Rita Veen is one 
of many who invests both through her club and on her own. Veen, who lives in 
Sherman Oaks, is an enrolled agent, a tax specialist licensed by the U.S. 
Treasury Department. She is also the founder of the Enrolled Agents Investment 
Club, which meets on the second Sunday of every month at Encino Glen. 
</P>
<P>
 Veen is a savvy small investor who does not hesitate to preach the gospel of 
economic self-sufficiency to people, especially divorced and single women, she 
meets in the course of doing their tax returns. When she encounters a woman 
trying to live on a mingy divorce settlement and a low-paying job, she says, "I 
try to get her to carry her lunch and to buy a $25 savings bond every week." 
Veen believes systematic investing and other good financial habits are all that 
stand between people, whatever their incomes, and the fiscal abyss. "We have to 
make people understand it's what you do with what you get, not how much you 
make." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Veen's favorite vehicles for individual investing is the dividend 
reinvestment plan, or DRIP. Many companies have these no-fee or low-cost plans 
that allow members of the public to reinvest stock dividends and even buy 
additional stock directly from the company at a discount. Veen's strategy is to 
invest excess cash in the stock of companies that offer products or services 
she likes and that also have DRIP programs. She has a personal portfolio of 
some 17 stocks, often chosen by tracking the consumer preferences of Clifton, 
her husband of 43 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Explains Veen: "My husband drinks Budweiser so I bought Anheuser-Busch. My 
husband likes to go to Bowlerland so I bought Brunswick." 
</P>
<P>
 Most DRIPs require investors to hold at least one share of stock in their own 
name before they can enroll. NAIC facilitates this by allowing members to buy a 
single share in many companies for $5 over the cost of the share, much less 
than the cost through even a discount broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1991, Veen's investment club is an efficiently run operation that 
coordinates its meetings with the continuing education courses every enrolled 
agent must take. Members invest each month in multiples of $25, although, Veen 
points out, "You only get one vote no matter how much of the club you own." 
</P>
<P>
 Should a member want to drop out of the club, the group writes him or her a 
check for the value of his or her shares. Alternatively, another member may 
want to buy out the exiting member's stake. If the member's exodus forces the 
group to sell stock, the departing member must pay the brokerage fee. The tax 
implications of investing through a club are a snap for Veen's group. The club 
files a partnership return, and each individual receives a K-1 form to file 
with his or her own tax return, reporting any income, capital gains or losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the club has almost half its $40,000 in holdings in cash (at the 
end of 1993, Veen reports, the group unloaded a couple of dogs and one stock 
that had had a nice run-up but didn't look as if it would continue to 
appreciate). Now she would like to see the group buy shares of the local drug 
company Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks. She thinks it is a well-run company, and 
she also likes the fact that it hires and promotes minorities. "The way they 
handle their employees tells you a lot about a company," she says. "I think if 
we get in now while the price is low, it's a good buy." 
</P>
<P>
 She knows, however, that each member of her club will vote his or her own 
mind. "These are all self-employed entrepreneurs and they are used to making 
decisions, so it's a little different from other clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's hardly the most important decision they make, choosing a name is 
often a club's first real challenge. Some groups opt for names worthy of a 
stand-up comic. Judy Powell, who founded an all-female club that meets in 
Agoura and Westlake Village, reports that her group calls itself "Moneywi , 
with a dollar sign for the s. Isn't that clever?" Nationally, there is at least 
one Bag Lady Prevention Society, and local groups sport such puckish titles as 
the Take Stock Group and Virgin Investors. 
</P>
<P>
 When new investment clubs start up, they often turn for advice to Don Shorkey, 
who is president of NAIC's Los Angeles Council, which oversees 350 groups from 
Santa Barbara to Orange County. Shorkey, who lives in Hacienda Heights, is a 
forklift operator for Nestle Corp. in Mira Loma and a man who taught himself 
how to invest with help from the national organization. "Each club has a 
uniqueness about it," says Shorkey, whose current group of nine men and women 
is called the Wanna-Be Investment Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Shorkey's club invest a minimum of $20 a month (one contributed 
$200 at the last meeting). Made a realist by experience, Shorkey urges clubs to 
screen prospective members for compatible people. His own group asks people who 
want to join to attend three meetings, then to make a presentation on a stock. 
Present members must vote unanimously to accept a newcomer. "You want to have 
compatibility in your group or you're not going to make any headway," he 
counsels. "You'll just sit there and argue."  
</P>
<P>
 Shorkey thinks part of the reason tensions sometimes roil groups is because 
the subject is a sensitive one -- money. "You start getting involved with money 
and, boy, you can have a lot of hard feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 As to what to do with a disruptive club member, Shorkey doesn't hesitate a 
nanosecond. "If you're not comfortable with someone in the club," he advises, 
"throw them out." Starting Up a Club 
</P>
<P>
 * If you want to join a club, you will probably have to start one yourself. 
That's not difficult, according to the National Assn. of Investors Corp. Talk 
to two or three of your friends and suggest that they contact several of their 
friends who may be interested. You might also find prospective members at your 
church or temple, at work, even among your neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 The NAIC advises looking for three things in prospective club members: people 
whose company you enjoy, people who can agree on an investing philosophy and 
people who are willing to study and report on stocks the group may want to 
invest in. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hold a first meeting to discuss creation of the club, at your home if you 
wish. Make it clear to prospective members that this is a preliminary meeting, 
not a commitment to join. If you plan to go the NAIC route, make sure that you 
and two or three others have read the Investors Manual and are prepared to 
answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * After the group has discussed investment philosophy and other fundamental 
issues, ask for a show of hands by those who want to proceed with creating a 
club. Decide how the club will be organized (most form as partnerships). Other 
matters that can be taken up at the first meeting: election of officers, 
setting a regular meeting time and place, deciding how much individuals will 
invest each month, choosing a name and deciding whether to join NAIC, (810) 
583-6242. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Council of NAIC will hold an all-day investors fair Oct. 1 at 
the Proud Bird restaurant, 11022 Aviation Blvd., near Los Angeles International 
Airport. The cost for non-members is $30. For further information, call (310) 
326-8150.

PARENTING; KIDS EAT UP LUNCH BOX IMAGERY; TREND-CONSCIOUS OFFERINGS ARE A FAR 
CRY IN MATERIAL AND STYLE FROM OLD METAL FOOD HAMPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Cindy LaFavre Yorks writes 
regularly for The Times.

<P>
 A lunch box can say as much about a child's taste and sensibilities as the 
goodies housed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever model a child selects to carry his or her lunch, it really becomes a 
part of that child. They don't want anyone else's; they like their own," says 
Marlyn Di Tommaso, a Reseda resident who teaches preschoolers at Encino 
Presbyterian Children's Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, manufacturers of lunch kits are busy rolling out new models for 
the coming academic year. Many of these reflect the popularity of summer 
movies, hit TV shows and timeless, classic action figures. All are marketed to 
a young audience with such a vengeance that many kids have known since 
mid-summer which kit they're taking to school. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood resident Rosie Spinks, 4 1/2, is one of these. According to 
her mother, Johanna Spinks, "She's been talking all summer about wanting a 
Flintstones lunch box, but she'll probably want a Lion King one as well." 
</P>
<P>
 It goes without saying that such trend-conscious offerings are a far cry in 
both material and style from the metal food hampers so popular in the first 
half of the 20th Century. Today's boxes are mostly made of hard or soft 
insulated plastic. Most come with a beverage container, and many are stuffed 
not only with tissue paper but with samples of juice boxes, Nestle's Quick and 
assorted money-saving coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 With most kits priced from $6.99 to $9.99, some parents complain that their 
shelf life is shorter than the cost warrants. Di Tommaso has seen some kits 
last a mere week and others as long as a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But even more critical to a child than durability is the power of a lunch 
kit's popular imagery. Di Tommaso predicts that Disney's Lion King model will 
top the list of those purchased for the new school year, an impression 
reinforced by the inventory at stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally popular this season, say educators and marketers, will be kits that 
feature Power Rangers, the super-hero stars of the Fox television series. But 
these models may not be welcome at some Valley-area schools. Controversy over 
the characters and their use of martial-arts-inspired skills have caused some 
Power Ranger toys to be banned in classrooms at Bay Laurel School in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting complaints from parents about increased aggression," says 
Principal Martha Mutz, who adds that, while she has not banned Rangers lunch 
boxes themselves, she gives teachers permission to authorize individual 
classroom bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Because such concerns about battling super-heroes are common, parents may want 
to check with the administration of their child's school before buying such a 
kit. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of lunch box a youngster chooses has a lot to do with his or her age 
and peer group, says Di Tommaso. Generally, she adds, by the time kids are 7 or 
8, they go in for what she calls a "cooler kind of thing" -- a nylon carrier 
that either zips or seals with Velcro. Her daughter, Joanna, now 8, never 
wanted a character lunch box after the second grade. Likewise, Johanna Spinks' 
7 1/2-year-old daughter, Jessica, prefers grocery bags, paper bags and 
cooler-style bags to formal lunch carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old B.G. Ballard of Encino, who attends The Buckley School, is 
equally adamant on the subject. His lunch kit "wardrobe" consists of nylon 
backpacks outfitted with matching lunch bags, all purchased at Staples The 
Office Superstore last year.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like things that are really plain, and I am into recycling, so I like these 
better than paper bags," young Ballard explains.  
</P>
<P>
 Even kids who choose character lunch boxes may go the recycling route 
eventually. Di Tommaso predicts that some of last year's big hits -- Barney, 
Batman, Aladdin and Barbie -- will probably end up as hand-me-downs presented 
to younger brothers and sisters.  
</P>
<P>
 In her view, "We're getting smarter in this society, and that includes the 
kids."

PARENTING; THE SANDBOX SOCIAL SET; ARRANGING PLAY DATES FOR PLAYMATES REQUIRES 
CAREFUL PLANNING AND ASSURANCE ON THE PART OF PARENTS. EXPERTS SAY THE VISITS 
ARE BENEFICIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet McGuigan of West Hills vividly remembers the first time she arranged a 
play date for her 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Becky, at another child's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only gone for an hour or less, and I hurried back envisioning all kinds 
of things," McGuigan said. "Of course, everything was just fine. But it takes 
time. You and your child have to ease into it." 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound simple to set up a youngster's early social engagements, but the 
process is fraught with anxiety for many parents. Taking a child to play at a 
friend's home not only involves questions of safety and trust, it's also a 
stage of the separation process. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts say that once children are ready for it, the experience can be 
very beneficial. "There is something unique to one-on-one play time where 
friendship can really take place," said Dr. Charles Weinstein, a child 
psychologist who has offices in Burbank and Encino. "Having free play in the 
home, whether it's in the child's room, the living room or wherever, that's a 
whole different kind of process" than in a school or day-care setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts agree that there is no need for play dates until children are at 
least 2. After that, such personal contacts can help in the development of 
communication and socialization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Play dates teach about sharing and can also help with verbal skills," said 
Dr. Marsha Gerro, a Burbank pediatrician. "Sometimes, it's easier to potty 
train or give up the bottle because they see other kids who are past those 
stages." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How can parents tell when the time is right for their child to be left at 
another person's home to play? And how do they choose the right playmates for 
play dates? 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein suggests that since children mature at varying rates there is no set 
timetable for initiating them into social life. If a tot is especially verbal, 
he says, and can report on a social experience after the fact, he or she is 
probably ready for the independence of a play date. If not, parents might want 
to come along on several occasions until the child feels comfortable enough to 
stay without them. 
</P>
<P>
 For parents of preschool- and elementary-age children, identifying suitable 
playmates can be as simple as noticing whom they play with at school. Grown-ups 
can also ask children whom they like, and talk to teachers and other parents to 
gauge compatibility between youngsters. Little Johnny's mother might have a 
terrific personality, for example, but her son might be overly aggressive for 
another child's taste. 
</P>
<P>
 As an additional source of contacts, parents of younger children can develop a 
play-date pool by becoming involved in a Mommy and Me class, Gymboree or other 
types of groups. Prenatal education classes also offer soon-to-be parents an 
opportunity to get to know prospective families. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Laurel Murray of Valley Village, for example, met a group of women in a 
prenatal exercise class at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank four years 
ago. The women and their babies got together four months after their deliveries 
and have been meeting twice a month ever since. The group calls itself Moms 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said a group-play situation offers parents the opportunity to 
informally screen prospective play dates for their children. "It can ease 
anxiety that you might have because you're around these children -- and their 
parents -- for a while before you make the commitment to a play date," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her view, screening parents -- and indeed the household a child will be 
entering -- is part of the whole play-date process. Can these people be relied 
on? Who else might be around while youngsters play? Could teen-agers or a 
baby-sitter potentially be left in charge? 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents today need to be real assertive and find those things out," Weinstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That advice may be particularly helpful to parents who work outside the home 
and don't have the luxury of staying to observe their child's first few social 
outings. 
</P>
<P>
 For this same group of parents, a related worry concerns not being close by 
should problems arise during the play date. For them, Weinstein said, it's 
important to have a talk with their baby-sitter to develop a working definition 
of what feels safe. 
</P>
<P>
 If a sitter is uncomfortable with a situation, he added, she "should have 
instructions that it's OK to say no or to depart." 
</P>
<P>
 Stay-at-home parents, on the other hand, might find the prospect of a 
baby-sitter bringing another person's child to their home unappealing. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, it might help to schedule play dates with parents who have 
similar child-care arrangements. Or wait until the visiting child is old enough 
to be dropped off without a baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, experts say, children are the best barometer for measuring the 
success of play dates. If they come home happy and enjoy sharing the experience 
they had, things are probably going fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds simple, but you just really need to listen to your children," 
Weinstein said. "The bottom line is, did the kids have fun? If they did, you'll 
know you're on the right track."

PARENTING; FILLING A NEED; FAMILIES SEEKING A SPECIALIST TO DEAL WITH THEIR 
CHILDREN'S TEETH AND FEARS TURN TO A PEDIATRIC DENTIST.

<P>
 When Candee Messmore took her son Spenser to the dentist when he was 2, the 
examination nev er moved beyond Spenser's clenched mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dentist's attitude was that my son needed to be big and sit in the chair 
alone, without me there," said Messmore, who lives in Granada Hills. "The whole 
experience started so negatively that he remembered it and referred to it for a 
whole year." 
</P>
<P>
 Messmore's story, say experts, is not uncommon, and its impact can be 
far-reaching. Childhood fears can turn into a lifelong dread of dentistry, 
which, in turn, may keep even adults from seeking the care and treatment they 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 To head off this kind of trauma for her son, Messmore made an appointment with 
a specialist trained to handle children: a pediatric dentist. During his first 
visit, she said, "Spenser forgot all his fears. When we walked in, there was a 
treasure chest full of toys. The dentist let Spenser push buttons, move the 
chair up and down, squirt the water and touch all of his tools. He even 
demonstrated the tools on Spenser's arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Such playfulness and sensitivity are no accident, according to Dr. Stephen 
Howard, a Tarzana dentist also known as "Dr. Supertooth." 
</P>
<P>
 "During the first year of pediatric dental training," he explained, "we 
receive classes that revolve around the emotional and psychological growth of 
the child. Kids go through so many changes, and a good dentist has to be aware 
of what level they're on. You don't want to talk down to them or use language 
they don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 To find a pediatric dentist who is both qualified and simpatico, Howard 
suggests getting a referral from a satisfied parent. "Then just show up at the 
office and ask to look around," he advised. "If the staff is receptive to the 
visit, that's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Many preschools offer group visits to dental offices, where kids get hands-on 
experiences with dental tools, said Howard, who has hosted such visits himself 
during his 20 years in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To calm youngsters before their first appointment, Pat Azarnoff, executive 
director of Tarzana-based Pediatric Projects, advises parents to express 
confidence in the dentist but not to offer unnecessary details. "Just prepare 
them for what they will see and feel," said Azarnoff, whose organization 
distributes toys and books to help children understand health care. "Say, 'We 
need to keep your teeth clean and healthy and the way we do that is that a 
dentist checks your teeth. You will need to sit in a chair, open your mouth 
wide, like this, so the dentist can see inside. And I'll be right beside you.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Howard added that parents can take cues from dentists about how to simplify 
complicated dental language for young children. "We talk about putting a 
Band-Aid on a tooth, not drilling a filling," he said. "And we don't give 
shots, we put a tooth to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Howard rejects the term "waiting room" in favor of "family room." 
In his office, this is a place packed with toys and computer games for children 
of every age. Pictures of patients are on a bulletin board, some taken with a 
giant bear Howard keeps on hand.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mostafa Rad, who has practiced pediatric dentistry in Woodland Hills for 
six years, allays children's fears by giving them choices. "I ask them what 
flavor of fluoride they want -- strawberry, banana, bubble gum or mint," he 
explained. "It gives them a sense of control and boosts their confidence level. 
I become like a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Another welcoming device involves the layout of a dentist's office. Instead of 
closed examination rooms, Howard's floor plan features a large open bay that 
harbors five dental chairs. "One child can see that the other kids are OK while 
they're being examined, and it creates peer support," Howard said. "It 
eliminates that closed-door feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Should an examination take place in a separate room, most pediatric dentists 
allow parents to accompany their children. "A child sees the exam as this new 
experience and they need mom or dad near to help translate it," said Azarnoff. 
"There is no substitute for a trusted parent at a young age." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When a child turns 5, say experts, parents can usually begin cutting down the 
time they spend in the examination room. 
</P>
<P>
 Moms and dads who take their children to a pediatric dentist might be shocked 
to learn that it can cost more than their own dental care -- an average of $60 
for a visit. But, like Messmore, many parents who have tried the alternatives 
have no complaints, especially when they encounter someone like Howard.  
</P>
<P>
 "For the better part of 17 years, I came to work each day dressed as Dr. 
Supertooth, wearing white tights, blue trunks and a red cape with a tooth logo 
on my chest," Howard recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of his patients have outgrown the gimmick, and he has put it aside, 
he is still known to some by his larger-than-life moniker. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business," he said fondly, "is all about how to make dental visits light 
and easy. We do it for the kids." Putting Teeth First 
</P>
<P>
 Introducing children to the dentist early can lay the foundation for a 
lifelong habit of good dental hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pat Azarnoff, executive director of Tarzana-based Pediatric 
Projects, "There are many children today under the age of 10 who have never had 
a cavity because they've been getting checkups and fluoride from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American Dental Assn. recommends taking children in by age 1," she said, 
"then once or twice a year after that for checkups to see if the teeth and jaw 
are growing properly." 
</P>
<P>
 An early visit benefits grown-ups as much as it does their children, said Dr. 
Mostafa Rad, a dentist who practices in Woodland Hills. "It teaches parents to 
care for their baby's teeth and gums." 
</P>
<P>
 During the consultation, dentists can also evaluate -- and inform parents 
about -- any adverse habits, such as thumb-sucking, and they can determine a 
child's fluoride needs. X-rays may be taken to determine if the teeth and 
facial bones are developing properly and to spot any hidden decay. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as a child's first teeth begin to appear, usually by the 13th month, 
Rad suggests draping a gauze pad or washcloth over a finger to wipe the teeth 
gently. After the child is used to the procedure, parents can use a 
soft-bristled toothbrush with a small dab of toothpaste. They should also floss 
when the child's teeth become close enough to trap food particles, as well as 
brush after breakfast and before bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids can begin helping out with brushing at age 4 or 5, a practice Rad 
encourages to build confidence. Depending on their manual dexterity, many 
children will be cleaning their teeth on their own before they're 8.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts advise parents to set a good example by brushing and flossing their 
own teeth twice each day, and by visiting their dentists regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 For children with particular fears or questions about dentistry, the following 
books, geared for youngsters ages 2 to 6, may prove helpful to parents: 
</P>
<P>
 * "My Dentist," by Harlow Rockewell, Morrow Books, $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Going to the Dentist," by Anne Civardi and Stephen Cartwright, EDC/Usborne 
Books, $3.95. 
</P>

House, $2.50.

PARENTING; TAILORING A CHILD'S EDUCATION; WHETHER GIFTED OR LEARNING-DISABLED, 
STUDENTS NEED A CURRICULUM THAT FITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

The Times.

<P>
 A small group of students have donned the hats of editors, photographers and 
reporters at Ranchito Avenue Elementary School in Panorama City. They meet 
after school to interview and photograph "sources" for their school newspaper, 
report on school events and even sell advertising. The students, who have been 
identified as gifted, are often bored by regular classroom work, but their 
campus newsroom challenges them to master advanced writing, business and 
computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning-disabled students at Ranchito also find that the regular classroom 
environment does not meet their needs. These students, who struggle with basic 
reading and arithmetic, spend an hour or more a week working one on one with a 
teacher who designs assignments specially for them.  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to education, one size never fits all. Some students do fine in 
regular classrooms; some seek extra challenges; others need additional help. To 
meet the needs of students, schools throughout the Valley offer classes at 
levels from learning-disabled to highly gifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything else," said Sheila Smith, who coordinates gifted programs 
for the Los Angeles Unified School District, "we feel that every school should 
be about the business of nurturing the gifts of all children." 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in helping children with special needs is to determine who they 
are. That may require detective work on the part of teachers and parents, 
according to Marty Baer, Ranchito's resource specialist teacher in charge of 
special education. "It is not always obvious who qualifies for the programs 
until we do some investigating," he said. "The idea is to keep our antennae 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Once identified as candidates for special education or gifted services, 
students are evaluated by a school psychologist, who determines their 
eligibility according to criteria defined by state education laws. In general, 
special-education students must have a measurable learning disability that 
severely impairs academic achievement, and gifted children must be two years or 
more above grade level. Because referrals are based on at least two years of 
school records and test scores, youngsters are usually not placed until the 
beginning of third grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators warn that the child who earns Cs and Ds does not always qualify for 
special education, and the child who unfailingly brings home A's is not 
necessarily gifted. "Parents have such an appetite for their children to be 
identified as gifted," Smith said, "but a parent's notion about who their child 
is may be quite apart from that child's actual interest and ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Most learning-disabled children who qualify for special education services are 
placed in a Resource Specialist Program. These programs, offered by every 
school in the district, include small group settings and individualized 
instruction. Speech and language therapy, adaptive physical education and 
counseling may also be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resource specialist program offers specialized methods, materials and 
room organization to help children overcome their perceptual dysfunctions," 
Baer said. "In a calm environment, without the distraction of a lot of kids, 
they can work on what is uniquely appropriate for them, such as intensive 
phonics, which may be different from what is going on in their regular 
classroom. As they improve, they can start buying into regular classroom 
activities -- and that is a heady experience for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on their needs, students may work with the resource specialist 
teacher for as little as an hour a week. The rest of their day is spent in 
their regular classroom. "It is really important that special education 
students be part of normal classroom activities," said Lucky Hemphill, 
principal of O'Melveny Elementary School in San Fernando. "They need the chance 
to see the thinking processes that average and advanced students use to solve 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Gifted children also spend the majority of their time in standard classrooms, 
but state law requires that they be assigned at least 200 minutes a week of 
supplemental activities (known in academic-speak as differentiated 
instruction). These may include science experiments, advanced algebra or 
hands-on computer practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools have also launched voluntary after-school programs for gifted 
students. Such programs take on a number of guises, depending on the 
preferences of the teacher and students. Ranchito students, for example, put 
out their student newspaper in the campus newsroom; O'Melveny gifted students 
build rockets and study the nutritional value of mealworms.  
</P>
<P>
 Parent Nanci Caillouet, whose children, Bret, 11, and Marie, 9, are in the 
gifted program at Ranchito, believes the after-school class provides a relaxed 
yet demanding learning environment. "It gets kids looking into things and gives 
them a chance to use skills they don't exercise in a classroom," she said. 
"School wasn't anything Marie looked forward to -- but she really looks forward 
to the program after school because it is challenging and creative and fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnet schools are another option for high-ability and gifted elementary 
students. Those in the Valley include Balboa Boulevard in Northridge, 
Canterbury Avenue in Pacoima, Kester Avenue in Van Nuys, Vena Avenue in Arleta, 
Welby Way in West Hills and San Jose Street in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But space in magnet schools is limited, and some educators point out that 
gifted students benefit from an environment that includes a wide range of 
talents and abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemphill said the gifted, like all children, need to learn social skills, 
which are best acquired in a heterogeneous group. "Many gifted children are not 
tolerant of others," she said. "They feel their opinion is the only opinion; 
their way is the right way. In a regular classroom, you have kids who get what 
the teacher is saying the first time, kids who get it the second or third time, 
and kids who don't get it until the sixth or seventh time, so the gifted child 
learns to work with all different kinds of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Caillouet agrees. "I don't want my kids to be set aside or thought of as 
oddities," she said. "I want them to be part of the mainstream. Kids need to 
see all sides of the coin. Kids need to feel like regular kids." Between the 
Cracks 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-grade boy can't read. 
</P>
<P>
 His reading problem could be traced to the fact that he has attended 16 
schools in his young life. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it's because he is absent from school more often than he is present. 
And it probably doesn't help that both his parents dropped out of school -- and 
neither ever learned to read. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy is not learning disabled. He can't read because he simply never 
had a chance to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a learning disability, he cannot get help from special education 
classes; yet his needs clearly cannot be adequately addressed in a typical 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 His case may be extreme, but many children struggle and sweat their way 
through school -- but do not qualify for special education.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just because a child is getting Cs does not mean the child belongs in special 
education classes," said Janice Milgrim, who coordinates special education 
services in the San Fernando Valley. "Everyone thinks their child should get 
A's, but everyone does not get A's. Special education is not for kids who are 
doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Milgrim, it is up to schools, teachers and parents to devise ways 
within the regular classroom setting to assist such children who fall through 
the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Such measures may include after-school tutoring programs, remedial math or 
reading classes, or teachers of different grade levels exchanging students when 
certain subjects are taught.  
</P>
<P>
 At Ranchito Avenue Elementary School in Panorama City, a struggling child's 
past and current teachers, parents, school psychologist and resource specialist 
teacher meet to determine how they can help him or her. Together the group -- 
which calls itself a student study team -- charts the child's strengths, 
weaknesses, steps that have been taken to aid the situation and actions that 
have not yet been tried. They may recommend, for example, that teachers change 
the way they give directions, rearrange seats in a classroom or allow for more 
time to complete assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the non-reading fifth-grader, the student study team suggested 
that the boy spend an hour or so a day in a lower grade to work on beginning 
reading skills. The parents promised to ensure that his older siblings would 
sit down with him every afternoon and help him with reading assignments. The 
boy's teachers call the parents every week to update them on his progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do the best we can, but much more is needed," said Marty Baer, Ranchito's 
resource specialist teacher. "Kids who can't work at the pace of the class 
still get the short shrift. They can feel out of the loop -- and they are 
learning how to tune out." 
</P>
<P>
 Parental involvement is especially critical in such cases, according to Baer. 
He suggests that parents meet with teachers for suggestions about materials and 
techniques that can be used at home. For those who have the financial means, 
private tutoring may be recommended.  
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to be encouraged to come to school. They need to realize this is 
a friendly place," Baer said. "Then the kid knows there is a home-school 
relationship. It is important for children to know that parents and teachers 
speak the same language and work together."

<P>
 The big news on the Valley fashion front is that grunge -- a sloppy look few 
parents ever went for -- is fading into the summer sunset, making pol ished 
looks more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 For fall, girls' fashions are decidedly more ingenue. Feminine preppy-girl 
chic is edging out flower-child whimsy. For young men, outrageously oversized 
styles are being overtaken by a sophisticated, pulled-together look moms and 
dads are sure to prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grunge is over," agrees Jacqueline Kidd, owner of The Baby Cottage in 
Woodland Hills. Kidd says the biggest trend for fall is the influx of plaid, 
for both boys and girls. For boys, she is seeing a tremendous number of woodsy 
plaid T-shirts a la "Northern Exposure." The guys will pair these with 
loose-fitting, pleated corduroys. 
</P>
<P>
 At a la popcorn in Woodland Hills, boutique owner Alissa Cohen sees the 
combination of plaid schoolgirl skirt and fitted, "baby," T-shirt as a virtual 
uniform for fall. The shoe of choice to complete the look: French army boots in 
dark suedes. This trendy footwear is even available in infant sizes at Cohen's 
next-door shop, which is called L.A. Babes.  
</P>
<P>
 Though brand names are less important in the '90s than they were in the '80s, 
Kidd's store does carry a few some parents and kids like: Baby Guess?, Guess? 
Kids, Petiza and Wollypogs.

 Cohen, who agrees that label consciousness is waning, says many of her sources 
-- such as C.W. Designs -- hail from the San Fernando Valley. Value-priced 
items, not names, are what drive the sales in her boutique, Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can expect to pay about $70 for a basic two-piece outfit at The Baby 
Cottage, while prices at a la popcorn can run from $50 for a preteen outfit to 
between $40 and $75 for a two-piece outfit for younger girls and boys. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the plaid fad, jumpers are the most happening trend in girls' 
wear, says Kidd. Most of the ones displayed in Valley boutiques like Kidd's are 
made of cotton flannel, as opposed to warmer wool styles being shown in the 
national fashion magazines. Some feature same-fabric suspenders, while others 
are equipped with detachable leather or vinyl straps. Often the jumpers are 
paired with crisp white blouses, tiny T-shirts, thigh-high or knee-high socks 
and sensible shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen says that, at her store, colored denim jeans will continue to be a hot 
item for both boys and girls. Earthy, subdued tones such as cream and wheat, 
she adds, are especially popular in early fall when persistent, summerlike 
temperatures make dark, heat-absorbing colors less practical. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Shauna Shelton of North Hollywood is readying her list of 
back-to-school must-haves, says her mother, Laura Leimseider. 
</P>
<P>
 Shauna, who selects all her own apparel while shopping with her mother, will 
be looking for overall jumpers, oversized shorts and long T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Leimseider reports that she and her daughter typically shop department stores 
such as the Broadway, Robinsons-May and Mervyn's for Shauna's clothes. Shauna, 
Leimseider says, places a great deal of importance on style but is still 
developing her own personal look. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's picky," says Mom. "She won't wear anything I pick out. She sometimes 
doesn't wear what she picks out." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Leimseider has determined: If it's boyish, Shauna usually likes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all kids bow to the trends when it comes to shopping for back-to-school 
items. For example, 14-year-old Josh Fradis, who will attend Chatsworth High 
this year, says temperature is the driving factor for his back-to-school 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh -- who prefers to shop with his mother because, as he puts it, "she pays 
when she comes along, otherwise I pay" -- plans to get new shorts with his 
favorite Anchor Blue label. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he doesn't go in for what he calls the really "huge" look, he does have 
a strategy when it comes to fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to buy everything two sizes bigger," he says, "because it's all more 
comfortable that way." Josh also hopes to round out his wardrobe with some 
shirts from Billabong, a line of surfing sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the more tailored, preppy look, Josh says that while some of his 
friends are wearing the classic styles, they aren't for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of children who do favor them, however, says Kidd, are sure to applaud 
the end of long-heated arguments about too-tight or too-loose clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will probably be more agreement among parents and kids," she predicts. 
"The trendy clothes will be the ones parents want to see their children 
wearing, and that's a welcome change."

PARENTING; LESSONS ON A LARGER SCALE; THE GURU-STUDENT METHOD MAY NOT BE THE 
ONLY WAY TO LEARN MUSIC. VALLEY GROUP PROGRAMS FIND SUCCESS. 
</P>

<P>
 It is a commonly held notion in our society that learning to play a musical 
instrument during childhood will enrich a person's life forever. Consequently, 
many parents feel obligated to see that their children take music lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some grown-ups maintain that the best way to interest kids in music is through 
one-on-one lessons. But there is a whole school of thought -- backed up by 
several San Fernando Valley-based programs -- that argues otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Shamrock, professor of music at Cal State Northridge, believes that 
though "the guru-student relationship is time-honored, one on one per se is not 
the only viable way to learn music. It can be more efficiently and joyfully 
done in a group." 
</P>
<P>
 Shamrock, who specializes in music education, said it is in a group atmosphere 
that young children, including babies just 18 months old, can really develop 
musical responses. These include pitch, rhythm and tempo, which youngsters 
learn through singing, dancing, rhyming, chanting and clapping. Sometimes they 
can pick up quite a bit of musical knowledge without even touching an 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she said, they "can move from that kind of context to an instrumental 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 When children do play music together, "there's a whole lot of interaction that 
happens in a group," said Larry Newman, executive director of Children's Music 
Workshop, a private service that teaches children to play instruments in groups 
at public and private schools. "They're out there doing it in front of their 
peers. They come to the support of each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Such endorsements -- coupled with the savings involved in bypassing private 
instruction -- make group lessons appealing to many. A brief survey of Valley 
programs shows the range of options parents and children have.  
</P>
<P>
 The First United Methodist Church in Burbank offers after-school music 
programs that are open to the public. The church presents a variety of group 
activities, including a music education program called Orff-Schulwerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by German educator and composer Carl Orff (1895-1982), this creative 
approach to teaching and learning music is based on things children like to do: 
sing, dance, keep a beat. It incorporates poems, rhymes, games, songs and 
dances into music made by children on xylophones, glockenspiels and various 
percussion instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Rucker, who teaches the Orff process at the church to kids ages 4 to 12, 
also teaches two Kindermusik classes, one for children 18 months through 3 
years, the other for 3 1/2- through 4-year-olds. Grown-ups accompanying 
students in the younger group must partake in the program's singing, moving, 
playing and listening to sounds and rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of Kindermusik classes ranges from $70-$78 for 15 weeks. The Orff 
class is $35 for 15 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindermusik classes as well as Yamaha music education courses are taught at 
the Crescenta Valley Yamaha Music Studio in La Crescenta. Yamaha, the Japanese 
company that produces motorcycles, grand pianos and other musical equipment, 
began its group music education system in Japan in 1954. Its goal, using Yamaha 
keyboards, is to foster a love of music through ensemble playing, composition, 
improvisation and performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An adult must accompany each child to the Kindermusik classes as well as 
Yamaha's basic musicianship classes for children ages 4 to 6. It is also 
recommended that parents attend keyboard fundamentals classes for kids ages 7 
to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees range from $7 for a half-hour Kindermusik class to $14.50 for a one-hour 
Yamaha class for kids age 4 and up. 
</P>
<P>
 Piano Play in Sherman Oaks also offers the Yamaha music education program. 
Parents must accompany children up to age 6. Fees range from $11 for a 
45-minute class to $15 for a one-hour class. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Cultural Center -- the group responsible for the free Concerts in the 
Park series at Warner Park during the summer -- also has a no-cost Music in the 
Schools program. To supplement the limited music instruction in the public 
schools, it has sponsored orchestras and musical instruction at Valley 
elementary schools during the past five years, and plans to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more extensive are Children's Music Workshop programs to teach children 
at both private and public elementary and junior high schools how to play 
musical instruments. Director Larry Newman, public-school music teacher for 
over 12 years, visits school assemblies each fall and demonstrates sample 
instruments. He tailors his programs to each school's needs. Group sizes and 
fees vary. The workshop includes an easy-pay plan for buying an instrument.

PARENTING; FINDING OUTLETS FOR ANGER; SPECIALISTS SAY YOUTHFUL OUTBURSTS OF 
AGGRESSION ARE NORMAL. BUT DEALING WITH THEM EFFECTIVELY IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR 
AND MUST BE TAUGHT TO CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Barbara Bronson Gray writes 
regularly for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the challenges of parenting, dealing with a child's bursts of 
aggression can be especially daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments of pure, unadulterated anger may leave grown-ups wondering if their 
child is treading on dangerous psychological turf, or just exhibiting a normal 
expression of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Weinberg, a staff psychologist at the San Fernando Valley Child Guidance 
Clinic in Panorama City, says it is not at all uncommon for children, up to the 
age of 5 or 6, to exhibit some physical aggression, typically through hitting 
and angry outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 "All kids are going to go through periods when they're angry," she said. "It 
doesn't mean they are going to grow up to be criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Lambert, director of the Woodland Village School, an Agoura preschool 
that enrolls children from 6 weeks old through kindergarten-age, agrees that it 
is natural for children to engage in some kind of aggressive behavior, such as 
pushing another child in an effort to be first in line, or pinching or hitting 
someone in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But while anger is normal, experts say, dealing with it effectively is a 
learned behavior and must be taught to children as well as demonstrated by 
parents. Parents can be particularly effective in coaching children through an 
angry moment, and also in providing outlets for rage: athletics, outdoor time 
-- even a punching bag.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids these days spend a lot of time in school, in the car, without 
many outlets. Sports teams, outside time, free time -- these are important," 
said Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 When a child is hurting or threatening someone or damaging property, she 
advised, the first thing parents should do is to stop the particular act of 
aggression. After Mom or Dad has helped to subdue the child by using a calm, 
quiet tone of voice, and perhaps a timeout, the two can discuss what triggered 
the anger. The parent can then suggest reasonable outlets to use in the future 
-- such as hitting a pillow or seeking adult remediation -- and can help the 
child find words to express his or her feelings.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents can also assist children in learning to recognize signs that they're 
getting angry. Their own loud voice or clenched fists, for example, might 
suggest that it's time to pull away, use words to communicate their feelings, 
or get help from an adult, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Weinberg, some parents take a child's aggression personally; they 
see it as a sign of a lack of respect, or they think it's directed at them, or 
that it indicates that they have made some major parenting mistake, said 
Weinberg. For adults who grew up with parents who yelled at or hit them, the 
natural reaction to a child's aggression may be to yell or to spank, which 
serves only to recycle anger and upset everyone more, she advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert has found that it helps for parents to tell children that there is 
nothing bad about feeling angry, as long as they find ways to handle the 
emotion without hurting others. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking children to evaluate angry episodes and consider other ways they could 
have handled themselves also helps because it illuminates future options. Some 
youngsters need to be told that it is all right to ask for a grown-up's 
intervention. Others benefit from learning appropriate responses: "I won't play 
with you if you throw sand in my face again," or, "If you hit me, I'll get the 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg encourages parents to insist that a child make restitution if someone 
is hurt or something is broken. Appropriate action might include apologizing, 
or fixing or paying for broken property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While occasional outbursts of anger are no cause for alarm, recurrent 
aggression can be a sign of other problems, according to David Paster, an 
Encino-based child psychiatrist.  
</P>
<P>
 "Putting a child into a group (day-care) setting too early is an invitation to 
be aggressive," Paster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry outbursts might also signal depression, attention-deficit disorders, 
violence at home or loneliness. Paster suggests that parents seek counseling if 
a child destroys property, threatens others with weapons or is 
self-destructive.  
</P>
<P>
 One Newbury Park mother of two preschool boys suspects that her children's 
long days in child care contributed to her 5-year-old's aggression at 
preschool. "He would knock the desk over, chase a teacher with a pencil -- 
whatever it took to get the teachers to call me and have me take him home," 
said Laurie, who asked that her last name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Laurie analyzed her son's typical day, she realized that his behavior may 
have been caused by his rugged schedule. She would wake him up at 6:10 a.m. 
every weekday, feed him breakfast in the car and drop him off at his Agoura 
preschool by 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
 After work, she would pick him up and go to the gym, where he would again be 
in child care, and then return home for a quick dinner, bath and bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was aggressive to get attention -- and it worked," said Laurie. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that she has rearranged her schedule and made more time to be with him, 
she said, his aggression is less intense.

PARENTING; MOMENTS FULL OF INSPIRATION; THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP 
AND SHARE AWE AND WONDER OF THE UNIVERSE IN A FAMILY CONTEXT.

 Kenneth Klaristenfeld makes a habit of sitting with his 8-year-old son, Josh, 
as the day ends, silently watching the sunset, taking in all the color changes 
and the quiet of nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's powerful stuff," said Klaristenfeld, a rabbi and Encino-based 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Brown, a director at JAF Ministries in Agoura, likes to take his 
4-year-old granddaughter out in the back yard or on a slow-paced walk around 
the neighborhood, picking dandelions and blowing the seeds to scatter them, or 
watching a ladybug make a trail along a leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaristenfeld, Brown and other parents say they are deliberately trying to 
expose their children to what is awe-inspiring, offering them special moments 
to glimpse the beauty and complexity of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, such an effort is just a small part of a more structured religious 
life that includes formal instruction and regular worship. But for others, the 
quest to nurture a sense of wonder may have nothing to do with any particular 
religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the world we live in and the fact that life is so terrifying, it's 
crucial to have some sort of a balance to help us get through," said 
Klaristenfeld. "Perceiving the awe-inspiring helps us put ourselves in 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents may wonder how a simple sunset or a butterfly can mean much to a 
generation of children accustomed to video games and special effects. But 
"silence itself is awe-inspiring to children," Klaristenfeld believes. "You 
don't even need to say anything. Awe can only come when life stops for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Busy grown-ups might ask, Who has the time to sit quietly, doing nothing, 
looking up at the gnarled branches of a tree, or watching a red-tailed hawk 
glide in the breeze? 
</P>
<P>
 Brown agrees that exposing children to the universe takes some effort, and it 
doesn't happen automatically. "It boils down to taking the time and listening, 
and that's what allows you to connect to your child at that given moment," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing a sense of wonder is also possible through the simple activities of 
daily life, Brown believes. "Having a pet -- learning about unconditional love 
-- watching a cake rise in the oven, learning what happens when water boils, 
standing on top of the Empire State Building or talking with grandparents about 
their personal history: This can all inspire wonder about the universe," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaristenfeld sees many opportunities to share awe and wonder in a family 
context. He suggests that parents take children to the ocean to watch and 
listen to the waves, or to a forest, a desert, or a stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Klaristenfeld likes the time he spends watching sunsets or beachcombing 
with his parents. "It gives me a special feeling," he said. "It gives me time 
to think about things that went on that week, like if someone asked me a 
question and I didn't know the answer, I can think about it while the sun 
sets."

PARENTING; BUILDING ON A PIVOTAL RELATIONSHIP; ALTHOUGH THE MODERN FAMILY 
STRUCTURE HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS, THE NEED FOR GRANDPARENTS IS A CONSTANT.

 As a teen-ager, Joan Koss was convinced her parents could do nothing right. 
Now that she's a parent herself, Koss is absolutely certain they can do nothing 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought every single day," Koss says of her parents, Sandy and Alice Miller 
of Sherman Oaks. "Now, they're my best friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Maturity and marriage had a lot to do with the turnaround, Koss admits. But 
dealing with her parents as grandparents to her two children -- Daniela, 3, and 
Jason, almost 2 -- has been pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents have a little more patience with my children," says Koss, 35, who 
lives in Thousand Oaks with her husband, Ron. "My mom loves to read to them. My 
dad loves to play and joke around. It's unconditional love." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing changes a relationship between parents and children more than the 
arrival of a grandchild. Children suddenly become responsible adults caring for 
a new generation, while parents become respected elders who already have 
succeeded at the monumental task of raising children. 
</P>
<P>
 And nothing can be more satisfying to all three generations than a strong bond 
between grandparents and their grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship between grandparents and grandchildren is really wonderful 
to watch," says John Anderson, a Northridge psychologist. "It gives children a 
sense of heritage, not just of their immediate family, but it lets them know 
they are part of a lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 "With single-parent families and dual-career families, the relationship is 
increasingly important," Anderson adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond between grandparents and grandchildren is considered so critical that 
on Jan. 1, 1994, the state of California enacted a law that allows grandparents 
to petition for visitation rights with their grandchildren when the youngsters' 
parents divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that's difficult for children in a divorce is the loss of a 
sense of a permanent relationship with somebody," says Cynthia Davis, a Sherman 
Oaks psychologist. "What is helpful for children is knowing that they don't 
have to lose all their relationships. That can sustain them." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the modern family structure certainly has changed in the past few 
generations, the need for grandparents is a constant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandparents are an important part of a network of relationships," Davis 
says. "The idea of knowing that there is somebody who cared for your parents 
over time is an important concept for children to have. It contributes to the 
idea of permanency." 
</P>
<P>
 As important as the relationship is, fostering bonds between grandparents and 
grandchildren can be a challenge -- especially if there is geographical 
distance between families or if relations are strained between grandparents and 
their own children. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who is trying to encourage his 8-year-old daughter's long-distance 
relationship with her grandparents, believes that telephone calls, letters, 
pictures and photo albums can go a long way toward building bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they're very young, I don't think there's any substitute for visits," 
Anderson says. "Once they're a little older, a handwritten letter can be very 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, family relationships are complex. Sometimes, particularly if 
grandparents don't get along with their own children, grandchildren may be 
reluctant to bond with them. But there are ways to mend fences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smartest thing grandparents can do if they want a relationship with their 
grandchildren is to make contact and keep their relations separate from their 
relations with their children," Davis says. "They should not talk to the 
children about difficulties with the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most important, they should keep the boundaries of the relationship clear," 
Davis says. "That's always a good rule in any family. Each generation's 
problems with each other should stay within the boundary of that system of 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 For grandchildren, the rewards of a close relationship with their parent's 
parents are invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandparents are a big part of my life," says Susan Farrar, 30, of her 
grandparents, Frank and Dorothy Jacobson of Northridge. "My grandparents were 
supportive of things in my life that sometimes my parents weren't. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very instrumental in getting me to the college I wanted to go to," 
says Farrar, who lives in Turlock with her husband and two children. "They were 
very helpful emotionally and financially." 
</P>
<P>
 For grandparents, grandchildren are a delightful gift. "I think you can see 
yourself in your grandchildren," Dorothy Jacobson says. "You don't have full 
responsibility for them, and they don't keep you awake nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Alice Miller, in true grandparent fashion: "I wouldn't have missed being 
a grandmother for the world."

 "Where L.A.'s Top Designers Shop" headlines one of the print ads for De 
signers Furniture Mart. I didn't run into any of Los Angeles' top designers 
while researching this store, but after checking out the inventory, I would say 
it's entirely possible that you might.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a family business, and owner John Green handpicks the styles.

 The quality of the wood pieces, as well as the upholstered pieces, is quite 
good, considering that the prices are so reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The armoires are particularly well-priced: a pie/jelly cabinet -- excellent 
for storage or display -- in natural or waxed pine is only $247. Usually these 
run around $350. 
</P>
<P>
 An entertainment/storage center that is slightly bigger, in solid pine and 
with one adjustable shelf, is $295. As is the case with all of the wood pieces 
here, custom finishes are available. 
</P>
<P>
 A country bonnet-top armoire, with two adjustable shelves and a clothes rod, 
measures 78 inches high by 40 inches wide and is a reasonable $495 -- about 
$300 less than at many sources. Most wood pieces come from local manufacturers, 
and while we're not talking Century quality, they are made very well. 
</P>
<P>
 We reported recently on some slipcovered sofas at Mark Friedman's in Santa 
Monica, and here's another selection at a good price. 
</P>
<P>
 A 92-inch upholstered sofa -- and there's a wide range of fabrics to select 
from -- plus the slipcover of your choosing is $795. 
</P>
<P>
 All the sofas are kiln-dried elder wood, and the styles are transitional. The 
sofa-and-chair combo for $995 is a particularly good buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors enhance the bargains on these sofa/slipcover combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lifetime warranty on the frames; a fabric protection treatment is 
offered at no cost; and you can trade in the slipcover at any time and receive 
a 50% credit applied to a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Good-quality futons start at $167; check out the "clam bed" at $199. Sofa beds 
start at $395. 
</P>
<P>
 A handsome, queen-sized canopy bed was $399, and I've seen similar designs 
elsewhere for as high as $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the prices are 30% to 40% below retail, some even lower. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a small "clearance" room upstairs that provides some super 
one-of-a-kind bargains. A four-drawer captain's bed of solid pine was priced at 
$249. WHERE TO SHOP

3-HOUR TOUR: THE LANTERMAN LEGACY; FABLED HOUSE BOASTS AN INGENIOUS DESIGN AND 
OFFERS GLIMPSES OF A FAMILY THAT CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1915, Roy Lanterman, a doctor, insisted that the foundation, floors and 
walls of his Craftsman-style house be built from reinforced concrete, because 
he had treated victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and had witnessed 
its devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 11,000-square-foot Lanterman House, at 4420 Encinas Drive, opened 
to the public for the first time in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy and his wife, Emily, were the parents of Assemblyman Frank Lanterman 
(1901-1981), a dedicated and well-respected public servant who represented the 
area in the state Legislature from 1951 until 1978. He continued to live in the 
home with his brother, Lloyd, (1897-1987) after their parents died in the 
1940s. Lloyd left the house to the city of La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank and Lloyd Lanterman's grandparents, Jacob and Ammoretta, had come to the 
La Canada Valley from Michigan in 1875. With a partner, they purchased a 
Mexican land grant of about 6,000 acres known as Rancho La Canada. It covered 
the area from the Arroyo Seco to present-day Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 They subdivided the land into 46 lots and built a home for themselves on 
Verdugo Road. Jacob and Ammoretta were instrumental in establishing the first 
elementary school in the area and the La Canada Community Church, which today 
is the Congregational Church of the Lighted Window. 
</P>
<P>
 All the furnishings in the home are original. The Lanterman Historical Museum 
Foundation is restoring the house and its grounds. Visitors are invited to 
observe aspects of the restoration process as well as the unusual blending of 
architecture and design styles and the history of a family who contributed so 
much to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 1 p.m.: The tour begins in the garage, which has been converted into a 
visitors center. Ringing the room are large black-and-white photographs, 
including a 1907 photograph of the La Canada Valley, where such crops as 
citrus, grapes and barley were grown; portraits of family members and an early 
photograph of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-minute video, "A Glimpse Into Our Past," presents a history of the area, 
dating to the Gabrielino Indians, and that of the Lantermans and the house. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 p.m.: The docent-led tour of the grounds and the house begins outside the 
visitor center. One can see from here the sleeping porch upstairs, which is 
outside the ballroom and not yet open to the public. There are photographs of 
it in the video. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment the garden contains mostly wildflowers. A landscape architect is 
working to replicate the original plantings of wisteria and roses. 
</P>
<P>
 One unusual feature of the house, which sits on a small knoll, is its 32 pairs 
of French doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the vast living room with its furniture, painted ceiling and wall 
ornamentation, numerous Oriental rugs, paintings by California artists and a 
fireplace of stones cut from a quarry near the present-day Descanso Gardens. 
Although it is an open room, typical of the Craftsman or bungalow style, its 
dark, heavy furnishings would fit right in a Victorian-style house. 
</P>
<P>
 The house lightens up a bit in the dining room. You'll see gas and electric 
lighting fixtures of the day and, in the frieze area, classic grape motifs. The 
area around the room that extends from the wall to the carpet is marble, but 
the floor under the carpet is concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Before radio and television, this family played billiards in the richly 
appointed, dark-wood paneled Pool Room. The pool table stands under a stylish 
lighting fixture that hangs low from the ceiling. Racks off the main room still 
hold cues. 
</P>
<P>
 Emily Lanterman's eyeglasses and recipe file can still be found in the 
kitchen. A built-in ice box has an opening to the outside, which allowed for 
deliveries to be placed directly into it. 
</P>
<P>
 A guest bedroom contains baby portraits of Frank and Lloyd Lanterman, a 
Victorian carved walnut bed, and wallpaper in a nature motif. The bathroom next 
door sports a roomy bathtub and a leather razor strap. 
</P>
<P>
 2:30 p.m.: Two rooms that you will pass through quickly on the tour deserve 
more lengthy scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone thinking of or currently refurbishing a home will want to peruse the 
exhibit of photographs and text that details some of the house's structural 
restoration process, which is nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Another room is stuffed full of memorabilia from Frank Lanterman's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps best-known outside the La Canada community for his pioneering efforts 
to establish community-based mental health programs, Frank was a music major at 
USC and became a professional organist. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he played at the opening of the Alex Theatre in Glendale in 1927. 
Among his political and governmental mementos is a trunk full of his music. 
</P>
<P>
 3 p.m.: Leave the Lanterman house, turning right from its driveway. Make a 
right on Verdugo Road. Make another right on Foothill and go to the Hill Street 
Cafe at 1101 Foothill Blvd., for an excellent chocolate milk shake. 
</P>
<P>
 3:30 p.m.: Take Foothill Boulevard past Verdugo and turn left into Memorial 
Park, which has picnic and children's play areas. Descanso Gardens, at 1418 
Descanso Drive, is just a few blocks away and open till 5 p.m. WHERE AND WHEN

CLUB SCENE; HITTING THE HIGH NOTES AS WELL AS THE LOW 
</P>

<P>
 Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays are karaoke nights at El Torito Restaurant and 
Cantina in Northridge, but you'd think it was a Friday night kegger on 
fraternity row.  
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: The bar area fills up quickly Monday nights with what seems like 
the entire Greek-letter population of nearby Cal State Northridge. "This is the 
only place in the Valley happening on Mondays," explained Julie Leach, 21, of 
Chatsworth after belting out Bette Midler's "The Rose." There's no stage, so 
participants stand by the karaoke machine up front and sing songs chosen from a 
menu of rock, rap, country, R & B and even Christmas fare as a monitor scrolls 
the lyrics. The words also scroll on two hanging TV monitors and two large 
screens on either side of the bar area. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Some work the room in dance club attire: baby-doll dresses for the 
women, T-shirts and vests for the guys. But the majority of both sexes are 
content to just kick back in their Greek T-shirts, tank tops, shorts and 
sneakers. About 120 people filled every seat by 10:15 p.m., yet a waitress 
warned, "This is not as crowded as it gets." 
</P>
<P>
 THE KARAOKE: The first several songs chosen, among them, "If the Devil Danced 
in Empty Pockets," "Holding Back the Years" and "Can't Help Falling in Love," 
could not compete with the loud banter of the crowd and their margaritas. It 
wasn't until Kevin Tice, 22, of Calabasas sang a vein-popping rendition of Guns 
N' Roses' "Welcome to the Jungle" that the crowd began to loosen up, start to 
"yee-ha" and sing along from their seats. Then again, the margaritas could've 
kicked in.  
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: "Everyone from CSUN comes here," said Todd Brown, 21, of Woodland 
Hills. "It's local, fun, and there's loud music." Has he ever participated in 
the karaoke? "Naah, my voice sucks," he said. "I've got my pride." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: First-timers are shown no mercy. This crowd howled like ailing dogs 
during one woman's off-key and off-the-beat rendition of "When Doves Cry," by 
"the artist formerly known as Prince." In stepped Dianne, the karaoke night 
host, after two grueling minutes to help her find a key, any key. After the 
woman went back to her seat in mid-song, the wireless mike was passed to crowd 
favorite Kevin Tice, who saved it by performing a rousing Axl Rose-esque 
version, accented with the rocker's famous side-to-side dance. Tice said, "They 
need to build a stage because people can't see you performing." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "A quiet, shy boy, isn't he?" said Dianne into the mike after one of 
Tice's eardrum-shattering performances.  
</P>
<P>
 El Torito, 8855 Tampa Ave., Northridge, serves food from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
Mondays to Thursdays, till midnight Fridays, 9 a.m. to midnight Saturdays and 9 
a.m. to 10 p.m. Sundays. Karaoke begins at 9 p.m. Mondays, Thursdays and 
Fridays. The bar closes at 1:30 a.m. Information: (818) 349-1607. CHERIE

A HOME FIT FOR A KID; A WOODLAND HILLS CARPENTER CONSTRUCTS CUSTOMIZED

 For Shirley Rees and her 5-year-old granddaughter, Susan, stepping into their 
back yard is like stepping into another era. It's a time of white wicker chairs 
and silver serving trays, a time for such genteel pursuits as sipping tea, 
reading stories or just listening as the birds chirp their songs. 
</P>
<P>
 If it all sounds rather 19th Century, rather British, well that's exactly what 
Rees intended -- an English garden to complement and enhance a certain, small 
back-yard garden cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an ordinary playhouse," Rees said. "The bottom line is that this 
is something I have always dreamed about. Something that I've always envisioned 
for relaxing. Something that I could enjoy right alongside my granddaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't easy finding just the right structure -- and the person to build 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look in the Yellow Pages, what you find is mostly the standard 
playground equipment," Rees said. "There is a place in San Diego that makes 
playhouses, but they offer only very preconceived structures, with very 
cut-and-dried plans. There's no room for creativity. And they're expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, through word of mouth, Rees latched onto Jerry Humes, a Woodland 
Hills contractor who literally has been building a reputation for his 
playhouses since 1992, when he put one together for his two daughters as a 
Christmas gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really amazing," Rees said about her garden cottage-style playhouse, 
completed shortly after Christmas. "It's like watching this little mini-house 
take shape right before your very eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the kind of person who knows exactly what I want, so working directly 
with Jerry has been wonderful. It's absolutely custom. And he's a true artist." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just really love anything to do with wood," said Humes, who builds the 
playhouses part-time. "And I have this ability, and confidence I guess, to see 
something once and re-create it or refashion it to the customer's needs." 
</P>
<P>
 What the customer can expect to get from a finished playhouse is almost 
entirely up to their imaginations -- and their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The most basic 64-square-foot structure can be purchased for about $499, but 
he has charged up to $3,500 for a Victorian-style playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I must admit that the more creativity that's required, the more I enjoy 
building it," said Humes, who can produce playhouses with drywall interiors, 
French windows, shingled roofs, patios, carpet, wallpaper or just about 
anything else you can dream up. "It's like designing an entire house." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the size, most of Humes' projects take from one to three weeks to 
construct. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses only pine or plywood, never relying upon the particle board often used 
in build-your-own-playhouse kits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was truly a work of art," said Corinne Muramatsu, director of Laurel Hall 
Preschool in North Hollywood, where Humes completed a Cape Cod model in 
October, charging the school only for his labor. "The children loved to watch, 
from a safe distance, of course. And it's one of their favorite playthings in 
the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's their own space. Their own size. Just the right comfort level where they 
can act out the dramas of their lives and emulate the most important aspects of 
family play. And, well, it's just plain fun." WHERE TO GO 
</P>

A BOY'S LIFE; RUTH KELLEY FOUND A PENCHANT FOR A YOUNG MALE POINT OF VIEW AS 
SHE WROTE 'JAKE'S JOURNAL,' ABOUT A YOUNGSTER IN A RURAL CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA HOWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rebecca Howard writes regularly for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Writer Ruth Kelley welcomes the quiet at night within her home's thick walls, 
built with railroad ties from the 1920s. This is the time when ideas come to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do a good bit of my noodling in bed," she said. "I'm in bed, and I become 
the boy, sort of, and I get phrases that I'm going to use, then the other 
things fit around it." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those boys is Jake, the main character of Kelley's recently published 
novel for children 8 to 12, "Jake's Journal." It is the story of the adventures 
of Jake and his little brother, who come to live for the summer with their 
father and stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, set in the rural canyon in Canyon Country where Kelley lives, 
depicts not only today's mixed families, but is full of an appreciation of 
nature's lessons, from snake bites to mountain lions to an earthquake, even, 
which Kelley based on the San Fernando Valley's 1971 temblor. All this is told 
through the entries in a journal that Jake keeps. Many of Jake's and the other 
characters' experiences come from Kelley's observations of her children and 
their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Kelley and her environment have recognized them in the book. 
"When my sister read it, she said, 'I felt like I was visiting you,' " Kelley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kelley was raising her son and daughter in the rustic canyon 30 years 
ago, she never thought the experience would someday be material for children's 
literature.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kelley never considered herself a writer at all, until she felt 
compelled to write a novel about the ills of the unemployment office where she 
worked for 14 years. Although it was never published, "it got me started 
writing," she said. "I had a big urge to get it out of my system, all the kinds 
of things that go on in an unemployment office or welfare office or a Social 
Security office." 
</P>
<P>
 While trying to learn how to market her novel in a class conducted through a 
local adult school, Kelley began working on a children's story. Encouraged by 
her classmates, she submitted the story to Ranger Rick children's magazine. The 
story, "Cleopatra's Revenge," about the effects of flood on a canyon, was not 
only published in the magazine, but was named best short story for children 
published in 1985 by the International Reading Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about this canyon, the natural things that happen to it, and the things 
that seem bad have a good side to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grow up in the country, you have to learn to take the bad with the 
good," Kelley began the story. "Things happen, natural things, that you don't 
like at all. Usually, though, something good happens that helps balance things 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recognition for her children's story, it took more than 30 
submissions, beginning in 1986, before "Jake's Journal" found a publisher and 
went to print this year. In the editing process, Kelley found herself revising 
and revising the book, at the request of editors, from its original form of 
letters written by the main character. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I got through with it, I just didn't like it at all," Kelley 
said. "So I went back to the letters and just made it a journal." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of having the book written in letter or journal form was to give 
authenticity to Jake's voice, Kelley said. Many boys go on to nonfiction or 
science fiction by the time they become good readers because many fiction 
stories are not realistic from a boy's point of view, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really what I was aiming at. I remember asking my husband if he 
thought it would be all right if I wrote this in the form of letters because I 
want this to seem like a real kid," she said. "I want boys to read it. A woman 
who does my copying sent the book to her grandson in Ojai. He told her it was 
the best book he'd read in a long time. Something like that just pleases me no 
end. I got to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for writing the book in journal style was Kelley's way of 
inspiring children to keep journals of their own.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many elementary schools are encouraging journals," she said. "It's a great 
catharsis for kids. To get it written down, you get it out of your system." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jake's Journal," published by Worthington Press, is available through 
schoolbook ordering programs and in area bookstores, such as One for the Books 
in Newhall. The book was used in class sessions at Castaic Elementary, where 
Kelley spoke to fourth-graders. She has received correspondence from students 
as far away as Rochester, N.Y., thanking Kelley for a great book. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley said she was pleased at the publisher's price for the book -- $2.99 -- 
which makes it affordable, thus more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many kids -- or parents -- can go in a store and spend $15 or $20 on a 
book for a kid that a kid night not like?" she said. "No matter what happens, 
the kid is going to outgrow it. It's not like an adult who is going to buy a 
novel and pass it around to all the friends and even read it again. I'm very 
happy to take a small advance if they'll sell it inexpensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley has many other writing projects. She has written poetry and adult short 
stories and is working on historical novels about her canyon, as well as one 
about World War II. Every two weeks, she meets with a writers group, as she has 
for the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly suggest writers participating in a critique group," she said. 
"It's been nice because we can see the progress we've all made." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's next children's book will be an extension of her first. "Boomer's 
Journal" will focus on another boy character and deal with alcoholism and 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a message that there is help," Kelley said. "If I can get that across 
without being preachy, it'll be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Boomer is a character composite of children Kelley has known, and she hopes to 
reach her audience by speaking through him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I have a strong boy's voice. I don't know where it came from," Kelley 
said. "I guess I just have an empathy with the kids who are around here."

 Eleven singles for four quarters. That's just one of the bargains at Mi Casita 
Salvadorena. The others, you eat. 
</P>
<P>
 First bargain first: Take those quarters and unleash a flood of Alvaro Torres 
or Los Tigres del Norte from the restaurant's old-fashioned Wurlitzer jukebox. 
Of course, chances are you won't have to. One of the other customers will 
probably have beaten you to the punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of Salvadoran cafes have opened in standard-issue storefronts since the 
flood of immigrants from El Salvador in the '80s, but Mi Casita Salvadorena 
breaks the mold. The location is a dreary, oversized Van Nuys roadhouse 
decorated in vestiges of a bygone roadhouse era: faded brown vinyl banquettes, 
wooden captain's chairs that have as much to do with Central America as 
tortillas with Cape Cod, a Lite beer sign complete with attached longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lean over the front counter, though, and you can watch a team of female cooks 
unhurriedly kneading, patting and grilling pupusas , the Salvadoran national 
snack.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter how Mexican individual Salvadoran dishes may look, this basically 
tropical cuisine is no more than a distant cousin of Mexico's. Salvadoran food 
tends to be sweeter and milder, for one thing. Take tamales de elote , stuffed 
with shredded chicken and chopped olives; they're softer and much sweeter than 
Mexican tamales. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that rice, beans and tortillas are eaten with gusto in Mexico and El 
Salvador, but even that similarity is deceptive. Salvadoran tortillas are thick 
corn patties, more like johnnycakes than something you'd use to make a taco. 
Rice becomes a gentle, crunchy pilaf flavored with chicken broth, celery and 
carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pupusas the cooks are making somewhat resemble Mexican sopes , both 
snacks being based on cornmeal masa , but pupusas are far more complex. Pupusa 
de queso con loroco , for instance, calls for white cheese and loroco , a dried 
flower bud with a taste some liken to asparagus (personally, I don't see the 
resemblance). The cooks mix bits of loroco with the cheese, stuff the mixture 
into the masa , form it into a thick disk and finish the thing up on a hot 
grill. 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular pupusa is revueltas . For that specialty, the cheese is mixed 
with crunchy pork cracklings ( chicharrones ). All pupusas come with curtido , 
a vinegary cabbage salad that could pass for coleslaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Meat dishes are quite popular in this cuisine. Salpicon Salvadoreno is finely 
minced beef cooked with onion, chiles and other vegetables, typically eaten 
with rice and beans. 
</P>
<P>
 This kitchen also prepares some Gargantuan meat dishes that will feed a crowd, 
especially with those thick Salvadoran tortillas. Anyone with more than a 
little time on his hands ought to give one a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Parrillada Salvadorena is one of them: a one-pound Spencer steak, marinated 
and charcoal-grilled until the outside of the meat is a dark crust. Parrillada 
costilla de puerco is an entire slab of lean pork ribs, basted with a deep red 
salsa. The piece de resistance has to be gallina entera , a whole chicken 
served in two courses that is pricey by this restaurant's standards: $25. The 
first course is grilled boneless chicken, skin on. The second course is a 
home-style soup, full of those missing bones. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant offers many dishes unique to the Salvadoran repertoire. 
Rellenos de guisquil is a meat-stuffed yellow squash, first cousin to the 
stuffed vegetables you find in, say, any Armenian restaurant. Cena de pavo 
consists of delicious, boneless hunks of baked turkey brushed with a mild red 
sauce. Empanadas de platanos are sugar-dusted banana fritters, wonderful for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual chilate con nuegados y dulce de platanos makes a great breakfast. 
Chilate is a pasty, spicy gravy that Salvadorans spoon over stewed bananas 
(dulce de platanos). Nuegados are fried dough balls in a sugary syrup, making 
this dish the Central American equivalent of banana pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverages include fruity, sweet-sour tamarindo , made from tamarind, and 
horchata , a sweet, cinnamon-flavored drink made from boiled rice. Served ice 
cold, both are quite refreshing on a hot summer day. You'll get yours in a 
paper cup. No frills here. 
</P>
<P>
 The one complaint I have about Mi Casita Salvadorena is the perfunctory 
service. Questions about ingredients, for instance, may be greeted with a stony 
shrug. But don't even think about letting those objections deter you from 
giving this place a try.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, if you don't like the service or even the food, you can always get up 
and dance. WHERE AND WHEN

IT'S A DAY OF FIRSTS AS FALL CLASSES BEGIN AT CAL STATE FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cars, cars everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 They're a sure sign that Cal State Fullerton is back in session. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, commuter students streamed into parking lots, across lawns and 
into halls, inaugurating the 36th year of college life on the Fullerton campus. 
About 22,000 people are expected to attend the university this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 105,000 students have graduated here since 1959, President Milton A. 
Gordon told the campus community during a convocation this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Upperclassmen renewed the annual academic cycle Thursday, swarming from 
classrooms to lunchrooms and back -- leaving a few frantic freshmen wondering 
where to go for their next math or English class. But student volunteers who 
sat behind fold-up tables were ready to point them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's Biology 101?" a new student asked David Dutchen, 20, an orientation 
volunteer. Dutchen, who wore a button that read "Ask me anything," leafed 
through a course schedule and pointed over his shoulder: "Over there, second 
floor." The freshman, with a shiny pair of black in-line skates in his arms, 
gave Dutchen a quick "thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 "People always ask us where University Hall is," said Reushann Ison, Dutchen's 
partner, indicating a recently constructed building behind her. "They're kind 
of embarrassed when you tell them they're standing right next to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers said freshmen often wander about lost before picking up maps 
and handbooks at the three "survival booths" set up around campus. Sometimes 
the volunteers' clientele isn't limited to people new to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one guy come by who's 42 and he's been going to school here since 
1972," Dutchen said. "He's basically a professional student."  
</P>
<P>
 The first day of class initiated several other firsts: the first bike crashes 
of the year; the first pick-up lines in the quad; and the first gripes.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got a class at 8 in the morning; I think I'm gonna die," one young woman 
moaned near the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Students Jordan Ruyle and Stu Slater began school by attending their first 
guitar class Thursday. Ruyle said he has made a few resolutions to start off 
the new academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means more to me than New Year's Day," said Ruyle, 23. "I'm doing all this 
new stuff -- like exercising and going to guitar practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater's goals were more basic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of new people to meet that look very, um, interesting," said 
Slater, 26, a graduate student. "Especially of the shorts-and-tank-tops 
variety." 
</P>
<P>
 The campus's Office of Student Life will offer new students several activities 
in the next two weeks, including workshops, tips for juggling classes, a reggae 
concert -- and a "Velcro wall" at which students can hurl themselves and 
dangle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our chance to be welcoming and do outreach," said Kevin Colaner, 
assistant director for campus programs. "We know that many students coming here 
are the first in their family to come to college, and we want to do as much as 
we can to reduce their stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Colaner said students can be overwhelmed by bureaucracy at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to take the fear factor out of that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, he hopes to involve alumni and Gordon's office in orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his welcoming address Tuesday, Gordon said 33 more faculty members will be 
hired this year at a cost of $1.2 million to accommodate a growing student 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracting new instructors to Cal State Fullerton has been hard in the past 
few years because of high housing prices, Gordon said. Because of that, the 
university is seeking to build housing for faculty and staff in Brea.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton Foundation officials are negotiating with landowners Santa 
Fe Energy Resources Inc., who plan to build 867 homes in an area called Olinda 
Heights. About 400 of those homes would be set aside for university staff and 
faculty in an area tentatively called University Summit. Another 250 may be 
offered to senior citizens through a university-sponsored program.  
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of the fact that neither the economy nor Mother Nature has been very 
kind to California," Gordon said, "and despite continuing diminishing state 
resources, I am optimistic about our future."

MAN HELD IN SLAYING OF FORMER ROOMMATE; CRIME: HE AND 3 OTHERS ARE ACCUSED OF 
KIDNAPING, BEATING AND STABBING VICTIM. 
</P>

 A Lake Forest mechanic who kicked out his roommate after an argument last 
weekend will be charged today with later abducting the man, murdering him and 
then dumping his battered body in Cajon Pass in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean P. Neuer, 27, and three other men -- all from Orange County -- are 
accused of the kidnaping, beating and fatal stabbing of Jody Vincent Robinson, 
a 20-year-old pool hall attendant who shared an apartment with Neuer before 
moving out last weekend after the two argued over unpaid rent, according to 
members of Robinson's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men are being charged as accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's bound body was discovered Monday afternoon by a motorist in Devore. 
The victim had been stabbed, severely beaten and stripped of his military-style 
black boots. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's parents said Thursday that they were told by authorities that the 
removal of the boots marks the work of racist skinheads, but authorities said 
they are not treating the slaying as racially motivated. Robinson is black. 
Neuer and three other suspects are white, one suspect is Asian American and one 
is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people involved may, in fact, be skinheads," said Sgt. Warren 
Nobles of the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department. "They're not telling us 
that. There's nothing to suggest that this was a deliberate skinhead attack on 
someone who's black. . . . What we have is a roommate fight where the roommate 
solicits some friends to help him get rid of a guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's mother, Rae Ann Robinson of Rancho Santa Margarita, said, "It's 
hard to think they would do something like this over rent money." 
</P>
<P>
 The others facing murder charges are Michael Bukowski, 20, of San Juan 
Capistrano, Christopher Roy, 20, of San Clemente and Andrew Irving, 21, 
described by police as a transient who lives in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Nguyen, 25, of Lake Forest and Ladell Hill, 22, of Glendora are being 
charged as accessories to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 All six are being held without bail in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and acquaintances said Thursday that Robinson and Neuer had 
quarreled over household finances since they began rooming together about a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neuer, a mechanic at an equipment-rental store in Mission Viejo, complained to 
co-workers that Robinson didn't pay rent and telephone bills and wouldn't move 
out. Neuer told them once that Robinson had threatened him and his girlfriend 
with a pool stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuer "was looking for a way to get rid of the guy and just couldn't get rid 
of him," said Bob Street, who hired Neuer two months ago to fix equipment at 
Mission Viejo Rentals. He described Neuer as a capable mechanic but "flaky" and 
often late for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Street said Neuer's complaints subsided when Robinson found work recently. Rae 
Ann Robinson said that about two weeks ago her son landed jobs at Fezziwig's 
Family Fun Center in Mission Viejo and at a Jiffy Lube in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 But an argument broke out on Saturday over rent, and Neuer announced he had a 
new roommate, Rae Ann Robinson said. Robinson was kicked out that day and he 
stayed with a co-worker, she said. He visited his parents on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought everything was resolved. He left. He left all that behind," said 
Rae Ann Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that when Robinson finished work at the pool hall about 3 a.m. 
Monday, he was greeted by Irving, Bukowski and Roy -- all acquaintances of his 
-- and accepted their offer of a ride. They took Robinson to Neuer's apartment 
building, where Neuer and the others bound and gagged him and put him in the 
trunk of a car, authorities said. Robinson was driven to a dirt road just off 
Interstate 15, killed and left there, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They beat him and stabbed him and took his boots and left him laying there," 
said Rae Ann Robinson, her voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Robinson graduated from Trabuco Hills High School in 1991 and later 
studied architecture for one semester at Saddleback College. Robinson's 
3-year-old daughter, who lives in Atlanta with her mother, has been staying 
with his parents for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a real good kid, real outgoing and well-liked by everybody I know," 
said David Leahy, a friend who lives near Robinson's parents in Rancho Santa 
Margarita. "He was such a friendly kid. He'd associate with people I didn't 
think he should associate with."

VAN IN BOSTON LINKED TO STUDENT'S SLAYING; CRIME: POLICE ARREST TWO YOUTHS IN 
VEHICLE BELIEVED THE ONE USED IN GARDEN GROVE KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 An Orange County man and a juvenile were arrested in Boston Thursday in a van 
police say was involved in the shocking murder last week of a UCI engineering 
student gunned down in Garden Grove as he attempted to get the van's license 
number, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Sapinoso, 19, of Westminster was shot Aug. 17 as he and a friend 
followed a van he believed had been involved in neighborhood vandalism. He was 
hit several time in the upper body, then driven to a local hospital that did 
not have emergency facilities. He died before paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The van has been located in Boston," said Garden Grove police Capt. Dave 
Abrecht. "We're sending four investigators back there tonight to pick up the 
trail." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police Lt. John Woods said police stopped the van about 6 p.m. 
after a 10-minute chase. About four people were in the van, he said, but only 
two were held. They were a 17-year-old from Orange, who was arrested on a 
probation violation, and Vinh Quoc Ta, 18, of Santa Ana, arrested on a burglary 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston police, like those in several other locations, had been advised by 
Garden Grove police to be on the lookout for the van. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is one of the places where we thought they might turn up," Abrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Sapinoso, Robert's father, said he was "overwhelmed, overjoyed" to learn 
of the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want justice to be done because we believe in justice in this country. 
. . . We are just happy that justice is being done." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso's friend who was with him when the attack occurred, said he was "glad 
for Robert's parents. We wanted justice to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the slaying, the friend said, "we've been doing a lot of praying here. 
We're a very religious family. I had really good faith that they were going to 
catch them. I'm totally relieved. The police did their job. They don't want it 
to happen again, and I don't want it happen again, and no one wants it to 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, he was convinced those involved in the killing were part of 
a gang, so he was still "scared of the (gang members) coming back. It is a 
gang, so . . . I'm always going to have in my mind a worst-case scenario. . . . 
I'm going to have to watch out. The police are coming by here a lot. That's 
made my family feel better." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso, an engineering student, had been working at the friend's house on 
their cars about 6:45 p.m. that day when they saw a passing silver Toyota van 
that matched the description of one used by vandals there the previous weekend. 
They got into Sapinoso's Honda CRX to follow it. 
</P>
<P>
 They had written all but one digit of the license plate when the van pulled 
over at Newland Street and Trask Avenue, and a passenger walked toward them and 
opened fire, the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 He rushed Sapinoso to nearby Vencor Hospital-Orange County, which has no 
emergency facilities. Sapinoso died as they waited for help to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend told police the shooter was Vietnamese, between the 17 to 21 years 
of age, with "thick, black, unruly" hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Thursday released a composite sketch of the gunman.

IN HOT WATER; OCEAN WARMS UP DRAMATICALLY THIS SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When San Clemente lifeguard Richard Chew looked at the thermometer, he 
couldn't believe it. It read 79.9 degrees. Not the air. The water temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wondered if our thermometer was working right!" Chew exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 So Chew and his colleagues checked the reading against one taken by state 
lifeguards the same day, Aug. 18, aboard a boat a mile out from San Clemente. 
That reading: 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least two weeks, Orange County's coastal waters have heated up to 
unusually tropical temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at this time, water temperatures averaged 70 degrees, but ocean 
water temperatures are now averaging 76 degrees along Orange County's 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that as inland air temperatures have soared, the heat -- combined 
with only mild wind -- has had a warming effect on the ocean, said Dean Jones, 
meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said a high pressure system over Southern California has prevented high 
winds from developing over ocean waters and producing upwelling, when warmer, 
surface waters are moved away and replaced by colder water down below. 
</P>
<P>
 When told about the 80-degree temperatures, Jones said, "Wow! That is warm." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have that strong offshore flow pattern, which would result in 
upwelling," Jones said, "the water can become more stagnant and heat up over a 
period of days or weeks, even a month. And it has been a pretty warm summer." 
</P>
<P>
 For lifeguards, there are other more obvious indicators of warmer waters, 
including larger beach crowds and more reports of stingray and jellyfish 
stings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chew, during a one-week period in 1993, water temperatures in San 
Clemente averaged 69.5 degrees. This year, Chew said that for the same week's 
period, Aug. 15 to 21, the water averaged 74.9. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That's almost five degrees warmer than last year and the 80-degree 
temperature was about the warmest anyone can ever remember it being down here," 
said Chew, who has been a lifeguard for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mullin, professor of biological oceanography at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography in La Jolla, said a research vessel that recently spent two weeks 
at sea found that the region's water temperatures were cooler, not warmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implication is that although near-shore waters are warmer," Mullin said, 
"the offshore region is cooler than the long-term average. . . . It's a coastal 
rather than a California current-wide phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 The California current runs north to south and skirts near shore at Point 
Conception then travels west of the Channel Islands near Oxnard in a band 100 
miles wide, Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A real indicator of warm water coming up from the south are crabs, red crabs 
about the size of your thumb," Mullin said. "You would see them wash up on the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Obvious indicators for lifeguards have been huge crowds of people at the beach 
escaping Southern California's sweltering weather, and higher incidents of 
swimmers being stung from jellyfish and stingrays. 
</P>
<P>
 During a one-week study, Don Ito, state park superintendent in Huntington 
Beach, said they had to close Bolsa Chica State Beach on a warm weekend, 
something the state parks system had not done in recent times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a 40% increase in the number of people using our beach from the same 
one-week period in 1993," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for stingrays, which prefer warm, placid water, Seal Beach and Huntington 
State Beach have reported more contacts with the bottom dwellers, according to 
Thomas W. Barnett, San Clemente State Beach lifeguard supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also has noticed more jellyfish, which visit during spells of 
warmer water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get maybe 72 degrees around here and that's about as high we get," Barnett 
said. "And we're getting temps in the high 70s. I've never heard of it being 
that high around here." Warming Trend 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean temperatures along the Orange County coast have been unusually high. San 
Clemente's recorded 80 degrees is the warmest in two decades. A comparison of 
high and average water temperatures during the first weeks of August in 1993

 Looking haggard but struggling to remain composed, John J. Famalaro's voice 
quavered only once when an investigator asked him to explain why his freezer 
contained the corpse of a young Newport Beach woman who had been beaten, 
striped naked and handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "After, after you've read me my rights I think I want to talk to an attorney," 
Famalaro said softly. "I just want to go see my attorney, please." 
</P>
<P>
 A videotape of that interview shortly after his July 13 arrest, released 
Thursday, shows the 37-year-old murder suspect fidgeted in his chair when faced 
with the evidence, and then requesting his attorney when the murder of 
23-year-old Denise Huber was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Scott Mascher of the Yavapai County Sheriff's Department abandoned his 
questioning of the house painter and handyman, who sat in the corner of a dimly 
lit interrogation room, his legs stretched out in front of him. The interview 
lasted only a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first and last time that Famalaro has talked to the detectives 
trying to unravel why someone might tote a frozen body across the west for more 
than three years. He remains in an Arizona jail cell, but may be extradited to 
Orange County for trial as soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Taped interviews with Famalaro's sister and former brother-in-law offered a 
few more clues, revealing the former Lake Forest resident's troubled upbringing 
and adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's sister, Marion Thobe, told investigators she has struggled to 
understand why both her brothers have been accused of such twisted acts. Warren 
Famalaro, a former chiropractor, served time in prison for molesting two young 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where it started," Thobe, 40, of Prescott, told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 She seemed to lay at least some of the blame on her mother, Anna Mae Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and her brothers were raised in an unhealthy, repressive 
environment where they were verbally abused, beaten with belts and forbidden to 
talk about sex, maturing or even pregnancy. "It wasn't a normal household," 
Thobe said. "She would go out to other people and say, 'Look at my three 
wonderful children.' But in the house we were (expletive)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She described her father as a kind "Christian" man but said her mother took 
religion to an extreme that bordered on fanaticism. Anna Famalaro was not 
tolerant of her children's antics and would often react with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an odd duck," Thobe said. "She was pretty physical. My dad wasn't. She 
would use a belt. . . . She had a short fuse, you know. The tolerance wasn't 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 When interviewed by detectives, Marion Thobe's former husband, a one-time Iowa 
police officer, also talked about Anna Mae Famalaro: 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know, all I can say is what I experienced myself with the mother. In 
the 15 years I was part of that family, the mother is very controlling -- very 
dominating and -- you don't do things her way, she gets mad," said Duane Thobe. 
"The mother, I can just imagine how awful it must have been growing up with 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Thobe described a telephone conversation Famalaro had with Marion 
shortly after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marion said there wasn't much of a conversation and all he did was cry. He 
said, 'Do you hate me? Do you ever want to see me again?' . . . He just cried 
the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew the Famalaros report that Anna Famalaro would cover John 
Famalaro's eyes in the movie theater if the actors so much as kissed, even when 
her son was in his late teens. Neighbors say Anna Famalaro tried to discourage 
her son from dating, and never seemed satisfied with any of his female friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing the impact one person can have on a family, just amazing," 
Marion Thobe continued. "This isn't a pretty story." 
</P>
<P>
 "She followed (John) on a date once," she later added. " . . . To make sure he 
didn't do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Thobe told investigators her mother also interfered with her marriage, 
telling her son-in-law that his wife could not be trusted. Her mother, she 
said, thought she was cheating on her husband because she attended exercise 
classes regularly and dressed fashionably when she went out. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators asked Marion Thobe why she moved next door to her mother at the 
Prescott Country Club given their mother's overbearing nature. Marion Thobe 
said she hoped her mother would have "mellowed" over the years, but upon 
returning found that she remained cold and aloof. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Thobes divorced and moved out, Famalaro moved into the home where 
Huber's body would later be found. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last month, Anna Famalaro said she was hurt by the harsh 
portrait that others have painted of her. She described herself as a 
conservative Christian who was being unfairly blasted as a domineering mother. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's upbringing could become key during the murder trial, especially if 
defense attorneys chart an "insanity" defense or argue that the bizarre 
upbringing manifested itself in violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's body was found in a freezer inside a stolen rental truck parked in the 
driveway of a home owned by Duane Thobe, Marion Thobe's ex-husband. Famalaro 
was living in a home is in a country club community in Dewey, Ariz. Huber's 
belongings were found in the garage in a box marked "Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators asked Duane Thobe his whereabouts when Denise Huber disappeared, 
and he told police he was dealing with his own failing marriage at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Thobe told investigators he helped Famalaro move several times, 
including into the Laguna Hills warehouse where authorities believe Huber was 
murdered. But Duane Thobe stressed he never saw the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw a freezer. Never saw a freezer," he said. "I never moved a 
freezer. It wasn't at the warehouse. . . . I'd swear to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro faces the death penalty if convicted of kidnaping and murdering 
Huber, a young waitress who vanished in June, 1991, after tire blew out on her 
car on the Corona Del Mar Freeway as she was driving home from a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County investigators suspect that Famalaro abducted Huber from the 
freeway and then took her to a Laguna Hills warehouse where he was living and 
bludgeoned her to death. Even three years after her disappearance, detectives 
allege they have found traces of blood in the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical tests are pending to determine whether Huber was sexually molested. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is expected to waive extradition Monday and be transferred from 
Arizona to the Orange County Men's Jail later in the week, Deputy Public 
Defender Leonard Gumlia said Thursday.

DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT MAY BRING BUDGET CUTS; EDUCATION: COLLEGE DISTRICT HAS 
460 FEWER STUDENTS FOR FALL. AN ADDITIONAL $1.4-MILLION SHORTFALL LOOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Administrators for Ventura County's community colleges Thursday disclosed 
another budget shortfall that more than doubles an existing deficit, even as 
fewer students enrolled this week at the three campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller number of students signing up for fewer classes for the fall 
semester means that the Ventura County Community College District's budget 
problems could be deepening, despite heavy cuts in recent years and more on the 
way, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly discovered $1.4-million shortage will force the district to trim a 
total of $2.5 million from its $61.6-million tentative budget adopted by 
trustees two months ago, Vice Chancellor Jeff Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the previous $1.1-million deficit announced earlier this month, Marsee 
blamed Thursday's new shortage on declining property tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state did a preliminary review on what they thought the projections would 
be, but they followed them up last month and found those estimates were too 
high," he said. "We were totally and completely blindsided." 
</P>
<P>
 College district trustees said Thursday that the size of the growing deficit 
may threaten the quality of education that their campuses offer in Oxnard, 
Moorpark and Ventura. Classes and part-time teachers may no longer be insulated 
from cuts that must be made by Sept. 13, when the governing board is scheduled 
to adopt a final budget, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just have to hunt through the budget and cut where we can," Trustee 
Timothy D. Hirschberg said. "It's not a pleasant task, but it's something the 
board is getting too used to doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary numbers provided by the district Thursday show that enrollment has 
dropped districtwide almost 2% from a year ago. The hours of class time that 
students signed up for have also dropped slightly more than 1% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The enrollment figures are important because the district's funds are 
appropriated by the state based on the number of students who sign up for 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the current budget is based on enrollment from the last school year, 
so the new numbers will affect next year's budget, Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position on all of the cuts has been not to take money out of the 
classrooms and try to make all of the (budget) adjustments in the support 
services areas," Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, the district has eliminated five administrative jobs, 18 full-time 
faculty positions and 17 classified jobs, Vice Chancellor Jerry Pauley said. 
And any new vacancies will not likely be filled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not hiring the people we think we need to hire," Pauley said. "We're 
not replacing people, and we're reducing staff through attrition." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several weeks, the district has not filled about a dozen vacant 
support-services jobs, a move that Marsee said will whittle about $750,000 from 
the multimillion-dollar shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did fill a few critical positions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Gregory P. Cole, who is not seeking reelection in November, chastised 
his board colleagues for digging a deeper hole by approving a multiyear 
contract for the district's full-time teachers earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district could have avoided some of the cuts if they had held firm with 
their contractual obligations with the (full-time teachers)," Cole said of the 
contract, which gave teachers a 1% pay hike. "Over 90% of our budget now is 
going to salaries and benefits. That's appalling." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Hirschberg said the contract was the result of the entire board's 
direction to staff negotiators. "We would have been in bad faith with the 
district and our employees had we backed out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have been politically expedient to do an about-face, as did the 
board minority that night," Hirschberg said. "But in good faith, we had to 
honor the commitment reached over months of very hard bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, 24,912 students were enrolled in the three community 
colleges, down 460 students, or 1.85%, from last year, according to district 
figures. The hours of instruction are also down districtwide slightly more than 
1%, to 282,468, a drop of almost 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of the decrease continues to drop, so we're coming closer to 
closing the gap," said Barbara Buttner, director of governing board relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College was the only campus to show an increase in students and class 
hours over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this school year, the district's smallest campus has enrolled 5,165 
students, up five students from a year ago. Those students are also holding 
down tougher schedules, carrying almost 53,000 hours of class time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gymnasium has come on-line now," said Larry Calderon, Oxnard College vice 
president of instruction. "But we've also taken a hard look at what we offer 
and made sure that we scheduled a bunch of the high-demand classes so students 
won't get turned away." College Enrollment Slips 04,18,19,18,19 Fall, 1993

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; STORE HEIST SUSPECT ARRESTED IN ENGLAND 
</P>

 A man suspected of robbing a drug store of condoms and prescription drugs and 
threatening a pharmacist with what appeared to be a hand grenade was arrested 
Thursday at Heathrow Airport in England, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Cooper Clark, 30, of Irvine apparently tried to flee from airport 
authorities after a routine check on his identification revealed that he was 
wanted in connection with the robbery, said Officer Mike Corcoran, a spokesman 
for the Huntington Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his arrest by English authorities, Clark was flown back to New York, 
where he is now being held without bail until local authorities finish 
extradition procedures and bring him back to Orange County to be tried, 
Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark may be flown back as early as today to face armed robbery charges, if he 
waives extradition, Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark is a suspect in Monday's robbery of the Druggist, a store on Brookhurst 
Street. He had placed two packages of Lifestyle condoms on the counter and 
handed a list of prescription drugs to the store's owner and pharmacist, Terry 
Bottorff. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark then opened his jacket and revealed what appeared to be a grenade 
strapped to his chest and told Bottorff that he had a gun as well, police said. 
The list of about a dozen painkilling drugs was taken out from a booklet with 
information about the Irish Republican Army, which was left behind along with a 
driver's license with a Beverly Hills address on it, Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into his previous address revealed that he had moved out of 
the affluent Beverly Hills neighborhood and moved into another house with his 
mother in Irvine, Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of Irvine and Huntington Beach police officers, sheriff's deputies and 
a bomb expert searched the Irvine home for possible weapons and explosives and 
found three "rifle-type" weapons, a handgun and a grenade, which was discovered 
to be real but without the proper fuse to ignite it, Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has no arrest record and apparently has no ties to the IRA, Corcoran 
said. He was in England to visit his father, Corcoran said. TAMMY HYUNJOO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; FOUR YOUTHS ARRESTED IN ARMED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police in Seal Beach arrested four people Wednesday night shortly after two 
pedestrians were robbed of $181 at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Dunn of Compton and Carl Garrison of Carson, both 18, were booked on 
suspicion of armed robbery along with two juveniles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man and woman were walking along the 200 block of 10th Street about 10:15 
p.m. when two men approached them with what appeared to be guns and demanded 
money, police said. The two handed over the money and the suspects fled in a 
1983 Nissan, said Lt. Kenny Mollohan. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief search, police found the car and four suspects, whom the victims 
identified, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn and Garrison were booked into Orange County Jail, and the two youths were 
taken to Juvenile Hall, he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; RESIDENTS WIN FIGHT, KEEP 21ST ST. NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of 21st Street have won their fight to keep the name of their 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Tuesday rejected a proposal by a realty company to change 
21st Street to Medical Way and agreed with residents that the change would 
cause too much disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good concept, but I see too much community opposition," said 
Councilman Craig Schweisinger, who joined his colleagues in a unanimous vote to 
deny the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Keegan of Keegan Realty proposed the name change to reflect the medical 
uses of the buildings on Hospital Circle, which uses 21st Street as its main 
access from Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Keegan said that changing the name to Medical Way, or to one with a medical 
connotation, would enhance the image of the street and attract more clients for 
the nursing home, the medical offices and a respiratory-care facility on 
Hospital Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now tougher for medical areas to survive," Keegan said. "We just want a 
chance to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents said that the name change would be like robbing the identity of 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived there since 1955," said Irene Harbison. "I want to live on 21st 
Street, not Medical Way." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, residents said that a name change would cause postal difficulties 
because they would have to notify friends, relatives, insurance and utility 
companies, the Department of Motor Vehicles and other public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident, Catherine Garcia, said that changing 21st Street to Medical 
Way could confuse people who might think that there is still a hospital with 
emergency services inthe area. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a 19-year-old college student shot in Garden Grove was rushed to 
Vencor Hospital-Orange County on Hospital Circle and died because the hospital 
does not have an emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that more signs would be posted to help motorists find the 
medical facilities on Hospital Circle, and 21st Street would be repaved to 
improve its appearance. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CHILDREN LEARN ROOTS BY DANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an audience of their peers and parents clapped to the beat of the music, 
girls in colorful skirts and boys in white shirts and dark denims on Thursday 
proudly danced traditional dances of Mexico, known as Ballet Folklorico.  
</P>
<P>
 Their performance was part of the closing celebration of a monthlong summer 
camp for 60 youngsters, aged 5 to 13, who participated in the third annual 
Project LEARN -- Local Efforts to Address and Reduce Neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, a year-round effort of the Orange County division of the 
Children's Bureau of Southern California, provides a variety of services to the 
predominantly Latino students at Oak View Elementary School and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp, held in August at the school's BienestarFamily Center, focuses on 
giving children from the low-income area enriching cultural and recreational 
activities, said Dorothy Nieto Manzer, manager of the Project LEARN prevention 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Offered free, the summer camp is made possible through private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past month, the young dancers have practiced daily during the summer 
camp. Maria Elena Arreola, who has formally studied the art of Ballet 
Folklorico, volunteered to instruct the children, hoping to help the children 
retain their heritage and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a part of the dance team has helped the youngsters develop self-esteem, 
Manzer said. The dances give Latino children a positive expression of their 
culture and help Anglo youngsters learn about Mexican dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Arreola taught the youngsters dances native to the northern regions of Mexico 
and the southern state of Jalisco. If the performances by the young dancers 
were not technically perfect, she said, they were from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancers agreed that Folklorico is one way of learning more about their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to learn my culture because my ancestors danced," said 11-year-old 
Eduardo Gonzalez, one of the 19 male dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Graciela Gonzalez, Eduardo's mother, agreed that Ballet Folklorico is a good 
way for her American-born son to relive her family's way of life in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing the costume made her feel proud of herself and her friends, said 
Elizabeth Lopez, 11, one of 13 female dancers who wore an off-the-shoulder 
white blouse and a short, red print ruffled skirt. She said she chose to join 
in the dancing "because it's part of me." DEBRA CANO

 Cablevision of Orange overcharged its subscribers by $96,000 during a 10-month 
period in 1993 and 1994 and must refund the money, the City Council has 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable company, which serves more than 24,000 customers, has 30 days to 
appeal the council's decision to the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members passed a resolution Tuesday that rejected the $11.20 monthly 
rate Cablevision charged for its "basic tier" service from September, 1993, to 
July, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic rate should have been $10.82 and should have included stations WTBS 
and WGN, said Emily Brubaker, a consultant with Communications Support Group 
Inc., in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. David De Berry said subscribers may have to wait for 
months before receiving the refund, which amounts to about $4 per customer, 
plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cablevision General Manager Kristy Casasanta said the company is waiting to 
see the council's resolution before deciding whether to appeal. "More than 
likely, we will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of classifying cable channels has come before city councils in 
cities across the country since Congress restored local control over cable 
rates in 1992, Brubaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not alone in this," she advised council members who said they were 
uncomfortable challenging the cable company on a formula too complex for lay 
people to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, it boils down to how many channels can be counted in a package," 
De Berry said. "It gets into whether those two channels were taken off the 
basic tier to purposely evade regulations." LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; TRASH COLLECTION RATES ARE GOING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trash-collection rates will go up slightly in the city beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday night unanimously approved a proposed list of 
monthly increases for trash collection.The increases vary, according to number 
of containers used and whether the customer is residential or commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Fred Maley said the new rates affect only residential customers' 
brown, or general garbage, containers. "There is still no charge for the green 
containers, which are used for recyclables," Maley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for one residential brown container on Oct. 1 goes from the current 
$13.45 a month to $13.70. If a resident uses a second brown container, the 
additional cost per month is $1 -- a 20-cent increase over the current fee. For 
a third brown container, the additional cost is $3.85 a month, an increase of 
10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial rates were increased about 3.5%, with the cost varying according to 
number of daily collections. For instance, the fee for once-a-week collection 
of a three-cubic-yard bin will be increased from the current $85 a month to 
$88. The higher fee includes the cost of recycling the commercial haul. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the increased rates following negotiations with the 
city's trash hauler, Taormina Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Maley said Taormina bills city customers directly on a quarterly basis. The 
city is not involved in the billing process, the city manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barry L. Denes said Villa Park residents generally are pleased with 
Taormina. "The service we get is terrific," he said. "I've only had one 
complaint (from a city resident) in a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Frackelton, who assisted Denes in negotiating with Taormina, 
said he thinks the new rates are equitable. "We feel this is a fair increase at 
this point and time," Frackelton said.BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; PROPERTY TAXES TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Property owners will see a slight increase in their 1994-95 property taxes to 
help pay off a 1980 bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners will be charged an extra $3.82 per $100,000 in the appraised value of 
their property. The tax increase will raise $561,222, according to city 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim voters approved a ballot measure in 1980 to fund $10 million in storm 
drain improvements. The bond has financed storm drain projects on Euclid 
Street, South Street, Vermont Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the increase Tuesday night. MARTIN MILLER

<P>
 A man who went for a midnight ocean swim with a friend apparently drowned in 
the waves near Newport Pier, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a man in his 20s believed to be from Riverside, did not come back 
up after a large wave toppled him and his friend about 12:30 a.m., police Sgt. 
Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's body turned up about four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the man was not released, pending notification of relatives. 
Detectives investigating the case did not identify the friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said the incident did not appear to be the result of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach closes at 10 p.m. and no lifeguards were on duty at the time of the 
drowning, Gonis said. KEN ELLINGWOOD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; HAIRCUT PROCEEDS WILL FIGHT GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Those looking for a cheap haircut can head to the Baker Street West Salon on 
Sunday, where 32 stylists will be lowering ears at $10 a shot from 9 a.m. to 4 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you get hungry while you're waiting for the buzz, tamales will be sold 
by Madres Costa Mesa (Costa Mesa Mothers), a gang-prevention group. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds from the so-called "haircutting marathon" will go to local 
gang-prevention programs in the city.The event's sponsor is Todos Hermanos (All 
Brothers), a Costa Mesa group working to deter gang activity and put a dent in 
gang membership, said Roy Alvarado, a gang counselor for the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the top of the cream, the cream of the crop," Alvarado, a former 
barber, said of the stylists, who will come from all over the area to give the 
trims at 763 W. Baker St. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado, a former gang member, said the money raised will go to Madres Costa 
Mesa and Padres Costa Mesa (Costa Mesa Fathers), another gang-prevention 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has a vested interest in the gang problem and we need more money to 
continue some of the current programs we have in the city," Alvarado said.  
</P>
<P>
 One program is providing walkie-talkies for Madres Costa Mesa, used for making 
sure older gang members don't try to recruit the younger, more vulnerable 
children, Alvarado said. He said the mothers wait at different bus stops for 
their children to get off the school bus, and if any gang activity occurs they 
contact police after notifying each other through the walkie-talkies. TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; TEEN'S BEATING NOT DEEMED HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office said Thursday that the attack 
that hospitalized a black Santa Margarita High School football player will not 
be prosecuted as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault by 25 to 30 males at a Portola Hills party that left 15-year-old 
Ruben Vaughan with a broken nose, broken jaw and stab wounds was motivated by a 
high school rivalry, not race, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Bruce Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we unraveled it all, it wound up that a rival group was looking for 
retaliation and stumbled upon (the victims)," Patterson said. "It just happened 
that one guy was black. It's very unfortunate. They were looking to get someone 
from Santa Margarita (High School)." 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Thomas Jones, 20, of Huntington Beach has been charged with assault with 
a deadly weapon, causing great bodily injury and attempting to influence a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell T. Scarce, 19, of Lake Forest is being prosecuted on charges of 
causing great bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon, using a caustic 
substance -- pepper spray -- and assault on a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a 16-year-old Lake Forest juvenile has been arrested in connection with 
the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Scarce appeared briefly at a pretrial hearing Thursday in Municipal 
Court here. They will be back in court for a preliminary hearing on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision not to include race-related charges angered political activists, 
who said they plan to ask the federal government to pursue the case as a hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montes, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said 
his group will join the 100 Black Men of Orange County to urge federal 
officials to pursue stiffer hate crime charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Meloch said Jones and Scarce had no prior record of 
racially offensive behavior. Although witnesses say that racial slurs were made 
during the assault, Meloch said the epithets couldn't be attributed to the 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarce's attorney, James Sweeney of Mission Viejo, said his client denies 
assaulting Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were too many people there that night to be certain who did what to 
who," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' attorney, Public Defender Loren Mies, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sheriff's Department investigators, Vaughan had been given a 
flyer announcing the Portola Hills party by one of his football teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving there with another teammate, who is white, Vaughan was assaulted and 
later hospitalized for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hospital press conference, the teen-ager's stepfather, Melvin Aaron, said 
the attack had been racially motivated. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; POLICE LEAD CHILDREN ON TRIP TO THE ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Julio Gonzalez, 11, bounced on his toes and shouted to his friends when he 
glimpsed camels in cooling shade at the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my gosh, they're huge! Look at these camels!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio was one of about 60 children from Santa Ana and Costa Mesa who went to 
the zoo Thursday as part of a community outreach program sponsored in part by 
their local police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen on-duty police officers and volunteers accompanied the 
elementary and intermediate school children through the maze of exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual program is designed to offer low-income children a fun trip to 
places they might not otherwise get to go. It also offers them a chance to meet 
police officers in a friendly setting, said Lydia Casamina, a spokeswoman for 
the Santa Ana-based Civic Center Barrio Corp., which also co-sponsored the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio, whose trip to the zoo was his first, said he was impressed not only by 
the camels, polar bears and flamingos he saw but also by the kindness of police 
officers who helped pay forthe trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're nice. I'm proud of them and appreciate it a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Guillen, a police service officer, said, "These kids are realizing that 
we're not only out there arresting people, but we're also their friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said the best part "is seeing their joyful faces. It makes me feel 
great that they're so happy to be here." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL BOARD BALKS AT DRUG PROGRAM COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District board has backed away from a city request 
to pay half the cost of an additional DARE officer for middle school grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The city currently funds two DARE officers who conduct a 17-week course for 
sixth-graders and give presentations to lower grades.But Irvine police say 
recent studies show substance abuse education is critical for middle school 
students before they enter high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's elementary school DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) 
program is paid for with city drug forfeiture funds. But a new middle school 
DARE program would require the Irvine Unified School District to pay $44,000 -- 
half of the annual cost for a third DARE officer. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 28, the Irvine City Council approved funding for the other half of the 
cost to the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members say they support the program, but they are also balking 
at the added expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general feeling is that we probably need to try and do something here, 
but it's a little hard to justify a general fund expenditure," said school 
board President Michael B. Regele, pointing out that this will be the third 
school year without a pay increase for teachers and school district staff. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr., in a letter sent to the school district, said 
funding of an additional DARE officer would establish "a concrete example of 
both government agencies coming together in mutual support for drug education, 
gang prevention and campus safety." 
</P>
<P>
 School district staffers will seek grant funding for the program, but the 
issue will return to the school board if funds are not found.RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY CO-SPONSORS FIRE 'REMEMBRANCE' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to co-sponsor "One Year Later: Remembrance & 
Rebirth" to commemorate the anniversary of last fall's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day event will begin Oct. 27, exactly one year after a fierce blaze 
ripped through the area, damaging or destroying more than 400 homes and 
scorching the once-scenic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of relief agencies and community groups, including the city's Arts 
Commission, had pushed for the remembrance and sought the council's support 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been a disaster like this in Laguna Beach," arts commissioner 
Pat Kollenda said. "This was a city disaster; it should be a city-sponsored 
four days." 
</P>
<P>
 Activities will include music, a memorial service, a "survivors' potluck" and 
a display of fire-related artwork. A planned bonfire was scratched from the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage inflicted by the fire deeply affected the close-knit community, 
where several city leaders lost homes, including Councilman Robert F. Gentry, 
City Manager Kenneth C. Frank, Deputy City Manager Cindy King and Planning 
Commissioner Jeff Powers. 
</P>
<P>
 As further testament to the emotional impact the fire had on the community, 
Councilwoman Lida Lenney, mayor at the time of the fire, fought back tears 
Tuesday night during discussion of the commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really glad you're doing this," she said. "I want to support you with all 
my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 David Horn, whose Mystic Hills home burned, acknowledged that some people 
would rather not be reminded of the fire. Still, he applauded the city's 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's going to handle this differently," Horn said. "I think it's a very 
important milestone to recognize." LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; COUNCIL RACES LIKELY TO START HEATING 
UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The entry of local attorney Carlos Negrete into the November City Council race 
could raise the campaign intensity level, as 10 candidates vie for three open 
seats and a chance to make policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete, 37, and a group of other residents sued the city in 1991, alleging 
misuse of public funds in connection with then-City Manager Stephen B. Julian's 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A bitter nearly three-year series of suits was settled earlier this year, with 
each side agreeing to dismiss all pending litigation and pay their own attorney 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've basically had this city run in the past few years by the good old 
boys," said Negrete, who was the last candidate to enter the race before the 
filing deadline. "I'm running because I think a change is in order." 
</P>
<P>
 With longtime Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer and first-term Councilman Jeff 
Vasquez deciding not to run again, the election will give voters a choice 
between relative newcomers and established political veterans from the Planning 
Commission and downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Jones, 62, is the lone incumbent running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners John Greiner, 56, and Wyatt Hart, 58, and Thomas 
Holsten, 57, who is a partner in a downtown business, have filed nomination 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others candidates are: Serge Kohan, 45, an import/export entrepreneur; Mario 
Pina, 39, a letter carrier; Philipe Delgado Jr., 43, a businessman in Orange; 
David Swerdlin, 51, a photographer, and Steven Dallas, 43, a radiation 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete said he entered the race because the field contains candidates like 
past powerful council members who shared a narrow agenda favoring development. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Hart and Jones, Negrete did not identify any other candidates by 
name. Hausdorfer is considered to be the last of the city's "old-guard" council 
members, who included former mayor Ken Friess. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more established candidates don't believe they didn't fit the 
description of political insider. 
</P>
<P>
 "An insider?" Greiner said. "Definitely not."

EL TORO AIRPORT INITIATIVE STAYS ON BALLOT, JUDGE RULES; COURTS: HE HAS DOUBTS 
ABOUT THE MEASURE BUT SAYS THE SHORTCOMINGS POINTED OUT BY LAKE FOREST ARE NOT 
ENOUGH TO DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON THE ISSUE.

 An Orange County Superior Court judge Thursday refused to invalidate an 
initiative that will allow voters to decide in November if a commercial airport 
should be built at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing arguments from Lake Forest, which sought to kill the initiative, 
and from airport proponents, Judge Donald E. Smallwood acknowledged that he had 
some doubts about the legality of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Most importantly, the judge said, he was not convinced that the airport 
proponents had reconciled the traffic impacts with the county's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Epstein, the lawyer representing the pro-airport group, called the 
Committee for 21,000 Jobs, had contended that highway traffic would not 
increase appreciably if an airport were built and that the county's general 
plan has a mechanism to pay for any necessary road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallwood questioned whether either was true and whether the initiative 
illegally circumvented the need to plan for more intense commercial development 
that would surround an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smallwood said Lake Forest's lawyers had not persuaded him that any 
shortcomings in the initiative were serious enough for him to deprive the 
people of their right to vote on the issue. Higher state courts, he said, 
repeatedly have upheld "the importance of the initiative process" to a 
democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallwood said he had scant time to research the complex issues surrounding 
the initiative because the county registrar of voters was pressing for a 
decision before the November ballot goes to print next week. 
</P>
<P>
 He specifically left open the possibility that Lake Forest could return to 
court to try to repeal the initiative if the voters approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect I will see you again," he told the lawyers afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest City Atty. Jerry M. Patterson said the city probably would not 
appeal the decision and would wait to see the election results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough for a judge to make a ruling that denies the right to vote. We 
knew that," he said. "We knew that we would have the uphill side of the 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said he thought it was important for the city to challenge the 
initiative before the election so that it could not be accused of "sitting on 
our rights."  
</P>
<P>
 He said that while he was disappointed with the judge's decision, he was 
pleased that Smallwood "made the point that there are some concerns. I think we 
laid the foundation for showing the initiative is invalid."

MAN WALKS INTO TRAFFIC, IS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim man was killed Wednesday night after he walked into traffic on 
southbound Beach Boulevard and was struck by a woman driving a sports car, a 
spokesman with the Orange County Sheriff's Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovidio Fajardo, 42, died at the scene about 10 p.m., sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini 
said. A team of investigators attended Fajardo's autopsy Thursday in an effort 
to reconstruct what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it appears to be the pedestrian's fault," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was treated at a hospital for facial injuries and released, Martini 
said.

$5-MILLION STATE JUDGMENT IN MARINE PILOTS' DEATH UPHELD; COURTS: APPEAL PANEL 
IN SANTA ANA AGREES THAT GIANT AIRCRAFT ENGINE MAKER PRATT & WHITNEY WAS AT 
FAULT IN THE 1986 HELICOPTER CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has upheld a nearly $5-million judgment against the 
world's largest aircraft engine manufacturer, which was sued by the families of 
two Marine Corps pilots who died in a 1986 helicopter crash. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unanimous opinion issued Wednesday, the 4th District Court of Appeal 
ruled that Pratt & Whitney of Canada should pay the award, plus interest, to 
the families of Maj. Kenneth D. Johnson, 34, of Fallbrook and 1st Lt. Thomas R. 
Riggs, 26, of La Canada-Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The two servicemen, who were based at Camp Pendleton and were part of the 3rd 
Marine Aircraft Wing at El Toro, were killed Nov. 14, 1986 when their AH-1T 
Cobra crashed during a training flight and caught fire near the Cleveland 
National Forest in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots' families sued Pratt & Whitney, which made the engine for the 
aircraft, alleging that the company had installed a defective fuel nozzle in 
the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Brian J. Panish, who represented the Johnson and Riggs families, said 
Thursday his clients were pleased that the justices upheld the award, but still 
are concerned that the military has other helicopters with defective Pratt & 
Whitney parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that there are a lot of others out there right now," Panish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Pratt & Whitney did not return calls to their offices Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial judge had determined that Pratt & Whitney's attorneys had 
stonewalled the families' attorney and withheld pertinent documentation as the 
case was being prepared for trial, according to the appellate court opinion. 
The company ignored at least 50 court orders, the justices noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Orange County Superior Court Judge Jack K. Mandel ruled without a 
trial that the company was responsible for the fatal crash. He ordered that a 
trial be held solely to determine the monetary damages suffered by families of 
the dead Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Mandel said the defense contractor knew of the defect and 
"intentionally concealed the information from the United States military." 
Following a weeklong trial, the jury awarded the families a total of $4.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Pratt & Whitney appealed the award and the judge's decision, 
claiming both were legally flawed. But the three-justice panel rejected their 
arguments and ruled that both the award and Mandel's decision were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the award was upheld, state law requires that Pratt & Whitney pay 
prejudgment interest on an earlier settlement offer and post-judgment interest 
on the judgment, which was awarded Aug. 11, 1992. The total award is currently 
near $8 million, attorneys said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; SILENCE ISN'T ALWAYS GOLDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority wisely agreed this week not to fire 
bus drivers for first infractions of failing to call out stops on a route. The 
outcome reflected needed communication between the authority and the union. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between drivers and the transit agency arose after several blind 
riders complained that drivers had failed to announce stops. Unable to drive 
and faced with sprawling geography that usually rules out walking, the blind 
are especially dependent on public transportation. If bus drivers fail to call 
out upcoming stops, the blind can easily become lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA rightly has told its drivers for three years that the law requires 
the enunciation of bus stops. Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities 
Act in 1990 to extend the protection of civil rights laws to the disabled.  
</P>
<P>
 The act requires local transportation agencies to make it easier for the 
disabled to use mass transit, whether getting on or off buses in a wheelchair 
or being told when a transfer point is approaching. OCTA directors recently 
voted to spend $50,000 to help make the county's bus stops fully accessible to 
the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers union said it supported the disabilities law, but the authority 
claimed that random inspections found that many drivers failed to announce 
major bus stops. Two drivers were threatened with dismissal and two dozen 
others faced lesser discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the union and management have agreed to abide by the law, but they 
apparently had communication problems, which the OCTA made progress toward 
fixing this week. The agreement called for drivers to get warning letters for a 
first offense but face firing for a second misstep within a year. That is 
better than the earlier sanctions; one violation should not cost someone a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus drivers often have their hands full fighting their way through traffic and 
keeping an eye on signal lights. But when they can, they should assist all 
riders, disabled or not. That help personalizes the service and makes for a 
more enjoyable ride. To those unfamiliar with a route, street announcements are 
a public service; to the blind, they are a necessity. Bus drivers must remember 
to speak up.

HOME SOLICITING HOURS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ordinance extending to 10 p.m. the hours that door-to-door solicitors can 
work was tentatively approved by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In its approval of the first reading of the law, the City Council cited a U.S. 
Supreme Court decision establishing 10 p.m. as a reasonable cutoff time for 
residential solicitors and fund-raisers.A private organization soliciting funds 
for the Sierra Club had complained to city officials about the 8 p.m. deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always taught in my home that it was inconsiderate to call people after 
8:30 at night," Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings said. "And you didn't call 
your relatives after 9. I don't want people knocking on my door at night." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hastings and her council colleagues unanimously gave preliminary approval 
to the ordinance after City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said the city could be 
challenged in court for restricting solicitation hours earlier than 10 p.m. 
"Basically, the council's hands are tied on this," Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Brown asked the city manager if the prohibition on solicitation 
in the gated community of Leisure World could also be vulnerable to a court 
challenge. But City Atty. Quinn Barrow said gated communities are allowed to 
ban door-to-door solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrow said residents can fend off late-night door-knockers by posting a "no 
solicitors" sign.

2 HISTORIC BUFFALO RANCH BUILDINGS WILL BE MOVED TO COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two structures from the historic Buffalo Ranch will be relocated to the Orange 
County Fairgrounds in November -- and everything is free of charge, a 
spokeswoman for the fair said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair's board of directors Thursday agreed to accept a donation of the 
buildings by the Irvine Co., which owns the ranch, to move the two structures 
to the fairground, fair spokeswoman Jill Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll fit in with the motif of the fairgrounds perfectly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two structures -- one that resembles a silo, the other a two-story barn -- 
will be used by the fair for public meetings, educational classes and to 
provide additional office space, a much-needed commodity these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Ranch, situated near Ford Road and MacArthur Boulevard, is dotted 
with 15 structures, all of them built in the 1960s by well-known architect 
William Pereira, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. has development plans for the ranch, which is zoned for retail 
or residential use. Instead of demolishing the buildings, the company would 
like to preserve them by relocating them to the fairgrounds, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen to the remainder of the buildings is not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Davis, vice president of land development for Irvine Community Builders, a 
division of the Irvine Co., could not be reached for comment. Michelle Sweet, a 
communications consultant for the Irvine Co., said the company will not build 
anything on the site for at least two years -- and must first get permission 
from the city of Irvine.

EX-SENATOR CARPENTER'S EXTRADITION IS ON AGAIN; COURTS: JUDGE IN COSTA RICA 
ORDERS RETURN OF PAUL CARPENTER TO THE UNITED STATES. THE EX-LEGISLATOR HAD 
FLED BEFORE HE COULD BE JAILED ON FEDERAL POLITICAL CORRUPTION CONVICTIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter's on-again, off-again extradition from Costa 
Rica was on again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, who fled the United States before he could be jailed on federal 
political corruption convictions, was ordered extradited by a Costa Rican 
judge, U.S. Atty.Charles Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge originally ordered Carpenter extradited in May. But in July, a Costa 
Rican appellate court overturned that order on procedural grounds and ordered 
additional review of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the lower court confirmed its earlier decision that Carpenter 
should be extradited on the mail fraud and money laundering charges of which he 
was convicted, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter is to remain in a Costa Rican jail until he is returned to the 
United States, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former senator arrived in San Jose, Costa Rica, last February. He said he 
was suffering from cancer and did not want to enter prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, 66, was convicted of conspiracy, mail fraud, obstruction of 
justice, racketeering and extortion in two trials arising from an FBI sting 
operation at the state Capitol in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, a Democrat from Cypress, left the state Senate in 1987. He was 
convicted in 1990 of shaking down a businessman, who turned out to be an 
undercover FBI agent, for $20,000 in campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
 That conviction was overturned on appeal, but he was convicted last year of 
serving as a middleman in a scheme to funnel bribes to another lawmaker. 
Carpenter was scheduled to be sentenced for that crime when he fled the 
country.

MIKE PENNER: KNOX'S PLAN COMING TOGETHER PERFECTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan will be laughing so hard, he'll be crying. He'll be doubled over in 
his leather chair, wiping the lenses of his fogged-up glasses with a 
handkerchief. The rest of the Arizona Cardinal coaching staff will be on the 
floor, giggling uncontrollably, holding their aching sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knox will have them right where he wants them. 
</P>
<P>
 So you thought the Rams' 24-6 loss Thursday night to the previously 0-4 San 
Diego Chargers was a joke? So will Buddy, once he gets a load of the videotape. 
So did the 49,283 ticket holders at Jack Murphy Stadium who watched the home 
team, probably the fourth-best team in the AFC West, impersonate the Dallas 
Cowboys for an evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is to look at the small picture and the small picture only. 
</P>
<P>
 And what is Knox if not the consummate big-picture man? 
</P>
<P>
 It is brilliant, really. Possibly the deke of this NFL season and many more 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
 You lose eight consecutive exhibition games, dating back to mid-August 1992, 
around the closing ceremonies of the last summer Olympics, and you play an 
opponent with nearly as many problems as you -- namely, no victories in 1994, 
no wide receivers and few people capable of stopping opposing ballcarriers 
before they're dancing in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 So you keep Jerome Bettis, your most valuable offensive player, on the bench 
all night. 
</P>
<P>
 And you keep Flipper Anderson, your best (only?) deep pass-catching threat, on 
the bench all night. 
</P>
<P>
 And you allow your brittle-kneed new quarterback, Chris Miller, to spend an 
entire half scrambling for his life behind a jury-rigged offensive line 
featuring New York Giant castoff Clarence Jones at left tackle/backside 
protector. 
</P>
<P>
 And you give Todd Lyght and Steve Israel serious playing time at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 Result: You score two field goals, you lose by 18 points, you conclude your 
second consecutive 0-4 exhibition season and the Cardinals swagger into Anaheim 
Stadium a week from Sunday completely unprepared for the devious trap Knox has 
laid for them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a masterstroke, I'm telling you. 
</P>
<P>
 Notice how thick Knox laid it on post-rout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we were awful," were his opening words to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the only good thing I can say on our part was the goal-line stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just aren't in sync at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way we can commit those kinds of mistakes and win . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned, big time. I hope (the players) are concerned. They better be." 
</P>
<P>
 And why hadn't Knox played Bettis and Anderson in his team's final tuneup, 
with Miller still trying to learn a new system and become accustomed to new 
teammates? On a team seemingly groping blindly for cohesion and confidence at 
this point, why not put your first-team tailback and wide receiver on the field 
at the same time with your first-team quarterback -- with a highly uncertain 
defensive unit on the other side of the football? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said he didn't want Bettis or Anderson getting hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not, however, say anything about the Rams' opening-day gate. 
</P>
<P>
 (Attention fans, passers-by and rotisserie geeks bored out of your minds: Many 
prime seats still available!) 
</P>
<P>
 Save The Rams may not be an idea with much of a future, but Thursday night, 
the Save The Chargers program picked up a considerable head of steam. Such 
heroes. Gale Gilbert, formerly the third-string quarterback in Buffalo, having 
taken his last regular-season NFL snap in 1990, completing 6 of 11 passes for 
73 yards, including a touchdown strike to one Al Pununu, who celebrated the 
occasion by holding the football to his mouth, pretending it was an ice-cold 
mug of beer and taking a long pull on it. 
</P>
<P>
 A night against the Rams -- the pause that always refreshes. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the Rams enter Knox's third season, and maybe their last season in 
Orange County, with no momentum, not much of a clue and hammer marks from four 
straight pounding by the Packers, the Patriots, the Raiders and the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, they look like Tampa Bay West. And the Cardinals? Here they come 
next Sunday, chewing on toothpicks and whistling and listening to portable CD 
players, counting the empty seats and staring at the scoreboard, wondering what 
will look more attractive -- 35-10 or 42-10? 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when Knox finally reveals what he's been hiding all this time up 
his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>

THIS TIME, DUNLAP STOPS SPRINGFIELD; LITTLE LEAGUE: PITCHER THROWS ONE-HITTER 
AS NORTHRIDGE WINS, 3-0, TO REACH CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In a game a teammate said he was born to pitch, Nathaniel Dunlap bore down, 
throwing a one-hitter that gave Northridge a 3-0 victory over Springfield, Va., 
and the U.S. Little League baseball championship Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-run homer by Spencer Gordon in the first inning gave Dunlap a cushion, 
and the 5-foot-11 right-hander carried a no-hitter into the sixth and final 
inning before settling for a one-hit shutout in front of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (20-1, 3-1 in Series play) will be the third consecutive team from 
Southern California to represent the United States in the World Series 
championship game. Long Beach is two-time World Series champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Maracaibo, Venezuela, defeated Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 10-1, to win the 
international championship and will play Northridge on Saturday at 12:40 p.m. 
PDT. Maracaibo is 4-0 in Series play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal all along was to win the U.S. title, and that is accomplished," said 
Larry Baca, Northridge's manager. "I am gratified we are playing Saturday and 
it will be fun, but it is icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap's effort was Northridge's second consecutive one-hit shutout over 
Springfield. Justin Gentile had held the South Region champions hitless after 
the first batter singled in a 2-0 victory Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the most important game of Nathaniel's life," Gentile said. 
"Everybody tells him he was born to pitch, and he was born to pitch this game 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Weishar hit a sharp single to right field with one out in the sixth, 
ending a hitless streak of 11 1/3 innings against Northridge pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Miller followed Weishar with a ground ball to shortstop Matt Fisher that 
hit the seam between the grass and dirt and bounced off his chest for an error, 
bringing the tying run to the plate. However, Dunlap struck out Pat Malatino 
and Ethan Lare -- Springfield's best hitter -- to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Ethan to look for breaking balls, and they out-foxed us by throwing 
the heater," said George Lare, Springfield's coach and Ethan's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would Dunlap have thrown anything else? 
</P>
<P>
 Standing 46 feet from home plate, he throws a 74-m.p.h. fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "You end a game with a fastball, and you end it with a strikeout," Dunlap 
said. "You blow it past him. That's the way it's supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Springfield's only other baserunners came on hit batsmen in the second and 
fifth innings. Dunlap struck out 10 and walked none. He has 23 strikeouts and 
one walk in 12 innings of Series play. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, no Northridge batters struck out against Springfield pitchers Mike 
Fratoe and Miller. Gentile doubled twice, Cassel singled twice and Gregg Wallis 
doubled.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a chance to run up the score after the first inning, but 
they played good defense," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that Gordon's home run provided the game's only offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge cleanup hitter had been one for nine in the Series before the 
homer, and he had made the final out with two runners on base in a 4-2 loss to 
Brooklyn Center, Minn., on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After that game, Gordon was devastated, telling his parents that he was 
responsible for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is as redeemed as a kid could ever be," said Eric Gordon, Spencer's 
father. Little League Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Tuber will pitch for Northridge against Maracaibo. Tuber, a 5-9 
right-hander, defeated Middleboro, Mass., on Tuesday, 6-4, striking out 13. He 
was perhaps Northridge's most valuable player in last week's Western Regional 
tournament, winning three games, including the final. Justin Gentile will be 
available in relief, but Nathaniel Dunlap will be ineligible to pitch. Little 
League tournament rules stipulate that a pitcher who throws more than one 
inning in a game cannot pitch in the team's next game. 
</P>
<P>
 Maracaibo probably will start Cesar Hidalgo, who struck out 15 in a 4-1, 
two-hit victory over Taiwan on Tuesday. Hidalgo was clocked by a radar gun at 
74 m.p.h.

RECESS IS CALLED AS TALKS STAGNATE; BASEBALL: FEDERAL MEDIATORS RECOMMEND BREAK 
AFTER OWNERS AND UNION LEADERS BRING NOTHING NEW TO THE TABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Do baseball's collective bargaining negotiations need a mediator or mortician? 
</P>
<P>
 The situation wasn't entirely clear Thursday, when federal mediators 
recommended a recess only a day and a half after the talks had resumed for the 
first time since the players' strike began Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there may now be some meaningful activity behind the scenes, sources 
said formal negotiations are unlikely to resume before Tuesday or Wednesday, 
possibly in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no movement and no indication of movement," Donald Fehr, the 
union's executive director, said as the recess began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite true. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed that many of the 12 owners and club executives who had joined the 
process on Wednesday couldn't wait to get moving. 
</P>
<P>
 They had previously scheduled flights to catch, as did some of the 14 players, 
down from the 21 of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler, the Dodgers' assistant player representative, didn't attend 
Thursday's session because of a meeting with his financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Curt Schilling, the Philadelphia Phillies' pitcher, was angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm upset," he said. "I want to play baseball. A lot of us were willing to 
stay as many hours as it took, but we had the feeling that a lot of the owners 
wanted to leave and there was just no movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just my opinion, but I don't think there's going to be anymore baseball 
played this season." 
</P>
<P>
 The union, of course, has thought that was the owners' agenda all along, 
forcing the players to strike by refusing to waive their right to ultimately 
declare an impasse and unilaterally impose their salary-cap system. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time Thursday, Fehr agreed publicly with two oft-mentioned 
premises: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The owners agreed to mediation only as a demonstration of good-faith 
bargaining in the event the union claims otherwise in protesting an impasse 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although knowing the union will never accept it, the owners have refused to 
take the salary cap off the table because, in an impasse situation, labor law 
requires management to implement its last formal offer, and the cap is 
paramount to their new system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look on it as evidence they don't want to reach agreement," Fehr said of 
the owners' refusal to budge on the cap because of the impasse option. "As I 
see it, the clubs are exactly where they planned to be." 
</P>
<P>
 With the sides polarized, John Calhoun Wells, national director of the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service, said he recommended a recess after about 
two hours of talks Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would stay in contact with both sides and hoped they could continue 
deliberations in smaller groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The union was willing to stay at it Thursday, but the owners jumped at the 
recess opportunity, Fehr said. Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, 
said both sides agreed to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The size of the room never determines the success of a negotiation," Ravitch 
said, meaning breakthroughs are more likely in a quieter and less congested 
situation. Owners and players first had to consult a seating chart before 
bargaining began on Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lawyers agreed that something positive could emerge from an ongoing 
dialogue in a fireside format, none were scheduled as of Thursday night, and 
Fehr said the recess could be a long one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not at a point where people walked out in a huff, but clearly we had 
nothing substantive to talk about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their response to everything we say is, 'So, are you ready to give us a 
salary cap?' I mean, we knew going in that these meetings would mostly produce 
a cheering section for Dick and the cap, and that's mostly what it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch continued to insist that there will be no sign-off on the impasse 
option because the owners believe they can't afford to play next season under 
the old rules, and that there will be no progress in these negotiations until 
the issue of cost is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners are clearly unanimous on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimity is holding, but several high-revenue clubs remain frustrated by 
their colleagues' refusal to compromise on the cap and their inability to do 
anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
 A settlement must by approved by 21 of the 28 clubs, meaning the bigger 
markets are being held hostage by the smaller markets as time marches on. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Day is dead, and the rest of the season may follow. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 14 of the strike, Boston Red Sox CEO John Harrington said no deadline 
has been set for determining the fate of postseason play, but it's clearly 
being thought about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have several weeks before hitting the hard wall, but the pressure 
builds up the closer we get to mid-September," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that it was unlikely that the postseason could be delayed, leading to 
a possible November World Series played at a neutral site because of weather or 
stadium commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Milwaukee, acting commissioner Bud Selig said he wasn't discouraged 
by the recess. He credited the mediators with good judgment in suggesting an 
impromptu approach for a time, saying the two days of discussion underscored 
his contention that there is unanimity on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that should be obvious now," he said. "We have to get past that 
debate and settle the real issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 * NHL TALKS TOUGH 
</P>
<P>
 If there is no progress soon in stalled collective bargaining talks, 
commissioner says training camps might not open. C13

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; BAD TIMING; ROSE BOWL STILL HAUNTS 
UCLA'S COOK, BUT HE ENTERS SEASON WITH CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If he had it to do over again, he would throw the ball into a sousaphone in 
the UCLA band. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 238 days since the final play of the Rose Bowl game, Wayne Cook has 
thought about it at least 238 times. And wished he could do it again, 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, it gets clearer, and maybe more frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 First and 10 on the Wisconsin 18, with 15 seconds to play, no timeouts and the 
clock running. Cook takes the snap and there is a moment of indecision before 
he starts to 
</P>
<P>
 run, picking up three yards before being hauled down by Mike Thompson. Five, 
four, three, two, one. Wisconsin 21, UCLA 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was going to clock it, which means throw the ball into the ground to 
stop the clock," he said. "On our clock routes, normally receivers run 
five-yard outs. But when we are inside the 20, the outs go to fades." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are two steps inside the 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm still thinking clock, outs," Cook said. "So I go up to the line of 
scrimmage -- and this is all going through my head. Kevin Jordan ran the right 
route, but when he didn't do what I thought he was going to do, it was like, 
'Whoa, what just happened?' Well, he ran a fade and that's what he was supposed 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just lost track of where we were on the field, I guess. So I'm trying to 
make a smart play and get us closer to scoring, and it ended up being a 
bonehead play because I should have just thrown it over his head and out of 
bounds. . . . I even know the play I wanted to run next, the perfect play. I 
wanted to roll right and have J.J. (Stokes) go inside and then back out. Then I 
could throw the ball back across the field and he could go up and get it. 
You've got 15 yards to go, so why not go to your big guy? I think a lot about 
stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that there's time to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you have to think about this stuff quickly, because you don't have much 
time. Then when something happens you don't expect, you just go on instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the quarterback instinctively becoming a football player and it ended a 
season that had otherwise gone so right. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, he was in competition for a job, a battered quarterback with a 
surgically repaired knee, trying to prove he was better than Ryan Fien and Rob 
Walker. He got the No. 1 job three days before the opening game, getting the 
chance to play his first complete football game since his senior season at 
Newbury Park High, largely because he had more time in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the one reason he didn't want to hear. He wanted the job because he had 
earned it through his play. He has kept it for just that reason. 
</P>
<P>
 By midseason, when UCLA was in the middle of a seven-game winning streak, 
Coach Terry Donahue was giving Cook credit for the Bruins' success. This, after 
trying to shelter him from blame for an 0-2 start, one of the losses having 
ended in Cook's throwing an interception against California. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a case of all's well ending well, because it didn't end all that 
well. But it has ended with Cook coming back to school as the first returning 
UCLA quarterback starter since Tommy Maddox took his game to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a new Cook, bigger at 218 pounds and with a new outlook, no longer having 
to prove himself after a season in which he completed 165 of 297 passes for 
2,067 yards and 18 touchdowns. Twice he threw four touchdown passes in a game. 
Five touchdowns came from 35 or more yards out. He threw only four 
interceptions, only three during the regular season, a Pacific 10 record. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a more confident Cook, who has a season of success on his resume, one in 
which he led UCLA to the Pacific 10 championship after the Bruins were picked 
by some to finish as low as sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he reminds, he's coming back after a mostly injury-free season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had that kidney problem, but that wasn't because I was fragile," he said. 
"That was because I got killed. I took the kind of shot that would have hurt 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The shot was delivered in the first quarter against Washington State when 
DeWayne Patterson jumped off-side and leveled Cook, who came back, tried to 
play and then went to a hospital. He could not play the next week, against 
Arizona State, which defeated the Bruins, 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
 That tells you how important Cook is to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took his team to the Rose Bowl," said offensive coordinator Bob Toledo, 
who replaced Homer Smith in the job after last season. "When he wasn't in 
there, the Bruins got beat." 
</P>
<P>
 When Toledo took the job in February, one of the first things he did was watch 
film of Cook to see what kind of raw material he was working with. He saw 
Cook's two fumbles in the Rose Bowl and said he needed to work on ball 
protection. He saw Cook get sacked and said he needed to change his footwork. 
He saw Cook's 55% completion rate and said that needed improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he saw Cook in spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was better than I thought," Toledo said. "When I saw him on the field, he 
was better than when I saw him in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things you don't see on film, like his character, his charisma, the 
way the kids rally around him. They have confidence in him and his leadership 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
 The other things could be fixed but you can't teach leadership. When a couple 
of defensive players went on a hair-cutting rampage during preseason practice, 
they started on the freshmen, then went to Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'If you get yours cut, others will follow,' " said Cook, who bowed 
to solidarity -- and overwhelming numbers -- and ended up with a crew cut. And 
others followed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an intangible that takes Cook beyond mere numbers. Stardom comes from 
statistics. Sometimes victories don't. 
</P>
<P>
 For reference, consult your favorite college football preseason magazine. 
Nearly all of the Pac-10 starting quarterbacks are back, and seemingly without 
exception a pecking order is listed. There are Rob Johnson at USC, Steve 
Stenstrom at Stanford, Danny O'Neil at Oregon and. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They say 'solid returning quarterback Wayne Cook,' " Cook said. "Solid. 
Little things like that get under my skin. . . . I don't want to be just solid, 
and I don't think people here think that way. It's just the way some people put 
it. They'll be positive, but they'll knock you by saying you're average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those guys are great quarterbacks. They throw the ball well. But head 
to head, what happened? My team won. I beat Stenstrom. I beat Johnson. I'm not 
saying I'm a better quarterback, but I am saying I can compete with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up taking an offense that was much more balanced than theirs were -- 
they all threw the ball more than I did, we ran the ball a lot more -- and we 
beat those teams. People look at stats first, and that's obviously a lot, but 
you've got to look at other areas too. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, look at my last year's stats, at the touchdown-interception ratio (18 to 
four) and all that . . . and my offense scored the highest number of points per 
game (32, with California's 31.2 next and no other team's over 26.7), that's 
how I compare to those guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "They threw for more than 3,000 yards, but I basically missed two games. If I 
had played those two, I would have probably thrown 200-250 yards in each (which 
would have brought him close to 2,500)." 
</P>
<P>
 Under his stewardship, receiver J.J. Stokes made All-American and Kevin Jordan 
established himself with 45 catches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say anybody could be a success with Stokes as a receiver," Cook 
said. "I think that's wrong. He's great. He really is. I think he's the best 
player in the country, but I had another receiver (Jordan) who was a sophomore 
All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere down the line, you've got to look at me and say I'm throwing the 
ball and hitting the guys in the hands, or else they're not going to catch it. 
There has never been a great receiver that did not have a good quarterback. And 
it works the other way. There haven't been any great quarterbacks who haven't 
had great receivers. Montana had (Jerry) Rice and (John) Taylor. He's still the 
best quarterback who ever played the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line, Cook is the returning quarterback of the Pac-10 champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I played in the Rose Bowl," he reminds. 
</P>
<P>
 And threw 43 passes, completing 28 for 288 yards and a touchdown against 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 The quest is for a repeat performance or better. Cook is a senior but in only 
his second season as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the press guide, at quarterbacks in their second season, and it 
seemed like they all got 5% better in passing completion and stuff like that. I 
want to get up to 60 or 65% completions. I want to throw for more yards. Maybe 
25 touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
 It's music to Toledo's ears. He's bringing the short-passing game to the UCLA 
offense, with emphasis on throwing to the backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think his completion rate was as good as it can be," Toledo said. "I 
want him in the 60% range. And we've got some big-play guys, so we're going to 
throw the ball enough so it's possible that he can throw for 3,000 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 No one has done it at UCLA, where Troy Aikman's 2,771 yards -- and 24 
touchdown passes -- in 1988 are school records.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA will still seek offensive balance. Donahue still wants Cook handing the 
ball to a running back as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cook and Toledo are still trying to work out their own relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be interesting, seeing how the play-calling goes," Cook said. 
"But I look at his coming here as a positive thing. I'm learning from him. I 
was bummed when Coach Smith left because I think he made me into a quarterback. 
But now I'm getting a new coach, some new ideas and I think that might be 
better for me in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 His UCLA career has one more season to run. Then it's on to other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NFL used to be a dream for me, but it seems more real now," Cook said. 
"You know what's interesting? I used to watch a preseason game, and after the 
first two quarters, I didn't want to watch anymore because it was boring. I 
didn't know any of the players. Now I've played against a lot of the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched Atlanta-San Diego, and Vaughn Parker (who finished his UCLA career 
in 1993) was playing almost the whole game. And Perry Klein played quarterback 
for Atlanta. I played against him when we were younger. And he's throwing 
touchdown passes to Bert Emanuel (a former UCLA quarterback who transferred to 
Rice). I'm saying, 'I'm as good as Perry Klein, and he's out there looking 
pretty good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's another quarterback comparison. He can't escape it. Even in his own mind.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; THE ARMS RACE; A POCKETFUL OF 
QUARTERBACKS COULD THROW PAC-10 RECORDS OUT THE WINDOW THIS SEASON 
</P>

 Last year, this Pacific 10-headed quarterback averaged 6 feet 2.7 inches, 
202.8 pounds and passed for 20,688 yards and 153 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The collective conference beast might have sent even more defensive 
coordinators screaming into the night had it not been for those wishbones at 
Oregon State, which passed only in states of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 Quarterback Man gobbled up efficiency marks and yardage records as it 
stalked the hallowed footprints left by the likes of John Elway and Dan Fouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was no place for the honors-sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Oregon quarterback who passed for 300 yards or more in a 
game six times, threw for 3,224 yards and 22 touchdowns? 
</P>
<P>
 Folks, this was your all-conference honorable mention . 
</P>
<P>
 The USC quarterback who is bidding to become the first non-running back to win 
a Heisman Trophy at Tailback U? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Stanford kid once chased him to wide receiver when they were high 
school teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The California quarterback, a face in this crowd, may some day be playing in a 
Super Bowl near you. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA quarterback threw four interceptions. All year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona quarterback, despite his numbers, has to take a number for the 
purposes of this examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback at Arizona State, a sophomore, may eventually be better than 
all his elders. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news for defenses is that eight of the 10 conference starters have 
returned to wreak further havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare, no doubt," Cal defensive coordinator Artie Gigantino said. 
"The problem is a quarterback, with his arm, can beat you. You can stop a great 
running back. But when a quarterback gets hot, he can kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports information directors up and down the coast are tripping over their 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Rob Johnson, most experts agree, leads the Pac-10 pack. The Trojans 
wasted no time in touting Johnson on the media cover as "Heisman Candidate." Of 
course, Heisman hype and pro potential are different animals when it comes to 
quarterbacks (see Gino Torretta, Charlie Ward, Ty Detmer, et al.). 
</P>
<P>
 So, while Johnson may be all the rave with the NFL, Stanford's Steve Stenstrom 
has the numbers and certainly the right publicity director, Coach Bill Walsh, 
passing out leaflets in the Heisman marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already ahead of 70% of the NFL quarterbacks in terms of throwing to 
alternative receivers," the respected Walsh bellowed about Stenstrom for the 
preseason publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Bay, Cal's Dave Barr cranks up for his senior season having set the 
conference record last year for passing efficiency with a mark of 164.5 -- 
10th-best in NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he can hardly get a Heisman word in edgewise in a conference that already 
includes Johnson, Stenstrom and UCLA receiver J.J. Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr said he doesn't mind the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't really care less who's out there," he said. "It's not going to be 
a battle of numbers. We all have our own goals. Anyway, the numbers don't tell 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The logjam figures to cause more headaches for conferences SIDs, some of whom 
are trying to get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all going to be beating up on each other," Stanford SID Gary Migdol 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all going to have great years. Someone will rise to the top. It will 
likely depend on how the team is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, Stenstrom and Barr make up the prime-time short list, but the Pac-10 
quarterback well may run six or seven deep. Taking aim behind the big guns are 
Danny O'Neil of Oregon, Wayne Cook of UCLA, Dan White of Arizona, Jake Plummer 
of Arizona State and perhaps Damon Huard of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have two quarterbacks that are Heisman candidates (Stenstrom and 
Johnson), everybody else is going to be overshadowed," acknowledged O'Neil of 
Oregon. "Look at what Cook did. He was the quarterback who took his team to the 
Rose Bowl, he's returning, and he's barely mentioned. That's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The draftniks already are touting the pro potential of Plummer, the ASU 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the top three quarterbacks in the country right now," Mel Kiper 
Jr. contends. "He has a chance to be as good as any quarterback in the Pac-10 
since Elway." 
</P>
<P>
 So, this is the best returning group of Pac-10 quarterbacks ever? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. The Class of 1988 still holds the distinction with its group of 
Troy Aikman, UCLA; Rodney Peete, USC; Bill Musgrave, Oregon; Timm Rosenbach, 
Washington State; Troy Taylor, Cal; Erik Wilhelm, Oregon State, and Cary 
Conklin, Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 All seven were NFL draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 cast, at least for now, does not measure up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to put them in order now, where I thought they'd fall (in the 
draft), I'd go Johnson, Stenstrom, Barr and O'Neil," said John Becker, the 
Rams' director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, aren't sold on Stenstrom's arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Walsh can say all he wants about how great a quarterback Steve Stenstrom 
is," Kiper said. "But Steve Stenstrom is not going to carry a great grade 
heading into the NFL draft. Now, if (Walsh) had Rob Johnson and was saying 
those things about him, it would carry more weight, because Rob Johnson can 
play for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In order of preseason clout, here's a look at the quarterbacks of the Pac-10: 
ROB JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, USC 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6 feet 4, 220 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 68.6% of his passes for 3,630 yards, with 29 
touchdowns and six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: He's the real deal, a probable first-round NFL pick. The loss of 
Johnnie Morton, the All-American receiver, might cut into his numbers a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kiper: "The best of the group -- arm, size, everything. Has added about 10 
pounds and is bigger physically. STEVE STENSTROM 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Stanford 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6-3, 205. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 65% of passes for 3,627 yards, with 27 touchdowns 
and 14 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: No doubt, a great college quarterback who benefits from playing in 
Walsh's system. Stenstrom is in position to break all six school passing 
records, including Elway's marks for yardage and touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Note: Johnson and Stenstrom were teammates at El Toro High in south Orange 
County. As a junior, Johnson was moved to wide receiver to allow the senior, 
Stenstrom, to play quarterback. DAVE BARR 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, California 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6-4, 205. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 68% of his passes for 2,885 yards, with 24 
touchdowns and 12 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: A shoulder injury in October slowed him considerably, but in his 
final three games Barr threw for 910 yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kiper: "He's a kid who's got so much better than he was in his first year. I 
didn't think he was much of a prospect then. But in terms of everything it 
takes to be an NFL quarterback, he seems to fit the physical mold." DANNY 
O'NEIL 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Oregon 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6-2, 178. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 61.9% of his passes for 3,224 yards, with 22 
touchdowns and 15 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: Plays for a losing team and is flat-out skinny, but he continues 
to pile up the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I'm just hoping to put up the wins," O'Neil said. "I've put up the 
numbers and it doesn't really matter. I found out the hard way last year. I put 
up the numbers but didn't put up the victories." 
</P>
<P>
 * Kiper: "Good college quarterback, gritty kid, hangs in there, but in terms 
of physical ability, doesn't have what I'm looking for as far as the NFL." JAKE 
PLUMMER 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore, Arizona State 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6-2, 189. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 51.3% of his passes for 1,650 yards, with nine 
touchdowns and seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: Probably the best true freshman quarterback in the country last 
year. Should rank as best sophomore in 1994. Has a chance to be tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kiper: "He played last year with a team that was not super strong, took some 
hits, learned the hard way and got better each week." WAYNE COOK 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6-4, 215. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 55.6% of his passes for 2,067 yards, with 18 
touchdowns and four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: Bruins won eight of the 11 games Cook started. Of course, Cook had 
a pretty good target in the wide receiver Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kiper: "A competent college quarterback with very limited pro potential." 
DAN WHITE 
</P>
<P>
 Junior, Arizona 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6-5, 215. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 49.6% of his passes for 1,548 yards, with 13 
touchdowns and nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: Completed an erratic season with a three-touchdown, 209-yard 
passing game against Arizona State and added two touchdown passes in Arizona's 
rout of Miami in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kiper: "He's a big kid, who's improved a little bit at the college level, 
but I don't see him as a pro prospect." DAMON HUARD 
</P>
<P>
 Junior, Washington 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6-4, 215. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 58.9% of his passes for 1,282 yards, with nine 
touchdowns and 10 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: An up-and-down player with some potential, Huard won the starting 
job outright this season from Eric Bjornson, who has moved back to wide 
receiver. Huard may be hurt by undistinguished receiving corps, but should 
benefit from arrival of Bill Diedrick, the new offensive coordinator. CHAD 
DAVIS 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore, Washington State 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 6-2, 199. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Red-shirted after transferring from Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: Last year's starter, Chad DeGrenier, returns as a backup, having 
been ousted by Davis in the spring. Davis is green as they come, having not yet 
thrown a regular-season pass at the collegiate level. The Cougars are miles 
from the days of Drew Bledsoe and Timm Rosenbach. DON SHANKLIN 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore, Oregon State 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 5-11, 194. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 statistics: Completed 76.5% of his passes -- 13 of 17 -- for 90 yards, 
with no touchdowns or interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments: It's almost unfair to include OSU quarterbacks in this mix, since 
the team runs a wishbone offense and rarely passes. Shanklin regained the 
starting job from Rahim Muhammad, who started the last six games after Shanklin 
was injured. Strength in Numbers 
</P>

 The Pacific 10 Conference is no place for aspiring quarterbacks, as each of 
member of this season's class has experience as a starter. A look at how they

MIKE DOWNEY: A LITTLE MUSIC, MAESTRO, PLEASE

<P>
 Public television has been airing film from the great "Three Tenors" concert 
at Dodger Stadium, and HBO has shown Barbra Streisand's fabulous show at the 
Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 What neither network has shown you is exclusive, behind-the-scenes footage of 
all four artists in a top-secret meeting, at which a spectacular joint concert 
was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 This newspaper has obtained the official minutes of that meeting. Excerpts 
follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Luciano, Placido, Jose . . . I have wonderful memories of your last 
concert together. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: Grazie. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: Gracias. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras: Ditto. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Misty water-color memories of the way you were. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: I no understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Never mind. So, how do you find Dodger Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: Turn left on Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: No, I mean for singing. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Domingo: Mmmm, no, we go before baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: I don't mean what time. I mean, do you ever watch baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: Is too slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: You guys sing opera and you think baseball is slow? 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras: Nothing happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: You guys like soccer and you think in baseball nothing happens? 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: Zubin Mehta take us to one Dodger game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: Was no good. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: No good? 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: They run out of Dodger Dogs, six inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Who was your favorite player? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Streisand: I still miss Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: So, why we here? 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras: What we can do for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: When is lunch? 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: OK, look. We're singing in a big sports stadium, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: So? 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: So, let's sing a sports song. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: Is good idea! 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras: Like what? 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Here, I brought some sheet music. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: I have to sing that "O, Sole Mio" thing once more, I go nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: Hey, Barbra! I like this one! 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras: Me too. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: La la, la la, la la. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Let's try it with the words. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: Mi, mi, mi, mi. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Ready? 
</P>
<P>
 Tenors: "We will, we will . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Again. Much louder. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenors: "We will, we will . . . rock you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Louder! 
</P>
<P>
 Tenors: "We will, we will . . . rock you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: I no like. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: Let's stick with Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: I no want to rock nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: OK, OK. Try this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras: What is this about? 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Three famous men. Like the three tenors. Ready? Begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenors: " . . . we are talking Willie . . . Mickey annnddd the Duke!" 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Beautiful! 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: I like. Who this Willie? Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: Willie Mays. Baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: Ah! And Mickey is Piazza! 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras: Would you forget about Piazza! 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: OK. We do this Willie-Mickey-Duke aria. What else you got? 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: What about na-na song? 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand: What? 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: I go to big American baseball game. Near end of game, everybody 
sing: "Na na na na, na na na na, 'ay, 'ay, 'ay, good- by!"  
</P>
<P>
 Domingo: Everybody? 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti: Si, everybody!

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; BAD PASS; WITH UCLA INTERCEPTION BEHIND 
HIM, USC'S JOHNSON MAKES VICTORY HIS GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When USC lost out in the Rose Bowl race Nov. 20, it happened in a way few 
could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson, for 12 games, had been the most accurate passer in Pacific 10 
Conference history, having thrown only four interceptions in more than 400 
attempts. That Johnson would throw a game-deciding interception -- and from the 
two-yard line at that -- didn't make much sense. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did. UCLA won, 27-21, and earned the Rose Bowl date. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was, late that night in a USC neighborhood apartment, Johnson's 
teammates gathered to console him, to share his pain. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some beer-drinking. There were some tears. And all there did share 
the pain.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that night -- and I still feel this way -- that part of me is 
still on the two-yard line at the Coliseum," said Tony Boselli, Johnson's 
roommate and an All-American offensive tackle.  
</P>
<P>
 USC, trailing by 27-21, reached UCLA's three-yard line with 1 minute 16 
seconds left on pass plays by Johnson that covered 33 and 43 yards. He had 
already thrown for two touchdowns and 307 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 As he took his team to the line of scrimmage on first and goal, he was, by a 
wide margin, the leading passer in USC single-season history, with 3,630 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Two running plays by tailback Shawn Walters to the left side netted only a 
yard.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, a pass was called, a short toss to tight end Tyler Cashman. But a 
lurking UCLA safety, Marvin Goodwin, intercepted. UCLA ran out the clock and 
went to the Rose Bowl. USC went to Anaheim to play Utah in the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Johnson could only say of Goodwin, "I never saw him." 
</P>
<P>
 "He really took it hard," Boselli said. "But we all did. I kept telling Rob, 
'Hey, if we'd blocked for Shawn, he'd have scored and we wouldn't be having 
this conversation.' But we knew how he felt. Nothing seemed to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of felt sorry for ourselves at first, then we got . . . off. And the 
more beer we drank, the more . . . off we got. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's really gotten over it. I know I haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Hogue, a guard, remembers Johnson that night the way everyone else does 
who was with him -- disconsolate.  
</P>
<P>
 "When it was just the two of us talking, I told him if it wasn't for those two 
long pass plays he made, we wouldn't even have been down there, in a position 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was one of those situations where nothing you could say to him would 
help him. And it's because he's a winner. He told me he'd rather play a 
horrible game and win than have great stats and lose. He said he'd give back 
anything he's ever done in football to have that play back." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Riley, the Trojans' offensive coordinator, later viewed the UCLA-USC 
finish as supreme irony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who has a phenomenal year -- he throws virtually no 
interceptions -- and we go down on a high-percentage pass play in the final 
drive of the (regular) season.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard, and he took it hard. He got emotional, right after the game. 
(The coaching staff) tried to take some of the heat off him by telling him that 
the play developed too slowly, that we hadn't practiced it enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was all true, but it didn't help. This is a young team, and we'll all 
learn from that day." 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath, Johnson, a junior then, told his teammates he would be back. 
But he and his father, Bob Johnson, who was his high school coach, gave some 
thought to leaving USC early for the NFL draft.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Johnson said, his father told him, " 'Look, if you're thinking 
about coming out, you'd better make a decision -- there's only two weeks left 
until you have to declare.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We sat down and talked about the positives and negatives, and we couldn't 
think of too many positives," the quarterback said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The negatives were, I'd be no better than the third quarterback taken -- 
behind Heath Shuler and Trent Dilfer -- and that probably meant the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the main thing was, I want to take this team to the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Garland Johnson is 21, 6 feet 4, 220 pounds and walks with a swagger.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Boselli: "I remember the first day I saw him on campus, four years ago. 
He was cocky and arrogant, but I mean that in a good way -- the way you want 
your quarterback to be. He knew he was going to be a prominent player here from 
Day 1." 
</P>
<P>
 With Johnson's record-breaking 1993 in the bank and what seems to be a solid 
football team in place for this season, USC's sports publicity office has 
cranked up a campaign for a fifth USC Heisman Trophy.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says he's a bit embarrassed by summertime Heisman talk, even before 
the leaves have turned at Notre Dame.  
</P>
<P>
 The line from Johnson and his teammates goes like this: "If we have a great 
season, if we go to the Rose Bowl, that stuff will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing's for sure. If Johnson does have a Heisman season, the quarterback's 
father isn't going to miss a thing. He has been the football coach at El Toro 
High the last 12 years but is taking this season off so he can attend every USC 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 And this father-coach, who can be his son's toughest critic, tells all that 
those dwelling on awards and statistics aren't really seeing his son.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rob couldn't care less if he throws 15 or 35 passes a game," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "All he wants is the W, nothing else. I remember he told me (Notre Dame 
quarterback) Rick Mirer came up to him in the Coliseum tunnel after the 1992 
game (won by Notre Dame, 31-23), and congratulated him on a fine game.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rob told him, 'Thanks, but you got the W. I'd rather have that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach John Robinson: "If Rob gets the Heisman, that would be fabulous. 
But if he doesn't, life goes on. I love being around the guy, because he loves 
to play so much. And he'll play another 15 years, after he leaves here." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every Pac-10 team has a returning quarterback this season, and two of 
them played on the same high school team, coached by Bob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stenstrom, in his 1989 senior season at quarterback for El Toro, threw 
65 completions to his wide receiver, Johnson, who got the QB job the next year, 
after Stenstrom had left for Stanford.  
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson was one of the nation's most widely recruited quarterbacks in 
1991. In his travels that spring, he visited Notre Dame, with his El Toro 
teammate, Hogue, now a USC offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue is USC's No. 1 Johnson story teller, and this one has to do with a 1991 
afternoon when a Notre Dame graduate assistant coach, name forgotten, was 
driving Johnson and Hogue around the Notre Dame campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled Hogue: "Rob is not a religious guy, and he was pretty young then . . 
. and he looks up at the woman depicted on the top of the Golden Dome (it's the 
Virgin Mary), and says, 'Who's the chick on the dome?' 
</P>
<P>
 "The coach turned around, and he didn't think it was funny, and I don't think 
Rob intended it to be funny. The coach said, 'Don't ever let Coach (Lou) Holtz 
hear you say that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, during periods of confinement on airplanes or buses, loves to get 
something going, Hogue says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves to argue. He'll argue about anything. One time on a bus ride last 
year, he started an argument over whether or not a luge has a brake. I mean, 
really dumb stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's started arguments over who's better, Larry Bird or Magic Johnson. Or 
what the Knicks would be like with Shaquille O'Neal, or the Orlando Magic with 
Patrick Ewing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue, on Johnson and the Heisman: "He knows we all want it for him. But we 
know he wants a national championship more than the Heisman, and that's why we 
want the Heisman for him.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've known him since the eighth grade. He's a natural leader, by example. 
He's great at picking up a guy who's just screwed up, telling him quietly to 
just forget it. And he's really loose and funny in the meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 That pretty much describes the Johnson family, loose and funny. Bob Johnson, 
his wife, Debbie, and Rob's older brother, Bret, visited the USC training camp 
the other day, and the family had lunch together.  
</P>
<P>
 There were maybe 50 football players eating, but the Johnson family table was 
the noisiest as they laughed, needled and teased one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a treat," Bob Johnson said. "I can't tell you when the last time was 
we were all together, eating at the same table." 
</P>
<P>
 Bret, also a quarterback, was recently cut by the Atlanta Falcons and spent 
last season in the Canadian Football League.  
</P>
<P>
 Riley was asked how you coach a quarterback who completed 68.6% of his passes 
last year and accumulated 3,630 yards, nearly a thousand yards more than any 
other Trojan quarterback in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty much a polished guy at his position, but we do want to cut down 
on his sacks (about 40 last year), to get him to throw the ball away when a 
play has fallen apart," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said, "I want every play to work, and I'm back there ready to pass, 
thinking positive thoughts. I'm thinking, 'Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!' and the 
play falls apart and I get sacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to get that split-second decision down, where I'm thinking, 'Yes! Yes! 
Yes! Yes! No! ' And throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Two Pac-10 coaches, Robinson and Washington's Jim Lambright, say Johnson can 
be a more effective quarterback with a better USC running game. Returning 
tailback Walters was the conference's No. 8 rusher last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing I can do for Rob is to give him a running game that will take 
the heat off him," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lambright: "If SC's run game is significantly improved this year, that 
means Johnson would become one-third more effective than he was last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters will be joined by three promising newcomers at running back -- Leonard 
Green, Delon Washington and Rodney Sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson threw an average of 34.5 passes a game in USC's 8-5 season a year ago. 
Riley would like to see fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 25 to 28 passes would be an optimum number for Rob," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to continue throwing to our tight ends a lot, as well as our wide 
receivers. We hope our tailbacks can allow us to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Johnson's numbers figure to be impressive because, Riley 
says, he is phenomenally accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob could make a living in the circus, throwing footballs through a swinging 
tire -- he'd never miss," Riley said. USC Passing Leaders 06,20,07,07,06,07,04

GOLF ROUNDUP; STADLER ADJUSTS, SHARES SERIES LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Craig Stadler's love affair with Firestone Country Club has even survived a 
change of courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadler birdied the last four holes Thursday to complete a 5-under-par 65 that 
gave him a share of the first-round lead in the World Series of Golf in Akron, 
Ohio, with Loren Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 PGA and British Open champion Nick Price, who has won three of the last four 
tournaments he has played in, was cruising along at three under par and 
threatening the leaders when he put his tee shot into the water on the 184-yard 
17th and made a bogey 4. The native of Zimbabwe, the only multiple winner on 
the PGA Tour this year, finished at 68, tied with U.S. Open champion Ernie Els 
of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Price's first competitive round since winning the PGA title on Aug. 14 
and then undergoing office surgery the next day for possible skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadler's closing burst lifted him into the tie with Roberts and ahead of an 
international field of 49 that is chasing a $360,000 winner's share of the $2 
million purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, Mark McCumber and Jeff Maggert 
were a stroke back. Maggert chipped in for an eagle 2 as the highlight of his 
66 and McCumber played without a bogey and without a "5" on his card. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman of Australia led a large group at 67 that included Billy Mayfair, 
Steve Lowery, South African David Frost and Australian Ian Baker-Finch. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadler is looking to the World Series as a revival to his game for the third 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught a little bit of fire there at the end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, it is on a different course, the shorter, water-laced 
North course that was pressed into service on an emergency basis last month 
when the South course -- site of this tournament since its inception in 1962 -- 
suddenly lost its greens to a mysterious blight. 
</P>
<P>
 The change didn't seem to bother Stadler at all, but he admitted he "was a 
little disappointed," when it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Nause birdied the last three holes to shoot a seven-under-par 65, which 
was good for a one-stroke lead after the opening round of the LPGA du Maurier 
Classic at Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Ann Mills, Kelly Robins, Debbie Massey and Michelle McGann were all at 
66 on the rain-soaked 6,400-yard Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club course.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY'S RELEASE IS A POSSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams are considering releasing cornerback Darryl Henley instead of 
committing to a $1-million bond that would free Henley to travel with the team 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's present bail restrictions on an indictment of cocaine possession and 
distribution prevented him from joining the team in San Diego's Jack Murphy 
Stadium Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge's ruling last week granted Henley permission to travel with the Rams 
with an increase in bail from $200,000 to $1 million, and with the proviso that 
a probation officer be with him at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are concerned that the presence of a probation officer -- on the team 
plane, in team meetings and along the sideline -- might represent a 
considerable distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 A team official, who expressed concern about the $1-million bond, said the 
matter would be discussed Saturday in order to reach a final determination 
before Sunday's final cuts. T.J. SIMERS

HAPLESS RAMS ARE NO MATCH FOR CHARGERS; FOOTBALL: LOS ANGELES LOOKS A LOT WORSE 
THAN ITS 24-6 LOSS TO SAN DIEGO MIGHT INDICATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Embarrassing, inept, humiliating, depressing, sloppy, discouraging, 
disheartening, ugly, disgusting Ram football. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a team playing as poorly as the mind will allow, and the Rams went one 
penalty, one dropped pass, one blown coverage beyond in a 24-6 loss to the 
Chargers Saturday night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were awful," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "We just aren't in sync at this 
point. No way can we commit these kind of mistakes and win." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine consecutive exhibition defeats, 45 defeats in their last 64 
regular-season games, and that's Ram football as they go bungling into the 1994 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 If Charger running back Natrone Means plays the Rams every week, he rushes for 
twice the yards Dallas' Emmitt Smith gains this year. 
</P>
<P>
 If Charger linebacker Junior Seau plays the Rams every week, he leads the 
league in sacks and sets an NFL record for forced fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers were 0-4 in exhibition play before Thursday night, but they're 
talking playoffs now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned -- big time," said Knox, who was asked if he thought his 
players were concerned. "I hope they're concerned. They better be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Rams didn't play running back Jerome Bettis and wide receiver 
Flipper Anderson, but why not? Why save Bettis and Anderson, but subject 
injury-prone quarterback Chris Miller to such a thrashing? 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers were ahead, 24-3, with 1:16 remaining in the first half, and 
inexplicably Miller was still in the game, pitching footballs behind an 
offensive line threatening to end his season before it began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams couldn't play defensive ends Fred Stokes and Gerald Robinson and 
defensive tackle Sean Gilbert because of injuries, but that was starting 
cornerback Steve Israel beaten by Charger wide receiver Shawn Jefferson for a 
22-yard touchdown; starting safety Deral Boykin beaten by tight end Alfred 
Pupunu for a four-yard touchdown, and heaven knows who was assigned to cover a 
wide-open wide receiver Mark Seay on his eight-yard touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams lost the exhibition opener to the Packers, and fret not, they said, 
it was only the exhibition opener. They fell to New England in Anaheim Stadium, 
and it was early, they said. They were drubbed by the Raiders a week ago and 
apparently it was no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 In four exhibition games, the opposition rolled up 58 points on the Rams' 
first-string defense. The Ram offense produced three touchdowns in four games, 
and if kicker Tony Zendejas (seven of eight on field-goal tries) ever misses 
the team bus, it's time to pack away the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 What were these guys doing in training camp? Do they teach mistakes? 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the opening kickoff, starting linebacker Roman Phifer was caught 
holding. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The defense had the Chargers stopped on their first offensive series after 
a third-down incomplete pass, but rookie defensive end Brad Ottis was flagged 
for stepping off-side and, eight plays later, the Chargers scored. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the ensuing kickoff, Ram running back David Lang couldn't catch the 
ball, which bounced out of bounds at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four plays later, an unblocked Seau arrived in the backfield about the same 
time Miller was handing the ball to Lang. A collision produced a fumble, Seau 
recovered and, three plays later, Stan Humphries was throwing a touchdown pass 
to Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams were penalized for an illegal block on the kickoff. . . . a poor 
snap from center forced Zendejas to miss a 49-yard field-goal attempt. . . . 
Means caught a short pass from Humphries and ran through a half-dozen Ram 
defenders before falling to the ground. . . . Holding penalty on Ram guard Bill 
Schultz. . . . Safety Anthony Newman drops an interception chance directed 
right into his hands at the goal line. . . . Miller throws a pass in the 
general direction of Richard Buchanan and Charger defensive back Darren 
Carrington intercepts. . . . Tight end Troy Drayton drops a pass. . . . The 
Rams elect to save quarterback Chris Chandler, and they start Jamie Martin in 
the second half. He fumbles the first snap from center. . . . Martin runs 10 
yards for a touchdown, but the score is wiped out because offensive lineman Tom 
Newberry is caught for hitting a Charger defender in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 An endless series of mistakes, and the Rams counter that none of it means a 
thing until the regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Better days are ahead, the Rams say, but then in their last two regular-season 
openers, the Rams were outscored 76-13.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; TOUGH DECISIONS AWAITING SHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the bubble is a phrase used to describe NFL players who are on the 
borderline of being released. With teams forced to trim rosters to 53 Sunday, 
several players will have their last chance to impress the coaches Saturday 
when the Raiders play at Houston in their final exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this process so tough for Coach Art Shell is the Raiders' 
considerable depth and strong core of veterans returning from last season's 
playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that it's easier to make cuts this season because of the increased 
number of players kept on the active roster compared to last season's 46, but 
the final cutdown will still be difficult for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many positions secured with returning starters and experienced 
veterans, some players' fate may be determined by their performance against the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys can definitely earn a spot by making an impact (against Houston)," Shell 
said. "It's been done in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell, however, did say that other factors might be more important for a 
player to make the team than just to play well in the final exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have a chance to show what you can do until the final cut is 
made," Shell said. "But, the process doesn't always revolve around games. You 
have practice sessions, injuries and other things that come into play. It is 
just not one situation." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The Raiders will be host of the NFL Experience, a football theme park, outside 
the Coliseum on Saturday and Sunday Sept. 10-11, before their first home game 
against the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Only ticket holders for the game will be admitted to the NFL Experience, which 
features interactive games, NFL memorabilia and former players. The park will 
be open from 10 a.m to 6 p.m. on Saturday and 9 to 11:30 a.m. on Sunday. LONNIE

MORNING BRIEFING: HOLE IN ONE HERE ISN'T OUT OF THE ORD-INARY

 You've heard of golfers getting into a groove. How about a golf course in a 
groove? 
</P>
<P>
 It happened last Sunday at Ord Golf Club, when three golfers scored holes in 
one within about 20 minutes of one another during an American Legion 
fund-raising tournament in Ord, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Fred Williams, a teacher and the golf coach at Ord High, aced the 
180-yard seventh hole. Then, as Williams watched from the ninth tee a few 
minutes later, Rick Gamel made a hole in one on the 156-yard ninth hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Man that is something, two holes in one almost right in a row,' " 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes later, Roland Shafer made it three, also acing No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a big vacuum in the center of the earth," Shafer said. "It was 
just drawing these golf balls in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: This season, Ken Griffey Jr., Matt Williams and others were on or 
close to record paces in various hitting departments. Who were the major league 
leaders in the triple crown categories for the last season shortened 
significantly by a strike, 1981? 
</P>
<P>
 Add trivia: Who were the Cy Young and most-valuable-player award winners in 
1981? 
</P>
<P>
 There's no escape: Buffalo Bill offensive lineman Kent Hull says that after 
losing four consecutive Super Bowls, the Bills know it's inevitable that they 
will continually be reminded about their failures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in Las Vegas, the cab driver is from Nigeria, he's giving me a Buffalo 
Bills joke," Hull said. "You can't escape it." 
</P>
<P>
 Just for starters: Do NFL teams pay attention to statistics? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett and Jeff George, two of the NFL's more talented enigmas, are a 
combined 60-94 as starting quarterbacks. Everett, the New Orleans Saints' new 
No. 1 quarterback, is 46-59; George, the new Atlanta Falcons' starter, 14-35. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you're curious, their respective backups this season, Wade Wilson for 
the Saints and Bobby Hebert for the Falcons, are a combined 88-64 as starters. 
Wilson is 35-30, Hebert 53-34. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies won the home run 
title with 31 and led the majors with 91 runs batted in. The Pittsburgh 
Pirates' Bill Madlock led batters with a .341 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Add trivia answer: The Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela won the National League Cy 
Young and Rollie Fingers of the Milwaukee Brewers was the American League 
winner, as well as the league MVP. Schmidt was the MVP in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: New Orleans Saint kicker Morten Andersen, on the new NFL rules that 
are designed to minimize the influence of the kicking games: "It makes no sense 
to me to penalize somebody because they are successful. If the quarterback is 
good, what are you going to do, make the end zone smaller so he doesn't throw 
so many touchdowns?" TIM KAWAKAMI

WOODS ROARS BACK TO ADVANCE AT U.S. AMATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiger Woods won four consecutive holes on the back nine Thursday and rallied 
to defeat former champion Buddy Alexander and advance to the quarterfinals of 
the U.S. Amateur Golf Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as comebacks are concerned, this is a pretty big one," said Woods, 18, 
who graduated from Western High School in June. He was three down with five 
holes to play, but needed to make only one birdie in his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never lost a match like that," said Alexander, the 1986 Amateur champion 
and the golf coach at the University of Florida. "I didn't hit a good shot 
after the 12th hole. I just played lousy." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods displayed the same poise that carried him to three successive USGA 
Junior titles and three prestigious amateur championships this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 After slicing Alexander's advantage to 2-up with a routine par at the rugged 
438-yard 14th on the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass, Woods punctuated a 17-foot 
par putt on No. 15 by enthusiastically pumping his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I willed that putt into the hole," said Woods, who ran his match-play record 
this summer to 16-1. "I knew if I showed some energy on that putt, it would 
demoralize him. Maybe it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 On the 132-yard 17th, Woods' 9-iron stopped inches from dropping into the 
water. His chip was followed by a four-foot par putt, giving him a 1-up lead 
after Alexander three-putted from 28 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was sharper in his morning match, a 6 and 5 victory over Michael Flynn 
of Rochester, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Gibstein of Matinecock, N.Y., at 35, the oldest player still in the field, 
rallied to win four consecutive holes down the stretch for a 3-and-2 victory 
over Anthony Rodriguez of College Station, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Oh of Torrance lost in the second round, 4 and 3, to Tim Jackson of 
Germantown, Tenn. Defending champion John Harris, 41, of Edina, Minn., bogeyed 
the second playoff hole and lost to Chuck Jabaley of Cleveland, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 The semifinals are Saturday and the 36-hole final is Sunday.

 Tiger Woods of Cypress won four consecutive holes on the back nine and rallied 
to defeat former champion Buddy Alexander on Thursday and advance to the 
quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur Golf Championship on the Stadium Course at 
TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla . 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as comebacks are concerned, this is a pretty big one," said Woods, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never lost a match like that," said Alexander, the 1986 Amateur champion 
and the golf coach at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was much sharper in his morning match, a 6-and-5 victory over Michael 
Flynn of Rochester, N.H.

 Ted Oh of Torrance was eliminated in the morning round in a 4-and-3 loss to 
Tim Jackson, Germantown, Tenn.

 Craig Stadler birdied the last four holes at Firestone Country Club at Akron, 
Ohio, and shot a five-under-par 65 that gave him a share of the first-round 
lead with Loren Roberts in the NEC World Series of Golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, Mark McCumber and Jeff Maggert 
were a stroke back at 66. 
</P>

 Greg Norman led a large group at 67 that included Billy Mayfair, Steve Lowery, 
David Frost and Ian Baker-Finch.

 Leigh Ann Mills, Kelly Robins, Debbie Massey and Michelle McGann were all at 
66 on the rain-soaked 6,400-yard Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club course.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: NBC AND COSTAS WILL MAKE THEIR RETURN TO BASEBALL . . 
. LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It would have worked out nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the 55th anniversary of the first televised major league baseball 
game -- Cincinnati against the Brooklyn Dodgers from Ebbets Field on NBC -- and 
tonight was supposed to be NBC's first regular-season baseball telecast since 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But strike all that. 
</P>
<P>
 And you can't blame NBC's Bob Costas for being a little upset. His return to 
the sport he loves has been put on hold, and he mostly blames the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have had some legitimate complaints, but they overstated them with 
statements that even a 12-year-old could see through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have muddied the waters with ridiculous claims and created an atmosphere 
of mistrust." 
</P>
<P>
 Costas believes a third party, preferably a new commissioner, is needed "to 
restore trust and hopefully get this thing settled." 
</P>
<P>
 How about Costas for commissioner? Of course, he'd have to take a salary cut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Costas: He was at Camden Yards in Baltimore recently to tape his role as 
host of a prime-time special, "40 for the Ages: Sports Illustrated's 40th 
Anniversary Special," which will be on NBC Wednesday, Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 On the program, which is based on the magazine's 40th anniversary issue (Sept. 
19), 40 of the most influential sports figures since the magazine's inception 
in 1954 will be named. Picking the top 40 will be a group of SI writers and 
editors. 
</P>
<P>
 Could generate a few debates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add Costas: One of the best shows on radio is "Costas: Coast to Coast." 
At one time it was being carried Sunday nights at 6 by KMPC. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still around but hard to find. XTRA has been carrying it most Sunday 
nights at 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Freedman, XTRA's program director, said ESPN radio programming has 
pushed it to the late-night spot, but it might move back to 6 p.m. this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas is not always the host -- Pat O'Brien is the main backup, with James 
Brown, Jim Lampley or Bob Trumpy occasionally filling in -- but no matter, the 
show is always first rate. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Recommended viewing: There's exhibition football tonight on TNT and Saturday 
on NBC and Fox, but ABC, the week before it starts its 25th year of "Monday 
Night Football" with the Raiders at San Francisco on Sept. 5, is taking this 
Monday off. 
</P>
<P>
 There is football on Fox Monday night. It's the network's first prime-time 
special, "NFL All-Access," at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The network sent camera crews to the training camps of the Dallas Cowboys, 
Arizona Cardinals and Minnesota Vikings, and they were given full access to 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The crews spent a combined 27 days at the three camps, gathering some 
excellent footage. The special opens with John Madden visiting the Oakland 
Raiders' old Santa Rosa training camp, which is now a shambles. The El Rancho 
Motel that used to house the players was torn down shortly after Madden's 
segment was taped. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece sometimes is hard to follow because there is no narrator, but 
overall it's a show football fans won't want to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Another show not to miss is TNT's "Stadium Show" preseason special Sunday at 5 
p.m. Lawrence Taylor makes his TV debut and among other things will talk with 
his former coach, Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A little baseball: ABC offers the Little League World Series championship 
game, featuring Northridge, Saturday delayed at 3:30 p.m., with John Saunders 
and Jim Palmer calling the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer will also work the major league World Series, if there is one. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taking part in ABC's Little League coverage Saturday will be 13-year-old 
Maria Sansone, a regular contributor to television station WJET in Erie, Pa., 
who has worked for ABC on other events. 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA made a deal late Thursday to carry Saturday's game live at 1 p.m. XTRA 
can be heard on 670 in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings game: The lack of baseball seems to be paying benefits for football. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday night, the Cowboys and Denver Broncos delivered an 8.5 rating for 
TNT, not only its highest exhibition rating ever but the fifth-highest football 
rating of any kind for the cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC got an impressive 13.1 for Chicago and Kansas City last Monday, and Fox's 
second NFL exhibition telecast, Green Bay vs. New Orleans last Friday, got a 
6.9 national Nielsen rating, up from a 6.5 for its the network's first NFL 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 College football: ABC kicks off the college football season Sunday at 11 a.m. 
with the Kickoff Classic -- Nebraska vs. West Virginia -- and Channel 9 
televises Monday night's 6 o'clock Pigskin Classic -- Fresno State vs. Ohio 
State -- from Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Williamson of Malibu-based Radio Sports Creations was hoping to get 
XTRA to carry Monday night's nationally syndicated radio broadcast of the 
Pigskin Classic. But XTRA passed, so Williamson had to buy time on Orange 
County's KORG to get an L.A. outlet. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Beach volleyball: NBC offers live coverage Saturday and Sunday of the Miller 
Lite International Championships at Hermosa Beach. This is the eighth of 10 
beach volleyball events to be televised by NBC this year. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC began televising beach volleyball in 1990 after it lost baseball, and the 
sport has become a mainstay for the network. One of the reasons is the work of 
announcers Chris Marlowe and Paul Sunderland. TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 2's popular "L.A. Football Co." show with Jim Hill has bit the dust, a 
victim of CBS' losing football to Fox. Meanwhile, a new locally produced NFL 
show, "Fox Overtime," with Rick Garcia, makes its debut on Channel 11 Sept. 4 
after the Dallas-Pittsburgh game. . . . Prime Ticket's Ron Pitts, the former 
UCLA defensive back who will also be an analyst for Fox this season, interviews 
former Bruin teammate Darryl Henley on tonight's "Press Box." . . . Saturday's 
Raider game at Houston will be on NBC at 11 a.m. . . . Martina Navratilova is 
interviewed by Barbara Walters on ABC's "20/20" tonight at 10, and touches on a 
wide range of topics. 
</P>
<P>
 The USA network's weekday U.S. Open tennis coverage begins Monday, with John 
McEnroe returning as one of the commentators. CBS' coverage begins Saturday, 
Sept. 3, with Mary Carillo and Tony Trabert serving as analysts. McEnroe, 
during another one of his rambling conference calls with reporters this week, 
said of Carillo: "I haven't seen her in 12 years. I think it's funny that when 
people want a quote about me, they ask Mary Carillo. She doesn't have a . . . 
clue about me." Carillo, asked about the possibility of ever working with 
McEnroe, said, "That would be great -- we could exchange gunfire across the 
booth." 
</P>
<P>
 Respected NBC executive Jon Miller has been promoted to senior vice president 
of sports, the No. 2 position in the department behind president Dick Ebersol. 
. . . Former Olympic skier Andy Mill, who worked the last two Winter Olympics 
as a commentator for CBS, will join ABC's "Good Morning America" as a regular 
contributor on Tuesday. For his second segment on Wednesday, he will be joined 
by his wife, Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers to KMPC loved the Jim Healy tribute on Wednesday. Here's hoping the 
station will make cassette tapes available to the public and also replay it a 
few more times. . . . Former KMPC talk-show host Tony Femino will begin doing a 
nightly talk show for Phoenix all-sports station KGME next week. . . . Femino, 
in association with Short Stick Productions of Studio City, recently put 
together a television pilot, "Sports on Tap." Femino is one of the hosts along 
with XTRA's Chet Forte, Kenneth Miller, a sportswriter for the Los Angeles 
Sentinel, and Lenny Del Genio of Bally's Sportsbook. Prime Network has 
expressed interest in the show which is similar to ESPN's "Sports Reporters." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Rob Johnson will be among the Pacific 10 quarterbacks featured on CNN's 
"College Football Preview" show Saturday at 8:30 a.m. . . . John Robinson and 
Terry Donahue will be Irv Kaze's guests on KIEV tonight at 6:15. . . . Boxing 
beat: For the first time in recent memory, a world title fight will be on local 
over-the-air television Sept. 10 when Channel 9 carries Humberto (Chiquita) 
Gonzalez defending his World Boxing Council-International Boxing Federation 
light-flyweight titles against Argentina's Juan (Domingo) Cordova in Lake 
Tahoe. The announcers will be Rich Marotta and Doug Krikorian.

A WINNING PROTOTYPE; BEACH VOLLEYBALL STAR KENT STEFFES DOMINATES ALONG WITH 
KIRALY, AND HIS HARDER, SMARTER APPROACH IS CATCHING ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kent Steffes was a straight-A student at Pacific Palisades High until he got a 
B in a volleyball class as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed the class a lot because I was at basketball practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball will always be his first love, but it's fun making big bucks 
playing volleyball. At 26, Steffes is one of the world's best pro beach 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a solid forward on the Palisades basketball team, but on the volleyball 
court, he really stood out. As an all-state senior middle blocker in 1986, he 
led the Dolphins to a 38-0 record and the State title. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes has made history on the beach tour with a meteoric rise that has made 
him the youngest player to have won more than $1 million in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 He ranks fourth in all-time victories with 68 tournament titles. The three 
players ahead of him Sinjin Smith, Randy Stoklos and Karch Kiraly -- are each 
at least seven years older.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 37, has won 135 opens. Stoklos, 33, has 120 titles and Kiraly, also 33, 
has 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes, 6 feet 4 and 210 pounds, attributes some of the success to an early 
start on the beach. He started his full-time career at 19, when most players 
are still competing in school, because his college career had ended abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes accepted a scholarship to Stanford after high school but transferred 
to UCLA after a year because the Cardinal had a losing season and he believed 
the program would not improve. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat out a year as required by the NCAA for transferring athletes, then 
played through the Bruins' 1989 nonconference schedule before learning he was 
ineligible because his partner had accepted money in a beach volleyball 
tournament during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't take any money, but the NCAA said that made us a pro team and you 
can't play on a pro team," Steffes said. "It was ridiculous and very 
disappointing. My whole career was taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Al Scates believes the ruling was absurd because Steffes proved he 
was clean. Steffes was a starter who could have helped the Bruins dominate, 
Scates said, but the team was still great without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kent had unlimited potential," Scates said. "He looked very good and I was 
going to use him as a key player. But it didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 So Steffes turned to the sand, where he has proven to be a natural. He and 
partner Kiraly have been tearing it up on the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals 
tour since they joined forces in the middle of the 1991 season.  
</P>
<P>
 They got together when Kiraly, a two-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist, returned 
from an Italian pro indoor league. In '91 they won six of 11 tournaments, in 
'92 16 of 19 and last season they won an AVP-record 18 events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been winning at a rate never before seen," Steffes said. "And every 
time we lose, it's news." 
</P>
<P>
 The team has continued to dominate this year, even though a bruised kidney 
forced Kiraly to miss four events. Steffes sat out two of them and teamed up 
with Scott Ayakatubby for the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly and Steffes have won 14 tournaments this year and are seeded No. 1 in 
this weekend's $250,000 Miller Lite Championships at Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-team event begins today at 9 a.m. and the final is scheduled for 2 p.m. 
Sunday. Steffes and Kiraly have won the title the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the season is not yet complete, Steffes has already locked in the 
$100,000 bonus pool awarded the player with the most points each year. He has 
won the pool three times, once with Kiraly and twice alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kent is not the best at anything, but he's excellent at everything," said 
Chris Marlowe, an '84 Olympic gold medalist in volleyball and television 
commentator of the sport. "He can really do everything well, and that's what 
sets him apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes is also known for his sophisticated workout routine. 
</P>
<P>
 It includes a rigorous weight and conditioning program that is mapped out in 
detail long before the start of every season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He trains harder and smarter than anybody else on the beach, so he's more 
prepared," Kiraly said. "He's incredibly dedicated and he has no weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dodd, winner of 63 opens, says Steffes is the prototype of the new 
player. Dodd, 37, has faced Steffes and Kiraly in five tournament finals this 
year and has won three opens with partner Mike Whitmarsh. 
</P>
<P>
 A Manhattan Beach native, Dodd has lived through the sport's evolution. When 
he started, athletes got T-shirts and beach chairs for winning tournaments.  
</P>
<P>
 With more at stake, he anticipates more and more athletes following Steffes' 
routine -- no partying, a strict training regimen and a more businesslike 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kent is incredibly focused and incredibly dedicated," Dodd said. "He has 
specific goals and purposes, and that's unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes started playing volleyball when he was 15, an age when most kids have 
already played on club teams for several years. He relied on natural athletic 
ability to hold his own. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Jackson, ran track at Michigan and his mother, Sandra, was a field 
hockey player. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had not succeeded in volleyball, Steffes would probably be working at a 
financial firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned a degree in economics at UCLA last year, has a serious interest in 
the stock market and manages his own investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the first thing he does every morning is watch the Dow Jones 
industrial average on Channel 22. Then he switches to CNBC, a station that runs 
a continual market summary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought I'd be successful at whatever I'd do," Steffes said. "That's 
one thing I don't lack -- confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 He even has it during pickup basketball games. Hoops will always be an 
important part of his life. He didn't ruin his perfect grade-point average for 
nothing.

 Hugh Culverhouse, a millionaire tax attorney who ran the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
with a frugality that made for sound business but frustrating football, died 
Thursday after a 20-month battle with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Culverhouse, 75, died in New Orleans, where he had been undergoing treatment 
since last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Culverhouse paid $16 million for one of two expansion teams that began play in 
1976. He was the only owner in club history and resisted the temptation to move 
the franchise when attendance dipped or sell to parties wanting to relocate the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-time tax attorney for Richard Nixon and Bebe Rebozo was the head of 
the NFL's financial committee through the strikes of 1982 and 1987.

 Culverhouse is a native of Birmingham, Ala. The funeral will be Tuesday in 
Tampa, Fla. Pro Basketball

 Hugh Culverhouse, a millionaire tax attorney who ran the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
with a frugality that made for sound business but frustrating football, died 
Thursday after a 20-month battle with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Culverhouse, 75, died in New Orleans, where he had been undergoing treatment 
since last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Culverhouse paid $16 million for one of two expansion teams that began play in 
1976. He was the only owner in club history and resisted the temptation to move 
the franchise when attendance dipped or to sell to parties wanting to relocate 
the team. Jurisprudence

 San Mateo County Commissioner George Taylor, who last week asked for Barry 
Bonds' autograph after reducing the outfielder's family support payments, has 
written a letter of apology.

 Taylor sent the letter to attorneys on both sides of the case and Superior 
Court presiding judge Aram Serverian, conveying "the court's sincerest regrets 
of impropriety. . . . In retrospect, it was the wrong thing to do and I simply 
won't make excuses."

 Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford has granted a request by boxer Mike 
Tyson's attorneys to move a court hearing in Indianapolis back two months so 
they have more time to prepare. The hearing was moved from Sept. 12 to Nov. 14. 
There was no objection from prosecutors. Tyson's attorneys have asked the judge 
to consider throwing out his rape conviction and holding a new trial. Pro

HEADSTRONG ARMSTRONG?; AMERICA'S BEST CYCLIST SINCE LEMOND WILL SUCCEED OR FAIL 
ON OWN TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being an expatriate is seldom easy. Lance Armstrong, a Texan with a treble 
twang and cowhide-toughness, has discovered just how desperate one can get on 
the lonely road to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 As a professional cyclist, Armstrong is stationed for half the year in Cuomo, 
Italy, in the bucolic Lake District north of Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 One day last year, he and members of the American Motorola team flew into 
Milan after a race and found exactly no one waiting to take them to Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, they thought. They simply donned some cycling clothes, stored 
their luggage, assembled their racing bikes and pedaled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, it's a two-hour ride for world-class riders. That's nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But this late spring afternoon was turning out to be something. After 
negotiating the pitted, clogged streets of Milan, the cyclists encountered a 
little drizzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a little rain. Then lots of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 They kept pedaling. 
</P>
<P>
 It started to hail big, icy balls. 
</P>
<P>
 They kept pedaling. 
</P>
<P>
 The hailstones left welts on their arms and foreheads, but they finally made 
it to Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swore I would never live in Italy again," Armstrong recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong is living in Italy again and plans to continue to do so every year 
during the spring and summer months, when he is spinning across Europe as 
America's best road racer since Greg LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
 In his rookie season last year, Armstrong won the world road racing 
championship in Oslo, Norway, by sprinting past the sport's biggest names in 
the final kilometers. He became the only American beside LeMond to have won the 
prestigious event, elevating his stature far beyond expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone should have known better. It was enough of a struggle to acclimate to 
Italian culture, much less become a dominating figure on the cycling scene in a 
year's time. So when Armstrong, 22, lines up to defend his world championship 
Sunday in Sicily, it will be the climax to a disappointing second season. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most frustrating was his failure to win America's premier event, the 
Tour Du Pont, last May. Motorola put great emphasis on winning it, but 
Armstrong was second to Viatcheslav Ekimov when the Russian gained a large 
advantage during the first time trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong's best race also ended in disappointment. He placed second in the 
Liege-Bastogne-Liege one-day classic last April when Eugeni Berzin of Russia 
sprinted past him about four kilometers from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong was among the top 10 during the early stages of the Tour de France, 
but dropped out before the serious mountain climbs. Motorola coaches said they 
had planned it that way. They did not want his confidence to erode with 
devastating defeats in the French Alps. Their idea is to bring him along 
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 But cycling purists cared little about development and youth. They expected 
Armstrong to ride like a world champion as long as he wore the special 
rainbow-striped jersey signifying his stature. That meant finishing what he 
started -- no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 That jersey has done in others. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what event -- whether a major spring classic or an out-of-the-way 
local race -- the man in the rainbow jersey will be chased, shadowed and boxed 
every kilometer of the route. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure is nerve-racking, particularly if the cyclist is struggling and a 
threat to no one but himself. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the world championship last August, Armstrong wanted to show he 
was worthy of the jersey. So, by the time the season began in January with a 
tour in Mexico, he was exhausted. The O-word was blamed. He had overtrained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just said, 'I can't ride bad with the rainbow jersey,' Armstrong said last 
spring. "I shot myself in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
 There was more to it than the pressure of fulfilling competitive expectations. 
By virtue of his title, Armstrong was thrust into the forefront of the American 
cycling scene. Taking the torch from LeMond, a three-time Tour de France 
winner, increased the tension. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond had given the sport a boost in the United States since 1986, when he 
won his first Tour. But when he lost his edge in 1992, the industry was 
desperate for a new face to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
 At 22, Armstrong was not ready to assume the role. 
</P>
<P>
 A convert from the triathlon, he needed time to mature in the comfort and 
obscurity of his Motorola teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 His first year, after all, had been a long, difficult climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone remembers the World Championships, but 12 months earlier Armstrong 
had felt the sting of disappointment by placing 14th at the Barcelona Olympics, 
where he had been favored. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in his professional debut shortly thereafter, Armstrong finished last 
among 111 competitors at the San Sebastian Classic in northern Spain. As he 
struggled up the final ascent, Spanish fans lining the road mocked him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging on was his first victory. After that, he began improving, little by 
little, on the roads. And then came the notice in 1993. And soon the rainbow 
jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 And that only brought trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you hear from these guys, 'Oh, the curse. The rainbow jersey weighs 20 
pounds,' " Armstrong said. "I got really scared and worried about that. I was 
not going to let anything interfere with my training." 
</P>
<P>
 So, on "Lance Armstrong Day" in Austin last winter, Armstrong could not be 
found during the ceremony. He was cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Episodes such as that gave Armstrong a bad reputation when all he was trying 
to do was protect himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people forget that I'm just 22," he said. "They are expecting you to 
be a 40-year-old politician." 
</P>
<P>
 That has never been his style. He's always had the tact of a bowling shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong went to Europe with Texas bravado, telling the cycling press how he 
would overwhelm the Euro competition. Those who had ridden for years on the 
circuit were a bit insulted. They wanted more humility from an American. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong might never replace LeMond as a cycling icon, but he will compete on 
his terms. 
</P>
<P>
 What is best for the sport? 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it a guy who wears his helmet every day?" Armstrong asked. "Is it a guy 
who never says a bad word? Is it a guy who has no character? Or is it a guy who 
wins races? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be everybody's dream boy. I'm going to win bike races and if 
that's your dream, then I'm your dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Just when it seems he is finished, he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cyclists as a whole are just not exactly cutting-edge-type people. I don't 
want to say they're nerds, but they don't understand personalities very well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't want to be Charles Barkley. Deion Sanders is not the answer 
either. You have to have a personality, but you also have to have some 
(decorum)." 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond, who handled outside pressures as well as any world-famous athlete, 
sees a younger version of himself in Armstrong. LeMond said that before a 
hunting accident in 1986 altered his career, he wanted to win every race he 
entered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like Lance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His advice to Armstrong: Start picking objectives because it is impossible to 
succeed in all facets of cycling. For LeMond, that meant foregoing the spring 
classics to win the Tour de France, which led to greater spoils and plenty of 
criticism that he was not a complete racer. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong may do the opposite. So far, he has shown more potential in the 
one-day races than in the major tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong still is serving an apprenticeship. But he is trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Since breaking up with a Texas girlfriend, Armstrong has spent the season with 
a Dutch rider, Danielle Overgaag. That has helped. So has the familiarity with 
the cultural milieu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming less foreign to me," he said, his twang sounding softer around 
the edges. 
</P>
<P>
 It might never replace Texas, but for now, it is home. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he keeps pedaling.

 O.C. AIR: Quarterbacks from Orange County will make their presence felt in the 
Pacific 10 Conference this year. Three starters and two key reserves played 
high school football here. A series beginning Sunday in The Times assesses the 
area as a breeding ground for top quarterbacks and looks at the three starters 
-- Steve Stenstrom (Stanford, El Toro), Rob Johnson (USC, El Toro) and Danny 
O'Neil (Oregon, Mater Dei) -- and the potential stars of tomorrow -- Tim Carey 
(Stanford, Los Alamitos) and Pat Barnes (Cal, Trabuco Hills).

LITTMAN IS MAKING HIS SHARE OF SAVES; SOCCER: SALSA GOALIE HAS LEARNED HOW TO 
HANDLE HIS ROLE AND IS SECOND IN THE LEAGUE WITH A 0.7 GOALS-AGAINST AVERAGE 
DESPITE SHARING JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Salsa goalkeeper Mike Littman dived quickly to his left, stretched toward the 
goal post and hoped for the best. Nice effort, but no luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Littman, in his second season with the organization, allowed a goal early in 
the first half against Vancouver on Aug. 21. Quick scores can rattle the best 
goalkeepers, let alone a journeyman battling for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Although disappointed, Littman kept his cool -- and got tough. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't let another ball into the net, stopping four hard 86er shots and 
helping the Salsa win, 2-1. The performance reminded Littman how far he's come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I might have been down after I gave up a goal," Littman said. "I 
would have worried about making mistakes in the rest of the game. But I'm a lot 
stronger now mentally. I believe I can still win now." 
</P>
<P>
 And so does the Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Salsa's reserve team a season ago, Littman is one of two 
goalkeepers on the big club. Littman's strong performance in net has 
contributed to two consecutive victories and a major boost in his confidence. 
He hopes to continue his sound play at 7:35 p.m. tonight when the Salsa plays 
at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never play as well as you possibly can, there's always room for 
improvement, but I think I'm playing pretty solid right now," Littman said. 
"I've waited for my chance, and now that I have it I'm performing well." 
</P>
<P>
 How well? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: Littman is among the statistical leaders at his position despite 
having played the second-fewest minutes of all goalkeepers with at least 300 
minutes, the minimum number needed to qualify for consideration by the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has very good desire," Salsa goalkeeper coach Zaky Abdel said. "He has 
learned (a lot) and he will keep improving." 
</P>
<P>
 Littman is 4-1 with two shutouts for the Salsa (6-5-1), who are in third place 
in the American Professional Soccer League. He allows an average of less than 
one goal (0.7), second-best in the league. In 472 minutes, Littman has given up 
four goals and has 23 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole team is giving me a lot of help," Littman said. "All the guys are 
making it real easy for me to make saves." 
</P>
<P>
 That's nice, but Littman has had a hand in things, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa had lost three of its previous four games before Littman provided a 
spark last week with a 3-0 shutout of league champion Colorado (Aug. 13) and 
the victory over Vancouver. Several players said the team is currently playing 
its best soccer this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are starting to come together," Littman said. "Everyone is starting to 
get into a positive frame of mind and the guys are feeling more confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Littman knows the benefit of mental fortitude. A graduate of Cal State 
Northridge, Littman (6 feet 1, 195 pounds) became a professional in 1987. He 
has played for several teams, but had not stood out at any stop. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the Cobras, the Salsa's reserve squad, last season, Littman 
learned a lot about patience. He watched as the Salsa celebrated during a 
playoff run that ended against Colorado in the title game with a 3-1 overtime 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking on from the inside was particularly frustrating, especially since 
Littman believed he could contribute. But instead of hanging his head, Littman 
watched the Salsa goalkeepers to try and improve his own game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot being a backup," Littman said. "I got a better understanding 
of the game and things to do in certain situations. Last season has paid off 
for this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed with Littman's approach, Salsa brass gave him the opportunity to win 
one of two goalkeeper roster spots for 1994. Littman did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 He shares the position with Bob Ammann, who also shared the position in 1993. 
Like most athletes, Littman would prefer being the starter every game. 
Considering the position he was in last season, however, Littman can deal with 
the present situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a job to do," he said, "and I'm going to do it as well as I can 
whenever I'm called on."

RAMS TO DISCUSS RELEASING HENLEY RATHER THAN FACE CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams are seriously considering the possibility of releasing cornerback 
Darryl Henley instead of committing to a $1-million bond that would free Henley 
to travel with the team this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's bail restrictions on an indictment of cocaine possession and 
distribution prevented him from joining the team in San Diego's Jack Murphy 
Stadium Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge's ruling last week granted Henley permission to travel with the Rams 
with an increase in bail from $200,000 to $1 million, and with the proviso that 
a probation officer be with him at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are concerned that the presence of a probation officer -- on the team 
plane, in team meetings and along the sideline -- might represent a 
considerable distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 A team official, who expressed serious concern about the $1-million bond, said 
the matter would be discussed Saturday in order to reach a determination before 
Sunday's required cut from 60 to 53 players. T.J. SIMERS

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NATION; LIBERTY BOWL HAS OWN 
ALLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five independents announced an agreement to compete among themselves to become 
host team for the Liberty Bowl in Memphis. Athletic directors from the 
University of Memphis, Cincinnati, Southern Mississippi, Tulane and East 
Carolina said the agreement gives their schools an unusually good shot at a 
bowl berth and could also help in efforts to form a new football conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which participants call the "Liberty Bowl alliance," covers 
this year's game on Dec. 31 and next year's Liberty Bowl. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Three Fresno State players were put on indefinite probation for run-ins with 
the law but will be allowed to play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are reserve linebacker Chris Burk, who is charged with mayhem for 
allegedly biting off part of a man's lip during a barroom fight; starting 
linebacker Gene Smith, who is charged with petty theft of vitamins from a 
health food store, and starting linebacker Ron Papazian, whom police are 
investigating for alleged shoplifting of garden supplies from a hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Gary Cunningham said the players were given probations to 
"assure we don't have further problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham also said, "I don't believe our football program is out of control. 
I know the controls. I know the discipline Coach (Jim) Sweeney has."

IOC LOOKING TOWARD TRULY MODERN GAMES; OLYMPICS: THE 12TH CONGRESS MAY ADD 
SEVERAL NEW SPORTS AND ALSO PICK A LONG-SOUGHT REPLACEMENT FOR FORMER USOC 
PRESIDENT ROBERT HELMICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One hundred years after a French baron, Pierre de Coubertin, welcomed sports 
leaders from throughout the world to the Sorbonne for the first official 
session of the International Olympic Committee, their contemporary counterparts 
will gather in Paris to contemplate the modern Olympic movement's second 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 After the IOC's executive board ends discussion of current business in 
meetings that begin today, the entire membership and more than 2,000 others 
considered part of the movement's extended family will join in a six-day 
Centennial Congress that opens Monday with a ceremony at the Palais de 
Paris-Bercy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the IOC scheduled the 12th Congress, the first in 13 years, one of its 
intentions was to establish a program of sports for the modern Olympics that 
was truly modern. 
</P>
<P>
 But virtually all of the sports considered endangered -- archery, equestrian, 
synchronized swimming, rhythmic gymnastics and modern pentathlon -- appear to 
have saved themselves, either through crusades by their supporters or 
popularizing rule changes. So it could be that the only changes in the program 
for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, will be additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports most often mentioned for inclusion are triathlon and taekwondo, but 
officials from eight others -- water skiing, parachuting, bowling, golf, 
racquetball, squash, karate and roller hockey -- are also here to campaign. 
Whether they have succeeded will be determined in an IOC vote during a two-day 
session that begins here on the day after the Congress closes. 
</P>
<P>
 The IOC also is expected to decide during that session on 10 new members, 
among them one from the United States to fill the vacancy created when former 
U.S. Olympic Committee president Robert Helmick resigned under a 
conflict-of-interest cloud in 1991. Because the IOC and the USOC have been 
unable to agree upon a replacement acceptable to both, the IOC since has had 
only one U.S. representative, Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 DeFrantz, however, has insisted that a new member should be elected at this 
session, in part to assist her with efforts to win support within the IOC for 
Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Lake City, which lost its campaign for the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano, 
Japan, by only three votes, is considered the favorite among nine cities that 
will formally introduce their candidacies to the IOC's executive board 
Saturday. The IOC will determine the site for 2002 in a vote June 16 at 
Budapest, Hungary.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; THIS QUARTERBACK ALSO HAD A GOOD '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brad Otton, the sophomore quarterback who will back up Rob Johnson this year, 
also had a pretty good 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6 Otton passed for 2,307 yards, 15 touchdowns and completed 58.3% 
of his passes last season -- for Weber State in Ogden, Utah. Otton feared Weber 
State was on track to drop its football program after last season and 
transferred to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 He's eligible because he transferred from a Division I-AA school to a Division 
I-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton began last season as a backup, but won the starting job in Weber State's 
fifth game. He led his team to five consecutive victories and had a 536-yard 
passing game against Northern Arizona in a 67-28 win. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weber State's football program was sinking in red ink, with home games 
drawing an average of only 4,800. The school's board debated dropping the 
sport, then decided to continue funding for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton was a redshirt his first year at Weber State, in 1990, then spent two 
years in Italy on a Mormon mission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore defensive tackle Matt Keneley had the team's highest grade-point 
average after the spring semester, a 3.93. Junior center Jeremy Hogue was 
second at 3.85. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, 20 of USC's 26 1993 seniors graduated last June, including first-round 
NFL picks Willie McGinest and Johnnie Morton. According to sports information 
director Tim Tessalone, only 11 of 29 NFL first-rounders graduated last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, you couldn't find a college football practice field without a 
rope-climb setup. Knute Rockne was a 1920s advocate of the drill, and 
encouraged rope-climb competition among his Notre Dame players.  
</P>
<P>
 Now USC has brought the old-fashioned, low-tech drill back. At a cost of 
$5,000, a 22-foot-high rope climb apparatus was installed this summer at Howard 
Jones Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defensive coaches felt we needed it, to increase grip and arm strength," 
said strength coach Jim Strom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most troublesome injuries still belong to tailback Leonard Green 
(hamstring), center Robert Loya (foot) and tight end Jeff Diltz (knee). All 
have missed multiple practices and all are uncertain participants in the Sept. 
3 opener with Washington. EARL GUSTKEY

PREP FOOTBALL STAR VAN BUREN RECEIVES SIX-MONTH JAIL SENTENCE AFTER SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's leading high school pass receiver will spend the next six months 
in jail after being sentenced Thursday for shooting through a door at his 
girlfriend's home last April. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Newbury Park football star Leodes Van Buren was also given five years' 
probation for firing a handgun through the locked glass door while his 
girlfriend, Marcie James, stood only three feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark said the 19-year-old deserved a 
jail term because of his lack of public remorse and for coercing James, whom he 
married in July, to change her account of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, who broke all state receiving records last fall at Newbury Park 
High, had faced up to three years in state prison, but could have received a 
six-month suspended sentence. He had no previous felony record. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren asked to begin serving his sentence immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, John B. Miller Jr., said Van Buren lost his full scholarship to 
the University of Colorado after he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren hopes to win another scholarship to a different school in the spring 
or next fall, Miller added. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, a Ventura County jury found Van Buren guilty of firing into an 
occupied dwelling. Attorneys said the key evidence included audiotapes of the 
football player and James, identifying Van Buren as the shooter. JULIE FIELDS

PHONE CHATTER COMES BACK AS A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phone Chatter, last year's 2-year-old filly champion, made her first start in 
10 months Thursday and rallied from last to win the $55,600 C.E.R.F. Stakes by 
a length over Airistar at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Laffit Pincay and carrying 117 pounds, Phone Chatter covered 6 1/2 
furlongs in 1:15. She paid $3, $2.60, $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Airistar returned $4 and $3, while Klassy Kim, another half-length back in 
third, was $3.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone Chatter hadn't competed since fracturing her hind leg while winning the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies on Nov. 6. She won the Eclipse Award as the 
nation's top 2-year-old filly.

'MASSACRE OF A PRESEASON' ENDS, SEASON LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, we interrupt this exciting NFL exhibition season to bring you a news flash 
on the Rams, a team on the move. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they're not loading the moving vans and headed to Baltimore or St. Louis, 
at least not yet. But they are headed down another road they have come to know 
quite well. 
</P>
<P>
 To nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams capped off their second-consecutive 0-4 exhibition season with a 24-6 
loss to the San Diego Chargers Thursday night at Jack Murphy Stadium. So with a 
nine-game exhibition losing streak under their belts, can another 5-11 season 
be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely certain that you will see a different team next week," 
linebacker Shane Conlan said of the Rams' regular-season opener against the 
Arizona Cardinals Sept. 4 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we do that, everybody will forget about this massacre of a preseason we 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan and the rest of the Rams' first-string defense were searching for 
explanations after giving up 24 first-half points to a Charger offense led by, 
drum roll please, quarterbacks Stan Humphries and Gale Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's Stan Humphries, ranked 22nd in the league in passing efficiency 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 New England, San Diego and the Raiders have scored a combined 58 points on the 
Rams' first-string defense in the past five quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries burned the Rams for two first half touchdowns before giving way in 
the second quarter to Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's Gale Gilbert, who hasn't played in a regular-season game since 
1990, when he was a third-stringer with Buffalo. Gilbert polished off a 24-3 
halftime lead for the Chargers by hitting tight end Al Pupunu over the middle 
for a four-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Pupunu came up with one of the more interesting touchdown celebrations, 
holding the ball up to his mouth and chugging from it like it was a mug a beer. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not tip a few to the Chargers? After an 0-4 start, they avoided their 
first winless exhibition season in club history by beating the visitors from up 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 With starting defensive tackle Sean Gilbert and defensive end Gerald Robinson 
on the sidelines nursing sprained ankles from last week, the Rams got very 
little heat on Charger quarterbacks, which made for easy pickings once again on 
the Rams' starting cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Lyght got beat by Charger wide receiver Mark Seay, a former Long Beach 
State player, for an eight-yard touchdown in the first quarter. Seay caught the 
ball at the five and dove over Lyght, who was playing five yards off the 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Israel got beat for a touchdown for the second consecutive game when 
Shawn Jefferson grabbed a pass from Humphries for a 22-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's frustrating," Lyght said of the Rams' pass rush. "But we can't 
get upset about it because we played a lot of young guys on the line tonight."

DEL MAR; BIG-MONEY RACES AT ARLINGTON DRAW SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

 Rodney Rash cannot turn a corner on Arlington International's backstretch 
without running into a familiar face. In some cases, it might even be a human 
being. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie's here and Mike Mitchell and Jenine and myself," Rash said. "And I 
know a few others are on the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rash, Charlie Whittingham, Mitchell and Jenine Sahadi are Southern 
California trainers with horses entered in Arlington's International Festival 
of Racing. Bobby Frankel has an entry as well. Pat Valenzuela, Chris Antley, 
Gary Stevens, Alex Solis, Kent Desormeaux and Eddie Delahoussaye will all be 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
 Rash, of course, did not go to Arlington Heights, Ill., for the camaraderie. 
When his horses hit Arlington, it was more like a cavalry charge than an 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 He has four horses entered in the three big-money races scheduled for the 
weekend -- Alex The Great and Blues Traveller in the Arlington Million, User 
Friendly in the $500,000 Beverly D and Saltgrass in the $400,000 Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
 However, getting four thoroughbreds from Del Mar to suburban Chicago is not 
quite like packing up the kiddies and taking them to Disney World, especially 
when it comes to cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his horses may be frequent fliers, they are not members of the club. 
The cost for shipping the four horses will run between $25,000 and $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering what we're running for," Rash said, "you're talking peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The main expense is air fare, plus "cabs" from the barn to the airport on one 
end and airport to barn on the other end. Food costs the same at home or away, 
since thoroughbreds get room service at both places. 
</P>
<P>
 Accommodations are paid for by Arlington for both horses and trainers, the 
latter in a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice weekend," said the 35-year-old trainer. "And there's certainly a 
lot of money to be won." 
</P>
<P>
 Big money hardly translates to easy money. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the three toughest races they've ever had," Rash said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Rash was thinking about entering three horses in the biggest and 
toughest of the bunch. He had Blues Traveller and Alex The Great set for the 
Million, and he was considering running the mare, User Friendly, in the Million 
as well. The size of the Million field made the decision for him and he 
squeezed User Friendly into the Beverly D. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, User Friendly must only contend with the likes of 
Flawlessly, Whittingham's mare, as well as Corrazona, Potridee and European 
invader Hatoof. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Million, Rash's horses will be up against Paradise Creek, the top turf 
horse; another European invader, Muhtarran, and familiar names such as Fanmore, 
Fastness and Star Of Cozzene. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not all," Rash said. "This is a field with good depth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Secretariat, at a mere $400,000, is almost the weekend's stepchild. 
Saltgrass, the winner of half of the split Oceanside Stakes here opening day, 
will represent Rash in the race for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got good horses you can't duck good horses," Rash said. "User 
Friendly has beaten the best before. Alex The Great is getting better and 
better. Blues Traveller can run with the best. And I've been itching to run 
Saltgrass at a mile and a quarter. I'm looking forward to the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 When the weekend ends, Rash will be focusing on the next weekend. That would 
be Labor Day at Del Mar, when he will have entrants in Sunday's $250,000 Del 
Mar Handicap and Monday's $300,000 Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarone, coming off a third-place finish in the Escondido Handicap on Aug. 8, 
will go in the Del Mar Handicap for older horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was the best that last start," Rash said. "But he got shut off 
on the turn. He had an easy race, though, and he'll get to drop some weight, so 
I think he'll come out ready to tear up the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Rash will have two horses in the Derby, Powis Castle and Blue Grass Prince. 
Powis Castle and Saltgrass gave Rash a sweep of the Oceanside Stakes and Blue 
Grass Prince is a highly acclaimed English import. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility exists that the Derby will be split into two fields, at 
$225,000 each, and Rash relishes the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won both ends opening day," he said. "Why not do it again?"

 ESPN's Chris Mortensen reported Thursday night that St. Louis beer distributor 
Jerry Clinton, whose minority ownership in the city's stadium lease has stalled 
negotiations with the Rams, was at the Rams-San Diego game to meet with Ram 
President John Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 As he watched the report in the owner's box at Jack Murphy Stadium, Shaw said: 
"That's news to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw was expecting Carolina Panther owner Jerry Richardson as a guest in the 
owner's box Thursday night. 
</P>

 Mortensen's report focused on plans by the Baltimore ownership group, led by 
Oriole owner Peter Angelos, to renew attempts to lure the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
Tampa Bay owner Hugh Culverhouse died Thursday of lung cancer. MIKE REILLEY and

NHL OWNERS ARE PREPARED FOR LOCKOUT; HOCKEY: IF THERE IS NO PROGRESS SOON IN 
STALLED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TALKS, COMMISSIONER SAYS TRAINING CAMPS WILL NOT 
OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, attempting to inject urgency into collective 
bargaining talks with players, has imposed a deadline of Labor Day weekend to 
see appreciable progress in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 If no movement has resulted by then, he will authorize a training-camp 
lockout, a course that was endorsed by club executives at a board of governors 
meeting Wednesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not saber-rattling," an NHL official said. "He (Bettman) is afraid 
the season is at risk without substantive collective bargaining talks. There's 
still a lot of time to make a deal and a lot of willingness to sit and talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's Toronto Star said Bettman had the full backing of his owners to 
initiate a lockout should negotiations remain stalemated. Players are due to 
report to camp for physicals on Sept. 4 and workouts the next day. The season 
is scheduled to open Oct. 1. The sides have not met since last Thursday and are 
not scheduled to meet again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman's intention is to negotiate throughout camp and into the season should 
the talks progress within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going into it with our eyes open," the Star quoted an unidentified 
owner as saying about the possibility of a lockout. "We know it could last 
months and the season could be at risk. No one wants that, but it's better to 
bring the issue to a head now than to go through what baseball is facing (a 
midseason strike)." 
</P>
<P>
 Players have been without a contract for more than a year. Mike Gartner of the 
Toronto Maple Leafs, president of the NHL Players Assn., said players are 
prepared to begin this season without a new pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're talking about a lockout, it's a very aggressive step," Gartner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., said he had not 
received any notice of a possible lockout and refused to speculate on Bettman's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not heard officially from the league on what his plans may or may not 
be," Goodenow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The key difference is the owners' desire to link salaries to revenue. The NBA 
and NFL do so in the form of salary caps, a term Bettman is reluctant to apply 
to the NHL. However, players insist a salary cap by any other name is equally 
restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clearly want an agreement, but there's one major principle (revenue-salary 
linkage) that is a non-starter for us and we can't seem to get over it," 
Goodenow said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arthur Pincus, the NHL's senior vice president for public relations: "If 
negotiations fall apart, it isn't because we are asking for a salary cap. . . . 
Our intention is to make a deal and we are totally focused on making a deal."

IRONMAN BERTH COMES AS A SURPRISE; TRIATHLON: FOOTHILL HIGH TEACHER STEVE 
ROCHFORD QUALIFIED FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS EVENT. NOW HE HAS TO GET READY FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Steve Rochford might as well be Clark Kent when he stands in front of his 
students at Foothill High. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the facade of teaching business classes, Rochford is a man of steel . . 
. er, iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprising even himself, Rochford qualified for the Ironman Triathlon World 
Championships in Hawaii in October. 
</P>
<P>
 From among the 20,000 or so athletes who annually try to qualify for one of 
the most prestigious titles in sport, Rochford emerged from Mike and Rob's Most 
Excellent Triathlon Aug. 14 in Ventura as an Ironman qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
 It caught him off guard -- way off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I was surprised," Rochford said. "I knew I would never win my 
division -- not this early (in my career)." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochford, a history buff, said he ran his first triathlon June 6, 1993 -- in 
memory of Robert Kennedy, who had died 25 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to watch the Ironman on TV and thought it would be so incredible to do 
something like that, but I never thought it would be something for me until I 
started doing some 5 and 10Ks just for the fun of it," Rochford said. "I knew 
how incredibly grueling it was. Last year when I did my first triathlon, I 
decided I wanted to work toward that. If I just finished (the Ironman), I'd be 
the happiest person on earth, even if I finished dead last." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he didn't win his age division -- providing automatic entry into the 
Ironman -- Rochford met the qualifying standards and was one of four at-large 
lottery winners from the Rob and Mike, which was half the distance of the 
Ironman. 
</P>
<P>
 So Rochford won the right to face a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bike ride 
and a 26.2-mile run. In all, it's 140.6 miles of hell in paradise to be 
completed within 17 hours. If not, you're disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 The swim is no problem. The run is no problem. It's the bike ride he fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biking was so much more difficult than I anticipated (in the Rob and 
Mike)," Rochford said. "Cardiovascularly, I wasn't that tired, but my legs and 
hips started breaking down, and that was only half of what the Ironman is, so 
now I know what the pain is going to be like. And if you're not off the bike in 
10 1/2 hours, they disqualify you." 
</P>
<P>
 He finished the Mike and Rob triathlon in 5 hours 59 minutes 42 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochford was on the bike about 3 1/2 hours in Ventura -- his target is eight 
hours for the Ironman, in which he will face headwinds up to 35 m.p.h. and a 
dozen hills of 6% grade -- or more -- that last a half mile to a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 His target time is 15 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochford actually predicted in March that he would be an Ironman competitor. 
Three sophomore students were looking at a collage of triathlon items that 
Rochford had put on a wall in his classroom, and the students asked their 
teacher what it was all about. And they asked if Rochford would compete in the 
sport's most prestigious event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I can do it this year," he told them, setting the stage for a 
promise, "but I'm going to do it before you graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochford thought he was a couple of years away. It was closer to a couple of 
months. He and his wife, Nycole, had budgeted a trip to Kansas to see his 
father at Thanksgiving a week before the Rob and Mike, not realizing -- or even 
remotely anticipating -- that they would need that money to make the Ironman 
trip. The airline tickets to Kansas, of course, were non-refundable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really unexpected," Rochford said. "Now we're just trying to throw 
things together. Financially, we didn't plan on it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to play basketball (at Ocean View High) and wasn't that good, but I'm 
disciplined enough to run and swim and bike and work hard and get better. But 
in basketball, I could work hard and I still stunk. This is something I can do 
and be good at at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ironman competitor usually trains seven months and swims, on average, 
seven miles per week during training, rides 232 miles and runs 48. Rochford 
will train two months and average seven miles swimming, 140 on the bike and run 
48. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watch people on TV cross the finish line," Rochford said, "and they seem so 
happy and relieved, and it seems like you reach the pinnacle of athletic 
achievement, and I want to say that I crossed the finish line of the Ironman." 
</P>
<P>
 He's hoping an iron will is enough to get him there.

RATCLIFFE'S OVERTIME GOAL GETS SPLASH PAST WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite one of his worst performances of the season, Paul Ratcliffe was a hero 
Thursday, scoring the game-winning goal with 1 1/2 minutes left in overtime in 
the Splash's 10-9 victory against Washington in front of 5,939 at USAir Arena 
in Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratcliffe and Denis Hamlett scored fourth-quarter goals to give the Splash a 
9-7 lead, but Dante Washington scored two sixth-attacker goals, one with 29 
seconds remaining, to send the game into a 10-minute extra period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (18-6) reduced its magic number to win the Continental Indoor 
Soccer League's Western Division title to two over San Diego . "We were tired 
and a little shellshocked going into the overtime, but this team has a deep 
passion for the game. . . . ," Splash Coach George Fernandez said. "Once you 
get into overtime, the only thing that's going to keep you in the game and take 
you over the top is hard work and a big heart. Tonight, we had both." 
</P>
<P>
 They also had a little luck, as the Warthogs (10-12) twice hit the crossbar 
while on a power play; the Splash killed the penalty, setting the stage for 
Ratcliffe at 8:32. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic because it was one of his worst games; he struggled all night," 
Fernandez said of Ratcliffe, who had two goals and an assist. "You can't look 
at a stat sheet and see how good he played. He just happened to be in the right 
place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Splash defender Ralph Black had two goals and two assists; his first goal gave 
him 350 career points in his 13-year indoor career. MARTIN HENDERSON

FIRST DAY OF PRACTICE KICKS OFF A NEW ERA FOR CHAPMAN; FOOTBALL: ERNIE CHAPMAN, 
A TACKLE ON 1932 TEAM AND SON OF THE SCHOOL FOUNDER, IS AMONG THOSE DRAWN TO 
WITNESS BIRTH OF DIVISION III PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Ernie Chapman walked across the field at Chapman University Thursday 
morning toting a video camera, the past met the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie was a tackle on Chapman's last football team, which played in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 At 83, he was there Thursday to bridge a 62-year gap by watching the next 
generation of Chapman football players go through their first day of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman is the son of Charles C. Chapman, who founded the college. Young Ernie 
played for the school when it was called California Christian College and was 
based in Los Angeles. The team had about 25 members when it was disbanded, 
mainly because of the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Six decades later, Chapman was there to see it reborn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's utterly amazing," he said. "This is exciting. I'm really looking forward 
to the game here. I think it's going to do a lot for the student body, giving 
them the main sport. . . . In our day, you used to push a (blocking sled) up 
and down the field. That was our scrimmage. We couldn't risk getting anyone 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 When the announcement was made about 2 1/2 years ago that Chapman again would 
field a team, Ernie Chapman said he hoped perhaps 40 players would try out. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ken Visser was hired as coach in December, he said he would be thrilled 
if he could get 60 to show up. But last spring and over the summer, it became 
clear that the number would be closer to 100. 
</P>
<P>
 The official total Thursday was 112. The Panthers, playing on the NCAA 
Division III level, open the season Sept. 17 at Whittier College. The first 
home game is Sept. 24 against Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started," Athletic Director Dave Currey said, "we anticipated trying 
to get 60 or 70. Any more would be a logistic dream for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "But why shouldn't we have this many, with (Cal State) Fullerton and Long 
Beach (State) dropping their programs, we're the only four-year team around 
(Orange County)." 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the program, like the start of practice, has received a great 
deal of attention. The program's rebirth will be featured in the September 
issue of Orange Coast Magazine and CNN has called about doing a story. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 9 a.m. Thursday, several players were already on the field waiting to 
get started. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day had begun much earlier for Visser. He awoke well before dawn, 
eager for his first day with his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was up at 4 (a.m.)," Visser said. "I just woke up and my eyes went 'Boing!' 
I was wide awake from then on." He arrived at the campus at 6:45 and went over 
paperwork until the team's breakfast at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 The players started to drift out to the field, which recently underwent a 
$500,000 face-lift, a little before 9. From that point on, the most popular 
question was "What time is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Close to 9:30, Chapman's first official practice began with the sharp sound of 
a whistle. The players wore black helmets, white shirts for offense, black for 
defense and black shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman is bringing together players from all over and from all backgrounds. 
Many of the key players are expected to be community college transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically," said Travis Carter, a junior from Cerritos College, "what I saw 
out here today convinced me that this is the No. 1 first-year program. I came 
here because I would have a chance to start and not have to compete against 
guys that have been in the program for two or three years. Everyone is from, 
basically, different areas but we are pulling together." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them hadn't met before a team meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea how good we're going to be," said Efriam Miranda, a defensive 
lineman from Orange Coast College and Tustin High School. "Now, the most 
important thing for us is getting to know each other and to trust each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Darin Beard, a freshman defensive end from Sunny Hills High, came to Chapman 
because it "felt right." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working hard all summer to get ready for this," he said. "I'm up 
with the big boys now." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice went smoothly for the most part, with no injuries and only two 
players needing attention because of the heat-related problems. Chapman also 
held a second practice Thursday night. The players will switch to full pads 
Sunday. Classes begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's the first day," Visser said. "But I wish we would have executed a 
little a little better on offense. But it sure is a lot of fun to finally get 
rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone walking on campus near the field, the most distinctive voice 
belonged to defensive line coach Bill Yurak. 
</P>
<P>
 His best moment came when the Panthers lined up to run wind sprints at the end 
of practice. After a few 60-yard runs, Yurak noticed the players slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 When they stepped to the line he asked them twice, "Are you people tired yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," they panted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then give me a growl," he screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the players did their best panther imitations, Yurak, a former Marine, 
looked at Visser and said, "We're ready, Coach."

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; WILL MEXICO'S ELECTION MAKE 
A DIFFERENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO and MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Bringing to an end nearly a year of political confusion, the Mexican elections 
concluded Monday with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) retaining the 
power it has claimed since 1929. PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo won the 
presidency with 50.03% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynical observers, sensing fraud, have staged protests in Mexico City over the 
manner in which the elections were held. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Zedillo's margin of victory, represents one of the lowest levels 
of support for any PRI president since the party's inception, which brings into 
question the level of confidence that the new administration enjoys from both 
the Mexican people and North American industries. 
</P>
<P>
 What's in store for Mexico's future and how will we be affected? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Shubb, president of King Travel in Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
 "(The elections) have only affected our business in the fact that there were a 
lot of Mexican citizens who went back to Mexico to vote. There are a lot of 
business people in Canoga Park and, as a result, there are several large 
business families. We had one whole family of 15 going to Guadalajara to cast 
their votes. People not familiar with traveling in Mexico always ask what the 
political situation is like down there. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the reports we've received from the Mexican Travel Bureau and other 
agencies indicate that things are safe. Chiapas is calm and the protest groups 
meeting in Mexico City have all been meeting quietly and organizing without 
violence. In general, travel to the resort areas of Mexico has been pretty 
substantial this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Tucker, financial consultant at Baraban Securities in Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "Selective Mexican issues have phenomenal possibilities. The most widely 
known, financially, is the TelMex telephone company, which recently traded very 
well at the New York Stock Exchange. As the Mexican infrastructure is 
developed, TelMex is going to expand quite dramatically. From an investment 
point of view, TelMex today is what AT&T was in the 1950s. Only two out of 10 
people own phones now, but that's going to change significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infrastructure development allows Mexico to have a substantial future over 
time. The economy is going to expand nicely as the buying power of the Mexican 
people improves. I think the PRI scenario was best in the elections. With the 
PRI still in power and with their plans to improve the economy, things are 
looking good for Mexico as long as those plans are successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, it doesn't matter who is in power as long as they focus on improving 
the lifestyle in Mexico and on improving the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 David Myhre, visiting research fellow at the Center for US-American Studies at 
UC San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing that we should be looking at is whether the election means the 
furthering of the democratization process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Organization of the party should be much more in terms of grass roots, in 
particular with the selection of candidates. . . . It's important to provide 
renewed emphasis on the election. It's clear there were many problems in rural 
areas and not just irregularities but pressure voting . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It means more of the same continuation of the present liberalizing of the 
Mexican economy in terms of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and 
NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the economic programs have been slow to bring benefits to people who 
are impoverished in Mexico. There definitely has to be something done, but not 
pushing Mexico to go too fast and too hard."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; COAST FEDERAL BANK MAY BUY HUGHES SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coast Federal Bank is negotiating with Hughes Aircraft Co. to buy the 
aerospace firm's sprawling Canoga Park campus to use as a headquarters after 
the research facility is shut down later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes will shut down missile engineering operations at the 86-acre facility 
Oct. 7 as part of a corporate restructuring that is moving many workers to a 
plant in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast executives have been negotiating with Hughes and Los Angeles city 
officials for several months to find larger quarters for some 700 workers now 
based in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bank will need only about half of the Canoga Park facility's 
843,000 square feet, spokesman David Porges said the extra space "allows us the 
room to accommodate future growth." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the bank would sell or lease out extra space. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieg Smith, chief deputy to Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, said his 
office has been working with Coast executives to find a new location since last 
year, trying to convince them not to leave the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the city might set up a nonprofit economic development corporation 
to buy the Hughes land, then sell parcels back to Coast and other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage to such an arrangement is that Hughes as well as potential 
purchasers would be eligible for special tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at some other businesses for whom this particular facility 
would be ideal," said Smith, who estimated the total price of the property at 
$10 million to $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 If the property is sold, a recreational facility built for Hughes employees 
would be turned over to the city for use as a public park. 
</P>
<P>
 If the buyer is Coast, Porges said the bank would transfer all operations 
except its executive offices in Los Angeles to Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to make the campus more attractive to potential buyers, Hughes 
spokesman Rand Christiansen said the company will ask Los Angeles officials 
next week to amend the property's conditional-use permit to allow financial and 
business services at the site. AARON CURTISS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CENTER BUILDER TO PUT OFFICE TRAILER ON SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The developer of Calabasas Promenade, a proposed large-scale commercial 
center, expects to move a mobile office trailer to the site in the next week or 
so to prepare for the groundbreaking, tentatively scheduled for the end of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving forward and we're just going to see how the chips fall into 
place," Pam Azar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing a trailer on the site will cost about $250,000 after landscaping 
and architectural costs are included, she said. The groundbreaking will come 
after she gets a financial commitment for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited about it," said City Councilman Marvin Lopata. "We approved 
it a couple of years ago because we thought it was a good project." 
</P>
<P>
 The 190,000-square-foot center will include an eight-screen, 2,000-seat 
theater. It is near the corner of Las Virgenes and Agoura roads. Azar said 
Wednesday that she is negotiating with a prospective tenant, Hughes Markets 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reached a tentative agreement in July and we are working on the details of 
the lease now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes would join Mann Theatres as one of two anchor tenants at the 
development, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azar, whose project was approved in November, 1992, is concerned that a 
proposed large-scale office and retail development about two miles away could 
become a major competitor.  
</P>
<P>
 "My position is that the retail is going to suffer enormously, because the 
area was too small to support both projects," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 A vote on Calabasas Park Centre, at Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas, has 
been delayed until late September while city officials and neighborhood 
associations work with the developer to scale down the project's size. FRANK 
MANNING

 A Canoga Park man who pleaded no contest to illegally disposing of hazardous 
waste was sentenced to 45 days on a Caltrans work crew, the city attorney's 
office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jafar Rassouli, 45, was ordered to pick up litter along the highway after his 
response to the charge of abandoning six drums of leftover paint at an 
automotive body shop in Sun Valley, the Los Angeles city attorney's office 
said.Deputy City Atty. Brooke White, who handled the case, said Rassouli left 
the hazardous paint behind after abandoning his automotive business.  
</P>
<P>
 "He just left it and walked away," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The six 55-gallon drums were highly flammable, White said, and should have 
been disposed of properly. The drums were discovered by the property's landlord 
after Rassouli had left his business, Best Auto Body. 
</P>
<P>
 A second defendant, Hamid Nadjafi, of Reseda, was cleared after he proved he 
had left the business before the violation occurred. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; SALVATION ARMY KICKS OFF NEW RECYCLING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Used clothes, toys and furniture won't be the only things that are recycled 
when a new curbside recycling program gets under way in the west San Fernando 
Valley next week. Organizers say the project will also help some people get a 
new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Salvation Army will begin a pilot program in which it will 
provide curbside pickup of donated items in selected neighborhoods in 
Northridge, Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Tarzana, Encino, Woodland Hills and West 
Hills. Money that is raised from sale of the donated goods will support the 
charity's drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderfully creative partnership between one of our most venerable 
nonprofits and the city of Los Angeles," City Councilwoman Laura Chick said at 
a kick-off ceremony at the Salvation Army's rehabilitation center in Canoga 
Park on Thursday. "It's yet another way we are finding in Los Angeles to divert 
materials from going into our landfills." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's public works department has spent $16,500 to provide the program 
with plastic collection bags and print informational flyers, which will be 
delivered next week to residents in the targeted areas. Beginning Sept. 6, the 
Salvation Army will begin picking up the bagged items, which people should set 
alongside their yellow recycling bins on their regular trash collection day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have great people in the community who want to help people and help the 
environment," said Nat Isaac, a city sanitation engineer who helped coordinate 
the program. Isaac said it took 18 months to iron out the legalities of the 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac predicted that the city will actually save money because, thanks to the 
reduced waste stream, Los Angeles will pay less in landfill user fees -- known 
as tip fees -- and will not have to build another landfill as soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 12,000 homes will have the service available for one year before it is 
evaluated for renewal or expansion. The city estimates that the program will 
keep 46 tons of reusable goods out of landfills per month. 
</P>
<P>
 That means 46 tons of goods will go instead to the Salvation Army's thrift 
shops for resale. That's good news for people like Larry Visakowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks ago, the temporarily homeless Visakowitz spent most of his days 
intoxicated on the streets of North Hollywood. The center has allowed him to 
begin pulling mind and body together, Visakowitz said. Many of the center's 
clients help repair or sort donated items, a form of therapy that helps keep 
them occupied and teaches them new skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Visakowitz said he is in favor of any effort to expand the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program gives us a lift up in terms of getting you back on your feet," he 
said. KAY HWANGBO

<P>
 A Canoga Park woman was sentenced to 90 days in jail for violating a ban on 
convicted prostitutes engaging in conversation or soliciting motorists during 
nighttime hours in areas of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Peaches Wilson, 40, was taken into custody about 10:15 Sunday in Canoga Park 
after she approached and solicited an undercover police officer, according to 
City Atty.James Hahn's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitutes on probation are prohibited from talking to motorists, asking for 
or accepting rides and being in parked cars with motorists between 5 p.m. and 6 
a.m. on certain segments of Sepulveda, Lankershim, Ventura and Reseda 
boulevards as well as Sherman Way, according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>

GRANADA HILLS WOMAN, 41, DROWNS IN NIGHT DIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-year-old Granada Hills woman who completed scuba training last week 
drowned during a night dive off the coast north of Malibu, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbi Jean Greenhead, who owns a Studio City video and audio post production 
company, became separated from her partner after entering the water Wednesday 
near Neptune's Net restaurant a mile south of Sycamore Cove, Ventura County 
Sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The partner, 39-year-old Patrisha Gyllenswan of Brentwood, left the water 
after her shoulder strap broke. Gyllenswan was helped out of the water by one 
of the dive masters, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gyllenswan noticed a diving light that was separate from the others and 
pointed it out to dive master Sigfus Sigurdsson, 25, of Manhattan Beach, who 
pulled the unconscious Greenhead from the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigurdsson began CPR, authorities said, until paramedics took over and 
transported Greenhead to St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, where 
she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sheriff's report, the divers were supposed to enter the water 
in pairs and all join together beyond the breakers. Greenhead and her partner 
were holding hands when Gyllenswan had the problem with her strap, the 
Sheriff's Department report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's husband, Richard Greenhead, said his wife had taken training 
classes that involved "textbook stuff" and had dived in a swimming pool. He did 
not know how many dives she had taken before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had made up her mind that she wanted to become a dive master," her 
husband said. "She loved the water."

MAN HELD IN CARPET SALES SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old Santa Clarita man was arrested for bilking seven San Fernando 
Valley residents out of $17,000 in a carpet-selling scam, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 James Anthony Cox was being held Thursday on $20,000 bail on seven counts of 
grand theft, said Lt. Joseph Garcia of the Los Angeles Police Department.Garcia 
said Cox posted flyers advertising discount carpeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
 He allegedly went to the homes of his intended victims, showed them sample 
carpet swatches and took measurements of their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox took in anywhere from $800 to $6,000 each in down payments and promised to 
return with the floor cover, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garcia said he never came back and didn't return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion, it was a straight-out scam," Garcia said. "All they saw was 
the little samples, they never saw the actual carpeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox made his final sale on Aug. 23, Garcia said, and was arrested that night 
at a Glendale bowling alley.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: YAROSLAVSKY WANTS INSURANCE, FEARS DISTRICT NOT IN GOOD 
HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA and HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A TEMP NEEDED: Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky recently floated 
the idea of a caretaker council member being temporarily appointed to replace 
him when he steps down from his post to become a member of the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 With a permanent, elected replacement probably not taking office until June at 
the earliest, the 5th District could be devoid of representation at City Hall 
for seven months.  
</P>
<P>
 That's too risky, Yaroslavsky and others have argued. 
</P>
<P>
 But some, including council President John Ferraro, have pooh-poohed the 
caretaker idea, insisting that 5th District constituents can rest easy in the 
expectation that their interests would be well protected by the council's other 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people believe that's a fairy tale. Witness, for example, the maneuvering 
last week of council member Mark Ridley-Thomas.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue was how to allocate $47 million in housing rehabilitation funds. A 
council committee had voted 2 to 1 in favor of a plan to provide $23 million 
for earthquake repairs (read: money for the Valley). However, committee 
chairman Ridley-Thomas, who represents South-Central Los Angeles, supported a 
plan to drop the earthquake allocation to $14.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted that the scheduling of full council votes on committee 
reports is decided by the committee chair -- in this case, Ridley-Thomas -- in 
consultation with Ferraro, the president. 
</P>
<P>
 With three San Fernando Valley lawmakers out of town, it was decided last week 
that the council would take up the allocation issue. The result: the 
Ridley-Thomas formula was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been a move to reconsider the vote, there continues to be a 
great gnashing of teeth in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly loud complaints came from Yaroslavsky, who presides over a 
district that includes quake-ravaged Sherman Oaks. A sneak attack, Yaroslavsky 
said by phone from British Columbia, Canada, where he was vacationing when the 
key vote went down. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some saw a silver lining. "That vote was the best advertising we could 
get for the need for a temporary council member," said Richard Close, president 
of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "It's a perfect example of how the 
district can be hurt when it has no vote." 
</P>
<P>
 What mischief might occur, Close wonders, should the 5th District remain 
leaderless for seven months? 
</P>
<P>
 MYSTERY COMMITTEE: GOP congressional candidate Gary Forsch doesn't know. It's 
an enigma to Jeff Pick. And U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) hasn't 
got a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery is who was behind a political committee called Democrats for Gary 
Forsch. This committee produced at least one piece of political mail for Forsch 
that went out in 1992, when the Sun Valley hardware store owner first ran 
against Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent check with the Federal Elections Committee unearthed no evidence 
that Democrats for Gary Forsch existed, much less ever filed a disclosure 
statement detailing its officers, contributors and expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 This mystery group, it is assumed, was an independent expenditure committee. 
Such committees enjoy wide fiscal latitude. Notably, individual contributors to 
such committees can give as much as $5,000 to their candidates. By contrast, 
$1,000 is the maximum an individual can donate directly to a congressional 
candidate's campaign finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the group's origins recently, Forsch said it was his understanding 
that Jeff Pick, a friend of his and the owner of a Northridge print shop, was 
head of the committee. But Pick subsequently denied this. Though he is a 
Democrat who supports Forsch, he is unable to shed light on the mystery, Pick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Will this committee surface again as Forsch runs against Berman again? "I hope 
so," Forsch laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE FALLOUT: City Controller Rick Tuttle clearly touched a nerve with Mayor 
Richard Riordan recently when he began to question whether the mayor was doing 
enough to help business recover from quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle pointed out that a disaster recovery plan signed by Riordan five days 
after the quake called for him to set up a hot line for aid and deploy business 
assistance teams to help proprietors get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But as of six months after the quake, no such teams had been assembled, Tuttle 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 When Riordan heard that the press had picked up on Tuttle's charges, he called 
Tuttle into his office for a verbal caning, according to City Hall insiders. 
The mayor's aides then announced that the hot line and the assistance teams 
would be in place by September. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's people did not stop there. Apparently determined to squelch any 
suggestion that Riordan had lost interest in the quake recovery, the mayor's 
staff led a full-court press to get the word out that he is committed to 
leading the rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In the month since Tuttle leveled his criticism, Riordan has announced he 
would hire an ombudsman to coordinate the city's efforts and has called three 
news conferences to promote new funding programs for quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 PROMISES TO KEEP: "Slush funds . . . nothing more than legalized laundering of 
money raised from special interests." That's what Laura Chick had to say about 
so-called officeholder committees in the spring of 1993 as she ran for the Los 
Angeles City Council against incumbent Joy Picus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eliminate car telephones for council staff," Chick said in the same six-point 
program for slashing council members' perks that she issued in the heat of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 So how has Chick performed on her program of fiscal reform and self-denial? 
</P>
<P>
 One of Chick's pledges was to reduce the use of city-owned cars by 3rd 
District council staff; another was she would refuse to accept the use of a 
luxury car if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, city officials confirm that Chick's office has only four city cars 
assigned to it, although each council office is authorized to receive seven. 
And Chick herself drives her own car. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick also pledged to slash 3rd District council staff by 25% and end pension 
benefits for future lawmakers (the job, she said, should not be a full-time, 
lifelong career). 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Constine, Chick's chief deputy, said the 3rd District office now has two 
fewer staff members than it did under Picus. As for the pension pledge, it was 
taken care of by 1993's measure that holds council members to two four-year 
terms. It takes 10 years of service at City Hall to be vested in a pension. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those "slush funds" and car phones? 
</P>
<P>
 That's another story. In fact, Chick has set up her own officeholder committee 
account. But Constine said Chick established it to offset cutbacks in her 
taxpayer-financed office budget that threatened to erode her ability to serve 
her constituents. Many council members use the funds to pay for constituency 
ingratiation like buying plaques to award citizen crime fighters, graffiti 
busters and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Chick and two of her staff now have cellular phones, the maximum 
allowed under council policy, according to Frank Martinez, a top official in 
the city's Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, Councilwoman Chick realized that having the phones would be a time 
saver for her staff, and during the earthquake they proved to be a lifesaver," 
Constine said.

PACOIMA MAN HELD IN DEATH OF ROOMMATE

<P>
 Police on Thursday arrested a 47-year-old Pacoima man who they say killed his 
62-year-old roommate with a blunt object and dumped the man's body along the 
side of Whitnall Highway in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennie Lee Carmack was arrested at the mobile home he shared with Roy Haselow 
on Glenoaks Boulevard, said Lt. Joseph Garcia of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. The two men argued before the killing and police are continuing to 
investigate the motive, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby discovered Haselow's body on Wednesday in bushes along the highway 
near Cahuenga Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmack is expected to be arraigned today, Garcia said.

BREAKING INTO THE BOYS' CLUB; A UNIQUE PROGRAM IS GIVING 20 YOUNG WOMEN A SHOT 
AT FILMMAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BERGMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Twenty women, age 18-23, were all desperately seeking to break into 
filmmaking. So they took out a full-page ad in the May 13 issue of 
Entertainment Weekly that read: "Please, please, please, please, please, can we 
have some money to finish our film? Before you say no, picture this: Twenty 
ethnically diverse young women with vision, passion, and absolutely no money." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors such as Kodak, Panavision and Skywalker Sound responded with 
equipment loans, while some last-minute funding came from the benefit premiere 
of Allison Anders' "Mi Vida Loca," giving these young women the chance to 
complete "Copper Women," a 35-millimeter short they hope to show at January's 
Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Just two months after the ad ran 
(donated by the magazine), they were on location with a $25,000 budget and a 
nine-day shooting schedule. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A visit to the set is almost jarring, a flurry of female activity rare in 
Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter. As director Guillermina (Gisha) 
Zabala, 23, struggles to bring in her film on time, she and Salwa Raphael, 19, 
the screenwriter, sit huddled in intense script consultation. Angel Singleton, 
21, and Liz Brown, 22, put down duct tape on the kitchen floor to help the 
actors find their marks, while assistant director Heather Grierson, 22, speaks 
into her headset, coordinating the search for more film stock. Grierson's 
parents look on, relatively calm considering it's their Van Nuys home the film 
crew is draping in tarp and littering with heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast includes 10 professional actors with speaking parts, but the camera 
crew is semi-pro, while the rest have never worked on anything as ambitious as 
a short feature. Virtually none of them, in fact, have ever shot a 
35-millimeter film. Aside from working with more complex and sensitive 
equipment, the crew was also asked to handle a lot of location shooting -- from 
Van Nuys to Venice Beach -- learning firsthand the nightmares wreaked by 
capricious weather. But after shooting for a week, the initial bewilderment and 
frustration has melted away, and confidence has emerged in its place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny," Zabala says in Venice, after finally wrapping a shot that the 
wind ruined about a half dozen times. "You have to make all the decisions in 
the beginning. I felt really responsible if stuff went wrong, if we ran out of 
film stock or whatever. Then I realized that there were certain things I 
couldn't control and that everybody is learning -- I'm learning too!" 
</P>
<P>
 The film crew members weren't the only ones learning as they went along, for 
this is the first film produced under the aegis of Independent Feature 
Project/West (IFP/West), a nonprofit organization dedicated to the support and 
promotion of independent film. IFP/West set up its own in-house production 
company, Project: Involve Productions, specifically to offer this hands-on 
filmmaking experience to women who were "representative of the cultural 
diversity in Los Angeles."  
</P>
<P>
 "It was originally intended as a 10-minute video," says Shainee Gabel, herself 
only 25, who as director of programming at IFP/West, engineered the project 
from genesis to production, "and this is where we ended up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raphael's script, based on a Native American myth, follows a young woman after 
a nearly fatal car crash. Upon returning from the hospital, the young woman 
sees her family as cold and distant. Realizing that she needs something more, 
she runs away and finds a spiritual connection with a jewelry maker in Venice 
Beach, who has recently lost her own daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more to the program than just producing a film. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point was to not only open up the film world and see all of its 
possibilities, but to offer these women an entree they might not otherwise have 
gotten," says Gabel, who acted as producer of "Copper Women." 
</P>
<P>
 After getting the go-ahead from IFP/West, Gabel initially received help from 
the James Irvine Foundation, and she started posting flyers at local high 
schools and colleges with media arts programs. Within a few months, she had 
received about 100 applications. She sorted through them for women who, as she 
puts it, had a "predilection for and a commitment to film, who had participated 
in some sort of media arts already." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabel ended up interviewing about 50 women for 20 spots, eventually matching 
these 20 with a mentor from a film profession of their choice. "IFP had 
developed all these great relationships with people in town," Gabel explains, 
"and we hadn't used any of them to make a film." 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-directors such as Anders and Quentin Tarantino agreed to be followed 
around on the job, as did other film veterans, including production managers, 
production designers and script supervisors, all providing experience that 
couldn't be learned inside a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The six months of filmmaking boot camp also included workshops on everything 
from gaffing and post-production sound to obtaining music rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the mentoring program that provided some of the women with the most 
benefits. "I've gotten so much further in a couple of months than I would have 
even in five years, in terms of the people I know now -- and the things I know 
-- that I didn't know before," says aspiring producer Sherri Smith, 22, who 
worked at Sony Pictures with her mentor, Stephanie Allain, the company's senior 
vice president of production. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith got to see everything Allain did, even visiting the set of John 
Singleton's latest project, "Higher Learning," and watching the dailies of 
films currently in production. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Allain, who is currently the highest-ranking African American female 
executive at a major studio, the venture came virtually risk-free. "It's not 
that much of a time commitment," she says, "and you have someone helping you 
who's really smart." It also helped her usher some women into a world she 
characterizes as "still a boys' club." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the mentoring, editor-director Anne Goursaud, who edited "Bram 
Stoker's Dracula" and worked with Zabala, says, "It's like being a friend, but 
a professional one, one she can ask questions of." 
</P>
<P>
 Goursaud wishes she'd had something like Project: Involve during her start in 
the business 20 years ago. "I felt very isolated," she recalls. "There weren't 
very many opportunities, and there weren't as many women out there trying to 
nourish us. It's so important . . . you do need support, you need other women." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabel hopes that one day this first crop of filmmakers will recall the boost 
it got and return to Project: Involve as mentors. But more urgently, she hopes 
to lure more funding for next year, because without sponsors, "Copper Women" 
may be the program's final film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if we could do it again it would be a lot more rewarding, the process 
would be smoother, and we would be able to reach out further," Gabel says. "In 
a short amount of time, we've earned a lot of respect within the industry, and 
if we could keep it going, it could be a point of reference for young women 
interested in filmmaking. It could give them something to look forward to."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; 'M.A.N.T.I.S.' RACIAL FLAP SIGN OF A DOUBLE 
STANDARD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 Television's first live-action black super-hero tries lifting off tonight, 
weighted with controversy and ethnic baggage. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 After airing on Fox last January as a TV movie, "M.A.N.T.I.S." now returns as 
a weekly series with new producers, facing heavy critical spritzing in some 
circles for changing its tone and exterminating four of the pilot's supporting 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Black characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Fox, obviously knowing the color of money, be faulted for appearing to 
lighten the complexion of "M.A.N.T.I.S." to attract more whites -- a motivation 
it denies -- even though no one protested when it earlier fattened up on black 
comedies as a strategy to reach more African Americans? Appealing to blacks 
through skin color is honorable business, yet employing the same strategy for 
whites is anti-black bigotry? Isn't this a double standard? 
</P>
<P>
 So far no one has publicly applied the terrible R-word to the new racial 
makeup of "M.A.N.T.I.S.," but no one really has to, for the racism charge is 
implicit in the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox insists that its "M.A.N.T.I.S." changes were made for creative reasons, a 
rationale "not acceptable to us," says Eddie Wong, head of the Rainbow 
Coalition's new watchdog group, the Commission on Fairness in the Media. 
There's "something more behind it," argues Gina Torres, a black actress whose 
character was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 More about all of that following an excerpt from this evening's newer, paler 
and somewhat better "M.A.N.T.I.S.": 
</P>
<P>
 Deep into the night, some armed hooligans mill on the docks, obviously up to 
no good. Suddenly, a figure in a bug costume appears, zapping one of them with 
a green ray. When another thug charges, the bug creature hurls him through a 
window. When a car tries to run him down, the bug effortlessly hurdles it. When 
another bad guy stalks him, the human bug pounces on him from the second story 
of a warehouse. When the rest of the gang tries to escape in a chopper, the bug 
pursues them with blinding speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only to be gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, nobody's perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Who or what is this clunky metallic insect thing lying motionless on the 
ground? "M.A.N.T.I.S." uses a flashback to explain that the downed super-hero 
is really brilliant biophysicist Miles Hawkins (Carl Lumbly) of fictional Port 
Columbia, a paraplegic African American who creates a futuristic power harness, 
or exoskeleton, whose headgear somehow enables him to walk again. In the 
process, he also discovers that the same technology -- a Mechanically Augmented 
Neuro-Transmitter Interactive System (M.A.N.T.I.S.) -- gives him temporary 
super-powers. 
</P>
<P>
 So he invents a do-gooder alter ego: the creepy, crawly, crime-fighting 
Mantis, who gives new meaning to entomology. With an arsenal that includes a 
flying submarine car, Mantis appears unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, someone is infecting Port Columbia with a deadly virus, and Lt. 
Leora Maxwell (Galyn Gorg) -- too beautiful not to be slated for future romance 
with Hawkins -- is on the case for the cops. Hawkins and his partner, John 
Stonebrake (Roger Rees), join Maxwell, and later the two scientists acquire a 
resourceful go-fer in street-smart biker-courier Taylor Savidge (Christopher 
Gartin). Only Stonebrake and Savidge (plus Hawkins himself, of course) know 
that Hawkins is Mantis. 
</P>
<P>
 With a plot tiny enough to be extracted with tweezers and a champion who is 
un-super by super-hero standards, "M.A.N.T.I.S." has to get by pretty much on 
style. At the very least, though, the series opener is much less a laughable 
farce than the pilot (which showed blacks bonding and working cooperatively, 
but largely as ethnic stereotypes). And in Lumbly -- as a rare black 
protagonist in a drama series -- it has an actor with leading-man looks and the 
skill to impart both authority and sensitivity, even though he's a bit stony at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Atmospherically, moreover, the night-shrouded premiere projects intriguingly 
mysterious dark hues. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet not dark enough to satisfy everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the new cast members joining Lumbly, Gorg is black, Rees and Gartin are 
white. If you're counting, that's a net loss of three blacks, a gain of two 
whites from pilot to series. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, new co-executive producer Bryce Zabel insists there's been no 
plan to "whiten the show up." But even if there were such an agenda, what would 
be the beef, given the silence of ethnic police when Fox earlier "blackened" a 
large chunk of its prime-time schedule -- percentage-wise much greater than the 
nation's black population -- for the purpose of carving out a specific ethnic 
niche in the ratings? 
</P>
<P>
 Black discontent over "M.A.N.T.I.S.," in fact, extends to other components of 
Fox's prime-time schedule, a fascinating irony given that Fox, more than any 
other network in the early '90s, has been committed to airing so-called black 
programs in prime time. Of course, raw numbers don't necessarily equate to 
quality. Yet that aside, at one point last season, nearly a third of Fox's 
series were black-oriented, even though African Americans comprise only 12.4% 
of the U.S. population, according to the Bureau of Census. Where were the 
ethnic police then? 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 1994-95 season, four of the network's 17 prime-time series -- 
nearly 24% -- either star or co-star black actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it added two hours of black-protagonist series for this season 
("M.A.N.T.I.S" and the cop show "New York Undercover"), Fox was still pilloried 
by Jesse Jackson and the Congressional Black Caucus for canceling two hours of 
low-rated black comedies ("Roc," "In Living Color," "The Sinbad Show" and 
"South Central") at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 As if the mere act of canceling series with predominantly black casts 
automatically aligned a network with white-hooded night riders. And even though 
two of those series, "In Living Color" and "South Central," were themselves 
harshly criticized by some blacks on ethnic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will this absurdity end? 
</P>
<P>
 As for "M.A.N.T.I.S.," meanwhile, rarely has material so scrawny and trivial 
provoked such a loud collision of social and economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Mantis is merely stunned by the bullet that fells him in the 
premiere's opening segment. He's been saved by his impenetrable exoskeleton. 
And speaking of absurdity, the hour's highest camp comes in the last scene, 
when Mantis begins to humbly walk away after taking bold action to save a life 
in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait!" an admiring nurse calls out. "Who are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Turning slowly toward her in his funny suit, he replies dramatically, "Call me 
. . . Mantis." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't call him Praying Mantis. That could upset the religion lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 * "M.A.N.T.I.S." premieres at 8 tonight on Fox (Channels 11 and 6).

 'Three Tenors' Suit: Composer Lalo Schifrin has sued "Three Tenors" concert 
promoter Tibor Rudas, alleging Rudas failed to give Schifrin arrangement credit 
for two medleys performed at the July 16, Dodger Stadium show. According to the 
Los Angeles suit, Schifrin's contract stipulated that his name be included in 
the concert program, as well as in credits for the show's worldwide TV 
broadcast, recordings and videotapes. The contract included that stipulation, 
the suit says, because Schifrin's name was dropped from a 1990 Rome concert 
featuring the superstar tenors -- Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano 
Pavarotti. Schifrin, a four-time Grammy winner who wrote the music for 
"Mission: Impossible," is seeking a temporary restraining order barring 
distribution of all concert items that do not carry his name, and more than $1 
million in compensatory and punitive damages. The video and CD of the concert 
are due out on Tuesday.

 Celebrating Tamara: The works of Tamara De Lempicka, the late artist upon whom 
the classic stage play "Tamara" is based, will be exhibited at West Hollywood's 
St. James Club tonight in a celebration hosted by actresses Anjelica Huston 
(who portrayed Tamara on stage) and Sharon Stone. The event, which benefits 
Planet Hope, a homeless charity founded by Stone's sister, Kelly Stone, will 
celebrate the first time that Tamara's daughter, the Baroness De Lempicka, has 
allowed her mother's art to be reproduced. It will appear in serigraphs 
produced by Los Angeles' DK Art Publishing. The 7-11 p.m. event, which is open 
to the public with a $125 donation to Planet Hope, includes a mini-presentation 
of "Tamara," a live re-enactment of the artist's signature nude "Adam and Eve" 
and a sale of the artist's works.

Peter Schaufuss' controversial reconstruction of "La Sylphide," created for the 
English Festival Ballet (now the English National Ballet) in 1979. Schaufuss is

 Hiding Violence Listings?: Even though cable and broadcast networks agreed 
last year to have parental warnings of violence included in TV listings, the 
information is often missing, a congressman complained Wednesday. "By omitting 
the label from weekly TV schedules, the serious business of giving parents 
information in advance looks more like a game of advisory hide-and-go-seek," 
said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass), who wrote 17 broadcast and cable networks 
to find out how they plan to ensure that parents have access to violence 
warnings. Listings companies, however, say it is the publications, not the 
listing companies, that may omit or shorten the warnings.

couple of days before she died. In an excerpt from the book that will appear 
Sunday in Parade magazine, Brando says of Monroe, "We had an affair and saw 
each other intermittently for years. Once she called and invited me to come 
over for dinner. I already had plans but promised to call the following week. 
She said fine. Two or three days later, she was dead." Brando continues: "I'm

JAZZ NOTES: DAVE HOLLAND KEEPS MIXING AN EXPERIMENTAL BREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bass marvel Dave Holland, who has played with everyone from Miles Davis and 
Chick Corea to Joe Henderson and Herbie Hancock in his 26-year career, believes 
that the time is ripe for new directions in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a realignment with real traditional musical values that will 
provide a strong springboard for the next jump into original territory," 
Holland said from his home in Saugerties, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The bassist has long been on the cutting edge. A gifted musician who never 
stops experimenting, Holland liberally mixes structureless playing, which he 
calls "open form," with more traditional jazz concepts, which he calls "closed 
form." 
</P>
<P>
 The brew, as heard on such albums as 1990's "Extensions" on ECM Records, is 
similar to the music played by such forward-thinking artists as John Scofield 
and Joe Lovano, and in many ways defines the direction jazz is heading. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland sees his mix of forms as part of a continuing musical evolution. "As I 
get older, I find I'm wanting to use all the various directions and languages 
that I like to play," Holland says. "I like to engage in group interaction, 
have a performance be a group dialogue that features soloists at different 
times, that integrates written material with improvising." 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory within which Holland feels he can best conduct his experiments 
is the organized, regularly performing band. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so important to maintain the ideal of a group," he says. "Groups have 
been the backbone of this music, and we musicians need to do everything we can 
to maintain them. They're opportunities for players to have an ongoing 
connection with other musicians, and to grow and mature." 
</P>
<P>
 To this end, Holland has a new quartet. Formed in January, it is composed of 
Steve Nelson (vibes), Eric Person (alto sax) and Gene Jackson (drums) and plays 
Tuesday through Sept. 4 at Catalina Bar & Grill. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland says the ensemble will explore his originals and works by such jazz 
giants as Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Thelonious Monk. Holland, the 
bassist with the fat, ringing sound and solo style that reveals a horn-like 
agility and melodiousness, says that his music stresses rhythm and melody. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the rhythm is strong enough -- and you don't have to hit people over the 
head -- people will feel it," he says.

KGFJ-AM TO TRY 'POSITIVE PROGRAMMING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 KGFJ-AM(1230) on Monday will change its format from R & B oldies to what the 
station calls "sweet inspirations," a combination of gospel and religious music 
and other programming with positive messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel there is a void in the marketplace and positive programming of this 
nature will serve a population seeking alternative music," operations director 
Shirley Jackson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the artists who will be featured are Andrae Crouch, Sounds of Blackness 
and Stephanie Mills, along with songs deemed "inspirational" by Earth, Wind and 
Fire, Aretha Franklin and Al Green. The station will continue its talk 
programming and community-service shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The new KGFJ will also put out "power messages," ranging one to five minutes 
in length, which Jackson described as "positive ways to start your day." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said some personnel changes will take place after the new format 
debuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The station, which is owned by East-West Broadcasting, has been languishing 
with its "soul oldies" format, having tied for 40th place -- averaging a 0.4% 
share of the audience -- in the latest Arbitron ratings survey. Station 
officials hope the new format will draw a larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really no station in L.A. that will be providing this type of 
programming," Jackson said.

CONJUNTO CESPEDES REFUSES TO CLOSE DOOR TO PAST; POP MUSIC: BAY AREA-BASED 
AFRO-CUBAN ORCHESTRA EMBRACES THE ENTIRETY OF ITS HOMELAND'S MUSIC, A RISKY 
CHOICE GIVEN SOME IMMIGRANTS' ANTI-CASTRO SENTIMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Is the Conjunto Cespedes the best Afro-Cuban orchestra in the United States? 
It might be too early in the group's career to say for sure. But if there are 
any others out there that can match the Conjunto's musical power and 
willingness to take risks, Latin music in the United States is doing just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Una sola casa" (Only One House), the Bay Area-based group's 1993 debut album, 
is an eclectic, vibrant homage to Cuba's musical legacy. It's all there -- 
fiery percussion, joyful charangas, son, rumba, religious chants, big-band horn 
arrangements and even acoustic ballads influenced by the Nueva Trova movement 
that flourished in the late '60s and had a profound impact on Latin American 
political songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main principle of our music is to say more than, 'Baby, I like the way 
you walk' or 'Let's go to bed,' " says the group's director Guillermo Cespedes, 
who will lead the 12-piece ensemble Saturday at the John Anson Ford 
Amphitheatre. "We utilize music as a way to dress poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Their instrumental talent and musical vision aren't the only things that 
distinguish Cespedes and his aunt, Bobi Cespedes, the group's singer: They're 
Cubans living in the United States, but their families came here before Fidel 
Castro's 1959 revolution, and the band members are equally fond of all branches 
of Cuban music -- traditional, post-revolutionary and made-in-exile. They like 
such elders as Cachao and Celia Cruz just as much as Nueva Trova artists Silvio 
Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a courageous choice, given the anti-Castro passion of the Cuban exile 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if they claim otherwise, most Cuban musicians in America need to have at 
least some kind of subtle anti-revolutionary political message in order to 
survive," says Cespedes, 43. "It's an absurd position that doesn't do any 
justice to our rich musical tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Cespedes' most controversial gesture was creating a musical setting for 
"Tengo" (I Have), a poem by the late Afro-Cuban poet Nicolas Guillen. The work 
proclaims that Cuban blacks enjoyed their rights for the first time under 
Castro, and the song predictably earned the Conjunto a bad reputation in Miami, 
the center of the mostly white Cuban exile community. Some radio stations 
refused to play the group as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people thought we were making propaganda," Cespedes says. "That song 
closed some doors for us, but we knew that was a risk. Our point is that we 
don't think Cuban music started or ended in 1959 -- it is our duty to 
acknowledge the whole picture of our music. A Cuban in the States is supposed 
to divide history, but we refuse to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The first members of the Cespedes family began to emigrate to the States in 
the mid-'50s, and the Conjunto was founded in 1981 by Guillermo, Bobi, 
Guillermo's cousin Miguel and his uncle Luis. After playing in Bay Area clubs 
for most of the '80s and early '90s, they were signed by the small, 
Connecticut-based Green Linnet label. The group has sold more than 11,000 
copies of "Una sola casa" with virtually no promotion or national tours, 
reaching No. 5 on Billboard's world music charts.  
</P>
<P>
 The main attraction of the orchestra -- which includes Cuban, American, Puerto 
Rican and Chilean musicians -- is Bobi Cespedes, a powerhouse singer who's 
often likened to the young Cruz. Also a Santeria priestess, she is one of the 
most important discoveries in Afro-Cuban music in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conjunto's open and flexible musical approach results in plenty of room 
for the unpredictable. It's a new experiment with a music that has long left 
its own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuban music is no longer Cuban," says Cespedes. "Everybody has utilized it in 
different ways throughout the century. Even us, who are Cubans living outside 
of Cuba, have a distinctive flavor. But the essence is there, and can't be 
described. You can only feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Conjunto Cespedes, Francisco Aguabella and the Marcos Loya Band will perform 
Saturday at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. E. , 4:30 
p.m. $17. (213) 466-1767.

RESTAURANT NOTES: MARVIN DAVIS TO SHUT DOWN SHOP AT THE CARNEGIE DELI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 George Burns will have to find some other place to hold his 100th birthday 
party. The 98-year-old comedian had booked Carnegie Deli for the night of Jan. 
20, 1996, but now owner Marvin Davis plans to close his 5-year-old Beverly 
Hills deli today at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnegie chef and general manager Don Dickman confirmed that the restaurant 
would be closing. He said the staff has been informed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Davis opened this branch of the popular New York Carnegie Deli, The 
Times reported he had a standing order at Century City's Stage Deli for half a 
pound of lox, six bagels, a pint of cream cheese and four bags of potato chips 
to be delivered to his office at 7 each morning. But his real love was New 
York's Carnegie Deli, where he was known to spend $1,000 at one crack. Davis 
finally got tired of schlepping deli from New York and decided it was time to 
open an L.A. branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's like a lot of other restaurants. It's a question of the economy, 
lack of tourism and different eating habits," said Davis' publicist, Lee 
Solters. "Carnegie is not the only one going out of business in Beverly Hills. 
Rodeo Drive now looks like a movie set." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooks on the Move: Ciejai Harroway has quit Il Mito in Studio City to cook 
across the street at La Loggia on the south side of Ventura Boulevard. . . . 
Chef Andreas Kisler is now in charge of the kitchen at Wyndham Checkers hotel 
in downtown Los Angeles. Kisler, who last cooked at Beaurivage in Malibu, 
replaces Bill Valentine who replaced Thomas Keller who replaced Jerry Comfort. 
Comfort opened Checkers' kitchen in 1989 after Elka Gilmore, who was originally 
hired as opening chef, decamped before the hotel even opened. . . . Chef Joe 
Venezia and general manager Carla Ugolini have left I Cugini in Santa Monica. 
The couple, who plan to marry, are negotiating to buy their own Italian 
restaurant: Il Boccacio on the Hermosa Beach Pier. . . . Anne and David 
Gingrass, the Spago alumni who opened Wolfgang Puck's highly successful San 
Francisco restaurant Postrio, are moving on after five years. The couple, who 
will leave in December, plan to open their own spot in the city's artsy 
South-of-Market district. No replacements have been named.

POP NOTES: FESTIVAL OF BLUES ON THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Blues Festival, which debuted last year in Dana Point, will 
return for a two-day run, Oct. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's festival, a three-day event, drew about 22,000 people to Heritage 
Park. The site has been moved to Doheny State Beach in response to parking 
problems and neighborhood complaints encountered a year ago. The new site can 
seat about 7,000 fans per day, according to promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Setzer, James Cotton and Maria Muldaur top the bill on Oct. 1. John 
Mayall, Kim Wilson and Charlie Musselwhite are the headliners on Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Two stages will be used (but not simultaneously) to minimize delays between 
sets. Schedules are as follows, in order of appearance: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 1: TBA, Robert Lucas, the Lifters, Barrelhouse, the King Brothers, 
Mississippi Millie, the Rhythm Lords, Maria Muldaur, James Cotton and the Brian 
Setzer Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct 2: Delta Ramblers, the Jive Kings, the Starlights, Lee Rocker's Big 
Blue, Doyle Bramhall, James Harman Band, Randell Young, Charlie Musselwhite, 
Kim Wilson and John Mayall. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows start at 11 a.m. each day, and the closing acts are scheduled to begin 
at 8 p.m. Tickets are $10 per day in advance, $15 at the gate. A limited number 
of two-day weekend passes, with preferred seating, are available for $25, in 
advance only. Information: (714) 645-1999 (recording) or (714) 740-2000 
(Ticketmaster). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NOW OPEN: The Firecracker Lounge is the site a new weekly, Sunday night rock 
soiree in Anaheim, launched as a sidelight by Tom Dumont, guitarist for the 
popular Anaheim band No Doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 The 150-capacity room -- known as the Baron's Room when rockers aren't there 
-- is the upstairs lounge at the Cattleman's Wharf restaurant, 1160 W. Ball 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wandered in there a few weeks ago. They had a cheesy lounge group doing 
Vegas songs," Dumont recalled. He approached restaurant management about doing 
something hipper on Sundays, and began his series last weekend with a show by 
One Hit Wonder and Box Car Wino. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ziggens and Eli Riddle play this Sunday, Bazooka headlines Sept. 4 and 
Lidsville and the Getbacks play Sept. 11. Shows start after 10 p.m., with all 
ages admitted. Admission is $3 or $4 to the Firecracker Lounge, which Dumont 
named in honor of the the room's view of the nightly fireworks display at 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he will try to keep the shows going as long as he has time left over 
from his commitment to No Doubt, which is still at work on a long-delayed album 
for Interscope Records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 STEPPING TO THE SIDE: After more than a decade fronting his own bands, M.I.A. 
and Naked Soul, Costa Mesa rocker Mike Conley is settling into a sideman's role 
with the San Diego band, aMiniature. Conley now plays guitar and provide 
backing vocals behind front man John Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to put his own new project, a band called Sugarfix, on hold for the 
time being when he hit it off with aMiniature after being introduced to the 
band by Fluf's guitarist, O. aMiniature, which has released two albums and 
records now for Restless Records, will play Friday at 9 p.m. at Our House, 720 
W. 19th St. in Costa Mesa, with Supernovice and No Knife opening.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; JOYFUL NOISE OF TABU LEY ROCHEREAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congolese singer Tabu Ley Rochereau sometimes is billed, in the United States 
at least, as "the Elvis Presley of African music." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an attention-grabbing appellation, to say the least, but in Rochereau's 
case it's actually somewhat accurate: He does blend distinct musical elements 
in an invigorating new way. 
</P>
<P>
 For his performance Wednesday at the Long Beach Museum of Art, however, a 
Jerry Lee Lewis comparison might have been even more apt, given the way he 
frequently left the audience: breathless- ahhh . 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Rochereau has been an inconsistent performer -- Village Voice 
critic Robert Christgau, an ardent booster of Afro-pop, says he has twice 
walked out on Rochereau shows in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was nothing inconsistent about the two sets here, concluding the 
museum's summer outdoor concert series. And the only thing frustrating about 
them was that even at an effervescent 2 1/2-hours total, they were over all too 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 At 53, Rochereau appeared almost frisky, often trading silky dance moves with 
others in his 13-member Orchestre Afrisa International band. His legendary 
honey-soaked tenor showed a few burrs around the edges early on, but such husky 
traces took nothing away from his vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sign that age might be taking its toll came during the second set 
when he turned over a good portion of the lead vocals to one of his three 
fellow singers. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, Rochereau often stresses the importance of the two- or 
three-part song structure that typifies soukous music, the Caribbean-influenced 
style of Afro-pop he helped develop in the 1950s, and he has criticized some 
performers who omit the lead-up sections and play only the invigorating 
up-tempo portion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, with songs that were insidiously infectious, he persuasively 
made his case against taking musical shortcuts. He also demonstrated -- without 
even seeming to try -- how much joyful release Western pop misses with its 
cut-to-the-chase reliance on three-minute, single-tempo structure. 
</P>
<P>
 His songs -- he estimates that he has written more than 2,000 during his 
nearly 40-year career -- usually open in a relaxed mid-tempo that puts the 
focus on the lyrics. After several minutes at that pace, the band -- without 
warning -- cranks the tempo up about 10%, a barely perceptible shift that 
nevertheless pumps up the energy level for the musicians as well as for the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Then after a few more minutes, there's a rhythmic break during which the 
drummer strikes three or four solo shots on the snare and the band moves into 
the third section, or sebene , which becomes irresistibly danceable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although that structure was repeated in most of the dozen songs the group 
played, the melodies, instrumental textures and energy never sounded 
repetitious. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit that to Rochereau's endlessly dynamic Orchestre Afrisa International. 
Some Afro-pop bands sink into a muddy blur after an hour or so of songs that 
often consist of just two chords -- dominant-tonic, dominant-tonic -- for 10 to 
15 minutes at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochereau's band showed its skill at song arrangements that were kept fresh by 
constantly shifting tempos and a steady stream of new instrumental accents. 
</P>
<P>
 A perfect example was "Linganga Nalinga Yo," which translates into a plea for 
all people to love one another. Featuring singer Dodo Munoko, the song started 
out as a slightly Africanized cha-cha (one of the key features of soukous is 
the use of speeded-up rumbas and other Latin dance rhythms). 
</P>
<P>
 It shifted briefly to a driving 4/4 beat (as close as the group came to a rock 
music sound) before it kicked up again into a peppery sebene full of galloping, 
octave-hopping bass lines, punchy sax fills and truly heroic work on the drum 
kit by Masibu Pa'rigo Nsazi. All this was overlaid with cascading guitar lines 
from Huit-Kilos Nseka and Makondele Loko Bingi. Dancers Wala Mawete and Ampo 
Biyeye added good-natured sensuality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When everything was clicking, the drummer beamed a grin at the guitarists, who 
returned wide smiles that telegraphed the obvious joy their music brings them. 
What a welcome contrast to all those rock guitarists whose anguished grimaces 
make it seem that all they're getting from their instruments is a couple of 
thousand volts. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise of the evening was Rochereau's arrangement of 
Lennon-McCartney's "Let It Be," which he translated into the Zairian language 
of Lingala, and sang as "La-La Be." 
</P>
<P>
 When he left the stage, drenched in perspiration, there was no stentorian 
voice announcing that "Tabu Ley has left the building," just a group of fans 
continuing to chant "Tabu Ley! Tabu Ley!" And there was no question that this 
particular Elvis is still very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tabu Ley Rochereau and Orchestre Afrisa International play Saturday at 10 
p.m. at the House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. $15. (213) 
650-0247. Also, Sept. 10 at 7:30 p.m. at the Street Scene '94 festival, Gaslamp 
Quarter, downtown San Diego, on the Miller Genuine Draft/KKOS Mardi Gras stage. 
Festival admission: $22 per day or $39 for a two-day pass until Sept. 8; $25 
per day starting Sept. 9. (619) 268-9025.

 Jerry Jeff Walker sings about old pickup trucks, steak-and-eggs cafes, 
wide-open roads, the love of a faithful woman, crumbling tombstones, old men 
with guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 So adept is Walker at evoking the spirit of his home state that by the time he 
finished playing Wednesday at the Coach House, the tidy, Southern California 
nightclub felt more like a beer-soaked Texas roadhouse.  
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a black cowboy hat, jeans and T-shirt, Walker, along with Gonzo 
Compadres band, turned in a performance that was by turns intimate and 
electrifying, down-home and exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice a well-deep, rumbling twang as comfortable and unaffected as a 
beat-up old cowboy boot, Walker exuded Lone Star charm, charisma and a rare 
affinity for connecting with a crowd. As a performer, he's as natural and 
sincere as they come. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Gonzo Compadres -- guitarist Johnny Inmon, drummer Freddie 
Krc and bassist Bob Livingston -- provided a surprisingly lush and full sound 
for so sparse a group. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly amazing was Inmon, one of the finest young guitar hotshots to 
come down the pike since Stevie Ray. His hyper-speed, Southern rock lines hit 
like Dickey Betts on amphetamines, his moody bends came from other galaxies, 
his hillbilly picking would have had you swearing there was a pedal steel 
player on stage. Again and again, his astonishing virtuosity brought the packed 
house to its feet, as he proved to be an unexpected and much-appreciated 
highlight of a fine show. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, 52, had no trouble whatsoever keeping up with his backing musicians, 
all of whom appeared to be in their 20s. With the enthusiasm of a man half his 
age, Walker genuinely appeared to be having himself a grand old time as he 
poured sweat, dipped, dodged and gesticulated to punctuate the lyrics to his 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the up-tempo country rockers to the mournful ballads and yodeled 
backwoods celebrations, Walker sang them all with genuine feeling and beauty. 
On some pieces, Walker would back away from his microphone, a smile as big as 
Texas itself parting his lips as his fiercely dedicated fans sang all the lines 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker performed all the expected hits, including "Up Against the Wall, Red 
Neck," "L.A. Freeway" and "Mr. Bojangles," as well as a cross section of 
material from his 30-plus year career and highlights from his excellent new 
album, "Viva Luckenbach." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker is that rarity in contemporary music: an artist who goes out of his way 
to give people their money's worth and seems to enjoy every minute of it.

THEATER; SUMMER HEATS INTEREST IN 'LEAR,' 'NUNSENSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The summer has done wonders not just for the movie business nationwide but for 
the more modestly proportioned Orange County theater scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the tens of thousands of playgoers who have forked over $7.2 million 
so far to see "The Phantom of the Opera" at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, tens of hundreds have turned out for Shakespeare Orange County's 
well-received "King Lear." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're picking up a lot of new people who haven't been to see us before," SOC 
artistic director Thomas F. Bradac said earlier this week. "People have come 
for this show from as far away as Thousand Oaks, way up near Ventura. People 
have heard about us who don't know where we are. There's a whole new group of 
people calling us. It's a fresh audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradac says attendance is up at least 35% from last season's "Julius Caesar," 
and that is likely to help SOC's subscriptions for next year. But he's not the 
only producer singing a happy tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Griff Duncan, who heads Fullerton Civic Light Opera, notes a 20% rise in 
attendance over last summer for his al fresco dinner-theater operation, the 
Theatre on the Green series at Fullerton's Muckenthaler Cultural Center. He 
says "Nunsense II," which closes Saturday with a sold-out house, has done even 
better at the box office than the musical "Quilters," which was the biggest hit 
of the series in its first season last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our books aren't closed on it yet, but we think the dinner theater will show 
a profit," Duncan said. "The series format calls for a musical, a comedy and a 
drama, and we want to keep offering that variety. But there's no question the 
musicals are more popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean the format will change for next season? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not necessarily," he said. "We haven't made any decision on that. Musicals 
may be more popular, but they're also more expensive to produce." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a darker countermelody enters Duncan's happy tune when he speaks of 
the FCLO's most recent year-round indoor season at Plummer Auditorium. 
Sometimes even musicals can't draw an audience, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCLO's 1993-94 schedule laid an egg for precisely that reason. The 
company's most recent offering at Plummer, "The Best Little Whorehouse in 
Texas," was poorly attended. Earlier in the season, "The Most Happy Fella" did 
somewhat better, but not by much.  
</P>
<P>
 "The single-ticket buyer was practically nonexistent for those two 
productions," Duncan explained. "We'll incur substantial losses on both. 
'Fella' showed a loss of about $40,000. We're still figuring out how much we 
lost on 'Whorehouse.' So our main musical season will show a considerable 
loss." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure. "The Most Happy Fella" just happens to be one of the best Broadway 
musicals ever, with a touching story and a deeply moving score by Frank 
Loesser. "Whorehouse" just happens to be one of the worst Broadway musicals 
ever, with only some glitzy Tommy Tune dance numbers to recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Andrew Lloyd Webber warhorse "Evita" was a big FCLO hit, 
turning a profit of about $30,000. And the Charles Strouse warhorse "Annie" 
also did well, though not as well as hoped, with a mere $5,000 profit, Duncan 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's looking forward to more adventurous programming -- we're speaking 
in relative terms here -- for next season at Plummer: "Phantom," by Arthur 
Kopit and Maury Yeston (Feb. 17-March 5); "Brigadoon," by Alan Jay Lerner and 
Frederick Loewe (May 12-28); "The Secret Garden," by Marsha Norman and Lucy 
Simon (July 14-30), and "West Side Story," by Leonard Bernstein, Stephen 
Sondheim and Arthur Laurents (Oct. 20, 1995-Nov. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 BY THE WAY: Did you ever wonder what Andrew Lloyd Webber and producer Cameron 
Mackintosh are making on "Phantom's" OCPAC booking? With grosses topping $1 
million a week, you can assume they're raking in lots of dough. It costs the 
producers about $600,000 a week to run the show. Everything after that is 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH TIMES?: They haven't made it official yet, but South Coast Repertory's 
budget next season will top $6 million for the first time. The county's largest 
theater company anticipates a 5% increase, roughly $300,000, over last season's 
expenditures of $5.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The record-high $6.1-million budget for the 1994-95 season, beginning Sept. 2 
with the first preview of "A Streetcar Named Desire," represents a 20% growth 
from five seasons ago. That's when SCR's budget topped $5 million for the first 
time and Southern California began heading into its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes you wonder what might have happened had the economy been good. Most 
theater companies would kill for SCR's tough times.  
</P>
<P>
 Last season, for example, attendance averaged 90%. The box office sold about 
41,600 single tickets, in addition to the roughly 110,000 tickets purchased by 
19,700 subscribers to all productions on the SCR Mainstage and Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 According to John Mouledoux, SCR's director of marketing and communications, 
subscriptions for the upcoming season are keeping pace with last. He says he 
expects the number of season ticket-holders to reach 19,800. That is down from 
SCR's historic high of 25,000 in the 1986-87 season. But single tickets have 
more than made up for the decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscription prices for next season are up "an average of 2% to 3%," Mouledoux 
said. They range from $57 to $198 for the six Mainstage productions and from 
$48 to $153 for the five Second Stage productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Single tickets have gone up slightly, ranging from $16 to $36 for the 
Mainstage and from $15 to $35 for the Second Stage. SCR-goers also face a stiff 
parking fee of $6 each time they attend a show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any control over parking," Mouledoux emphasized. The theater 
does not set the fees nor share in them.

MAKING DO WITH A GOOD JOB 
</P>

<P>
 Michael Strickland wonders if there isn't "something forgettable" about Edgar, 
the role he is playing to great effect in the Shakespeare Orange County 
production of "King Lear" (through Sept. 10). 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar is one of the play's key figures, of course.A target of his brother 
Edmund's evil machinations and a victim of his gullible father's bad judgment, 
Edgar ultimately saves Gloucester and kills Edmund -- thus redeeming personal 
honor, family name and the idea of justice in an unjust world. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, everybody remembers Edmund better. "Edmund (played by Wayne Alexander) 
is one of those characters the audience loves to hate," said Strickland, a 
26-year-old graduate student at the Yale School of Drama who grew up in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when Edgar got second billing to Lear himself. A quarto 
version of the play even named him in the title, Strickland pointed out. It 
went something like "The Tragedy of King Lear, With the Lamentable Fall of 
Edgar, Son to the Earl of Gloucester." 
</P>
<P>
 The quarto refers to an original manuscript version of the play, recorded four 
centuries ago in the stage manager's notes (known as "the foul papers") and in 
transcriptions by Shakespeare's contemporaneous audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But the subtitle allusion to Edgar "was dropped in the folio and never used 
again," Strickland added. The folio was the first authoritative publication of 
the play after Shakespeare's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Strickland doesn't always do good guys. He said he recently portrayed Iago, 
one of Shakespeare's most memorable villains, in a production of "Othello" at 
Yale. JAN HERMAN

FAMILIES; CIRCUS TROUPE GETS AUDIENCE INTO ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The judge is an octopus, the lawyer is -- what else -- a shark, and a killer 
whale sings the blues because the groupers laugh at his tutu. These eccentrics 
are part of San Francisco's 21-year-old, one-ring Make-A-Circus, touring 
Southland parks with its crowd-pleasing, kid-friendly combination of offbeat 
comedy theater, circus stunts, audience involvement and live jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe is performing its three-hour, free family show Saturday at 
Chapparosa Park in Laguna Niguel and Sunday at Rennette Park in El Cajon.  
</P>
<P>
 The Make-A-Circus formula: troupe members put on a scripted comedy filled with 
circus derring-do and high jinks, take a break and teach audience members of 
all ages a few rudiments of juggling, tumbling, pyramid building and 
stilt-walking, then they pop the new performers into a second scripted 
"community" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody gets into the act in this year's second show, "Water World," about a 
greedy developer who builds an underwater shopping mall/amusement park and is 
put on trial by angry sea creatures.  
</P>
<P>
 "All the children in the workshops get to be different animals living on the 
coral reef," said artistic director Peggy Ford. There are "dolphins, dancing 
shrimps, spider crabs on stilts . . . and then we have a big ring dance where 
we invite the whole audience to come up and celebrate the end of the day with 
us," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Audience participation is part of the first company show, too. "Pirates!" is 
about shipwrecked buccaneers who try "to scrape up a new crew" at the circus, 
according to writer/director Drew Letchworth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make-A-Circus appears Saturday at Chapparosa Park, Chapparosa Park Road off 
Golden Lantern, Laguna Niguel. 12:30 p.m. Free. (714) 362-4350. Also Sunday at 
Rennette Community Park, 935 S. Emerald Ave., El Cajon. 12:30 p.m. Free. (415) 
776-8470.

PARENTING; SHE'S BIG ON THE ART OF RECYCLING; THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS JUNK TO 
NANCY RUBINS, WHOSE ENORMOUSLY AMBITIOUS SCULPTURES DEFY GRAVITY AS THEY TURN 
THE WORLD ON END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nancy Rubins is such a petite woman, the art she makes seems as though it 
couldn't possibly come from her. Using the larger chunks of trash from modern 
life -- scrapped airplane parts, discarded trailers, mattresses, hot water 
heaters -- she creates hulking bouquets of metal junk on a scale so grand they 
simultaneously read as frightening, impossible and absolutely wonderful. The 
"gee whiz" factor in her art is very high. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting the 41-year-old artist at her studio in Topanga Canyon where she 
lives with her husband, artist Chris Burden, one gets some idea of how this 
insanely ambitious work comes to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Her modestly sized studio is in a state of barely organized chaos. Her 
drawings -- large sheets of paper obsessively covered with graphite until they 
take on the sheen and weight of metal -- are casually tacked to the walls and 
cover the floor, and many are irreparably torn and smudged. To get from one 
point to another, Rubins simply kicks them out of the way. She drags furniture 
over them. She hardly seems to notice they're there. It's a messy room, but 
there's something grand about the sheer volume of material it contains, and 
there's an exhilarating freedom in the rambunctious way she lives with the raw 
material of her art. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubins herself is a whirlwind of activity who always seems to be doing three 
things at once. Listening to her tell the story of her life and art in animated 
bursts, one deduces three facts: She has a wildly unfettered imagination and a 
child's sense of play; she had extensive schooling that gave her a solid 
grounding in the art of the 20th Century, and she has an indomitable, can-do 
approach to life. These things have led her to ask herself such questions as: 
"Why can't I make a sculpture out of 100 old mattresses smeared with 300 stale 
cakes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Included in MOCA's 1992 exhibition "Helter Skelter," a controversial 
exploration of the dark side of art in Los Angeles, Rubins contributed one of 
the show's most critically acclaimed works, and this is the Rubins piece 
Angelenos are most likely to have seen. A gigantic tumble of trailers and hot 
water heaters that loomed over the show like a menacing industrial cloud, the 
piece was a knockout and made clear why her work is so popular in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California will get another look at her work when she unveils an 
installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego on Sept. 23. By 
necessity, her site-specific pieces rarely live longer than the duration of the 
average gallery show and don't come to Los Angeles too often, so a drive south 
definitely seems in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubins is remarkably precise in charting the development of her work -- many 
artists balk at such a task, but she seems to remember everything. Born in 
Naples, Tex., the youngest in a family of three children, Rubins and her family 
relocated periodically throughout her childhood, following her father's career 
as a research engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lived in Cincinnati for a few years, then we moved to Tennessee, and I 
mostly grew up in a tiny town there called Tullahoma. My mother took us to 
museums and I loved drawing, but I wasn't one of those kids who could draw a 
face -- I guess I couldn't calm down enough to do a neat drawing," she says 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an extreme sensibility from the time I was young, and always played 
intensely and had a little too much energy. I made candles, for instance, and 
the candles always got out of hand. You know how kids melt their crayons and 
make candles -- I'd keep melting until what I was making turned into something 
that had nothing to do with a candle." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduating from high school at the age of 16, Rubins enrolled at Peabody 
College in Nashville planning to become a high school art teacher, but all it 
took was one day of classes for her to realize she was in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were training people to be exactly the kind of teacher I always hated, 
so I left that program and became an art major and started making paintings -- 
these strange, organic, Eva Hesse-looking things. Scale has always been an 
issue in my work and even those early paintings were big -- they were more like 
objects that hung over ropes," says Rubins who, surprisingly enough, has never 
taken a sculpture class. "I spent a lot of time in the ceramics lab too, and at 
the time was influenced by funk, a kind of low Pop, and Minimalism." 
</P>
<P>
 After two years at Peabody, Rubins transferred to the Maryland Institute 
College of Art in Baltimore, where she says she began making "crude, unfired 
ceramic pieces. At the time I was interested in work by Peter Voulkos, and a 
few years later the work of Robert Arneson became important for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only 18 when I went to Baltimore and was lucky in that I stumbled into 
a good school," she adds. "Lots of people came down from New York and lectured, 
and I took the train up there a lot, so I got a taste of what New York was 
about. I realized I wanted to be an artist when I was in Baltimore, but I still 
felt very young and was nervous about going out into the big world, so I 
decided to go to graduate school. I wanted to see what the West Coast was 
about, so I enrolled at UC Davis, where I studied with Arneson." 
</P>
<P>
 F or obvious reasons, some ob servers mention sculptor John Chamberlain, as 
well as the California Assemblage tradition, in discussing influences on 
Rubins' work. However, she says that "while it was important to know 
Chamberlain was there, he wasn't a direct influence -- I was more interested in 
the Minimal people like Robert Ryman and Agnes Martin, and also liked Robert 
Smithson, Claes Oldenburg and Gordon Matta-Clark. As for assemblage, I love 
George Herms' and Bruce Conner's work, but my work strikes out in a different 
direction."  
</P>
<P>
 Graduating from Davis in 1976, Rubins moved to San Francisco, rented a loft, 
worked as a waitress by day and taught painting at night at the San Francisco 
Art Institute. The roots of her mature style began to appear in the work she 
made at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always gone to Goodwills," she recalls, "and one day I was in a thrift 
store and saw a pile of television sets selling for 25 cents each. I was 
fascinated by the idea that I too could own a mountain of TVs, so I loaded up 
my station wagon with them -- I bought 286 -- planning to use them in a 
sculpture, which didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village at the time, and I 
painted all the TVs with fluorescent paint, stacked them up and held them in 
place by packing them in concrete. But somehow the TVs never transcended their 
TV-ness, so I thought enough with the TVs -- I don't know what I'm doing here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not long after that, in 1977, there was an earthquake in San Francisco and 
the building I lived in rippled like a wave," adds Rubins, charting the 
evolution of her approach to scale and materials. "I was amazed that something 
so heavy and hard had the capacity to be fluid, and that led me to make a 
series of concrete walls that moved. They were a quarter of an inch thick and 
12 feet high, and if you pushed them they rippled." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that same year, Rubins went to Richmond, Va., to teach for a year at 
Virginia Commonwealth University, and while she was there her work took another 
decisive turn when she became hip to the beauty of used appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially I noticed the appliances in thrift stores because they're small 
enough that you can manipulate them, but then I became struck by how infinitely 
varied they were. Hair dryers, shavers, toasters and hot dog cookers come in a 
million shapes and colors, and I loved the fact that each one had belonged to 
somebody who had an intimate connection with it -- the presence of the user was 
definitely in the object for me, and I had no interest in unused appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyhow, I started going to thrift stores and filling my car with them, and 
every day I'd mix buckets of concrete, pack it around rows of appliances, then 
let it all set up -- I was building walls out of them," she adds. "All those 
pieces were destroyed, and I loved their impermanence -- if I had to worry 
about storing my work I'd never be able to give myself the freedom to make it. 
A little pile of appliances just didn't do it, and those pieces had to be huge 
in order to work -- there's a hilarious absurdity to them because of their 
size." 
</P>
<P>
 Completing two appliance pieces in Richmond in 1978, Rubins went to New York 
and landed a show at the O. K. Harris Gallery, scheduled for two years later. 
In the meantime, she went to teach in Tallahassee at Florida State University, 
where she collected 3,000 pounds of appliances, which she shipped to New York. 
Returning in 1980 to New York, where she was to live for a few years, Rubins 
had her show at O. K. Harris. The show was well received, but for obvious 
reasons, she didn't sell anything and made her living teaching and running a 
house-painting company. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980-82, Rubins completed a handful of monumental works in New York, a 
few done through the arts program Creative Time. She then did a controversial 
permanent commission for a shopping center in Chicago that led Al Nodal, then 
the director of the Washington, D.C.-based alternative space WPA, to commission 
a piece for a plot of land near the Watergate building. Titled "Worlds Apart" 
-- a gargantuan, 40-foot-high orb of appliances perched on a thick stem -- the 
piece took three months to build and proved to be less than popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "The town went crazy when I built that piece," says Rubins, who was 28 at the 
time. "Ostensibly they objected to it on the grounds that it was a waste of 
taxpayers' money, but it was built almost for free with donated materials. The 
truth was they just thought it was ugly. We'd hoped to leave it up after the 
three-month permit expired, but the minute the permit was up they made us take 
it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was in Washington, (Los Angeles artist) Charlie Ray called and 
invited me to teach at UCLA," she continues. "I'd never had much interest in 
L.A. but needed a break from New York so I came in the fall of '82 and lived 
downtown at 6th and San Pedro. I didn't have a car so I had to catch a bus at 
5:45 in the morning to get to UCLA in time to teach -- I felt really alien 
here," she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That changed a bit when I met Chris (Burden) at the end of 1982, and after 
returning to New York I found myself thinking, 'Gee, that's a pretty nice guy 
back there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point I was rethinking my work," she adds. "I felt I'd gone as far as 
I could with the appliances and I started noticing bigger things, like 
trailers. In 1983, I made a piece in San Francisco using trailers that I cut up 
into parts, but that was unsatisfying -- when you cut them up they lost their 
trailerness. That same year I made friends with this junk dealer in San Pedro 
named J. W. who told me where I could get trailers in bulk, and five years 
later I made a piece in Pittsburgh (Pa., for the Three Rivers Arts Festival) 
leaving the trailers intact -- that seemed like the beginning of something." 
</P>
<P>
 R ubins maintained a long- distance romance with Burden until 1984, when she 
returned to L.A. permanently and moved in with him on a piece of land in 
Topanga Canyon where they lived outdoors for four years. "At first we camped," 
she recalls, "then we built a really elaborate tent." Burden and Rubins were 
both teaching at UCLA at the time, and Rubins spent much of her free time 
trying to find someone who'd sell her used airplane parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1984 I became friends with a man in the Mojave Desert named Mr. (Bill) 
Huffman who helped me find airplane parts, but it took forever to find somebody 
willing to sell them," she recalls. "The stuff usually belonged to the 
government and there were contracts forbidding its sale, but when I finally did 
find a seller who had some declassified parts he could legally sell, the stuff 
was amazingly cheap -- it sold for whatever the cost of scrap aluminum was at 
the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with the airplane parts, I realized there's a human element in 
everything we create," she adds. "Plane seats, for instance, are structured 
like the human back. We talk about electricity in terms of male and female, hot 
water heaters are approximately the size of people and liquids go in and out -- 
everything is a metaphor for humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubins completed her first piece using airplane parts in 1985, using wire to 
affix the chunks of metal to a tree on the land where she and Burden live (the 
piece is still there). She used those materials again the same year for an 
installation at the Alexandria Hotel in downtown L.A. titled "Four Thousand 
Pounds of Smashed and Filleted Airplanes," and the following year she and 
Burden collaborated on a mechanized airplane parts installation at Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions. "That was the only mechanized piece I've ever done -- 
the mechanization was Chris' contribution to the piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she's ever considered working with organic materials, she says, "No, 
because the organic element is already in my work -- it's there in the way the 
piece dictates itself as it grows, like moss or a fungus. The impermanence of 
the work is also organic." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Rubins is working with an organic material; she's been making 
sculpture out of cakes and old mattresses for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This work took root in 1987 when I visited Baltimore and noticed all the old 
mattresses in the alleys there," she says. "Then I discovered this device used 
in packing that straps things really tight, and realized I could use it to 
sculpt with mattresses. I made my first piece using the device in Baltimore, 
but it didn't work because I needed more mattresses -- I had 150 of them, but 
somehow it needed more density. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the time I was thinking about the mattresses, I went to do a show in 
Vienna and found myself surrounded by amazing pastries," she continues. 
"European pastries are an idealized, highly fetishized food, and they represent 
a kind of culinary high point in civilization. That part of the world has such 
a dark and complex history that there's a dark undercurrent to all the sweet 
food you find there -- it's as if the pastry helps maintain the dream that 
everything's nice and under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mattresses are related to this but different in that instead of being about 
dreams, they absorb dreams, along with other base parts of human life -- our 
sweat and so forth. Mattresses are like baroque clouds that are a metaphor for 
what we desire, and sweets are about human desire as well. It seemed as if they 
went together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I built the first piece using mattresses and cakes at UCLA in the spring of 
1993, then shipped it to New York where it was shown at the Paul Kasmin 
Gallery. When you unbind the mattresses the cake cracks, so you have to apply 
fresh cakes when you reach your destination. I come from a ceramics background 
so in a way I handle the cakes as if they were clay." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing Rubins talk about the mattress pieces leaves one eager to actually see 
one, but she has something else in mind for the show in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take a break from the cakes and mattresses right now," she says. 
"The San Diego museum has a beautiful new building with a triangular room and 
I'm going to remove the high windows above the room, and use the room and the 
street for the piece -- that's about all I can say about it at this point, 
because my work takes shape as I make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she has a dream project she's never been able to pull off she looks 
surprised. "No," she says, as if such a possibility never crossed her mind. 
"I've never not been able to do anything I wanted to do with my work."* 
</P>

JUDGE IMPOSES VALLEY'S 1ST '3-STRIKES' SENTENCE; CRIME: BURGLAR ROBERT HARDY IS 
CONVICTED WITH THE HELP OF LOVE LETTERS HE WROTE TO HIS GIRLFRIEND AND 
CO-DEFENDANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only time will tell whether Robert E. Hardy's vows of eternal love for a woman 
he called "angel eyes" will stand the test of 30 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy, a 29-year-old burglar with two prior convictions and a drug habit, on 
Thursday became the first person in the San Fernando Valley convicted and 
sentenced to life in prison under the controversial "three-strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the evidence used against him this week at his Superior Court trial on 
charges of stealing $15,000 worth of musical equipment and jewelry: love 
letters to his girlfriend and co-defendant, 27-year-old Candice Bingaman. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letters, Hardy not only professed his love, he offered Bingaman 
pointers on how to testify at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you, baby. You hold the key for me," Hardy wrote in June from his cell 
in County Jail. "My love for you will never end. But there is no way that I can 
do 15, 25, or 35 years. I just can't do it, baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert J. Schuit said Hardy begged Bingaman to lie for him 
on the witness stand. "The only way I can get out of this is for you to say you 
gave Michelle the checks," he wrote. "We didn't do NO burglary. You found those 
checks in the trash. . . . Otherwise, I'm gone for good!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Bingaman chose a plea bargain over romance. She pleaded guilty 
Friday to a lesser charge of receiving stolen property and testified for the 
prosecution. She told Schuit about the letters, which she'd kept in her jail 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said those letters ultimately convinced them of Hardy's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 They deliberated less than three hours before returning the guilty verdict 
Thursday morning. By Thursday afternoon, Hardy was on his way to state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors found Hardy guilty of burglarizing the home of a North Hollywood 
composer on March 16 -- just eight days after three strikes became law in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy and Bingaman were arrested when an accomplice, Michelle Spreuer, 26, 
tried to buy tires with the stolen checks. Like Bingaman, Spreuer pleaded 
guilty to receiving stolen property. Both women are awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Hardy committed the burglary before the law went into effect, he could 
have faced a maximum sentence of 16 years in state prison. Now, he won't be 
eligible for parole for 19 years, Schuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Hardy is the type of criminal that lawmakers had in mind 
when they passed the so-called "three-strikes-and-you're-out" legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We named the three-strikes law after this guy," said Schuit. "This is a guy 
you don't want on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the district attorney's office said Hardy is among only a 
handful of Los Angeles County three-strikes convictions. As of Aug. 19, 
prosecutors have filed 863 three-strikes cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Christopher Nance had argued that Hardy was not involved in 
the crime and was being framed by his accomplices, who testified for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict, Hardy admitted to two 1989 burglary convictions. During a 
routine reading of his legal rights, Schuit asked Hardy if anyone had 
threatened him or coerced him to admit his prior convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law itself does that," Hardy mumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Michael R. Hoff then sentenced Hardy, and he was handcuffed and led 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Hoff brought the jurors back into the courtroom and told them 
they'd just decided the Valley's first three-strikes trial, a fact that had 
been kept from them. Several jurors reacted with surprise, but none seemed 
upset by Hardy's sentence.

LITTLE IN LIFE UNALTERED FOR KIDNAPING VICTIM; VAL VERDE: REALTOR ABDUCTED 
WHILE SHOWING HOMES IS HAPPY TO BE ALIVE, BUT CAN'T FORGET THE EXPERIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Real estate agent Paula Harrington has led two lives since her kidnaping two 
months ago. Neither is the one she knew before the three-day ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, the 26-year-old Val Verde resident is grateful to be alive, 
attending college, spending more time with her family and looking forward to 
having children. On the other, there are the nightmares and therapy sessions 
that have become a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington has quit her real estate job -- at least temporarily -- because the 
memories of the man who posed as a customer in order to abduct her are too 
painful to bear at the office. Harrington and her family become nervous when 
she wanders too far from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home is my comfort zone right now," she said. "I run out and do a few things 
and then I want to come home." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was abducted at gunpoint June 29 while showing houses to a man 
later identified by authorities as Timothy Daniel Shue, 39. Two days later, she 
was found tied up in an Arizona motel room after having been sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The man accused of abducting Harrington was arrested July 6 and is scheduled 
to stand trial on federal kidnaping charges Sept. 13 in Los Angeles. Shue has 
not been charged with sexual assault, but federal prosecutors have said such 
allegations could be introduced at trial and would add time to any sentence on 
the kidnaping charge.  
</P>
<P>
 The outside of Harrington's house is still decorated with a few of the many 
yellow ribbons placed there by her co-workers during the kidnaping. Inside, 
cards from friends and strangers are displayed throughout the house, as well as 
the flowers sent by well-wishers.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, Harrington is surprisingly cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone may say that I'm not in touch with my feelings and I'm suppressing 
them, and at times I am doing that," she said. "But on the other hand, I'm 
genuinely happy because I'm alive and I have a lot to live for." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jody Traver, office manager where Harrington worked, said she has noticed 
a difference in her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before she was trusting and open and very innocent," she said. "Now, she 
doesn't smile as much and she has worry lines in her face. It's very, very 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the joy of surviving the kidnaping is extinguished by cold realities. 
She and her husband, Chris, hoped to have a child during her respite from work. 
But a doctor said she will have to wait at least another six months until it is 
known whether she contracted AIDS from the sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the possibility I have AIDS is slim, but I have to be careful just in 
case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said she returned to the Century 21 office where she worked about a 
week after her kidnaping and performed duties in the office instead of showing 
homes. But she said even that was too much to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't do it," she said. "I just felt a fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees at the office also suffered emotional distress, especially 
during the first month after the kidnaping, Traver said. "Many complained of 
not being able to sleep, not being able to eat, and they were tense and nervous 
all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The small office has taken extensive security measures since -- copying the 
driver's license and license plate numbers of customers and having employees 
make detailed lists of where they are, when alone or with a customer, Traver 
said. Video cameras also are being installed inside and outside the office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her bosses have agreed to give Harrington a leave of absence until January. 
But she said she is not sure she will return. She said she is taking classes at 
College of the Canyons and may eventually pursue a liberal studies degree at a 
four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I want to be when I grow up," she joked. "I thought I 
wanted to be a real estate agent, but it may take some time to get over (the 
kidnaping)." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said she is trying to stay busy to keep the incident out of her 
mind as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she goes to the Saugus Metrolink station weekdays to sell 
newspapers and coffee to riders -- a job she also did before the kidnaping. She 
said some regulars know about her ordeal, but most never "associate the 'real 
estate lady' with the 'coffee lady.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have any quiet time at all, I instantly pick up a book," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But forgetting is not an option. Police and lawyers continue to interview her 
about the ordeal, expecting her to remember the details of what happened. She 
said that prospect is frightening because many of those details she hasn't even 
shared with her husband yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said her husband has his own scars from the episode and is very 
protective of her now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walk down the street while he's on the phone, just to talk to a neighbor, 
and he'll holler out the balcony (for me)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traver said Harrington is handling the situation as well as any person could, 
but that the road back to a normal life will be a long one. 
</P>
<P>
 "She believed when got she got safely home it would be all be over for her," 
Traver said. "But now she's finding out the nightmare has just begun."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PROPOSED RULES FOR PAWNSHOPS WORRY OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing in his store full of worn guitars, gold pocket watches and 
sapphire-studded class rings, Canoga Park pawnshop owner Stanley Ward decried 
new attempts Thursday to regulate his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a legitimate business (and) are being persecuted," he said. "We are 
not second-class citizens, and shouldn't be treated as such." 
</P>
<P>
 In what he called an effort to discourage trafficking in stolen property, City 
Councilman Nate Holden has proposed new regulations, including limitations on 
hours and a citywide ban on drive-up windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large number of stolen items . . . end up in a pawnshop," Holden said. But 
if the city can't regulate all aspects of the business, "we can control the 
operating hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, whose shop closes at 5:30 p.m., was among the owners who called the 
proposal harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said it was an idea worth trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why they should be open when we have bank machines 24 hours," 
said Sergio Moraga, who owns a shop down the street from Ward's. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden has asked the city attorney's office to draw up plans within 60 days to 
limit pawnshop operations and hours, though he said he didn't know yet what 
those hours might be. 
</P>
<P>
 The shops are magnets for ne'er-do-wells, he said, and if the business is 
legitimate, there is no need to be open at 3 a.m. or to swap goods for cash 
through a window. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not under control," Holden said of the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A criminal can commit "burglaries (in the middle of the night) and then turn 
around and sell the stuff in the same minute." 
</P>
<P>
 To many owners, Holden's proposal is yet the latest attack on a business that 
continues to be punished for problems -- such as fencing stolen goods -- that 
were cleaned up decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Moraga, who liked the idea of limiting hours, said, "We have more 
regulations than any other (business)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ward, "Pawnshops today are not like the 'The Pawnbroker,' with Rod 
Steiger. We're as concerned about crime as the LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 On his counter is an ink pad for the thumbprint he must take from every person 
from whom he accepts goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath his counter are the receipts that require everything from a customer's 
driver's license number to his hair and eye color to be listed. 
</P>
<P>
 And the slips are sent every morning to the LAPD's pawn detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said the pawn business "is as clean as the furniture business (in which 
he spent some 40 years); as legitimate as the restaurant across the street."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; LAUREL PLAZA TENANTS IN DARK ON CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After meeting Thursday with the owners of Laurel Plaza, the tenants of the 
earthquake-damaged mall remain in limbo about whether they will ever be allowed 
to reopen their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from F. C. Laurel Inc. told the tenants they want to meet with 
them individually to talk about the cleanup of asbestos that became a hazard 
after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But F. C. Laurel officials stopped short of saying if and when the mall will 
ever reopen, or whether the firm will pay for the asbestos cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest delay angered tenants, who have been deprived of their livelihoods 
since the 33-store mall closed. The mall's manager, Forest City Enterprises 
Inc., has over the past few months set two reopening dates; both have come and 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very upset, because they did not give us any straight answers" said 
Anthony Tapanes, owner of Hot Dog Heaven, after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants say Forest City Enterprises has been deliberately stalling the 
reopening because it wants to tear the mall down and build a new one at the 
site.  
</P>
<P>
 Some tenants said after the meeting they believe Forest City has been hoping 
the tenants will voluntarily back out of their leases to avoid paying asbestos 
cleanup costs. Getting rid of the tenants would clear the way for building the 
new mall, the tenants say. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall owner is using a divide-and-conquer strategy in meeting with tenants 
individually, they further charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But F. C. Laurel and Forest City maintain that the proposed new mall is a 
separate issue. They are trying to resolve the situation fairly, they say.  
</P>
<P>
 They say they are meeting individually with tenants because their problems 
must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some tenants have insurance that will help pay for the asbestos 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there is a lot of frustration among the tenants, and I am working to 
try to resolve some of that frustration," said James Richardson, a project 
director for Forest City, during a news conference after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that after the meetings with tenants, he will meet with lenders, then 
go back and meet with the tenants again, at which point "we'll go over with the 
tenants what the future of the Plaza is." FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CSUN QUAKE BULLETIN TO ASSIST STUDENTS 
</P>

By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To allay the confusion and frustrations of students, faculty and staff members 
of Cal State Northridge as start their second semester amid massive quake 
repairs, the university's public relations office has published 50,000 copies 
of the Earthquake Recovery Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
 An upbeat update on the status of the buildings, parking and shuttle service, 
the four-page document will be available to the public at news racks and 
information kiosks throughout campus, according to CSUN spokeswoman Carmen 
Ramos Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulletin includes tidbits of quake humor such as politically correct 
euphemisms for the Jan. 17 disaster: "stability challenged" and "geological 
resource reallocation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a positive tone," Chandler said. "You have to get to the point that 
you can laugh at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said the bulletin will be published each semester until all the 
"directional disproportionment" repairs have been completed. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; GRANTS AVAILABLE FOR POST-QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has a new grant program that provides eligible homeowners up to 
$35,000 for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the department began taking applications for the grants about two weeks 
ago, I must have gotten 60 calls," said Barbara Pilegard, the city's assistant 
planner."I guess that means there was a lot more damage out there than we 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The community development block grants come from the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, said Scott Whyte, development specialist for the 
Los Angeles County Community Development Commission. They are funneled to the 
city through Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas was hit particularly hard by the quake in terms of dollar value, he 
said. The city reported $48,450,000 in damage and was awarded $1,343,793 of the 
$3 million in federal funds that were available to seven area cities, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for grants, homeowners must have already filed a claim with their 
insurance companies, said Whyte. They must also have applied to the Small 
Business Administration, which offers disaster loans to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can't qualify for the loans, they would be referred to the state's 
Individual and Family Grant Program. If any grants from that program fail to 
cover all the damage, the homeowner applies to the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city inspects the homes of each applicant to determine the extent of the 
damage, then meets with a review committee to decide whether to provide funds, 
said Pilegard. If the grant is approved, the city hires a contractor to do the 
work, then pays the contractor directly for the work. FRANK MANNING

POLICE ARREST 2 ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A doctor and his roommate were arrested Tuesday night for allegedly conducting 
an elaborate marijuana-growing operation inside their Glendale home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found over an ounce of the drug, an array of sophisticated equipment 
used to grow marijuana plants indoors, plus pipes and smoking paraphernalia 
when they served a search warrant at the home of Dr. Eugene L. Herzog in the 
3400 block of Angeles Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, 49, is a physician with a practice in Los Angeles. He was booked for 
felony cultivation of marijuana and released later on $10,000 bail. Michael 
David Green, 31, who lived at the same address, faces identical charges, police 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police also found 12 marijuana plants at a North Hollywood address, where they 
believe Herzog and Green stashed them in anticipation of a possible police 
raid, said Detective Scott Bickle of the vice and narcotics bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very obvious as we walked into the house that there was a marijuana 
growing operation in the bedroom," Bickle wrote in a police report. He said 
there was evidence of marijuana throughout the house, even in the kitchen: 
"There was no room on the counter to prepare food without getting marijuana on 
your food." 
</P>
<P>
 Bickle said police acted on a tip from an unidentified informant. STEVE RYFLE

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ACTOR LAMAS TO LEAD 'RIDE FOR LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 2,000 motorcyclists are expected to participate Sunday in Lorenzo Lamas' 
second annual "Ride for Life" from Newhall to Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 The television star of "Renegade" will lead the ride, which begins at 10 a.m. 
at Valencia Plaza, 24508 Lyons Ave., and will wind along California 126 and up 
through the Ojai Valley on California 150 before arriving at the lake, 70 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclists will pay $30 each to participate in the ride, which includes a 
barbecue lunch with live music and other entertainment at the lake. Profits 
will go to the World Children's Transplant Fund, which provides donor organs 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment will include Lamas' TV sidekick Brandscombe Richmond and his 
band, the Renegade Posse. A second set will be performed by Texas Flood. 
Comedians also will be on hand, along with Ojai area vendors selling everything 
from food to motorcycle paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers encourage those interested to sign up in advance, as the 2,000 
slots for the event may sell out, said Dana Tkac, ride coordinator and

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DISTRICT TO SPEND $673,000 TO STUDY NEEDS OF 3 
SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: AN ARCHITECTURAL FIRM IS HIRED TO SURVEY WHAT IMPROVEMENTS 
ARE NECESSARY AT EACH CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees in the William S. Hart Union High School District have decided to 
spend $673,000 to study needed improvements at three schools, even though there 
is no certainty the funding to actually do the work will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of trustees voted Wednesday to hire the architectural firm of 
Neptune Thomas Davis to study needs at Hart High, Placerita Junior High and 
Sierra Vista Junior High schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Since each of the schools is at least 30 years old, they would be eligible for 
$6.9 million in state modernization funds that will be needed to do the work. 
But those funds will only become available if voters approve a $2-billion bond 
issue in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the public doesn't buy that (bond) we're back to square one, but we're out 
on the architecture funds," said John Hassel, a Hart board member. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar $1-billion bond measure narrowly failed in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassel said he reluctantly approved the study, thinking the funds for it might 
be better spent on some of the schools' most urgent needs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the district must complete a design study to be eligible for the 
modernization funds. The schools are slowly deteriorating at current funding 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it's a risk we have to take," said Bill Dinsenbacher, a board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school needs more than $2 million worth of work, including replacement of 
air-conditioning units and worn roofs, asbestos removal, classroom and 
administrative building repairs, and other things, Hassel said. He said the 
term "modernization" is a bit misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just to bring the facilities up to today's standards," he said. "It does 
not include those things that will be necessary to bring technology into the 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate and Assembly are considering separate bills to place a 
$2-billion bond issue on the November ballot, said Dwayne Brooks, assistant 
superintendent for school facilities planning for the state Department of 
Education. He said the measure would provide $1.5 billion for K-12 schools, 
with the rest allocated to universities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart trustees are not confident the bond will pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not have a very good track record in this state in terms of public 
support of bonds," Hassel said. "They're fairly consistently shooting them 
down."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HOSPITAL UP AGAINST WALL IN CONTRACT 
CONTROVERSY; LABOR: FRUSTRATION BUILDS AS HEALTH WORKERS PICKET. ADMINISTRATOR 
SAYS IT'S THE UNION'S FAULT THAT TALKS STALLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 20 Lancaster Community Hospital workers, frustrated over stalled 
contract talks, built a "Berlin Wall" of cardboard boxes and picketed outside 
the institution Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration was the second in three months by representatives of the 
Hospital & Service Employees International Union. The group has alleged that 
the 132-bed hospital is sending profits back to its German-owned parent 
corporation while refusing to increase wages for local employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're building the 'Berlin Wall' to represent the oppression and repression 
we're forced to work under here," said Jay Corcoran, an operating room 
technician and member of the negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But hospital officials said the wall was merely a publicity stunt aimed at 
harassing and embarrassing the firm that owns the hospital. Steven Schmidt, 
chief executive officer at the hospital, said the contract talks are stalled 
because the union insists that the hospital require all eligible employees to 
join. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the main obstacle in reaching an agreement," Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also insisted that the owner, Paracelsus Healthcare Corp., has poured much 
of its local profits into buying new equipment and renovating Lancaster 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor dispute dates back to 1989, when a majority of employees voted to be 
represented by the union. The hospital spent several years unsuccessfully 
challenging the validity of the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract talks began in March, 1993, and hospital officials said they have met 
with union negotiators 48 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Displeased with the results of the talks, hospital workers picketed outside 
the hospital in May to call attention to unsettled contract issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the National Labor Relations Board filed an unfair labor 
practices complaint against the hospital, citing tactics the hospital allegedly 
used to discourage workers from participating in the May picketing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent memo, Schmidt said the board's complaint was "totally without 
merit." He said the hospital would defend itself during a Nov. 15 hearing 
before an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's demonstration, hospital officials kept a low profile. But Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies were summoned after the hospital complained 
that the "Berlin Wall" was a structure being built without permission on 
private property -- the hospital's front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members then agreed to dismantle the cardboard wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the relatively small turnout by hospital employees, who number more 
than 300, the picketers said discontent among workers is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're frustrated that the hospital isn't coming any closer to agreeing to 
sign a contract," said Loretta Flood, a registered nurse at the hospital.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CEMENT FIRM WINS STAY ON ORDER TO STOP BURNING 
WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cement company has been granted permission to continue burning hazardous 
waste as part of its manufacturing process while a federal order to cease the 
burning is appealed in court, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 National Cement Co. of California burns a mixture of petroleum and spent, 
hazardous solvents in its kiln near Lebec to generate the heat necessary to 
manufacture cement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had ordered the 
company to stop burning as of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco granted a 
stay to the company Wednesday, said National Cement president Don Unmacht.  
</P>
<P>
 He said such victories are rare against a government agency. "In order to get 
a stay you usually have to convince the judge you're going to ultimately 
prevail on the appeal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unmacht said the decision is only a small step in a legal battle that is 
expected to take years. Arguments on the appeal are scheduled to be heard 
sometime in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The burning has been opposed for several years by Desert Citizens Against 
Pollution, a small group of area residents who claim fumes from the burning are 
causing health problems for residents. The group filed a civil lawsuit earlier 
this month against National Cement demanding that the burning be stopped. The 
group's leaders called the suit a "backup" measure in the event that the EPA's 
order fails. 
</P>
<P>
 "These citizens groups are tenacious and we will wait for the next round," 
said Lyle Talbot, a Desert Citizens member. "Someday they will have to pay the 
pollution piper, we hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the dispute involves the Tejon Ranch Co., owner of the land the 
incinerator is on. Tejon officials said that they are aware of the burning, but 
that they are not participants in its supervision and direction as the EPA 
requires. Tejon Ranch is about 30% owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of The 
Times.

DUNLAP SPARKS NORTHRIDGE, 3-0; LITTLE LEAGUE: HE GIVES UP ONE HIT IN U.S. 
CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY. GORDON HITS THREE-RUN HOMER.

<P>
 In a game his teammates said he was born to pitch, Nathaniel Dunlap threw a 
one-hitter to give Northridge the United States Little League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-run home run by Spencer Gordon in the first inning provided Dunlap a 
cushion, and the 5-foot-11 right-hander carried a no-hitter into the final 
inning before settling for a 3-0 victory over Springfield, Va. Thursday before 
20,000 at Howard J. Lamade Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (20-1, 3-1 in series play) will be the third consecutive team from 
Southern California to represent the United States in the World Series 
championship game. Long Beach is two-time World Series champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Maracaibo, Venezuela, defeated Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 10-1, to win the 
international championship and will face Northridge on Saturday at 12:40 p.m. 
PDT. The game will be televised on Channel 7. Venezuela is 4-0 in series play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal all along was to win the U.S. title, and that is accomplished," said 
Larry Baca, the Northridge manager. "I am gratified we are playing Saturday and 
it will be fun, but it is icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap's effort was Northridge's second consecutive one-hit shutout over 
Springfield. Justin Gentile held the South Region champion hitless after the 
first batter singled in a 2-0 victory Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the most important game of Nathaniel's life," Gentile said. 
"Everybody tells him he was born to pitch, and he was born to pitch this game 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Weishar hit a sharp single to right field with one out in the sixth 
against Dunlap, ending a hitless streak of 11 1/3 innings against Northridge 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Miller followed with a ground ball to shortstop Matt Fisher that hit the 
lip of the infield grass and bounced off Fisher's chest for an error, bringing 
the tying run to the plate. However, Dunlap struck out Pat Malatino then Ethan 
Lare -- Springfield's best hitter -- to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Ethan to look for breaking balls, and they outfoxed us by throwing the 
heater," said George Lare, the Virginia coach and Ethan's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would the 5-foot-11 Dunlap throw anything else? Standing 46 feet from home 
plate, he throws a 74 m.p.h. fastball. He is the equivalent of a 7-foot-9 
pitcher throwing 97 m.p.h. from the regulation 60 feet 6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "You end a game with a fastball, and you end it with a strikeout," Dunlap 
said. "You blow it past him. That's the way it's supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, who hit two batters, struck out 10 and walked none. He has 23 
strikeouts and one walk in 12 series innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher and first baseman Matt Cassel made nice fielding plays for Northridge, 
which has made only two errors in four series games. 
</P>
<P>
 No Northridge batters struck out. Gentile doubled twice, Cassel singled twice 
and Gregg Wallis doubled. Northridge left seven runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a chance to run up the score after the first inning, but 
they played good defense," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon's home run provided the game's only offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge cleanup hitter had been one for nine in the series before 
stepping to the plate in the first inning, and he had made the final out with 
runners on base in a 4-2 loss to Brooklyn Center, Minn., on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After that game, Gordon was devastated, telling his parents that he was 
responsible for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is as redeemed as a kid could ever be," said Eric Gordon, Spencer's 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 And Northridge is redeemed as well, having followed the opening loss with 
three consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca, who had criticized the pool-play format before the tournament began, has 
had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it worked out is fine," he said. "No complaints."

NEW EARTHQUAKE PROBLEMS TO TACKLE; FOOTBALL: DAMAGE TO CANYONS STADIUM FORCES 
HART, SAUGUS TO CHANGE SCHEDULE, HOME SITE. 
</P>

<P>
 Hart and Saugus high schools will play some of their home games at Canyon High 
because of earthquake damage to the football stadium at College of the Canyons, 
their traditional home site. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium at Canyons was severely damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake, and it 
is estimated that repairs should be completed by Oct. 15.  
</P>
<P>
 Hart's opener Sept. 9 against San Fernando has been moved to Canyon and its 
game against Thousand Oaks the following week has been moved from Friday, Sept. 
16 to Sept. 15. Hart was not scheduled to play again at Canyons until Nov. 4, 
eight weeks into the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus is on the road until the third week of season. Its Friday, Sept. 23 
game against Loyola has been moved up to Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors indicate the north stairwell of the stadium continues to sink and 
have ordered additional tests. College administrators have said it will take 21 
days to analyze the results of those tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons spokesperson Sue Bozman said, "It's a safety issue, and we cannot 
allow anyone in (the stadium) until it is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita schools that use the facilities at Canyons were told Tuesday 
that the stadium would not be ready for the Sept. 9 opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Four high schools will use the field at Canyon. Valencia, which opens this 
fall, will field a sophomore team and also is scheduled to play at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Coach Larry Mohr sees no problems with the plan unless Mother Nature 
intervenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use a separate practice field, so that helps," Mohr said. "But if there is 
a tough rainfall, then that field is going to get torn up and need to be 
replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon will continue to play on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus Coach Jack Bowman has been through this before. While at Westminster, 
his team shared a home field with two other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the support groups are going to be affected by this more so than 
the players," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Herrington, Hart's coach, expressed concern for his senior players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that we have some players that looked forward to playing at COC," 
Herrington said. "It's a thrill for high school kids to come running down the 
hill and play under the lights."

 His team had reached a mountaintop, winning the championship of the United 
States, and all Matt Cassel wanted to do was roll down a hill. 
</P>
<P>
 His jersey was untucked, his pants were stained with brick dust and his face 
was abeam. The Northridge first baseman had singled twice and made a sparkling 
defensive play in the team's 3-0 victory over Springfield, Va., Thursday before 
20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet 30 minutes after the game, he felt like any other 12-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 A steep, grassy hill leads from the team dormitories to the field, the kind of 
hill a kid likes to roll down crazily, then crawl back up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew things were going to work out today," Cassel said, grabbing teammate 
Matt Cunningham around the neck and playfully wrestling him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge players were strewn all over the turf moments after the game, 
laying flat on their backs in feigned exhaustion after having circled the 
outfield in a victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Larry Baca and Coach George Saul gathered the team on the first-base 
line for the type of postgame chat teams all over the country engage in. Baca 
sat cross-legged on the ground and the players crowded around him, yanking 
blades of grass from the ground and tossing them at one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (20-1), No. 1 in the nation, is a Little League team through and 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys behave like prize puppies. They have what it takes to win trophy 
after trophy, and they know it. They play the game, then they just plain play. 
</P>
<P>
 For a victory meal, they feasted on hot dogs and baked beans served on paper 
plates. "These are really good hot dogs," said third baseman Gregg Wallis in 
all seriousness to a trio of teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were invited into the dormitory area for the first time all week, and 
everyone milled around, eating and congratulating one another. 
</P>
<P>
 All the back-slapping made some players restless. Scooter Drake punched his 
father's arm lightly and said, "C'mon Dad, let's go play Ping-Pong." 
</P>
<P>
 A few players separated themselves from the celebration, choosing to sit with 
their food on the lawn overlooking the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have anybody bugging you here. You can put your mind at rest," 
David Teraoka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to Teraoka sat Peter Tuber, an intense, quiet boy who will be the 
starting pitcher Saturday in the World Series championship against Maracaibo, 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thoughts about Saturday are starting to come to me," he said between bites. 
"I'm just gonna throw hard and have my pitches working." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Dunlap, who pitched a one-hitter in Thursday's victory, took a seat 
and told Tuber, "You're going to do good on Saturday, Pete." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber's mind had already wandered, however. He told Dunlap, "I signed an 
autograph to this one kid, and he said, 'Nice pitching,' like I'd pitched 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 They shared the laugh, then Tuber continued, "And I got two hugs from girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Teraoka chimed in, "I got two hugs too." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, from your parents," replied Tuber gently, and the three boys laughed 
heartily. 
</P>
<P>
 They were champions of their nation, they were goofy kids, and from a hill in 
Williamsport, life could not have been better.

BOWLED OVER; EVEN BRIFMAN IS AMAZED BY THE STRIDES SHE HAS MADE IN 2 YEARS ON 
VALLEY LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most athletes sweat, agonize and dream daily. They ply their trade throughout 
their youth, hoping they might grow up to be rich and famous by sinking the 
jump shot, hitting the curveball or completing the long bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Brifman seems to have stumbled upon greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 months after the Granada Hills High junior joined her first bowling 
league, she placed fifth in a national handicap tournament. Brifman, 16, joined 
the league in September, 1992, as a favor to a friend and entered the 
tournament by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Brifman has a coach who considers her a prospect for the Ladies Pro 
Bowlers Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Brifman had no idea what the initials LPBT stood for. Why would 
she? She was playing for fun and had only an 80 average. Now she carries a 171 
average and seems to be within striking distance of the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to be a pro," she said. "I think I'd like to be at 190 next 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
 A 200 average would be good enough to put Brifman among the top 30 on the 
LPBT. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brifman barely knew how to hold a ball when she competed in the National 
Junior Bowling Championships, which attracted more than 110,000 bowlers in 
July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had not a clue how to bowl," said Farol Brifman, Lauren's mother. "She 
didn't know why she was so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren knew only that when she rolled her ball, pins seemed to fall. With 
coaching, she has learned a fluid approach and delivery that grabs attention 
whenever she hits the alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere we go people say, 'Is that your daughter?' " Farol Brifman said. 
"I say, 'Yeah.' They say, 'Boy, is she going to make a lot of money someday on 
the pro tour.' Or they say, 'She's a natural. You can't teach form like that.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Farol also recalled how the pro shop operator at a local center -- after 
watching Lauren from his counter -- came down to the scoring table to get her 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody would be making such a fuss over Brifman, however, had schoolmate 
Michael Liteles not invited her to play on his winter-league team at Brunswick 
Granada Lanes in September, 1992. Brifman had practically no bowling 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I was that good -- not good enough to help the team," Brifman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she joined and rolled an 89 in her first game. Still, Liteles, an avid 
bowler, thought she had potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I didn't know she would get so good," said Liteles, also 16. "I had 
bowled for about eight years. I got a trophy in 1985 for winning a league. She 
was better than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Brifman had found her niche as an athlete after sampling a few years as a 
baseball and softball outfielder and a defender in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1992, Brifman joined the Northridge Knights' youth basketball team as 
its only female member. A 5-foot-7 1/2 forward who was occasionally in the 
starting lineup, Brifman specialized in shooting from the perimeter. She chose 
the all-boys' team, in part, because there was no girls' team in the 
neighborhood. But she also liked the challenge of trying to crack the Knights' 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like competing and I thought I could do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She dropped basketball as soon as she realized she could score better in 
bowling. Liteles said it was not unusual for Brifman, who had an 80 handicap at 
first, to put up handicap scores of 200 or better. Soon national tournament 
officials would eye those scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Brifman said she wasn't too careful in filling out her league entry form at 
Granada Lanes. Without reading the fine print, she put a check mark in a box 
that automatically entered her in the National Junior Bowling Championships. 
The NJBC starts as a local contest, in which a tournament official randomly 
selects series scores from one day of league competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Brifman's scores for three games (taken in February, 1992) were 151, 131 and 
151, and combined with her 95 handicap at the time. She qualified second among 
girls in the junior handicap division (ages 9-21) and advanced to the district 
tournament at Granada Lanes in March. Again she finished second, this time 
qualifying for the state competition in Modesto in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 Brifman said she was a little embarrassed at the notion that she eliminated 
several hundred girls with more experience. When tournament officials 
congratulated her, all she could say was, "Oh, really? That's good." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowling six games at McHenry Bowl in Modesto, Brifman captured the state 
championship. The highlight was a raw score of 204 in one game, marking the 
first time she cracked 200. The average score of her handicapped games was 
234.83. Tournament Director Joellyn Rinnander called Brifman into the office to 
break the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's good," said Brifman, again at a loss for words. But it was on to 
Kansas City and the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the country's top 60 girls in her division, Brifman bowled 12 games, 
averaged more than 220 per game with her handicap, and finished fifth. Nine 
more pins and she would have eclipsed Amy Glover of Great Falls, Mont., who 
finished fourth and was the last to qualify for the match-play, stepladder 
finals. Brifman also was nine pins short of winning scholarship money -- 
$11,000 was divided among the top four. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last summer was exciting," she said. "It seemed like I just got better and 
better every game. But this year is fun, too, because I feel like I have more 
control and know a little more about the game than I did before." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Hawthorn, a local coach and a successful amateur player, started working 
with Brifman last summer. He immediately set out to correct her approach, arm 
swing and follow-through. The changes would be possible, he thought, because 
she had natural talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got great form and we've been working real hard to even improve that in 
the last few weeks," Hawthorn said. "When I teach people who I think have 
ability, I try to take all imperfections out and give them nothing but absolute 
perfection." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Brifman talented, she is a quick learner. "If I tell her to do 
something, within three balls she'll do it," Hawthorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brifman has continued to improve while competing for the Greater Los Angeles 
Junior All-Stars on weekends. She bowls several days a week in Simi Valley at 
Brunswick Valley Bowl because Granada Lanes was destroyed in the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Brifman's average improved 67 pins in the last year, impressing Diane 
Stanislawski, director of the national junior tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the bowlers that come there have the potential for greatness at some 
point in time," she said. "But for Lauren to go up 60 pins in a year, that's a 
major accomplishment. Your talking between five and six clean frames in a game. 
She's obviously learned to make spares, keep the ball in play and improve her 
striking ability. It takes a lot to master all that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brifman might someday push her average above 200, which would put her in the 
company of two noteworthy Valley women. Former pro Donna Adamek, proprietor at 
Rocket Bowl in Chatsworth, ranks 11th on the LPBT with a 207.2 career average. 
Tish Johnson of Panorama City, who has made more than $500,000 in 13 years on 
the tour, ranks fourth with a career average of 208.2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day when I bowl, I learn something new about me and how good I really 
am," Brifman said. "I underestimate myself a lot. I surprise myself with just 
my ability to do it."

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES NOTEBOOK; NORTHRIDGE PLAYERS GET A SIGNING BONUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The penmanship of 12-year-olds isn't usually the greatest, but the Northridge 
players are getting some practice before school begins next month. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been besieged with requests for autographs following each game, 
mostly from girls about their own age. The players sign programs, T-shirts and 
baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some enjoy it more than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unreal," said first baseman Matt Cassel to catcher Matt Cunningham. 
Both players tried to appear nonchalant, but couldn't help giggling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no laughing matter to Peter Tuber, Northridge's standout pitcher, when 
he saw his teammates being swarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there another way out of here?" he asked a Little League official. 
</P>
<P>
 The official pointed to another exit, and Tuber bolted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A trained eye: On the field, Tuber is perhaps the most poised of the 
Northridge players. His ability to remain calm and focused reminds his 
grandmother, Pat Reiser, of her late husband, Pete Reiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber was named after Reiser, who died in 1981, two months after Tuber was 
born. Reiser played outfield for 10 years with the Brooklyn Dodgers and was the 
National League batting champion in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Pete and his grandfather both are all business on the field," said Pat 
Reiser, who married Pete in 1941, the year after he was National League rookie 
of the year. "Pete has the same look in his eye his grandfather had." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat lives in Palm Springs and has seen most of Peter's all-star games. She 
gets more apprehensive watching her grandson than she did watching her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose I feel more for him," she said of Peter. "He's my grandson and I 
get nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 She'll have plenty of reason to be nervous Saturday. Peter is scheduled to be 
the starting pitcher for Northridge against Maracaibo, Venezuela, in the World 
Series championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber, who struck out 13 in a 6-4 victory over Middleboro, Mass., on Tuesday, 
probably will face Cesar Hidalgo, who struck out 15 in a 4-1 victory over 
Chinese Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cheeky gals: With national attention on their brothers, what are sisters of 
Northridge players to do on game day? 
</P>
<P>
 Paint their faces, what else? 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Cunningham, 14, serves as official artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," she said, shrugging while painting No. 14 on the cheeks of Katie, 
6, and Kelly Fisher, 10, sisters of shortstop Matt. He is, of course, No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, Becky Teraoka, 15, Traci Wallis, 19, and Lindsay Wallis, 17, also 
created colorful posters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hot commodity: Seventy additional T-shirts with the words "The Earthquake 
Kids" circled around a baseball marked with a Richter scale were sent by 
Federal Express to Michael Nesbit, father of outfielder Mike Nesbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The shirts were sold for $10 each. Another shipment is due Saturday morning 
with a line added: "United States champion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the music: Music is played over loudspeakers between innings and one 
song is a favorite of Northridge reserves Michael Nesbit, David Teraoka, 
Scooter Drake, Todd Delevie and John-Michael Baca. 
</P>
<P>
 They sing along to the lyrics of John Fogerty's "Centerfield," with special 
emphasis on the line, "Put me in, coach, I'm ready to play . . . today."

<P>
 Cleveland High has named Jim Mills co-coach of the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, who last season was an assistant at Chaminade, will work with Steve 
Landress, the team's coach the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, a walk-on coach who is self-employed, isn't exactly an unknown quantity 
at Cleveland. He is a football assistant for the Cavaliers and an alumnus of 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's knowledgeable in the sport and he's a good disciplinarian," said Everett 
Macy, Cleveland's athletic director. "He'll really be good for the program, a 
definite asset." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland finished 3-20 last spring and was last in the North Valley League at 
2-15. The Cavaliers were 6-14-1, 5-12 in 1993. STEVE ELLING

PALMDALE MAKES MINOR DEAL; BASEBALL: CITY REACHES AGREEMENT WITH PROPOSED 
GOLDEN STATE LEAGUE FOR $5-MILLION STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Officials from the City of Palmdale will sign a letter of intent today with 
the Chatsworth-based Golden State League, bringing the region a step closer to 
landing a professional minor-league baseball franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said Thursday that the city has reached an 
agreement in principle with league president Bob Weinstein. Under terms of the 
deal, the league will finance a $5-million stadium in exchange for 25 acres of 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed league, on the drawing board for two years, will have 90 days to 
tie up a handful of loose ends -- which include proving it has $50 million in 
its coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Weinstein: "It's been a long time coming." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the agreement, the league will pay for stadium construction in 
exchange for land and other concessions. Namely, the city will provide site 
infrastructure such as utility hookups, and must expedite the permit process 
and waive developmental fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale this month acquired a 117-acre parcel of land, 25 acres of which has 
been tentatively designated for the new stadium, which will be owned by the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State, an independent league with no major-league affiliation, 
hopes to finance six new stadiums across Southern California by next summer, 
when the inaugural season is set to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein's proposal already has cleared the Palmdale city attorney and 
redevelopment offices. Ledford said he is "definitely intrigued" by the plan. 
Many Southland cities have been forced to build pricey stadiums to attract 
minor-league teams. 
</P>
<P>
 For Palmdale, it's a low-risk venture at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the state of minor-league baseball and this is worth looking at," 
Ledford said. "It's a whole different situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pull-your-own-weight baseball. It all falls on (Weinstein)." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, a 51-year-old investment banker from Chatsworth, must prove that 
the league's financial house is in order and that he can deliver the other 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it falls apart, it's no harm, no foul for Palmdale," Weinstein said. "I'm 
the only one with egg on my face."

HARRISON HAPPY AT PEPPERDINE; BASEBALL: NEW COACH HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH FOUR 
TEAMS THAT HAVE WON NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New Pepperdine baseball Coach Pat Harrison knows the way to Omaha and the 
College World Series.  
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, 48, also knows how to win at Omaha. He has been associated with four 
College World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Harrison was the starting second baseman for USC, which won the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973 and '74, Harrison helped guide the Trojans to the championship as a 
member of the USC coaching staff under Rod Dedeaux. Last season, as an 
assistant under Oklahoma's Larry Cochell, Harrison had a hand in a fourth 
national championship.  
</P>
<P>
 So when Pepperdine began its search to replace Andy Lopez, who resigned June 
20 to become coach at Florida, the first person it turned to was Harrison.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to have a business or a school show interest and pursue you," 
Harrison said. "I think Pepperdine has a great baseball tradition, even better 
than some people realize, and I hope to continue that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison has hired former Dodger and Angel pitcher Geoff Zahn as pitching 
coach. Zahn was the athletic director at The Master's College in Newhall, where 
Harrison was coach from 1987-90.

 In 1972, Harrison was studying to become a Presbyterian minister at Fuller 
Seminary in Pasadena when Dedeaux invited him to be an assistant at USC. He has 
also coached at Washington State and Oral Roberts.  
</P>
<P>
 As a player, Harrison became USC's first two-time All-American. During his 
senior season, he batted .278 and led the Trojans in runs batted in with 47 to 
help USC win the national championship. He was selected by the Dodgers in the 
first round of the secondary phase of the draft.  
</P>
<P>
 During his first day in major league training camp, Harrison tore his left 
hamstring. He quit as a player after 2 1/2 seasons in the minor leagues.  
</P>
<P>
 Harrison will be pressed to match Lopez's record. In six seasons, Lopez guided 
the Waves to four NCAA playoff appearances and the 1992 national championship. 
His record was 241-107.

 Clarification: MCI said some of its existing long-distance rates are a third 
lower than local long-distance rates tentatively approved for Pacific Bell by 
the state Public Utilities Commission. But MCI said it has not pledged to 
underprice Pacific Bell by a third in the local long-distance market, as 
reported here July 29.

IN HOT WATER; OCEAN WARMS UP DRAMATICALLY THIS SUMMER 
</P>

 When San Clemente lifeguard Richard Chew looked at the thermometer, he 
couldn't believe it. It read 79.9 degrees. Not the air. The water temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wondered if our thermometer was working right!" Chew exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 So Chew and his colleagues checked the reading against one taken by state 
lifeguards the same day, Aug. 18, aboard a boat a mile out from San Clemente. 
That reading: 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least two weeks, Orange County's coastal waters have heated up to 
unusually tropical temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at this time, water temperatures averaged 70 degrees, but ocean 
water temperatures are now averaging 76 degrees along Orange County's 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that as inland air temperatures have soared, the heat -- combined 
with only mild wind -- has had a warming effect on the ocean, said Dean Jones, 
meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said a high pressure system over Southern California has prevented high 
winds from developing over ocean waters and producing upwelling, when warmer, 
surface waters are moved away and replaced by colder water down below. 
</P>
<P>
 When told about the 80-degree temperatures, Jones said, "Wow! That is warm." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have that strong offshore flow pattern, which would result in 
upwelling," Jones said, "the water can become more stagnant and heat up over a 
period of days or weeks, even a month. And it has been a pretty warm summer." 
</P>
<P>
 For lifeguards, there are other more obvious indicators of warmer waters, 
including larger beach crowds and more reports of stingray and jellyfish 
stings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chew, during a one-week period in 1993, water temperatures in San 
Clemente averaged 69.5 degrees. This year, Chew said that for the same week's 
period, Aug. 15 to 21, the water averaged 74.9. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That's almost five degrees warmer than last year and the 80-degree 
temperature was about the warmest anyone can ever remember it being down here," 
said Chew, who has been a lifeguard for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mullin, professor of biological oceanography at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography in La Jolla, said a research vessel that recently spent two weeks 
at sea found that the region's water temperatures were cooler, not warmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implication is that although near-shore waters are warmer," Mullin said, 
"the offshore region is cooler than the long-term average. . . . It's a coastal 
rather than a California current-wide phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 The California current runs north to south and skirts near shore at Point 
Conception then travels west of the Channel Islands near Oxnard in a band 100 
miles wide, Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A real indicator of warm water coming up from the south are crabs, red crabs 
about the size of your thumb," Mullin said. "You would see them wash up on the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Obvious indicators for lifeguards have been huge crowds of people at the beach 
escaping Southern California's sweltering weather, and higher incidents of 
swimmers being stung from jellyfish and stingrays. 
</P>
<P>
 During a one-week study, Don Ito, state park superintendent in Huntington 
Beach, said they had to close Bolsa Chica State Beach on a warm weekend, 
something the state parks system had not done in recent times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a 40% increase in the number of people using our beach from the same 
one-week period in 1993," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for stingrays, which prefer warm, placid water, Seal Beach and Huntington 
State Beach have reported more contacts with the bottom dwellers, according to 
Thomas W. Barnett, San Clemente State Beach lifeguard supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also has noticed more jellyfish, which visit during spells of 
warmer water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get maybe 72 degrees around here and that's about as high we get," Barnett 
said. "And we're getting temps in the high 70s. I've never heard of it being 
that high around here." Warming Trend 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean temperatures along the Orange County coast have been unusually high. San 
Clemente's recorded 80 degrees is the warmest in two decades. A comparison of 
high and average water temperatures during the first weeks of August in 1993 
and 1994. 05,18,07,09,07,09 *2*August, 1993 *2*August, 1994 Beach High Average
