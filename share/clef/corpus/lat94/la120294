From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drummer Connie Kay, who joined the Modern Jazz Quartet in 1955 as Kenny 
Clarke's replacement, has died at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
 He died in his sleep Wednesday night, a family spokesman said.Kay had a stroke 
in 1992 but had recovered enough to work.  
</P>
<P>
 Kay performed with the quartet during a "floating jazz festival" in the 
Caribbean in October. 
</P>
<P>
 He played triangle, chimes, timpani and finger cymbals in addition to standard 
drums. John Lewis used Kay's mastery of those instruments in his composing for 
the MJQ, and other drummers in the 1950s were inspired to enlarge their drum 
kits.

 Conrad Henry Kirnon was born April 27, 1927, in Tuckahoe, N.Y. He studied 
piano with his mother and taught himself to play drums. Among his first 
engagements were appearances in 1944 and 1945 with Miles Davis in Harlem. After 
touring the South, he joined Lester Young's group in 1949. He sometimes played 
in small groups led by Stan Getz, Coleman Hawkins and Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 He also performed and recorded with Chet Baker, Cannonball Adderley, Jimmy 
Heath, Paul Desmond, Tommy Flanagan and Benny Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay played on several early Van Morrison albums. According to The Penguin 
Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Kay's "delicacy and precision . . . confirmed 
him as a first-class all-arounder."

century. Stander began his career on stage and as a youth appeared in several 
Broadway plays.In the 1930s, he moved into screwball comedy films. He appeared

OLD FRIENDS NOT NICE TO CLIPPERS; PRO BASKETBALL: JACKSON HELPS BROWN'S PACERS 
EXTEND L.A. LOSING STREAK TO 14 GAMES, 93-84. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Brown and Mark Jackson got out just in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown fled to Indiana after guiding the Clippers to back-to-back playoff 
berths in 1992-93 and Jackson, who spent two seasons in L.A., was traded to 
Indiana after he complained that the Clippers weren't committed to winning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers? They extended their season-opening losing streak to 14 games, 
falling to the Pacers, 93-84, Thursday night before an announced 6,685 at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who shot a season-low 36% (26 of 72), are three losses away from 
matching the worst start in NBA history, set when the expansion Miami Heat lost 
its first 17 games in 1988. Several fans behind the basket wore red bags on 
their heads, indicating that they couldn't stand to watch the Clippers, who 
have lost 18 games dating to last season, one shy of the longest streak in team 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you what, we played pretty good offense the first quarter against 
Indiana's porous defense," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said. "But they picked it 
up another level and they came out and played the kind of defense that has made 
them the team they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost our poise. What little space we seemed to have was between our ears, 
and they took us out of our game with their defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown isn't surprised that the Clippers have deteriorated after losing Danny 
Manning, Dominique Wilkins, Ron Harper, Charles Smith, Ken Norman and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lose the talent they've lost and have an injury to Stanley 
(Roberts), it's going to be tough," Brown said. "If you lose your best players 
and get nothing for them, I don't care who you are, you're going to fall. Look 
at Dallas. They were at a higher level than the Clippers ever were and look at 
where they fell. . . . It can happen to anyone. But if you get one player in 
the draft, then everything can change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to stay. Whatever went on, I might have had some problems, but I 
still wanted to stay here. I don't think I would have wanted to stay if 
everything was so bad. I thought they could have been corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers traded Jackson to the Pacers for point guard Pooh Richardson, 
swingman Malik Sealy and the rights to rookie Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be out," Jackson said. "You can believe that if you believe 
nothing else. It's going to be a long year. I could care less if they win one 
game or 40 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to talk about the Clippers or the organization. I'm not Ron 
Harper or Dominique Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows about the organization and the problems it has and the moves 
that it's made. That's pretty obvious. But the bottom line is having 12 guys 
who have a commitment to winning and doing whatever it takes. And we never had 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed, 69-64, going into the fourth quarter despite 
shooting 20% in the third quarter, were outscored, 10-2, in the first three 
minutes of the fourth quarter as Indiana took a 79-66 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who averaged 8.3 assists in his first 12 games with the Pacers, had 
10 assists and three points in his first game against his former team and is on 
a pace that would set a team single-season assist record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an adjustment for him, but he's going to be terrific," Brown said of 
Jackson. "I think he's a terrific player and a great guy and a great leader. He 
wants to win and he wants to help guys get better. But I don't think I'm the 
only coach that feels that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who missed 13 of 19 shots, had 17 points, four assists, three 
steals and four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller had 24 points, making seven of 12 shots, including five 
three-pointers, and forward Dale Davis had 16 points and a season-high 14 
rebounds as Indiana ended a two-game losing streak. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper guard Terry Dehere, who dislocated his right pinky when he collided 
with Mark Jackson at the end of the second quarter, will be examined by Dr. 
Tony Daly today. Dehere, who sat out the final 15 minutes of the game, missed 
eight of 10 shots, including all four shots in the second half. . . . Former 
Clipper John Williams, who was waived by the club last summer because of a 
chronic weight problem, has lost 50 pounds since signing with the Pacers. "He's 
gone from 340 to 290," Coach Larry Brown said. "He still has a ways to go, but 
he's a lot closer than he was this summer."

COMMENTARY; NOTRE DAME GETS ITS WAY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of one of its most glorious seasons, college football again is the 
burlesque of major sports. There is something known as the Bowl Coalition and 
it was supposed to clean up the way bowl bids were handed out and back-room 
deals between bowls and schools were made. It also was supposed to reward the 
most deserving teams, maybe even settle a national championship on the field 
once in a while. It does none of that in its last year, before it gives way to 
next year's miracle cure for college football, known as the Bowl Alliance. The 
coalition is a failure, run by greedy bums. Sometimes they look like the 
overflow from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 As we approach another college football postseason that could be a waste of 
time, with sportswriters and coaches settling the national championship instead 
of Nebraska settling it against Penn State, it is reassuring that the tradition 
of greed holds. It is why a mediocre team such as Notre Dame gets a spot in the 
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2 when it does not deserve to be anywhere near a major bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Notre Dame can do in any poll with its 6-4-1 record is No.26. Notre 
Dame really is lucky to be ranked that high. It does not stop it from going to 
the Fiesta Bowl and making $3.2 million to play Colorado. A few weeks ago, 
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz said he would be embarrassed to go to a bowl game 
with his team's record. Then the Fiesta Bowl waved all that money at him. You 
wave money at Notre Dame, it will offer to turn the fight song into rap. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame is college football's version of the 51st state. The Fighting Irish 
even have state-run television, NBC Sports in this case. NBC Sports televises 
Notre Dame home games. It also gets ready to televise the Fiesta Bowl for the 
last time. Next year, the game moves to CBS, so there is absolutely no love 
lost between NBC and the Fiesta Bowl, even if selecting Notre Dame looks like a 
cheap ratings grab. The bums from the Fiesta Bowl made the call here, but NBC 
never complains when it ends up in another sweaty embrace with the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame makes a big score on its name, not on merit. This is a season when 
Holtz disgraced himself by running up the score against Navy, when his team's 
most impressive victory might have come against that powerhouse from Air Force. 
Even at the end, the best Notre Dame could do against a USC team it had beaten 
11 straight times was a tie. Now Holtz says his team was a few good kicks away 
from being 10-1. He sounds like the beery fan at the end of the bar with the 
leprechaun on his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deserve to go (to the Fiesta) off our play for the last four games," Holtz 
says in the newspapers and on television. 
</P>
<P>
 All the other teams have to prove themselves over the season. The rules are 
different for Notre Dame teams, even those punched out by half its opponents. 
All the Irish have to do now is show signs of life at the finish. And here is 
what passes for a real big finish now in South Bend: wins over Navy and Air 
Force, a loss to Florida State, a tie against USC. Earlier in the season, 
Boston College pushed Notre Dame around the way it would push around a 
high-school team. "Manhandled" is the word Holtz himself used. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College goes to the Aloha Bowl Christmas Day. Its opponent is Kansas 
State, which is one of the great stories of college football this season, a 
nowhere program that can now play with anybody. Kansas State's only losses were 
to Nebraska (17-6) and Colorado (35-21), two of the best teams in the country. 
KSU was down one point to Nebraska with 11 minutes to go and was 21-21 in the 
fourth quarter with Colorado before blowing a terrific chance at the goal line 
to take the lead. Coach Bill Snyder's players ended up with a record of 9-2 
anyway, and are currently ranked No.8 in the coaches' poll. They are so much 
more deserving of a major bowl than Notre Dame it is a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Notre Dame decided to go to the Fiesta Bowl, it set off a chain reaction 
that knocked Kansas State out of either the Cotton Bowl or the Sun Bowl. So 
Kansas State gets $750,000 to play in the Aloha Bowl. But the Aloha doesn't pay 
expenses, which means the school might lose money by the time it flies 
everybody to Hawaii. It sure doesn't get $3 million from the Cotton Bowl, and 
that is a shame because this is a wonderful program all of a sudden under 
Snyder. But it is not a television program, the way Notre Dame is. It is not 
close to being the kind of draw Notre Dame is, because no one really is. Kansas 
State goes to the Aloha Bowl and, by the time the showcase games are played on 
Jan. 2, Snyder's players will have gone home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a product of a system that doesn't seem to work very well," Snyder said 
from his office in Manhattan, Kan. "I'm angry about the treatment we've gotten, 
my players are angry, our fans are angry. But our problem is a problem you run 
into a lot at this time of year: You don't know where to vent your anger. There 
isn't an individual or an institution who really seems to be in charge. You 
just hold it in."

MIKE DOWNEY: OF WILD THINGS, INCLUDING DUCKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Downey's California: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What happened to Mitch Williams only confirms the religious belief that you 
can be a stiff one day and an Angel the next. 
</P>
<P>
 -- By giving chances to Bo Jackson, Jim Abbott and Wild Thing Williams, the 
Angels have proven to be equal-opportunity employers. They have hired a man 
with a plastic hip, a man with one hand and a man with a screw loose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Williams will be played next season by Charlie Sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He still throws the same assortment of pitches -- fastball, curve, screw 
and gopher. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Carter, still in the American League last time I looked, is wearing a 
big, big, BIG smile somewhere today. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I hear scalpers are getting from 50 up in the neighborhood of 75 cents for 
those Clipper-Timberwolf tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minnesota and the Clippers could be responsible for the NBA's new ad 
campaign: "I hate this game!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- I would pick Saturday's game to be won by whichever team scores last, but 
that could mean waiting until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can't wait for Saturday's Wooden Classic college basketball thing. By the 
way, I'm very nervous about Fox television's proposed World College Basketball 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Kansas -- they all think they're so hot. Ha! 
I doubt if even three of them could beat the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They aren't the Final Four, but they sure are a Fine Four, ain't they? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I told a Tulsa player that UCLA has been called the No. 1 team in the 
country. He said nobody in Tulsa knows where UCLA is. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Newt Gingrich is sure Arkansas will be unseated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Now let me get this straight. The USC Trojans did not defeat UCLA, Notre 
Dame or either Rose Bowl team . . . and still got invited to one of the major 
bowl games? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I hear NBC reported the USC game as a 17-17 Notre Dame victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sports Illustrated editors have chosen Arizona to be the top college 
football team and UCLA to be the top college basketball team. Maybe Sports 
Illustrated should stick to illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Washington Bullets are reportedly trying to work out a deal with the 
Golden State Warriors in which they give Chris Webber back and get Don Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I always thought Bozo the Clown wore the funniest costume in America until 
I saw a Cleveland Cavalier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You've heard of Mr. Blackwell's 10 Worst-Dressed list? As soon as he sees 
the Cavaliers, he'll have to expand it to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Stockton of the Utah Jazz also looks really weird. Get this: His 
shorts stop above the knee!  
</P>
<P>
 -- Oh, now I get it: Reggie Miller has a big night against a team from New 
York, so now he's famous. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Someone also might whisper to David Letterman that in 48 of the 50 states, 
we don't think the New York Jets or Giants are all that funny. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I watched pro football last weekend and actually saw a play -- I'm serious 
now -- on which an official didn't call a penalty. No, really. Some guy ran 
with the football and nobody called anything! The play actually counted! 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL is buzzing with gossip that the commish, Paul Tagliabue, is trying 
hard to get the Rams to stay because he is utterly convinced that it's the 
Raiders who are going to split. I am therefore organizing my own Save the 
Raiders organization. Join now or I'll beat the hell out of you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I'm sending some Ram and Raider jokes to Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tommy Lee Jones is being considered for the "Cobb" sequel, "Rose." 
</P>
<P>
 -- I am not going to any more baseball movies until the theater owners agree 
on a $7 ticket cap. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At my automated teller machine, there are three buttons to press: 
WITHDRAWAL, DEPOSIT and LOANS TO L.A. KINGS. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Personal to a Mr. Murray, Los Angeles, Calif. 90053: Put your money where 
your typewriter is, pal. Ten bucks says Oregon absolutely destroys Penn State.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels have prepared a two-year contract offer for free-agent relief 
pitcher Lee Smith and hope to sign him within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very possible we could come to an agreement soon," Brian David, Smith's 
agent, said Thursday."We've been moving in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, originally considered longshots in the bidding for Smith's 
services, are said to be willing to offer Smith a two-year guaranteed contract 
that would pay a base salary of about $2 million a year, plus incentives and 
award bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith earned a major league-leading 33 saves for the Baltimore Orioles last 
season and was on pace for his fourth consecutive 40-plus save season until the 
strike was called Aug. 12. Smith, 37, is baseball's all-time save leader and 
has posted at least 29 saves in 11 of the last 12 seasons. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Rick Neuheisel was in Elk Grove, Calif. -- between Stockton and Sacramento -- 
last Monday, recruiting football players for the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had his mind on more important matters. He was a candidate to become 
the head coach and he told Rick Schwartz of XTRA radio that he called Colorado 
to see if he had gotten the job. 
</P>
<P>
 He was told to sit tight in the office of the Elk Grove High football coach. 
Later, he got the call telling him that he was the new coach, succeeding Bill 
McCartney, who had resigned on Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The last name of the Elk Grove coach? Lombardi. Neuheisel hopes it's an omen.

 "I always ran. I always liked the idea of running. You grow up in the ghetto,

another victory fly away Sunday when the (Philadelphia) Eagles' big bird,

 Peking Open?It's believed that the game of golf originated in Scotland almost 
1,000 years ago. However, Ling Hongling, a Chinese professor, says the modern 
game of golf originated in China during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), refined 
out of an ancient game involving hitting a ball with a club, the official 
People's Daily newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarities are that the ancient game was played on wide-open grassy 
areas, competitors used a stick with a bent head, and their aim was to hit a 
ball into a small hole in the ground.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: LITTLE DISH COULD FORCE CABLE INTO UNCONVENTIONAL 
CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cable television convention being held in Anaheim this week has been called 
the Western Cable Show for 27 years. But as convention chairman Robert McRann 
noted, that's a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention, which drew a record 18,000 attendees from 30 countries, is 
more like "an international telecommunications show," McRann said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hot topics has been something most cable operators would probably 
just as soon not hear about -- the new 18-inch DirecTV-RCA satellite dish that 
hit Los Angeles outlets in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is competition for cable. Slipshod companies will have to get 
their acts together and upgrade their systems or face a mass exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 There is now a relatively inexpensive alternative to cable. 
</P>
<P>
 For $700 plus $200 or so for installation -- more for a deluxe model and/or a 
second receiver -- you can get a DirecTV-RCA compact dish system, and a whole 
new 150-channel world of television opens. 
</P>
<P>
 A big plus is that the small dish can be mounted out of sight on your roof or 
behind a bush in your back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 And the system is incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first to use digital compression, so the picture is clearer than 
what you get on cable. And the sound is better, too. 
</P>
<P>
 For another $149, you can get the NFL Sunday Ticket for the rest of this 
season and all of next season. Every game is available except blacked out Ram 
or Raider home games. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the NBA announced a satellite-dish package of more than 400 games. 
It, too, sells for $149 and is available to DirecTV subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 DirecTV also offers eight Prime regional sports networks, among them Prime 
Ticket, for $7.95 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Program suppliers really don't care how viewers get their programs, as long as 
they get them. They do business with cable operators and they do business with 
dish distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Frazier is the president of Liberty Sports, the sports arm of 
Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) that now owns Prime Ticket, and his company is 
one of the major suppliers of sports programming in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "DirecTV is the first out of the box, and that counts for a lot," he said. 
"But cable technology will be upgraded and in two or three years it will 
leapfrog over the current satellite-dish technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where DirecTV now offers 150 channels, cable in the future will offer 500." 
</P>
<P>
 Counters DirecTV spokesman Tom Bracken: "We will be upgrading our system, 
right along with everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrival of the 18-inch dish, will the old C-Band eight-foot or 
10-foot dish systems become dinosaurs? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier and Glenn Gurgiolo, the president of Liberty Satellite Sports, the 
nation's largest supplier of satellite dish programming, say interest in the 
DirecTV system has kindled interest in all satellite-dish technology. 
</P>
<P>
 DirecTV and RCA launched in five small test markets in June. Now RCA is 
manufacturing 100,000 of the 18-inch dishes a month and can't keep up with 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 PrimeStar, which provides the hardware as part of a $38.95 basic subscription 
price, is doing business at about 30,000 units a month. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gurgiolo said the old C-Band systems are selling at double what was 
anticipated, averaging about 60,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Said DirecTV's Bracken: "We knew our push would create awareness in satellite 
dish technology and help everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Why would people still want the old cumbersome C-Band units? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because of what they offer," Frazier said. "You get 500 channels and 
news feeds and all kinds of things from all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gurgiolo: "A lot of people like to peek in and watch raw feeds. You never 
know what you'll find." TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Two new sports channels that were drawing attention at the cable convention 
were the Golf Channel and the Classic Sports Network. All systems are go for 
the 24-hour Golf Channel to launch on Jan. 17, says Joe Gibbs, the 
Orlando-based channel's president and its co-founder with Arnold Palmer. No, 
Gibbs is not the former Washington Redskin coach. He is a cable mogul from 
Alabama who has raised $80 million to start the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golf Channel will offer two tournaments a week, a domestic tournament from 
the PGA, Senior PGA, Nike or LPGA tours, and a European tournament. The rest of 
the time will be filled with instructional programming, news and information 
programming, talk shows and such, and much of that programming will be 
repeated. The suggested subscription price is $6.95 a month. The channel will 
be available in about 30 million cable homes and also in DirecTV homes. There 
are now about 200,000 DirecTV homes, and that number is growing at a rate of 
about 3,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Classic Sports Network, which had one of the largest and most elaborate 
booths on the Convention Center floor, is scheduled to launch March 24. Running 
it are Steve Greenberg, a former deputy commissioner of baseball and a former 
law partner of Alan Rothenberg, and Brian Bedol, former senior vice president 
of Time-Warner Enterprises. They have compiled a library of classic events and 
shows that should make this channel a big hit with sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN's "GameDay" Sunday will have a powerful interview Jim Rome did with 
Stanley Wilson, the former Cincinnati Bengal, Oklahoma and Banning High star 
who was suspended by the NFL for getting zonked out on cocaine the night before 
the 1989 Super Bowl. Wilson hasn't done an interview since Penthouse paid him 
$200,000 for one in 1990. Rome landed the interview because of the persistence 
of producer Mark Shapiro, who tracked down Wilson at a medium-security prison 
in Bakersfield in early November. Wilson was there finishing a three-year 
sentence for burglary. Rome taped the interview with Wilson two weeks ago. 
"He's really a sweet guy," Rome said. "We're pulling for him." The interview 
will also be shown on Sunday night's "SportsCenter." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's John Wooden Classic will be on NBC, with Tom Hammond, Steve Jones, 
Matt Guokas and sideline reporter Paul Sunderland working the doubleheader that 
begins at 10 a.m. Radio coverage of both games will be on XTRA. Randy 
Rosenbloom, Warren Williamson and host Geoff Nathanson will announce the 
Massachusetts-Kansas game. Regular UCLA announcers Chris Roberts and Marques 
Johnson will work the UCLA-Kentucky game. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 9 will carry three companion fights to Saturday night's Riddick 
Bowe-Larry Donald HBO fight at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The Channel 9 card 
will follow the main event. HBO's coverage begins at 6:30 p.m. . . . ESPN will 
carry a college football awards show Thursday at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Because XTRA's transmitter is in Tijuana, the station has a Mexican 
broadcasting license. So the station had to interrupt the Loose Cannons on 
Thursday morning to carry a Mexican national broadcast of a news conference 
held by new President Ernesto Zedillo. . . . For the record: The Jim Healy 
tribute, repeated on KMPC last Saturday, first ran on Aug. 24. Healy died of 
liver cancer on July 22. . . . KMPC is still selling cassettes of the Healy 
tribute for $12, with proceeds going to the American Cancer Society. More than 
1,500 tapes have been sold. Details: (310) 840-4943. . . . Brian Golden, KMPC 
part-time sports talk-show host, will do the play-by-play for the KBET radio 
broadcast of Saturday night's Quartz Hill-Hart high school playoff football 
game.

<P>
 The Raiders have been outscored in the fourth quarter this season, 98-49, and 
39-13 in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategy doesn't change from the first quarter to the fourth quarter," 
cornerback Albert Lewis said."I believe in the fourth quarter we have had too 
many mental letdowns that just cost us some big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he wouldn't name names, Lewis indicated that it shouldn't be assumed 
that some of the team's older players were automatically mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maturity, you can't measure that in number of years," said Lewis, a 12-year 
veteran who had spent his entire career with the Chiefs before joining the 
Raiders this season. "It has more to do with attitude and what you've learned. 
There are a lot of guys who have played 10 years in the league and don't know 
any more than they did when they were rookies."

BERLUSCONI SOFTENS ITALIAN AUSTERITY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi backed away from the brink Thursday, 
tempering economic austerity with billion-dollar concessions and persuading 
labor unions to scrap a nationwide general strike scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement reached in a marathon 21-hour negotiating session with the three 
main unions gives breathing space to the beleaguered Berlusconi, whose 
right-wing coalition government now looks safe in the short term after a 
precarious week. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord, reached in a marathon 21-hour negotiating session with the three 
main unions, followed a decision by Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement and its 
coalition partners to stay together at least through the end of the year. 
Berlusconi has also lowered political temperatures with conciliatory gestures 
to Milan magistrates investigating him for alleged bribes to tax police by his 
$7-billion-a-year business and media empire, Fininvest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't dream of resigning," he told a news conference Thursday, saying he 
will go to Milan to meet the judges but is setting no date. "I have sworn my 
innocence because I am convinced of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders, who had mounted a general strike and a million-strong rally in 
Rome against Berlusconi in recent weeks, expressed satisfaction with the 
compromise reached Thursday over the controversial 1995 government budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to reduce Italy's sapping public deficit by $30 billion, the 
58-year-old billionaire had proposed sharp cuts in Italy's generous pension 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's agreement softened the blows, restoring full benefits to salaried 
workers who have completed 35 years of service, increasing social security for 
large and poor families and boosting aid to the lesser-developed Italian south. 
</P>
<P>
 With labor unions now on board, left-wing parties will likely mute their 
opposition to the budget, which has passed the lower house of Parliament, but 
appeared to be in trouble in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Berlusconi's aides said, budget will go to the Senate for ratification 
Dec. 12, with good prospects of approval because of a constitutional Dec. 31 
deadline.

SHAKUR FOUND GUILTY OF SEX ABUSE CHARGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rap star Tupac Shakur was found guilty Thursday of sexually abusing a woman he 
had invited to his hotel room, but he was acquitted of more serious sodomy and 
weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur, 23, who was shot five times during a robbery Wednesday, was not in the 
courtroom when the verdict was read.He had appeared earlier Thursday in a 
wheelchair, but his lawyer said he had returned to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, which reached its decision on the third day of deliberations, found 
the same verdict for a co-defendant, Charles Fuller, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ecstatic," said Shakur's lawyer, Michael Warren. He said he was pleased 
that the jury "kept an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Each man was convicted of three counts of first-degree sex abuse, which means 
they groped and touched the victim without her consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Each faces a maximum sentence of seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Daniel Fitzgerald told attorneys in the case to return to court Monday, 
presumably to arrange a sentencing date.

STUDY FINDS LINK BETWEEN SMOKING, IMPOTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smokers are 50% more likely to suffer from impotence than nonsmokers, the 
government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the rate 
may be even higher, because their study was based on men willing to acknowledge 
the sexual disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more bad news for smokers," said Dr. David Mannino of the CDC's National 
Center for Environmental Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers estimate that up to 10 million U.S. men are impotent and that half 
of those cases are caused by such factors as diet, diabetes, aging, alcohol and 
medication. Smoking had long been suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was based on a survey of 4,462 Army Vietnam War veterans between the 
ages of 31 and 49 in 1985-86. Of that number, 1,162 said they never smoked; 
1,292 said they were former smokers; and 2,008 said they smoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Among nonsmokers, 2.2% said they suffered persistent impotence, compared to 2% 
of former smokers and 3.7% of current smokers. Researchers said the difference 
in the rate of impotence reported by nonsmokers and former smokers was 
statistically insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be a 68% difference in the rate of impotence reported by smokers 
and nonsmokers except that Mannino said the risk dropped to 50% when other 
factors such as drug abuse, race, age and vascular disease were taken into 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, published in the December issue of the American Journal of 
Epidemiology, is the first to show that smoking alone is a risk factor for 
impotence, said Dr. Robert J. Krane, head of Boston University Medical Center's 
urology department. 
</P>
<P>
 Krane was among a group of researchers trying to examine a possible link 
between smoking and impotence in men over age 50. Most cases of impotence occur 
among older men.

 Former Vice President Dan Quayle's health continues to improve after treatment 
for a blood clot in one lung and he will be released from the hospital Monday, 
his doctors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things look good," said Pam Perry, spokeswoman for the Indiana University 
Medical Center. "His doctors said they did a lung scan and things looked much 
improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle entered the hospital Monday night and is being treated with a blood 
thinner. Perry said Quayle is spending about half of each day out of bed and 
"he's progressing extremely well."

LOTTERY WINNERS SPLIT $100 MILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
 That's a $50-million haircut on Gary Allen's head. Allen bought $5 worth of 
Powerball lottery tickets on his way to a haircut Wednesday morning in 
Anderson, Ind., just north of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, he matched all six numbers drawn to win half the game's 
$100-million jackpot. The other winning ticket was sold in North Platte, Neb., 
but that winner hasn't come forward yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The jackpot was the game's second highest, eclipsed only by the $111 million 
won by a Wisconsin teacher in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, 38, went to Hoosier Lottery headquarters in Indianapolis on Thursday to 
claim his first installment of $1.8 million, after taxes. The Alexandria, Ind., 
man said the ticket was a "quick pick," in which a computer generates the 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen and his wife, Debra, who accompanied him to pick up the first check, 
said they planned to pay off bills and help family members. After that, they 
may travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Powerball game are sold in Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Rhode 
Island, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

 Mr. Sandman: The insults were flying at the Southern California Sports

jokes, emcee Jim Gillis introduced Dr. Joe Riggio, an anesthesiologist who was 
attending as a guest.

 Pulpit Fiction: Just when you thought every crime novel genre had been taken 
-- there are detective stories featuring everyone from rabbis and cats to gay 
insurance adjusters -- along comes Wally Davis with another. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' "Suspended Animation" has no graphic violence or sex. And the strongest 
expletive used is "jerk." It's a Christian murder mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that people who go into a Christian bookstore will know my book 
doesn't contain gratuitous violence or explicit sexual scenes," said Davis, a 
detective with the La Palma Police Department in Orange County. "It's possible 
to tell a good story without that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 His protagonist is ex-cop Gil Beckman, a security guard for a Southland 
amusement park who discovers the body of a murdered employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel contains several references to religion, but they are often leavened 
with humor. Discussing one Christian colleague, for instance, Beckman says: "He 
ate a lot of chocolate bars. Food abuse is common in Christian circles. It's an 
acceptable sin. Overeating is the only thing they can do without guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 What the heck.

 Drop that pitchfork!But enough about God. Let's move on to the Devil, who was,

Santa Monica Freeway, after allegedly shaking a 6-foot-long pitchfork at 
passing cars.

<P>
 "He had horns and a tail," reported Santa Monica Police Sgt. Gary Gallinot. 
"And he was wearing a red wet suit that made it appear he was naked -- with 
pubic hair and chest nipples showing, and a penis in the appropriate place." 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway Lucifer identified himself as a UCLA graduate student who was 
performing in a film project called "The Devil Tour '94." 
</P>
<P>
 He was cited for walking on the freeway and filming without a permit, as were 
a cameraman and a crew driver, who were dressed as humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon leaving the station, the dehorned star refused comment, telling one 
reporter: "The devil's not talking."

Avenue in Hollywood that claims it can make the freeway commute less hellish.

FM-2030 ON GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Why Worry About Government? We're on Automatic Fast Forward," Commentary, 
Nov. 25: 
</P>
<P>
 FM-2030 (what a droll name, sounds like an e-mail nickname) raises important 
ideas on "traditional values" that need rethinking as we approach the 21st 
Century. Among them are traditional values about work and the work ethic. 
Business is downsizing and automating, government is looking to trim or 
dismantle programs, leading to even fewer jobs. High-paid employees receive 
"golden handshakes" or are simply fired to be replaced by lower-paid or 
part-time employees without fringe benefits. Increasingly, full-time workers 
earn poverty-level or lower wages. Yet we continue to celebrate the "work 
ethic" and propose to reduce or eliminate welfare, food stamps, infant 
nutrition programs, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we even think creatively of FM-2030's thesis that a postindustrial 
society will have sufficient prosperity so that people can "work less and coast 
more" when the current reality is that many people must work two or three jobs 
to meet basic needs and many people are in low-paying jobs that may be 
eliminated as we "advance" toward his ideal. Or, does he imply that an 
underclass, perhaps a very large one, is an inevitable part of society where 
the government is largely irrelevant? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's comforting to know that there won't be any shortage of precious irony in 
the future, if "visionaries" like FM-2030 continue to proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
 The main problem with his "Mr. Spock Goes to Washington" thesis is the one 
thing that ruins every social engineer's paradigms: good old human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, in 2030 a kiss will still be a kiss, a sigh will just be a sigh, and guys 
are still going to fly into a jealous rage if they catch their significant 
other "encouraging new lifestyles to ensure intimacy and continuity in our new 
environments." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, most Americans are going to be busy preparing the right hemispheres 
of their brains for all the empowering leisure time those hard-working machines 
are going to create. After all, scanning back and forth through 5,000 cable 
channels of junk, instead of just 50, is much more mentally fatiguing than you 
might think. I'm sure my grandsons will take the aesthetic high road -- 
holographically projecting reruns of "Charlie's Angels" right into their 
bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 As for some new decentralized federal government which will rarely intrude in 
our lives and be virtually powerless to "decelerate the profound recontextings" 
of American life, don't count on it. 
</P>
<P>
 There's about as much chance of that happening as there is of living in a 
post-futurist/consultant world!

GOV. WILSON AND 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson ought to redirect all of his energies from Proposition 187 to 
bolstering the economy of all Californians. He could start mending his fences 
by reaching out to those countries south of the border, from Mexico to Tierra 
del Fuego, encouraging trade both ways in anticipation of NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing we strongly believe Wilson ought to remember is that this country 
has been blessed because it has always been helpful to the helpless; he should 
not push to have these blessings removed from the U.S.

 Once again, we voters have permitted ourselves to be bamboozled into allowing 
the candidates to determine the ground on which they run. The most telling case 
for me was the race for governor. Wilson could never have been reelected if had 
run on his record, so he ran instead on the fears and prejudices inherent in 
Proposition 187 and won without raising a sweat. What a bunch of saps we are 
for letting him get away with it!

 Your Column One article on Kathleen Brown's "doomed campaign" (Nov. 14) may

myth perpetuated in your own news columns). 
</P>
<P>
 Give the governor credit for a lot: campaigning mostly on issues, eschewing 
mostly the gross personal attacks of his party-mate from Santa Barbara, picking 
popular positions to publicize (anti-CLAS, anti-gun meltdown, pro 187) -- i.e., 
practicing the art of the professional politician, an honorable occupation 
notwithstanding this year's rhetoric to the contrary. But "spectacular 
comeback"? Only until the campaign started.

TEACHING HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter is in reference to Ruth Rosen's Column Left, "The War to Control 
the Past" (Nov. 24). In it she defends the new standards for teaching U.S. 
history and criticizes the political right for their negative attitude toward 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 I have taught U.S. history on both the senior and middle school level for over 
20 years, my politics have always been and still are significantly left of 
center and I think the new standards are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 History is not about making people feel good. History is a search for truth. 
The truth of U.S. history is that it is a story dominated by white males of 
European background. 
</P>
<P>
 These males have used their power position for great good and much evil, but 
the power has been theirs. To tell the story any other way is to sacrifice 
truth in the name of making the various minorities feel better. This is not 
only bad history, it doesn't work. We don't gain self-respect by lying about 
our past or our present. 
</P>

<P>
 Rosen exposes the latest raw nerve in the struggle for cultural control in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the call of Rush Limbaugh and his dittoheads simply to teach "what 
happened," there is a great deal more to any study of history. Those of us in 
the classrooms understand implicitly that there is no monolithic interpretation 
of the past, while truth is often open to subjective investigation and healthy 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in the current debate is the longstanding abdication of conservatives 
from the trenches of public education. They have traditionally confined 
themselves to dogmatic pronouncements from the bully pulpit of the media or 
imposed their views "from the top down" by getting elected to local school 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the political right deigns to join the ranks of hard-working teachers, 
their influence in the educational arena will only be marginal and 
unsatisfying.

"second-class citizens" -- Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Philippines, 
Turkey -- can have women heads of state (including Muslim states) but not 
"developed" America, where women are liberated and equal? 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that it is time for us to rethink and revise our ideas and 
judgments about other peoples and cultures?

ON THIS ONE, DOLE IS PRECISELY ON TARGET; GOP LEADER CALLS FOR 'LIFT AND 
STRIKE' POLICY IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can there be a military solution in Bosnia? Of course there can be, and indeed 
there will be. The only question is: Whose military solution? It seems 
President Clinton's military solution consists of Serb military victory, 
followed by the annexation to Serbia of all or most of the Bosnian territory 
that Serbian rebels now hold. Clinton's unspoken hope, matching the hope of the 
British and French architects of this military solution, apparently is that the 
Serbs will be appeased by this much of a surrender and will not attempt to 
conquer or annex the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serb-held parts of Croatia 
or the independent post-Yugoslav state of Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dole, soon to be the Senate majority leader, advocates another kind of 
military solution -- the "lift and strike" policy that until now, however 
unvigorously, has been Clinton's own; it would lift the arms embargo against 
the Bosnians and direct NATO to strike the Serb aggressor from the air. The 
"strike" half was partly enacted when NATO committed itself to guarantee 
several Bosnian "safe areas."NATO chose to subordinate its command structure to 
that of the United Nations, however, and when the cooperation collapsed in the 
face of a joint Serb assault on the Bihac "safe area," Dole did not hesitate to 
use the word failure . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas Republican's solution, like Clinton's, is only military at the 
start. Both aim in the end for a negotiated peace. Our support for Dole's 
approach -- Clinton's earlier approach -- rests on our belief that it would 
reach the negotiation stage quicker. "We're not trying to fracture the NATO 
alliance," Dole said in London on Wednesday, "we're just suggesting we try 
something else." The evident British-French determination to preserve Serb 
military superiority and seek peace by negotiations unbacked by the threat of 
military engagement in any form has led to a progressive widening of the war. 
On Thursday fighting broke out again in Croatia, which had abstained from 
fighting in the hope that the major powers could force the Serbs into at least 
a partial retreat. The Croats are now virtually certain to attempt to recapture 
territory seized more than two years ago by the Serbian army with the help of 
Croatian Serbs. As the extent of likely Western capitulation to the Serbs 
became evident, Croatia -- still ill-prepared for war -- is concluding that it 
cannot wait any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Clinton's nor Dole's option can be called good. Neither promises peace 
without further war. But the less bad option, Dole's, is to recognize that 
appeasing the aggressor will only lead to endless aggression. With "lift and 
strike," an end is eventually in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole is not without support both at home and abroad. Thursday the Action 
Council on Peace in the Balkans -- whose members include such major foreign 
policy voices as former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, former national 
security advisers Zbigniew Brzezinski and Richard Allen and former U.N. 
Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick -- called for creation of a U.S.-led coalition 
of NATO and non-NATO nations if NATO itself cannot be persuaded to perform the 
"strike" half of "lift and strike." NATO members mentioned by a council 
spokesman included Turkey, Denmark and the Netherlands. Once the first steps 
were taken, Italy might lend the use of the Aviano NATO base, and Germany, 
which dares not lead, might be willing to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who want this war over at virtually any price. Dole is not 
among them, and in this case he is right.

FEAR OF GUNS TIPS THE SCALE; IN ORANGE COUNTY 66% BACK TOUGHER FIREARM LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County long has been nationally known for its libertarian sentiment 
that the best government is the smallest and least intrusive. Nearly half the 
registered voters call themselves conservatives, and a quarter see themselves 
as moderates.But now a survey has found that worry about crime in the county is 
so widespread that two in three residents favor tougher gun control laws -- 
laws that traditionally have been championed by liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding stunned both poll-takers and the county's law enforcement 
community. But it reflects recognition of a harsh reality of life across the 
nation: There are too many guns on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the overall crime rate in Orange County has not increased much in 
recent years -- last year it actually declined slightly -- gang killings have 
soared, as have crimes of appalling violence. In too many cases guns have been 
the weapons of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates said the high support for tougher gun control 
laws was shocking in a conservative county but accurately reflected the 
public's fear of crime. The Orange County Annual Survey, conducted by UC Irvine 
researchers, found crime was the biggest concern of county residents, as it was 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said the percentage favoring stricter gun control laws, 66%, 
was higher than the figure in a nationwide poll five years ago, 60%. 
Significantly, the survey results, released this week, also showed the support 
to be uniform throughout Orange County, in both poor cities and rich ones. 
Support also extended across age groups. 
</P>
<P>
 These facts are worth consideration by the conservative legislators 
representing the county in Sacramento and Washington the next time gun control 
comes up for a vote. Knee-jerk responses to the issue and parroting a trite and 
questionable Second Amendment argument no longer can suffice.

RIGHTS WATCH; OLD ISSUE, NEW TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Boston Eight" is a self-proclaimed group whose members allege they are 
victims of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Outside of 
Massachusetts they would be of little note except for the fact that all are men 
and their complaints are against a California diet food company, Jenny Craig. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight men, who worked for Jenny Craig in the Boston area, either have 
filed suits against the company or have lodged complaints with the 
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. The firm has denied the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints of sexual harassment and legal actions filed by men are on the 
rise, adding yet another wrinkle to the already complex issue of work and 
gender. And such complaints are likely to get more attention soon because of 
the coming movie based on Michael Crichton's best-selling novel, "Disclosure," 
about reverse sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many male complainants say they get little sympathy and much ridicule. That 
will sound familiar to anyone who has read news reports of cases involving 
female victims over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the men in the Jenny Craig case say they were made uncomfortable by 
the company requirement that they wear smocks and scarves. Such complaints 
might seem comical to some, but the subject of sexual harassment is no joke. 
The temptation might be to dismiss men's sexual harassment complaints or to 
inappropriately indulge them. Each case should be assessed on its merits. And 
we should all look forward to a day when sexual harassment of both men and 
women is a historical footnote.

COURTS BRACE FOR A HIGH TIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not too many years ago, the Los Angeles Superior Court won dubious distinction 
as one of the most delayed civil trial courts in the nation. A truly Dickensian 
pace prevailed; those who wished to exercise their right to a trial could -- 
and often did -- wait five years for an open courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles had the worst state court in this regard but certainly not the 
only one that moved so slowly as to mock notions of justice. However, diligent 
efforts by judges, prodded by new legislative mandates, have changed the 
picture dramatically here and elsewhere. The wait for trial in auto accident 
cases, fraud claims and medical malpractice or other civil disputes has dropped 
to about 18 months in Orange County and two years in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That progress is now being wiped out by the incoming tide of "three strikes" 
cases. A year ago, there were 5,900 felony cases awaiting trial in L.A. 
Superior Court; last month the caseload was at 7,000. The district attorney 
says there may be more than 5,800 felony jury trials in Los Angeles in 1995, up 
substantially from 2,410 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court is also feeling the crunch. In April, 400 
criminal cases were set for trial; now the number is about 675. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal defendants are entitled to a trial within 60 days of arraignment and, 
unless a defendant waives that right, such a case takes precedence over any 
civil lawsuit -- meaning that a civil trial can be interrupted or delayed. 
That's now happening regionwide as judges who normally hear civil matters must 
help with the rising criminal trial caseload. Those civil litigants with means 
can, meanwhile, avail themselves of private judges; the rest, whose claims may 
be just as pressing, will have to get used to waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Californian Constitution says that you have the right to a jury trial in 
a civil case," says Robert M. Mallano, presiding judge of the L.A. Superior 
Court. "If we can't try civil cases, it makes the Constitution like a scrap of 
paper." Alas.

BOSNIA'S 'PEACEKEEPERS': EUNUCHS AT THE ORGY; U.N.: ANTIPATHY TOWARD THE 
SARAJEVO GOVERNMENT HAS LED TO COLLECTIVE INTERNATIONAL AMNESIA ABOUT THE 
SERBS' TRUE INTENTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RIEFF, David Rieff's fourth book, Slaughter House: Bosnia and the 
Failure of the West, will be published in February by Simon & Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have been down this road before. If the events in Bihac demonstrate 
anything, it is that the Bosnian Serbs understand the Western powers, NATO and 
the United Nations better than these nations and entities understand 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At least at the siege of Srebrenica, U.N. officials could assert that they 
were moving in uncharted territory. By the time of Gorazde, a year later, that 
excuse was hardly sustainable. As for Bihac, its transformation from a 
relatively viable economic and social entity into a Muslim Bantustan literally 
recapitulates what happened to the main government-controlled enclaves in 
eastern Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no excuses for the West's inaction or for the United Nations' 
failure to take a hard line; but there is nothing surprising about any of this 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 It is becoming clear that among the other ailments that afflict it where the 
former Yugoslavia is concerned, the international community, as it is rather 
inappropriately called, suffers from a collective failure of memory, a sort of 
moral Alzheimer's disease that allows it to misconstrue over and over again the 
same challenge from the Serbs. This is not simply a matter of U.N. officials 
from Boutros Boutros-Ghali and Kofi Annan in New York to Yasushi Akashi and 
Gens. Bertrand de Lapresle and Michael Rose in the Balkans dusting off the same 
expressions of shock and horror they used prefatory to doing nothing a year, 
two years, three years earlier. That could be ascribed to cynicism, or bad 
faith, or the desire, when all is said and done, to see peace come to the 
Balkans even if that peace is nothing more than a Serb victory with a hint of 
humanitarian window dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt these hidden agendas do affect the way the U.N. Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations and the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) behave. But 
the more fundamental and, in a sense, the more shocking point is that these 
officials are also genuinely surprised by what is going on. That they get along 
well with Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and the rest has been a given for a 
long time. Indeed, the difference between the cordial tone of most meetings 
between Akashi and Rose and the Bosnian Serbs and the tension of encounters 
between these officials and representatives of the Bosnian government is often 
remarked upon in private by U.N. and Red Cross officials who have been present 
at both. But there is a sense in which the United Nations' antipathy toward the 
Bosnians not only blinds it to the justice of the Bosnian cause, but also leads 
it to misrepresent to itself what the Serbs are up to. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear U.N. officials tell it, it was only a Bosnian army offensive that 
changed the status quo in Bihac. In their rush to blame the victims -- that 
oldest of U.N. specialties in Bosnia -- U.N. officials ignore the more 
fundamental aspect of the situation, which is that Gen. Mladic intended to do 
away with the Bihac pocket all along. He was just waiting for the right time to 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Serb side, many people even say that the Bosnian force was lured out of 
the pocket, and that the Serb counterattack was already planned even as the 
Bosnians advanced beyond positions they had any hope of holding. Whatever the 
details, those whose memory functions are not impaired will remember that the 
Serbs used the same pretext of Bosnian army assaults in the Drina Valley to 
gain effective control of that area in late 1993 and then again in the spring 
of this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion is inescapable that the United Nations does not want to 
acknowledge what the Serbs are really up to. Just as the Bosnian army seems 
incapable of conducting military operations while keeping in mind that the 
Serbs will hit back, so the United Nations seems incapable of viewing Serb 
actions in a large historical context. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of Bihac was clear early on to anyone following the development 
over the last few months of at least a partial rift between Belgrade and the 
Bosnian Serbs, and of a rising fear on the Bosnian Serb side and among the 
Krajina Serbs that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was thinking of selling 
out the Serb-held areas of Croatia as part of a "historic compromise" with 
Zagreb. With Bihac under Bosnian government control, the distinction between 
the Croatian Krajina and the Serb-controlled Bosanska Krajina remained a valid 
one. With Bihac neutralized, the separation of these two Serb-controlled 
entities became far more difficult, whatever Milosevic's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 But for UNPROFOR all this seems to have come as one more complete surprise in 
that long series of complete surprises that have marked U.N. peacekeeping 
operations in the former Yugoslavia since 1991. Cyrus Vance was surprised when 
the U.N.-protected areas in Croatia became the Serbian Republic of the Krajina. 
Lord Owen was surprised when the Bosnian Serb Parliament in Pale turned down 
his plan. NATO was surprised when the assault on Gorazde took place despite 
NATO's token air strike. And now Rose and Akashi profess surprise that the 
Serbs really mean to neutralize Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali -- forced, it is said, by ambassadors from the Islamic countries 
to go to Sarajevo -- was also surprised when Karadzic refused to come to the 
airport to meet with him. And yet this snubbing by the Bosnian Serbs was 
entirely predictable. Had Karadzic met with the U.N. chief, he might have had 
to give something up, or, at least, pretend to do so. And there is no reason 
for him to take such a risk. From the Serb perspective, everything is 
proceeding smoothly.  
</P>
<P>
 With the decision by the U.S. government to drop its opposition to the 
eventual merger of the Serb-controlled Bosnia with the rump Yugoslavia, almost 
the last obstacle to the plan concocted by Milosevic, Karadzic, Mladic and 
Milan Matic, the Krajina leader, has been eliminated. All that remains, they 
feel, is some mopping up on the battlefield. Bihac was one place this had to be 
done. The narrow strip of Serb-controlled territory is in the far northeast of 
the country; the so-called corridor around the town of Brcko is another. No 
doubt the fighting will start there in the not too distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the United Nations, it is stuck. With the humiliation not only of one 
peacekeeping operation but of the entire concept of peacekeeping all but 
complete, the United Nations, for all Boutros-Ghali's threats, cannot withdraw; 
the operation would simply be too costly. UNPROFOR would be fired upon by the 
Serbs and Bosnian government forces alike, eager to keep the equipment the 
foreign battalions brought with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The likeliest outcome is that as the Bosnian War is decided on the 
battlefield, and in the course of complicated negotiations among Belgrade, 
Zagreb, Sarajevo, Pale and Knin, the United Nations forces -- missionless, 
discredited and impotent -- will remain as resentful and largely ignored 
onlookers. They will be, as the joke goes in Sarajevo, eunuchs at the orgy.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a disgraceful predicament, but one that the United Nations, through its 
incompetence, its inflexibility and, above all, its blind amoral adherence to a 
notion of impartiality that made no distinction between murderers and their 
victims, richly deserves.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE ELECTION; ARE MEN ATTACKING THE SYSTEM?; THREATENED BY THE 
WHIRLWIND OF CHANGE GLOBALLY AND AT HOME, 6 OUT OF 10 WHITE MALES VOTED 
REPUBLICAN NOV. 8. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILTON VIORST, Milton Viorst is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the digits that spilled out of computers in analysis of the last 
election, perhaps the most significant is the voting pattern of white males, of 
whom six out of 10 cast ballots for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The number is significant because white women voted in almost precisely the 
opposite ratio. If women alone had gone to the polls in the last election, 
President Clinton's Democrats would have won a substantial victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the huge difference? 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, white men began voting against the Democrats in greater numbers than 
did white women. Only the overwhelming margins received from blacks of both 
sexes have kept the Democrats in contention.  
</P>
<P>
 The numbers tell us that something is going on in our society that is 
troubling white men but not white women -- or at least is troubling women far 
less -- and it clearly lies beneath the cover of everyday political grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, it seems that men were far more upset than women with Clinton's 
"draft-dodging" during the Vietnam War. It also seems that men have been more 
disturbed by Clinton's concern for the rights of homosexuals, in the military 
and out. Both issues cut to the core of men's identity, making them 
uncomfortable.  
</P>
<P>
 But there is more. Commentators have noted that American white males sense 
that they are lost in a whirlwind of cultural and economic change that they 
scarcely understand and cannot control. Similar feelings, historians say, 
emerged with the dissolution of the feudal system and the rise of the 
Industrial Revolution. The transformation of our own times lies in the 
globalization of the workplace, unprecedented in human experience.  
</P>
<P>
 American workers once blamed their ills on faceless capitalists in New York 
and lashed out at blacks and immigrants for trying to steal their livelihood. 
That tradition remains, but now the facelessness belongs to traders in Tokyo, 
bankers in Hong Kong, industrialists in Munich. The workingman is more 
frustrated than ever at his lack of recourse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toyota that the American male drives in itself confirms the power that 
foreign economies have over him. Global competition is real, not imagined; it 
exercises a serious drag on the rewards of his labor. The white male of today 
turns a deaf ear to old-fashioned appeals to class conflict. Instead, he senses 
that the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade -- inevitable as globalization of the economy may have made 
them -- will, at least in the short run, worsen his plight. American capitalism 
has adapted to the new conditions, but in the process the American worker has 
become much more vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 But are not black men equally vulnerable? Maybe the answer is that a sense of 
insecurity is so natural to blacks that they take it for granted and vote as 
they always have. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, however, another factor -- perhaps linked to globalization -- is also 
gnawing away at the white male voter. A couple of decades ago, he was the sole 
breadwinner and the proud master of the household. Today, the two-income family 
has become the norm, and the wife often earns more than he does. Patriarchy is 
finished, and the man of the house has to learn to share not only the decisions 
but also the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the profound cultural and economic transformation of our civilization 
rather than specific political grievances that are at the root of the anger 
that voters expressed last month. A few weeks ago, a white male taxi driver in 
a Southern town growled to me about "your stupid president and her husband." In 
pointing an irate finger at Hillary Rodham Clinton, he was conveying the 
anxiety that many men feel with the higher status that women have attained in 
our culture. No doubt the women's movement -- and perhaps the black and gay 
movements -- have diminished the white man's sense of himself and shifted the 
way he casts his vote.  
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, Americans needed to safeguard the government to defend them 
against communists, but the Cold War is over. Now they can safely turn to 
candidates who promise to dismantle the institutions of the state and even to 
third parties that propose to wreck some of them entirely. The American male 
seems to feel alone and frightened. He is angry at the system for failing him, 
but the problem may be so far beyond the powers of government that there is 
little that Bill Clinton or anyone else can do to correct it.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; FOURTH QUARTER IS A REAL LOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE SPRINGER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Magic Johnson used to call it winning time. For the Raiders, it has been 
losing time. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game is on the line, the Raiders have not been on their game, having 
been outscored in the fourth quarter this season, 98-49, and 39-13 in the last 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategy doesn't change from the first quarter to the fourth quarter," 
cornerback Albert Lewis said. "I believe in the fourth quarter we have had too 
many mental letdowns that just cost us some big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more mental than physical.... The key factor for us is that we 
haven't been mature enough to understand the importance of playing four 
quarters in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he wouldn't name names, Lewis indicated that it shouldn't be assumed 
that some of the team's older players were automatically mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maturity, you can't measure that in number of years," said Lewis, a 12-year 
veteran who had spent his entire career with the Kansas City Chiefs before 
joining the Raiders this season. "It has more to do with attitude and what 
you've learned. There are a lot of guys who have played 10 years in the league 
and don't know any more than they did when they were rookies." 
</P>

 Although he has recovered from an ankle injury, Derrick Hoskins will remain a 
backup to Patrick Bates at strong safety. Hoskins had been the starter before 
getting hurt. STEVE SPRINGER

 Mendocino Wine Pioneer Fired: John Parducci was sacked as general manager of 
the winery bearing his name by Teachers Management Corp., the Newport Beach 
investment partnership.Parducci, 76, who sold almost all of his stake in the 
winery in 1973 when TMI acquired Parducci Wine Cellars, said he was barred from 
entering the winery. Jim Martin, president of TMI, said Parducci was fired 
because of his relationship with personnel at the facility. TMI has been sued 
by disgruntled limited partners in TMI, who charge that the firm concealed $100 
million in debt and charged excessive fees. The suit seeks to eliminate TMI as 
general partner, and Parducci has been vocal in his support of the action.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS AND BONDS HIT BY ROBUST ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unexpectedly strong economic activity that resurrected fears of higher 
interest rates sent stock prices tumbling and bond yields higher Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 38.36 points at 3,700.87, having 
lost as much as 48 points earlier in the session. Traders said several rounds 
of high-volume computerized selling worsened the blue-chip index's losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 5 
on the New York Stock Exchange on Big Board volume of 288.31 million shares, 
down from 200.48 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp drop in computer stocks pushed broad-market indexes lower. The Nasdaq 
composite index, which is heavily weighted with high-technology firms, 
plummeted 9.71 points to 740.61. The NYSE's composite index fell 2.37 points to 
246.04, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 4.77 points to 
448.92. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks fell in tandem with bond prices after the National Assn. of Purchasing 
Management said its index of manufacturing growth rose to 61.2% in November 
from 59.7% the previous month. That was the highest reading since February, 
1984, and stronger than analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate reports, the Commerce Department said Americans' incomes surged 
1.4% in October, and the Labor Department said first-time claims for state 
unemployment benefits dropped by 12,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly half a point earlier in the session and 
recouped most of those losses. The long bond's yield ended up slightly: 8.01% 
from 8.0% on Wednesday. Its price, which falls when interest rates rise, lost 
3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market did not recover with bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The data was "considerably stronger than people were anticipating," said 
Robert Walberg, senior stock analyst at MMS International in Chicago. It 
indicates "that the economy remains robust, which increases the likelihood that 
the Federal Reserve (Board) will tighten (credit) down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar advanced broadly, hitting a seven-week high against the Japanese 
yen, buoyed by the purchasing managers report that indicated the economy should 
run full-steam into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar was quoted at 99.34 Japanese yen, the highest level 
since Oct. 13, up from 98.93 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. currency also changed hands late in New York at 1.573 German marks, 
up from 1.569. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors worried that higher interest rates will continue to lure 
investors out of stocks and into fixed-income investments such as bonds. Higher 
rates could also curb consumer spending and crimp corporate earnings, which 
would eventually send stock valuations lower, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 The market was pushed lower by a broad selloff in computer stocks, as concern 
mounted about Intel's Pentium chips. Intel fell 1/2 to 62 5/8, extending 
Wednesday's 2 3/8-point drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell Computer dropped 3 5/16 to 39 3/4, and Gateway 2000 slipped 1 5/8 to 20 
1/4. CS First Boston downgraded the issues, citing potential expenses tied to 
the problem with Pentium chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal computer stocks were also hit by an announcement by Hewlett-Packard 
that it will cut prices on some PCs. Hewlett lost 2 5/8 to 95 1/8. IBM slid 1 
1/8 to 69 5/8, while Apple fell 1 1/16 to 36 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch fell 1 1/2 to 36 1/2 on rumors -- denied by the investment 
firm -- that it has suffered large losses on investments involving Orange 
County. Some stock analysts said the drop in Merrill's stock was generally 
depressing stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailing stocks fell on weak November sales figures. Wal-Mart lost 3/4 to 
22 1/2; JC Penney fell 3 1/2 to 42 1/2; Gap Stores slid 3 to 32 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, stocks closed lower. In London, the Financial Times 100-share 
average fell 41.8 points to close at 3,039.6. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX was down 
1.67 points at 2,046.59, and Japan's 225-share Nikkei average ended the day at 
19,013.60, down 62.02 points. Mexico's market was closed for the presidential 
inauguration.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; KRASNOW STARTS RECORD LABEL WITH MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Krasnow, the talent guru who masterminded the success of such acts as 
George Clinton, Metallica and Anita Baker, has launched a record label in 
association with MCA Music Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old former Elektra Entertainment chairman, who shocked the record 
industry last summer when he quit the label following a corporate shake-up, 
broke his four-month silence Thursday to announce the multimillion-dollar joint 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm back and I'm ready to do business," Krasnow said in a telephone interview 
from his home in New York. "What I'm selling is specialized individual 
attention and dedicated commitment to each act I sign." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Inc. has committed more than $3 million in start-up costs for the 
as-yet-unnamed venture, which will be based in New York. Krasnow is conducting 
negotiations with several acts and expects to have his first release in the 
stores by June. 
</P>
<P>
 The realignment that drove Krasnow from Elektra also forced the departure of 
Warner Bros. Records chairman Mo Ostin and his protege Lenny Waronker, who are 
set to leave the Warner Music Group fold next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallout from the battle subsequently caused Metallica to file a lawsuit to 
sever its decade-long association with Elektra and triggered an unprecedented 
executive revolt in October that nearly paralyzed the world's largest record 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely respected for his keen musical ear and eclectic taste, Krasnow has been 
courted in recent months by several record conglomerates. Al Teller, chairman 
and CEO of MCA Music Entertainment Group, said: "This is a bet on Bob. The deal 
is specifically designed to take advantage of his great strength as a finder of 
talent." 
</P>
<P>
 In related news, Phil Quartararo will not leave Virgin Records to take a 
presidency post at Warner Bros. Records. And Sire Records artists and 
repertoire whiz Joe McEwen has turned down an offer to join his current boss, 
Seymour Stein, who is expected to move to Elektra Entertainment soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * John J. Ruscin has been appointed president and chief executive of CBS/FOX 
Video. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diarmuid Quinn is the new senior vice president of marketing for Hollywood 
Records in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 * Edward Egan, Mark Kristol and William Loper have joined Universal Pictures 
in senior marketing positions. All three executives come to Universal from 
TriStar Pictures.

AROUND TOWN: TALKING WITH LIVE LIVE NUDE NUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L.A. has its landmarks, as a world-class city must. There are Forest Lawn, 
H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D, Olvera Street. And there's the NUDE NUDES sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a day passes that, intrigued by that marquee on Century Boulevard 
approaching Los Angeles International Airport, someone doesn't stop and, just 
curious, venture inside the garishly painted building. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside is the Century Lounge, where the dancers are naked, the drinks are soft 
and the action is nonstop from 11 a.m. -- when the lunch crowd drifts in -- 
until 4 a.m., when the die-hards close the place. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cavernous showroom, with its three stages, twinkle lights play off 
mirrors. Center stage, China Doll is stripping down to her thigh-high, 
stiletto-heeled black patent boots. In a minute, she'll be back to retrieve the 
dollar bills left at the rail by the men in the front seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-male crowd is youngish and curiously emotionless; as they sip their 
soft drinks, they might be watching a weather report. Get the fish hooks out of 
those pockets, beseeches the deejay: "If these ladies don't wake you up, it's 
'cause you're dead. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Scantily clad dancers prowl the room: "Would you like a private dance?" That's 
where the big money is. Ten dollars a dance for the dancer, $4 for the house. 
Plus tips, big tips. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference four decades makes. Longtime Angelenos may recall that in 
the late '50s, this club was a 24-hour bowling alley/cocktail lounge/coffee 
shop called Carolina Pines, frequented largely by workers in nearby factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the factories moved out and name-brand hotels sprouted at the shoulders 
of the expanding LAX. And Carolina Pines fell upon hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "So they called 911 and I showed up," says Howard White, a onetime talent 
agent and son of the original proprietor. He perked things up with lingerie 
shows. Soon, "the lingerie got skimpier and skimpier." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1977, the bowling was history. In its place were a nude bar where, by state 
law, no alcohol could be served, and a thriving disco, Carolina West, where the 
music was loud and the drinks alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, White says, in 1987 his lawyer failed to file papers to renew his liquor 
license. "It killed me," he says. His solution? To go all nude. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally the sign said NUDES. People laughed when early in 1981 White added 
that second NUDE but he did so "with malice aforethought. I thought it would be 
catchy, a conversation piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, "It kept growing, like Pinocchio's nose. I kept making the letters 
larger and larger," until today the wavy orange letters are about six feet 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding the word live was another White inspiration. Enjoying his own joke, he 
asks, "What would I have, dummies?" He liked the idea so much that he later 
changed that to LIVE LIVE NUDE NUDES. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has been amused. To circumvent a onetime city ban on the word 
nude , White inserted the teensiest g, virtually invisible, between the 
towering D and E. When Pope John Paul II visited L.A., a city father suggested 
White remove the sign so as not to offend papal eyes. He declined. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sign is the Century Lounge's better mousetrap, but the club's 
airport-close location is its big plus. Thousands pass by each day. Back home 
in Akron or Walla Walla, they make mental notes to check it out the next time 
they hit L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 That sign brings them in; the dancers keep them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The music is "Leave Your Hat On" by Joe Cocker. The dancer is Raquel . She is 
wearing a black velvet dress with a flamenco flounce -- and a black hat. Soon, 
she'll shed the hat, the dress and everything underneath. She is a 
crowd-pleaser, a 21-year-old brunet with an alluring smile, a come-hither wink. 
Her onstage philosophy: "As long as it's legal, I'll do it.' ' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his "girls" are hired as dancers ($4.25 an hour, plus tips), 
"rhythm is the last thing" White looks for. Adds general manager Gene Lombardi, 
"Every man who walks in here has his fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The music is "I'm the Only One" by Melissa Etheridge. The dancer is Sarah. 
She's poured into a floor-length white lace gown that flares at the hem. Her 
long lace gloves flutter at her wrists. Soon, she will take off everything 
except the gloves and her white high heels. At 23, she, too, is one of the 
Century Lounge's top draws, a blond with a Gypsy-like stripping style and an 
offstage manner that would endear her to your grandmother.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The men come in limos and tour buses. In bachelor parties. An international 
mix of voyeurs. $10 at the door, please. Or come before six for just $1. 
</P>
<P>
 They know the dancers only by their first names. If they telephone, the 
cashier will read them the names of that night's dancers -- Angel, Jamie, 
Natasha -- much as a waiter recites the day's specials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raquel (Alicia Raquel Moses), a former high school cheerleader, and Sarah 
("Sarah Lee"), who describes herself as "very spiritual" have been dancing at 
the Century Lounge for 2 1/2 years, smiling at even the creeps, ignoring the 
occasional shouted obscenity, flirting as they bend down to pick up the dollar 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Their route to nude dancing can be summed up in one word: money . Raquel was 
working in the accounting department of a Newport Beach ad agency: "I wanted to 
moonlight a little. And I was curious." She hired on as a waitress at the 
Century Lounge. Five months later, she danced nude one night. She was scared, 
then excited, so caught up in the moment that she forgot to pick up the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah was a marketing researcher who had just taken a big pay cut. "I couldn't 
pay my rent. I was being evicted, had no food and a detective was looking for 
my car." 
</P>
<P>
 At a religious bookstore on Melrose Avenue, she met a Century Lounge waitress 
who thought she'd be a good dancer. Sarah came and watched, then "went to 
Hollywood to do a topless contest just to see if I could take my clothes off. I 
was very shy." 
</P>
<P>
 She was thinking, "I can't believe I'm doing this in front of strangers. I was 
shaking. I think I blanked out." She laughs. "I still don't change in front of 
my sister, or the girls at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 She can still remember driving past the NUDE NUDES sign a few years back and 
thinking, "Gosh, I'd never work there! How can they do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be nude onstage is to be exposed physically and emotionally. Sometimes 
Raquel pretends there are only women watching, and sometimes, she says, "I have 
a picture of the men all naked." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a part of you that feels free," Sarah says. "I feel like I'm having 
fun and these men are having fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Raquel has told her friends and her "born-again Christian" mother what she 
does, but not her baby-sitter. She won't, until her toddler daughter is old 
enough to understand that "sometimes things aren't what they seem to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sarah: "My family doesn't know. With my upbringing, I think they'd 
probably disown me. I told my female friends, one at a time. Most of them tried 
to talk me out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Raquel is divorced; Sarah has never married. Neither dates the patrons, 
although they are frequently asked out. And they do not turn tricks, they say, 
although some of the dancers do. 
</P>
<P>
 The major tippers aren't always easy to spot. "What they're wearing is not 
necessarily what they're thinking," says Raquel, who once got a $500 bill 
onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sarah: "I do well with Asian men. And businessmen coming in on their 
lunch break like me because I have a very conservative look -- no tattoos or 
piercings." 
</P>
<P>
 The house rules: Look, but don't touch. A hefty security force makes sure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You're very vulnerable. There's a lot of different types of men out there, and 
a lot of them have problems. -- Raquel 
</P>
<P>
 There's a switch that gets turned on and it's OK to be naked because you're in 
a safe, secure place. -- Sarah 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is ashamed of what she does. Money aside, both say they have 
benefited. And, they mention, holier-than-thou friends in need don't hesitate 
to accept their tainted money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the dancers had rough childhoods and are hard as diamonds by the time 
they're 18. Some are earning college money. Others are single mothers. They 
stay an average of six months before moving on, some to another club. 
</P>
<P>
 Some acquire sugar daddies. One man tipped a dancer $5,000 a month to have a 
weekly breakfast with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Most have had breast implants. Face lifts at 28 are not uncommon. "No matter 
how good-looking they are," White says, "they get paranoid when a good-looking 
girl shows up." 
</P>
<P>
 Their bodies are their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With cosmetic surgery, and if I keep in shape, I can probably dance another 20 
years. -- Raquel 
</P>
<P>
 As long as I'm still having fun with it, I could see myself doing it 10 more 
years. If my family doesn't find out. -- Sarah 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most dancers work three eight-hour shifts weekly and the money is good. Even 
in this economy, White says, "A good girl will make $300 to $500 (per shift) on 
tips." But, "They have to deal with these schmucks as if they loved every one 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah and Raquel have seen it all -- athletes, movie stars, rock stars, 
newscasters, a fundamentalist Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 And heard it all: "I'm just waiting for a plane." "I was just dropping a 
friend at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 They listen to the men's problems and, within reason, cater to their 
fantasies. And they tell the would-be touchers, ever so sweetly, "I'll touch 
for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Night after night, they psyche themselves up, put on their makeup and come 
through the curtain, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 And the deejay keeps on saying: "These ladies have been out there giving you 
110%. . . ."

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; A NEW WAY TO FIX THOSE MINOR DENTS AND DINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You exercise great care every time you pull into a parking lot. But then you 
return and find it. Another dreaded dent in the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the best efforts of auto manufacturers to add plastic door guards -- 
or, as did Saturn, go to plastic doors -- most doors are metal and dents and 
dings are as much a problem as ever. Parking spaces are shrinking, automobile 
sheet metal is getting thinner and people seem to be more careless. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost nothing will damage the value of your car more than seemingly minor 
dents and dings. When you trade in a late model car, an appraiser will mark 
down the value based on the cost of repairing these blemishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of a traditional dent repair can run up to several hundred dollars 
for a single door or fender. Dents must be sanded, filled, primed, painted and 
clear coated, a job that takes a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent Wizard is a relatively new service that claims it can beat that cost and 
inconvenience through a non-traditional repair, in which long tools are 
inserted through access holes in doors and fenders to manipulate the sheet 
metal back to its original form. The company only fixes dents in which the 
paint is undamaged. Dents up to the size of a softball can be removed.  
</P>
<P>
 Dent Wizard charges about $89 to remove the first dent and $31 for additional 
dents on the same fender or door. I hired the company, which has locations 
nationwide, to demonstrate the service on my car. 
</P>
<P>
 I would give Dent Wizard mixed marks for its performance and service. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, Dent Wizard did remove the two dents I asked them to 
fix. One was on the hood, the other on the rear left door. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not perfect, I doubt anybody but me could see the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dent Wizard repair left the window of the rear left door broken. The 
company did arrange to have it replaced, but I lost use of the car for a day. 
Dent Wizard twice promised to also replace the professionally applied window 
tinting film so the new window would match the rest of the car, but after five 
weeks it has yet to make good on that offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent Wizard President Kevin Beattie acknowledges broken windows can occur, 
though only 17 windows have broken during the course of 45,000 repairs, he 
says. Beattie says the company strives for 100% customer satisfaction and 
offers a money-back guarantee on all repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent Wizard does most of its business with dealers, and also has large 
accounts including Hertz and Nissan, which hires the firm to repair new cars 
dented in transit. If you want to try Dent Wizard, you can call (800) 336-8949 
to find the nearest location.

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; TRAVEL PLANNERS DO THE THINKING FOR YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's get in the car, take a vacation and get away from the computer for 
awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you've got to figure out how to get to wherever you're going, and the 
faithful computer you're going to leave behind can help find the best route, 
calculate the mileage, draw a map, suggest motels for overnight stops and even 
point out attractions to see along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The software used to pull off these tricks are travel planners, of which four 
are commonly available for the Windows platform (none are currently available, 
as far as could be determined, for Macintosh). To test them, we devised an 
imaginary car trip from Los Angeles to Los Alamos, N.M., with a side trip to 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 All four programs -- the "AAA Trip Planner" on CD-ROM, "AutoMap" on floppy 
disks, "Map'n'Go" on CD-ROM and the "Rand McNally TripMaker" on floppies -- 
work basically the same way. They allow you to type in your starting point, 
destination and any side trips you wish to take.  
</P>
<P>
 Then you get a variety of options, usually allowing you to choose between the 
quickest and shortest of routes (the shortest is sometimes not the quickest 
because of the type of highways you'll be using) and the average speeds at 
which you plan on driving (if you aim high, allow extra time for conversations 
with highway patrol officers).  
</P>
<P>
 Then the program goes to work, planning your itinerary. Not surprisingly, the 
quickest routes planned by the four programs were similar. The shortest in 
total mileage was "Map'n'Go," which came up with a grand total of 929 miles. 
"AutoMap" was the highest with 953 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated driving times ranged from 15 hours and 39 minutes to 19 hours 
and 3 minutes, with the differences due mostly to each program setting its own 
speed rates. The driving-time estimate is for reference only, anyway, because 
you will be stopping along the way for meals, bathroom breaks and hopefully on 
a trip this long, a sleep-over. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the four programs say exactly where they start in Los Angeles, but all 
use either the Harbor or Hollywood freeways (or both) to get you to Interstate 
10 and eastward toward Interstate 15 and the well-known route to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The differences in the itineraries start showing up on the less-traveled route 
south from Vegas to highways leading to Arizona and finally to Los Alamos, but 
again the variations in route are generally minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The real differences between these programs are in the printouts you take with 
you and in what they offer in suggestions for sightseeing along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The clear favorite is "Map'n'Go" from DeLorme Mapping, a pioneer and still a 
leader in the electronic mapping field. A printout from this program gives you 
a detailed itinerary, in map form, showing the changes in highways you take 
along the way and at what mileages.  
</P>
<P>
 The "Map'n'Go" printout for our sample trip ran to 16 pages (don't expect to 
do the printout just before you get into the car -- it will take a little time, 
especially if you're using a color printer). Stapled together, it made a neat 
package that was easy to follow, page by page. 
</P>
<P>
 After planning the itinerary, you can ask "Map'n'Go" to show you a list of 
points of interest along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 With an adjustable gauge set to show us sites 10 miles or less off the planned 
route, the program came up with 64 sites. Then, it launched into a narrated 
slide show. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the least useful, but perhaps the most amusing part of the program, 
as "Map'n'Go" showed us Forest Lawn Memorial Park, the Roy Rogers & Dale Evans 
Museum, the pyramid-shaped Luxor hotel in Las Vegas, Hoover Dam and the 
Bradbury Science Museum in Los Alamos, which a friend refers to as the 
"our-friend-the-bomb" museum.  
</P>
<P>
 The narration is of the uncritical "land of many contrasts" variety, telling 
us, for example, that at the Roy Rogers museum we can see "horse stars 
Buttermilk and Trigger, and Bullet, the dog." It does not mention that the 
opportunity to see these famous movie animals is brought to us through the 
miracle of taxidermy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Map'n'Go" costs about $40 through mail order or in software shops. The other 
programs, all of which give you a printed itinerary of some type, cost about 
$40 for the AAA CD-ROM to about $50 for "AutoMap."

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; DEATH OF A CHEERIER, FRENCH WILLY LOMAN; OF ILLUSTRIOUS 
MEN BY JEAN ROUAUD ; TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY BARBARA WRIGHT; ARCADE 
$19.95, 160 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Attention must be paid," Willy Loman's wife demands on behalf of her failing 
salesman husband. It is a cry of outrage that an ordinary man could work so 
hard to wrestle support and hope for his family, and get such a shabby return. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Rouaud's partly fictional portrait of his traveling-salesman father 
carries a message that is ostensibly similar. Attention must be paid to Joseph 
Rouaud, who drove hundreds of miles each day along the back roads of Brittany, 
lugging cases packed with china and glassware from village shop to village 
shop; whose laborious life could not contain an insurgent spirit; and who was 
felled by a coronary at the age of 41. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a distance between "Of Illustrious Men" and "Death of a 
Salesman." One might call it a distance between Europe and America. Rouaud's 
book is an evocation more than a protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The rigors of history and of society have bruised Joseph Rouaud's heart. He 
spent years in the Resistance, and modern commerce is beginning to stifle the 
village shop. But his heart has done some of its own bruising: the weakness of 
the organ his parents bequeathed him, the charge of passion he kept it tuned up 
to, the law of life that says you struggle and die. 
</P>
<P>
 Society and the state are not only an abstract Other; they are personages too 
-- as the king once was -- and they have rights and claims, even if you do your 
best to get around them. 
</P>
<P>
 If they -- along with time, other people, and inward raging -- play a part in 
wearing a man out, this has more to do with tragedy than injustice. It does not 
demean in the same way that injustice does; it does not crush in the same way 
that Willy Loman was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of Illustrious Men" is more golden than grieving; it is told with more gaiety 
than grimness, though darker notes are always present. Like Rouaud's "Fields of 
Glory," it tells its story of a modest provincial family in a series of 
exquisitely written scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins with Joseph on his roof untangling the telephone wire from some 
overhanging branches. Right afterward, this supremely buoyant and energetic man 
will feel a sudden exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 With its fatal outcome, the scene will develop in more detail toward the end; 
here it is the telephone line that counts. It connects us -- as will succeeding 
scenes, each with a moment of premonitory pain -- to an aspect of Joseph's life 
in the west of France in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone line, for example, illustrates the authority that Joseph holds 
in the village. His ingenuity and habit of assurance make others wait to see 
what he will do, whether it is a matter of assembling to consider the features 
of his new Peugeot, or rallying around when he organizes a communal cleaning 
after a smoky lantern fills his kitchen with oily soot. 
</P>
<P>
 (This is one of many scenes whose comedy harbors something richer and more 
telling: in this case the staggering number of pots, implements and chinaware 
amassed over many provident rural generations.) 
</P>
<P>
 Back to the telephone -- in the book, too, we constantly advance by detours. 
Joseph possesses one of the few in the village. His neighbors use it to escape 
the postmistress's eavesdropping at the telephone office; Joseph and his family 
considerately cover their ears when a neighbor makes a call, and Rouaud writes: 
</P>
<P>
 "The result was that we felt handicapped by the trust with which we were 
honored and didn't like to ask people to pay for their calls. But we valued the 
privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 Rouaud evokes the long hours of driving on gravel roads, stuck behind droves 
of cattle and the drover, who rides on a bicycle and flourishes a red flag. He 
writes of the endless ceremonial of the stops, hauling out six heavy cases and 
selling no more than two or three plates or glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 He writes of the large map of Brittany on which Joseph plans each day's route, 
with pins marking the shops, other pins marking attractive restaurants; the 
whole linked up by threads of different colors. Over the years he drove the 
equivalent of 2 1/2 times the Earth's circumference; his trips "wound like a 
ball of wool around a tiny little territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Rouaud writes of Sunday excursions with the family -- using the same 
wool-crossed map -- to visit interesting spots and gather enormous rocks, one 
of Joseph's possibly fatal passions. 
</P>
<P>
 He gives glimpses of Joseph's days in the Resistance; at one point guiding one 
of Patton's tank columns on a detour to see his fiancee. He records with 
graceful, stoic lightness the details of his father's collapse and death. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not die from being sick but from being alive, Montaigne wrote. In 
Rouaud's scattered and compelling snapshots, Joseph's large appetite for life 
is an aura of glory; while in each snapshot the appetite's shadow advances.

INK: IT'S A DRY SEASON IF SEX, CELEBS CAN'T SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; He is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have in front of us the current national best-seller lists from Publishers 
Weekly, USA Today, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, not all of the books launched with great thunderclaps of hype in 
recent months have dazzled book buyers. A few other titles have unexpectedly 
broken from the pack to become the sleeper hits of the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone from the best-seller lists is the autobiography "Brando: Songs My Mother 
Taught Me," which has to be one of the bigger disappointments in Random House's 
otherwise impressive season, considering the publisher paid Marlon Brando $5 
million to write the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Peter Manso's unauthorized "Brando: The Biography" (Hyperion) is 
nowhere to be found on the national lists. Brando's lone promotional effort, a 
clownish "interview" he did with Larry King on CNN, did little to enhance the 
mystique that both books purported to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 The newsmagazines and newspapers were all over "Sex in America" (Little, 
Brown), a reputable study that found the country's sexual life to be more 
traditional than many had believed, and Deborah Tannen's "Talking From 9 to 5: 
How Women's and Men's Conversational Styles Affect Who Gets Heard, Who Gets 
Credit, and What Gets Done" (Morrow). However, all of those off-the-book-page 
stories may have exhausted interest in the books themselves, which have not 
caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has Christopher Andersen's "Michael Jackson Unauthorized" (Simon & 
Schuster). Andersen, who has written shock-a-page bios of Madonna and Mick 
Jagger, this time had a subject for whom the public's curiosity had been 
drained by the scandal-driven media when his new book was published weeks ago. 
Call it a major stiff of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 And what are we to make of the reception for books about two movie legends? 
Robert Lacey's "Grace" (Putnam), a biography of Grace Kelly, was mined for 
awhile by the gossip columns and then faded. Lauren Bacall's "Now" (Knopf), 
like Brando's autobiography, is being "remaindered in place" by its publisher. 
Retailers were being urged to slash the price to as low as $11.50 in a 
promotion that will earn booksellers a special credit of $6 on each copy sold 
by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Another show-biz title that has underperformed this fall despite the 
publisher's expectation is Burt Reynolds' "My Life" (Hyperion). Reynolds was 
like Jackson: After the supermarket-tabloid barrage, how much more did readers 
want to know -- let alone pay for? 
</P>
<P>
 The top show-biz autobiographies to rise above the densely crowded field have 
been Reba McEntire's "Reba: My Life" (Bantam) and Dolly Parton's "Dolly" 
(HarperCollins). Other big hits are Tim Allen's "Don't Stand Too Close to a 
Naked Man" (Hyperion) and Paul Reiser's "Couplehood" (Bantam). 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to fall surprises, who would have thought that this Sunday's New 
York Times best-seller list would show radio broadcaster Don Imus' "God's Other 
Son" one notch above thriller master Dean Koontz's "Dark Rivers of the Heart"? 
</P>
<P>
 "God's Other Son," a comic novel written by the nationally syndicated Imus, 
was first published in 1981 and later reissued in paperback. However, after 
last month's reissue of 30,000 hardcover copies, Simon & Schuster reports that 
it now has 250,000 in print. 
</P>
<P>
 Another surprise is Richard J. Hornstein and Charles Murray's "The Bell 
Curve," a controversial examination of intelligence and race that has stirred 
crackling debate on America's talk shows and opinion pages. Published by the 
Free Press, the book clearly has found a market beyond the policy wonks and 
academics who might have been its primary audience -- its first printing in 
October was 50,000 copies. Copies in print today: 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks after publication, Pope John Paul II's "Crossing the Threshold of 
Hope" (Knopf) continues to rank at the top or near the top of the national 
lists. It's unclear whether total sales eventually will make the pontiff's book 
a profitable venture for the publisher, which reportedly paid more than $6 
million for the U.S. and Canadian rights. But the success so far has gone a 
long way to dispel the doubts of those who had less faith than Knopf.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'COBB': WHAT BECOMES A LEGEND LEAST?; SHELTON'S LATEST FILM 
SHOWS BAD AND UGLY OF BASEBALL STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his lifetime and after, as a player and a personality, Ty Cobb both 
astonished and horrified. A consensus pick, says biographer Al Stump, as "the 
most feared, castigated and acclaimed figure" in baseball history, Tyrus 
Raymond Cobb was too much for the world while he lived. Now, decades past his 
death, his memory alone has overmatched Ron Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton, the gifted writer-director whose best work ("Bull Durham," "White Men 
Can't Jump") involves sports, has used Stump's agonizing relationship with his 
subject as the framework for "Cobb," an ambitious but uneven and finally 
unsatisfying look at a man succinctly summarized as "hell in spikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed simply as a player, Cobb was arguably the greatest who ever lived. The 
first man elected to baseball's Hall of Fame, a competitor whose fire turned 
Gen. Douglas MacArthur into a tongue-tied acolyte, Cobb set 123 records during 
a career that lasted from 1905 to 1928, and his .367 lifetime batting average 
is one of several marks that no one is close to challenging even today. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for pioneering an aggressive approach to the game, Cobb was a terror 
during his off-hours. He was harsh, bigoted and probably psychotic, the kind of 
man who sent opponents to the hospital, took a blacksnake whip to his own son 
and proudly claimed to have pistol-whipped a street thug to death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As shrewd as he was nasty, Cobb made millions in the stock market, secretly 
supported some of his old opponents and handsomely endowed the Cobb Scholarship 
Fund for students who couldn't afford college. But as he neared the end of his 
life in 1960, nearly crippled by numerous illnesses and convinced that no one 
had ever properly appreciated him, he formed an unlikely friendship with Stump. 
</P>
<P>
 A sportswriter hired to collaborate on the great one's autobiography, Stump 
became an alter ego who "drew his bath, got drunk with him, and knelt with him 
in prayer on black nights when he knew death was near." 
</P>
<P>
 Their book, "My Life in Baseball," did not, on Cobb's insistence, contain any 
of that life's less savory aspects. Shortly after the man's death, Stump wrote 
a celebrated magazine piece that did, called "Ty Cobb's Wild 10-Month Fight to 
Live," and has just published his second book on the subject, "Cobb: A 
Biography," a thorough and chilling look at the athlete seen whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this is fascinating business and a film that concentrates more on the 
Cobb-Stump relationship than the former's playing career, as this one does, 
couldn't help but be of some interest. But like its subject, "Cobb" the movie 
invariably gets out of hand, its lack of sharp dramatic focus exacerbating 
problems in both casting and structure that prove difficult to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cobb's" initial trouble is that, to no great surprise, its namesake is much 
easier to take in print than on screen. Cobb's debilitating physical ailments, 
his propensity for shooting off his Luger as well as his mouth, the perpetual 
abuse he rains on anyone within reach, all inevitably become wearisome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, having the ferocious and talented Tommy Lee Jones play Cobb would 
lessen the pain, but it does not. Perhaps the actor is finally too tailor-made 
for the role, or maybe he and the director simply behaved as if he were. But 
the result, whether Cobb is wailing about greatness or ruminating about the 
dark circumstances around his father's death, is a performance too operatic and 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally problematical is the way Stump is portrayed by actor Robert Wuhl. 
Shelton, who has used Wuhl in two of his earlier films and is clearly fond of 
him, wrote the role with the actor in mind, a major miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the idea was apparently to portray Stump as sweet and vulnerable, in 
Wuhl's hands he comes off as the whiny, sniveling and servile half of a "The 
Champ and the Chump" double bill. As the harried man who watches over Cobb as 
he travels from the night life of Reno to an old-timer's banquet at 
Cooperstown, N.Y., to a trip to his Georgia roots, Stump is the main audience 
surrogate and it is fatal to have an irritating presence in that role. 
</P>
<P>
 Without anyone to care about, "Cobb's" script problems become increasingly 
intractable. Confronted by Cobb's volcanic personality, the film is completely 
nonplussed, unable to decide if it should be amused, piteous, reluctantly 
admiring or just plain disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar sense of uncertainty pervades all creative choices, from opening 
with an awkward fake newsreel detailing Cobb's baseball exploits to dealing 
with minor characters like an ill-used Reno cigarette girl (Lolita Davidovich) 
or even coming up with a plausible reason why Stump stuck around through all 
the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have a point of view, Stumpy, you're not worth killing," Cobb says, 
laying down his weapon in one of his quasi-sane moments, and it is a point well 
taken. Without a coherent aesthetic vision, this film and its ponderous 
emphasis on the cost of greatness is not what it might be either. 
</P>

DANCE REVIEW; THE POETIC RESTRAINT OF 'ROMEO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helgi Tomasson's lavish yet tasteful production of "Romeo and Juliet," which 
the San Francisco Ballet introduced at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on 
Wednesday, isn't like any other version of the Shakespearean tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 It lacks the operatic extroversion of Lavrovsky's ultra-Soviet staging. It can 
claim neither the picturesque theatricality established by Cranko in Stuttgart 
nor the verismo swagger that MacMillan enforced in London. It hardly tries to 
achieve the symmetrical abstraction of Ashton's Royal Danish incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasson does indeed pay passing homage to each of his most illustrious 
predecessors. He does so with telling allusions, however, not with quotations. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Romeo and Juliet" is subtle and lyrical, taut and trim, intimate and 
logical. There is nothing revolutionary here, and, thank goodness, nothing 
grating. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasson respects the poetry he must set in motion. In doing so, he 
demonstrates an exceptionally keen ear for the dynamic nuance as well as the 
romantic splendor of Prokofiev's score. 
</P>
<P>
 His choreographic vocabulary may be a bit limited for a challenge as broad as 
this one. There isn't a great deal of difference here between narrative dance, 
character dance and formal dance. Class distinctions are blurred. Traditional 
mime is virtually eliminated, and the protagonists are permitted on occasion to 
mouth silent words -- a stylistic anachronism that suggests nothing so much as 
agitated gum-chewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to be overwhelmed by the passions of the warring houses and 
star-cross'd lovers may find the proceedings on the stage a little too neat and 
a lot too reticent. Most faces in ballet tend to be pale these days, and 
Tomasson doesn't do a lot to intensify either focus or color. 
</P>
<P>
 In context, however, such reservations become almost inconsequential. The 
action in Tomasson's "Romeo" is meticulously motivated, aptly focused and 
carefully detailed. Vulgarity is steadfastly avoided, even when Prokofiev 
points the way to exaggeration. Comic cliche is not allowed. The fine line 
between pathos and bathos is respected. Ultimately, finesse becomes its own 
reward, in depth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The choreography is elegantly framed, perfectly complemented and perhaps even 
enhanced by the decors of the late Jens-Jacob Worsaae, who created muted images 
of Renaissance Verona that vacillate nicely between literalism and stylization. 
The scenes flow from locale to locale with graceful propulsion, and the 
exquisite color-coded costumes reinforce dramatic definitions. 
</P>
<P>
 This, essentially, is a very young and rather prim "Romeo and Juliet." The 
parental Capulets and Montagues must have gotten married as teen-agers. Friar 
Laurence is just a kid. The courtly lords and ladies look as if they were fresh 
out of school. The harlots are more polite than lusty, and the acrobatic trio 
that has inherited most of the divertissement duty doesn't even pretend to be 
part of the crowd. Luckily, everyone performs with enough dedication and 
exuberance to make surface contradictions seem less important than consistency 
of tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Randazzo and Elizabeth Loscavio danced the title roles beautifully on 
Wednesday. He may have projected generic ardor, but he leaped and grieved with 
splendidly controlled impetuosity. She may have resorted to stock-ingenue 
sweetness at the outset, but she certainly knew how to gauge the poignant 
course to heroic grandeur. The love duets, progressively contorted variations 
on the fine art of the lift, were dispatched with rare bravura -- the sort that 
refuses to call attention to itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The strong supporting cast was sensitively integrated, with Christopher 
Stowell as an exceptionally impish Mercutio, Jais Zinoun as a marvelously 
cynical Tybalt and Mikko Nissinen as a commandingly fleet Benvolio. Anita 
Paciotti enacted the Nurse with honesty unencumbered by mannerism, and Ashley 
Wheater actually managed to make Paris an imposing, noble competitor for 
Juliet's affection. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-working, well-trained corps generated constant admiration, whether 
executing aristocratic rituals, decorating the stage as live scenery or 
clanging with swords and daggers in Marty Pistone's intricate duels. This is an 
ensemble company, in the best sense of the adjective. 
</P>
<P>
 Prokofiev was appreciatively served in the pit, where Denis de Coteau 
demonstrated equal respect for the expressive line of the music and the 
physical needs of the dancers. The responsive 68-piece orchestra, locally 
recruited, enlisted Sidney Weiss as stellar concertmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandiose ballet, the real irrational thing, was back at the Music Center. At 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Romeo and Juliet," presented by the San Francisco Ballet at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion, 135 North Grand Ave. Remaining performances (with differing 
casts) tonight at 8, Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'RED': A STYLISTIC PALETTE OF EMOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for his imposing name, there is little about Polish filmmaker Krzysztof 
Kieslowski that fits the conventional American image of a great director. His 
public statements are spare, his subject matter intimate rather than epic, and 
his interest in anything as flamboyant as a cult of personality is nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as "Red" underscores, Kieslowski is likely the world's most accomplished 
director, that rare artist with a virtuoso's exhilarating grasp of all aspects 
of filmmaking from editing and cinematography to music and acting. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, Kieslowski is the type of master whose hallmark is 
unobtrusiveness, whose skill is the more impressive for its lack of 
self-important posturing. And his interest in narrative, emotion and the human 
condition make his films so accessible it is possible to underestimate how 
accomplished they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming after the invigorating "Blue" and the bitingly comic "White," "Red" is 
the final film in Kieslowski's "Three Colors" trilogy, inspired by the French 
flag and the motto of "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity." Co-written with longtime 
collaborator Krzysztof Piesiewicz, "Red" concentrates on fraternity, on the 
yearning for connection that even the most detached lives are prey to. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple on one level, profound on another, "Red" is also the best kind of adult 
fairy tale, a romance conceived and executed by a pessimist. For when a 
filmmaker as stern and uncompromising as the man who directed "Decalogue" 
decides to tell a story of love and hope, it is bound to be both different and 
convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kieslowski also believes in the importance of coincidence, and "Red" is rife 
with it. A tightly controlled film about the randomness of events, "Red" has as 
a major theme the pivotal role of chance and happenstance in shaping and 
defining its characters' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of things is Valentine (Irene Jacob), a young model living in a 
small apartment in Geneva. Though she is unaware of it, "Red's" elegant camera 
movements reveal that a handsome young man named Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), 
busy with his preparation for exams to be a judge, lives in a similar apartment 
just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 While Auguste has a beautiful blonde girlfriend named Karin (Frederique 
Feder), Valentine is involved in a ticklish phone relationship with a young man 
named Michel who is working outside the country. Fiddling with her car radio 
one night, Valentine hits a dog named Rita. The animal's collar lists an 
address, but returning the wounded Rita is not a simple affair. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rita's owner turns out to be an icily reserved man named Joseph Kern 
(Jean-Louis Trintignant), an unshaven former judge who is both reclusive and 
apparently contemptuous of all feeling. A formidable individual, unapologetic 
about his misanthropy, he coldly tells Valentine he is indifferent to the dog's 
fate and would like nothing so much as for her to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave she does, as disgusted at his attitude as he is at her evident concern 
and generosity. But circumstances bring her back to the judge's house, and 
though nothing conventional is to be expected, one of the accomplishments of 
"Red" is how convincingly it depicts the delicate and highly unlikely emotional 
connection that is forged between these two. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more to Kieslowski's web than that. There is always Auguste, the 
young man who unknowingly lives in the periphery of Valentine's existence, and 
whose own life is gradually revealed to have curious parallels to that of the 
former judge. Kieslowski has dealt with this theme before, most notably in "The 
Double Life of Veronique," which also starred Jacob, but he handles it here 
with lovely delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented naked on a page, "Red's" plot has the potential to sound contrived, 
but the skills of Kieslowski and his team, starting with Zbigniew Preisner's 
ethereal music and Piotr Sobocinski's gliding camera work (which looks 
effortless but at times required hours of work for the briefest shots), obviate 
that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical as well are the remarkable performances of the film's two leads. 
Jacob, a radiant actress with an open, wonderfully expressive face, must have 
served as much as a muse for Kieslowski during filming as she does for Joseph 
Kern in the finished product. And Trintignant, perhaps the preeminent French 
actor of his generation, is faultless opposite her, brittle anti-matter to her 
vibrant matter. 
</P>
<P>
 As with "Blue" and "White," Kieslowski uses this film's title color as a 
visual accent, forcing us to notice the bright red of a car, a Swiss Army 
knife, even a cigarette package. And though all three films stand alone, the 
director couldn't resist a finale that will be most fully understood by viewers 
who've seen the previous pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Kieslowski has also repeated a scene from both of the earlier films, showing 
an old woman vainly trying to stuff a wine bottle into a recycling bin, but 
with a difference. Here, for the first time, someone comes to the woman's aid. 
If "Red" does turn out to be, as Kieslowski claims, his final film as a 
director, there can be no doubt but that he's gone out in brilliant style. 
</P>

 Separation Acknowledged: The Hollywood marriage of actor Richard Gere and 
supermodel Cindy Crawford may be coming to an end. The pair have separated, 
they said in a statement Thursday. "This personal and painful decision was made 
between us in July," they said. "Since that time we have been trying to work 
things out, but due to the recent conjecture in the press, we have decided to 
make a statement at this time." The superstar couple, whose rumored marital 
woes had become fodder for tabloid reports worldwide, were married three years 
ago. Meanwhile, reports about trouble in another celebrity marriage -- the one 
between Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley -- were denied this week by both 
Jackson's publicist and his manager, Bob Jones, who told New York Newsday that 
stories about an alleged breakup were "100% total lie!" STAGE

 Early Christmas Present: The Bilingual Foundation of the Arts has received a 
$250,000 grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development as seed 
money toward a capital campaign that aims to move the theater group from its 
current 99-seat facility in a former jail in Lincoln Heights to a new, 
$3.5-million, 299-seat theater on Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles. 
Bilingual Foundation President Carmen Zapata declined to disclose the exact 
site of the proposed theater, saying negotiations were still in progress. She 
said the federal grant was initiated through Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente).

 Marsalis Septet Disbanding: Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, performing with his 
jazz septet through Sunday at New York's Village Vanguard, announced this week 
that the engagement would mark the influential band's final performances 
together. The breakup was necessitated, a spokeswoman said, by the many other 
activities on Marsalis' plate: He will be spending more time at New York's 
Lincoln Center, where he helps run the jazz program, and he has been 
commissioned to compose a new piece for a chamber music ensemble. Marsalis also 
plans to spend time studying with cultural historian Albert Murray, 
collaborating with other musicians, and perhaps working with a new quartet or a 
big band at Lincoln Center. In the immediate future, his first book: "Sweet 
Swing -- Blues on the Road," a memoir about being on the road with his jazz

 Chung Saved?: Sources at CBS said Thursday that it appears that Connie Chung's

Dan Rather's "48 Hours" will go to Thursday nights. "Northern Exposure" is said 
to be moving to Wednesday nights, while the drama "Chicago Hope" is likely to 
get the coveted Monday night time slot now occupied by "Northern Exposure." CBS 
is expected to announce its schedule changes as early as today, with three and 
possibly four nights of programming affected. Among the prime-time shows 
expected to be added to the network's schedule: four new sitcoms starring Delta 
Burke, Cybill Shepherd, Robert Pastorelli and Valerie Harper, and two new

 Rap Video: An edited version of the controversial video "Natural Born Killaz"

from the video, including re-enactments of the gruesome stabbings of Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, as well as the shotgun ambush of Jose 
and Kitty Menendez. During the making of the video, representatives for the 
families and victims rights groups chastised the rappers for "ridiculing a 
tragedy." An unedited version of the video ran last week on CBS-TV's "Hard

MOVIE REVIEW; 'TOM & VIV': IT'S NOT A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Tom & Viv" is a respectable attempt at a difficult subject. It's about the 
troubled marriage of T.S. Eliot (Willem Dafoe) and his first wife, Vivienne 
Haigh-Wood (Miranda Richardson), and the ways in which the trouble inspired the 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the Michael Hastings stage play and directed by Brian Gilbert, "Tom & 
Viv" creaks. It's in the "Masterpiece Theatre" mode, except it's no 
masterpiece. But once you get past the rather uninspired treatment -- the way 
each scene appears to be hermetically sealed -- the film begins to work anyway. 
Gilbert and Hastings, along with co-screenwriter Adrian Hodges, don't set up 
Tom and Viv as icons. Most Hollywood movies about famous artists show us people 
who knew they were living great and famous lives that one day would be made 
into movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom & Viv" takes almost the opposite approach: The sorrowing lives that we 
see are so miserably confused and painful that the characters seem in danger of 
going up in smoke before our eyes. Vivienne, the free spirit with her battery 
of psychological and physical problems, has lows that cancel out her highs; Tom 
plods through most of the movie like an undertaker at his own funeral. We're 
not exactly in Scott and Zelda country. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom is first introduced to Vivienne at Oxford in 1914, and their courtship is 
freewheeling and a little dizzying for both of them. Clearly Tom is enraptured 
by her manic gambols, and it's pretty funny watching this musty man attempting 
to keep up with her. But when he leaves Oxford to elope with her, their 
honeymoon turns into a nightmarish episode that sets the tone for a marriage 
that lasted more than 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Vivienne's long-term suffering with an out-of-control menstrual cycle, coupled 
with the toxicity of her prescribed medications, keeps her spinning more and 
more into mania as the years progress. Along with her brother, Maurice (Tim 
Dutton), who narrates the film, Tom finally commits her to an asylum in 1936. 
(She died in 1947.) 
</P>
<P>
 The pathos of the marriage is counterbalanced by the ardor that fired it. The 
filmmakers' approach is evenhanded: They don't assign blame to either Tom or 
Vivienne for what happened. (If anything, they blame the medical authorities 
who failed to diagnose the biophysical nature of Viv's mental imbalance.) Even 
when we observe Vivienne puttering in placid comfort in the asylum, still 
adoring the husband who hasn't communicated with her in 10 years, it's 
impossible to affix blame. Perhaps that's because in Tom's deep-set eyes we can 
see the weight of remorse and sadness -- and the love -- that Vivienne still 
inspires in him. 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers want to present Vivienne as Tom's angel -- his muse. And here 
the movie begins to stretch its good will. Much is made of how she "understood" 
his poetry, how she came up with the title for "The Wasteland." The pathos of 
their marriage is translated into Tom's inspiration -- and that's a pretty 
shaky formulation. It's also offensively reductive: The correspondence between 
an artist's inner life and his outer one is far too complicated and 
discontinuous for such a treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 And it's particularly dubious in the case of T.S. Eliot because he was a 
sufferer from way back -- his first poem, written when he was 9, was about the 
sadness of returning each Monday to school. The greatness of a poem like "The 
Wasteland" takes in so much of the modern condition (even now) that the film's 
attempt to scrunch its meanings into the framework of a bad marriage seems 
foolish. Sometimes the high brow on this film is set awfully low. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Bertrand (Bertie) Russell and a few cameos from 
Bloomsbury types like Virginia Woolf, "Tom & Viv" seems distinctly 
underpopulated with great and famous names. The filmmakers want to focus on the 
marriage, but the narrowness doesn't do justice to the other influences in 
Eliot's life -- Ezra Pound, for example, who rescued the poet and his art many 
times, is nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Dafoe does surprisingly well as Eliot, though it's such a reactive role that 
most of the time he's virtually immobile. Dafoe actually resembles -- or is 
made to resemble -- Eliot in all his whorled, fluted handsomeness. He has a 
shadowed gravity that goes well with the poetry. But the stand-out performances 
belong to Richardson and to Rosemary Harris as Vivienne's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris gives such delicacy and understanding to her role that it transforms 
the movie's meanings. At first, the character she is playing seems stuffy and 
over-refined but then we see that the stuffiness is a camouflage for her 
caring. Her lifelong concern for Vivienne is in her every gesture; she's 
infinitely tolerant of her daughter's upsets and yet they drag her way down. 
It's a great, valiant small performance. 
</P>
<P>
 And Richardson, who played the role in a BBC radio dramatization, is superb. 
She doesn't go hog-wild in her ups and downs -- even at her giddiest we can 
spot Vivienne's suffering, and her despair carries a trace of jest. Vivienne's 
unquenchable love for Tom seems, finally, heroic. Richardson shows us the sane, 
composed, ardent woman that was nestling inside Vivienne all along. 
</P>
<P>

bloody menstruation sequence and scenes of madness.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; WILLIAMS' SONGWRITING PROWESS STANDS OUT AT ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victoria Williams is probably best known for last year's album "Sweet Relief," 
a benefit record to assist the singer-songwriter's fight with multiple 
sclerosis and her efforts to establish health care for uninsured musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, featuring such artists as the Lemonheads, Pearl Jam and Soul 
Asylum interpreting her songs, brought Williams' music to the larger 
alternative rock world, but the Louisiana native's down-home songs -- many 
about growing up in the South -- have been acclaimed in smaller camps for 
nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the first of two sold-out nights at the Roxy, the Los 
Angeles-based Williams showed that her tunes are often more palatable when done 
by others. Her gratingly high and awkward voice made for tough listening, 
though her quirky persona and odd pitches did make the set all the more 
personal and image-evoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a loose frock and tattered boots, Williams applied her cartoonish 
Southern accent to her own material and such standards as "Moon River" and 
"What a Wonderful World," accompanying herself on piano and guitar while a band 
that grew as large as eight members added a rich backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum, whose version of "Summer of Drugs" was one of the 
biggest hits from "Sweet Relief," joined her for three strong songs, then 
Williams' husband Mark Olson, of the country-rock band the Jayhawks, joined her 
for the finest moments of the two-hour show. The two shot the songs to a 
pinnacle of emotion and harmony, exposing the utter warmth of Williams' 
songwriting. LORRAINE ALI

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: DOWNTOWN SONORA CAFE STEPS INTO MIDTOWN CITY'S SHOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about the time City Restaurant's Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger were 
ready to throw in the towel, Ron Salisbury was considering relocating his 
popular downtown Southwest restaurant, the Original Sonora Cafe. The space was 
right.A deal was struck. And now "the new" Sonora Cafe has moved into City's 
cavernous La Brea quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Salisbury could have introduced a few well-placed cactus plants, splashed some 
color onto the bare concrete walls and left it at that. But no, he went for a 
major renovation. The Southwest mise-en-scene now includes a huge fireplace 
with lizards hugging the sides, a copper-trimmed staircase descending from on 
high, chandeliers as big as Ferris wheels and chairs so oversized you feel like 
Alice after she swallowed the incredible shrinking pill -- or indulged in one 
too many of the Sonora's potent margaritas. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu has made the move intact and reads word for word like the original. 
Yes, they've still got skinny chile-dusted onion rings, chile relleno in a blue 
corn jacket and roast duck glazed with sticky sweet pomegranate-tequila sauce. 
It doesn't look as if they've gentrified the "cowboy-cut" Black Angus rib chop, 
weighing in at 18 ounces, any either. But will the fancy squirt work with the 
sauces and dishes like quesadilla stuffed with brie and apple-smoked bacon 
impress the new neighborhood as much as it did the young downtown set? Stay 
tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sonora Cafe, 180 S. La Brea, Los Angeles. (213) 857-1800. Open Monday 
through Saturday for dinner; Monday through Friday for lunch and Saturday for 
brunch. Major credit cards accepted. Valet parking. Appetizers $5.75-$8.75; 
entrees $10.75-$21.95.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A TRIO OF ITALIAN PICKS ON MELROSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The liveliest stretch of Melrose Avenue, between La Brea and Fairfax, bears an 
almost uncanny number of inexpensive Italian cafes that draw on the 
inexhaustible stream of foot traffic. Passing by dozens if not hundreds of 
times, I always wondered: Does each have its own ambience and specialties or, 
as one person joked, are they all fed by a single central kitchen? Recently, I 
parked to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tavola Calda, which replaces Rosso e Nero, is the new kid on the block. There 
are only a few tables outside, but inside, the vast post-modern cavern with 
blond truss, black duct work and cement floors could swallow the largest, 
hungriest crowd. During lunch, there's an attractive antipasto buffet: all you 
can eat for $8.95 -- three different zucchini dishes, four eggplant dishes, and 
a few other salads and vegetables steeped in olive oil. Hot offerings include 
tasty meatballs and penne marinara. 
</P>
<P>
 A dinner visit gives less satisfaction. The best thing we order is the "snow 
white" pizza, soft white cheeses and rosemary on a yeasty crust. The salads -- 
tricolore and fried goat cheese on roasted red pepper -- are made with fresh 
ingredients, but suffer from flavorless olive oil. Sauteed porcini on polenta 
taste as if they've been marinated in lighter fluid. A dispirited fettuccine 
with fresh vegetables tastes as if it has been stewed in dishwater. Both a 
clumsy apple tart and rubbery chocolate cake are way too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A block and a half to the west, Corleone's has an antiqued, battered look 
that's partly faux, partly the result of hard use. Sit outside, day or night -- 
by the heaters. Inside, there are cold cement floors, open doors and no 
heaters. Brrrr! 
</P>
<P>
 A quick bite at lunch -- say, Corleone's "traditional" pizza with pepperoni, 
mushrooms and a medium-thin crust -- evokes pizza-studded college days. Dinner 
gives less cause for fond sentiment. Our waitress is helpful and terrific: Too 
bad her charm can't perk up the food. A Caesar salad with fried calamari seems 
dressed solely in vegetable oil. A "gourmet" pizza of roast garlic and shrimp 
is a rubbery deluge of bland cheese and tasteless shrimp on underdone crust -- 
with nary a clove of roast garlic. Such omission may be habitual: "Pasta de la 
Mamma," described as "Fresh linguine in our special lemon, black pepper and 
rosemary white sauce with a grilled chicken breast," is gummy spaghetti in 
cream without discernible lemon or rosemary, and a well-peppered chicken 
breast. Two teeny lamb chops, ordered medium rare, are so well done, they have 
a black crust. 
</P>
<P>
 We're freezing, the same Sade tape is playing for the fourth time. No dessert, 
thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, Cafe Luna is a busy, well-established 
scene. We trail in behind a couple in matching fedoras, and a twentysomething 
kid nudging his dazed parents to a table. Walls are sponged the color of old 
blood and cluttered with pictures, handbills, shelves of dusty gee gaws. At 
dinner time, the patio out back is open -- and blissfully free from street 
noise. Set-your-own tables also bear cups of crayons. (The best scribblings 
paper the bathroom walls.) 
</P>
<P>
 Again, we're reminded of college hangouts: The menu is vast, the kitchen fast. 
A large, fresh tricolore salad wears a decent vinaigrette -- and should, at 
$8.50. Pizzas, even the simple Margherita, are freighted with cheese, but crust 
and sauce are just fine. Pastas are iffy: Buckwheat pasta with mushrooms, 
olives and fresh tomatoes has a very low flavor quotient. The normally raucous 
puttanesca is here a watery mix of tomato sauce, olives and capers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cappuccino would taste better if it weren't lukewarm. A big slice of apple pie 
is irresistible, but the poppyseed cake has spent too much time uncovered in 
the cold case.

JAZZ NOTES: AFTER 20 YEARS, CHARLES LLOYD TO PLAY L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Lloyd would be a perfect subject for one of those "Where Are They 
Now?" stories. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor saxophonist was one of jazz's biggest stars in the late '60s, riding 
a wave of fame generated by such albums as "Forest Flower" and heralded 
appearances at such rock venues as the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco. 
His quartet, featuring the emerging pianist Keith Jarrett, was bringing Lloyd 
financial success, too. "I was making some serious bucks in 1969," about 
$250,000 a year, the saxophonist said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 But as his star was burning brightly, Lloyd stopped performing and beat a 
surprising and hasty retreat from the jazz world, sequestering himself first in 
a home in the Malibu Colony, then later on the Big Sur coast of Northern 
California (and finally in Montecito). He says now the death of his mother at 
the age of 54 -- Lloyd was 30 at the time -- was instrumental in his abrupt 
lifestyle change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked away from a gold mine, but that wasn't the most important thing in 
my life to me," he said in a telephone interview from Montecito, where he lives 
most of the time, while still maintaining a home in Big Sur. "The inner call 
was so strong that I realized that if I didn't deal with it, no amount of bread 
would make up for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd makes his first Los Angeles nightclub appearance in more than 20 years 
Tuesday through Dec. 12, when he performs with pianist Cedar Walton's trio 
(bassist David Williams and drummer Billy Higgins) at Catalina Bar & Grill in 
Hollywood. He says during his seclusion, which lasted until the mid-1980s, he 
had not intended to return to active playing. But an unexpected visit from 
then-unknown French pianist Michel Petrucciani put a damper on his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This little Buddha in a small package showed up at my doorstep," said Lloyd, 
referring to the diminutive Petrucciani, who has a rare bone disease. Lloyd 
formed a quartet that spotlighted Petrucciani, but after a couple of years, and 
some albums released on Blue Note Records, the saxophonist felt he wanted to 
return to his life of solitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd formed a quartet that spotlighted Petrucciani, but after a couple of 
years and some albums released on Blue Note Records, the saxophonist felt he 
wanted to return to his life of solitude. But Lloyd says he couldn't. "I was 
lonely. I missed something about the life. That applause is like a narcotic."  
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd says he felt like coming back in earnest in 1989, when he made "Fish Out 
of Water," his first of three ECM albums. "It had been many years since I made 
a record I felt so personal about," he said. "Something wonderful happened for 
me there, and I hope for the listeners." 
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist says playing with Higgins at Catalina's will be like a 
homecoming. "When I was in school, we used to play at all-night jam sessions," 
Lloyd said. "Billy always had an incredible swinging quality. He inspires you, 
and I've always loved that about him."

 Club Caravan: For Ken Poston, the most important aspect of KLON-FM's Jazz 
Caravan isn't the money, though it's turned out to be a good fund-raiser for 
the nonprofit Long Beach station. No, it's that people show up who might 
otherwise never go to a jazz club, says the producer of the event, which will 
be held Tuesday at 16 Los Angeles area jazz clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The caravan shuttles fans by bus around town to such clubs as the Jazz Bakery 
in Culver City, Chadney's in Burbank and Fifth Street Dick's in Los Angeles. 
The event costs $10 in advance, and $15 if you buy your pass on the night of 
the caravan -- all club admissions are included and none of the rooms has a 
drink minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 This season's caravan is noteworthy for the high caliber of the artists 
performing and the fact that clubs in the Crenshaw district are being included 
for the first time. Fans will be able to see the B Sharp Jazz Quartet at the 
World Stage, Phil Vieux at Fifth Street Dick's and Larry Gales and the Howlett 
Smith band at Marla's. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of young musicians in town and many of them are playing in 
these clubs," said Poston. "I think it's important that people get a good idea 
of the club scene as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, on the caravan, Art Farmer plays at the Jazz Bakery, SuperSax and 
pianist Ross Tompkins are at Miceli's in Hollywood, Conte Candoli is performing 
at Club Brasserie in West Hollywood and Barbara Morrison sings at B. B. King's 
in Universal City.

 Still Sharp: With its debut album selling pretty solidly, the L.A.-based B 
Sharp Jazz Quartet is looking forward to more touring, both on the East and 
West Coasts. "In September, we played at Blues Alley in Washington, and in 
Baltimore," says Herb Graham Jr., the band's drummer and co-leader (with 
reedman Randall Willis). "But we haven't played New York yet. It's hard for a 
West Coast band to get established in New York, but we're trying." 
</P>
<P>
 B Sharp, along with Strangefruit and the Watts Prophets, appears on Saturday, 
8 p.m., in a free concert at UCLA's Wadsworth Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In April or May, the band hopes to head to Europe, hopefully playing France, 
Belgium and Italy. "It'll be a low-budget tour, but it will be good to get over 
there," Graham says.

THEATER BEAT: THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO 'MEMOIRS OF JESUS' AT MATRIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What if Christ had kept a diary? Harry Cornelius Cronin's one-man drama 
"Memoirs of Jesus" at the Matrix Theatre proposes that he did exactly that. In 
the olive grove shortly before his arrest and crucifixion, Jesus reflects on 
his life, the duality of his human/divine nature and the bitter destiny he now 
faces. "How did I come to this place? I'm a man who likes to look at the 
stars." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cronin's conception, Christ is first and foremost a man, one who comes 
slowly to the realization of his own miraculous power and who ever after 
struggles to balance his ordinariness with his divinity. The strict 
fundamentalist will breathe fire at Cronin's dramatic license with such 
scriptural matters. This Christ is in open conflict with his mother, Mary, a 
dogmatist who deplores her son's association with lowly fishermen. This Christ 
yearns for people to pray naked, stripped of artifice and fancy trappings. This 
Christ cures a leper, only to later see that same man engaged in an act of 
unspeakable brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cronin's play is thoughtful and respectful, if not always inspired. 
Andrew Robinson, who plays Jesus, goes a long way toward smoothing over 
Cronin's occasional missteps, such as the interruptive passage in which Mary 
Magdalene gives Jesus her philosophical take on worldly love. Portraying Jesus 
Christ ranks among the most difficult and potentially damning of acting 
assignments, yet under the capable direction of Angela Paton, Robinson renders 
a Christ at once gentle and tormented, full of passion, longing and 
soulfulness. Robinson's performance, coupled with Cronin's flashes of genuine 
insight, make for a worthy -- and at times, divine -- evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Memoirs of Jesus," Matrix Theatre, 7657 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles. 
Mondays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Dec. 13. $12. (213) 852-1445. Running time: 1 
hour, 5 minutes. 'Tanglin Hearts' Also Tangles Story Line 
</P>
<P>
 "Tanglin' Hearts," a country-Western musical at Theatre 40 very loosely based 
on Shakespeare's "As You Like It," has some toe-tapping numbers and a few 
engaging performances. However, these factors can't compensate for the feeling 
of being trapped in a "Hee Haw" rerun. 
</P>
<P>
 Zora Margolis wrote the lyrics, Peter Spelman the music. Despite uneven voices 
and deadening acoustics, the show features some bona fide chart-busters that 
would be right at home in a Clint Black roadshow. If only the plot were as 
contemporary.  
</P>
<P>
 Folksy aphorisms result in a few genuine yocks ("If wishes was fishes, we'd 
have us a fry"), but the desultory book by Margolis and Charlotte Houghton is 
more a series of music cues than a sustained story. Jan O'Connor's halting 
direction is a sorry failing in a show that cries out for briskness and glitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the cast, Gene Ross plays a monumentally dastardly villain who could 
give J.R. Ewing a good name. Drawling and droll Lori Thimsen makes comic hay as 
an over-the-hill roadhouse proprietress. Cliff Berens plays the perennial 
underdog with moronic panache; jaws don't get much slacker than this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tanglin' Hearts" wouldn't make such a bad cast album. If only there were more 
of a show tucked in around the music. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tanglin' Hearts," Theatre 40, 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills. 
Sundays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Dec. 13. $10. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 
hours, 25 minutes. 'Love Talker' Slips at Theatre 1761 
</P>
<P>
 Combine the mythological elements of Euripides' "The Bacchae" with the steamy 
sexual allegory of Christina Rosetti's "Goblin Market" and you'll have some 
idea of what Deborah Pryor's folk fable "The Love Talker" at Theatre 1761 is 
all about. Unfortunately, Pryor's classical story structure and frequently 
poetical language are vitiated by her risible regionalism and her 
unintentionally parodic portrayal of hill folk. 
</P>
<P>
 The placid pastoral existence of Bun (Colleen Cochran) and her younger sister 
Gowdie (Ebba-Marie Gendron) is shattered when Gowdie wanders into the forbidden 
woods, where she falls under the sway of the goat-god (Donald Wayne Jarman) who 
dwells there. Gripped with lust, Gowdie persistently conjures the spirit, while 
the prudish Bun just as determinedly tries to cast out and destroy the 
seductive entity. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Bun later learns to her everlasting sorrow, you don't mess with Mother 
Nature -- or the god Pan for that matter. Gowdie's bacchantic revels culminate 
in a blood sacrifice, while the spirit of the wood and his puckish bacchante 
(Toni Hood) look on. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a great deal of sophistication to play callow characters, and this 
youthful cast, although sincere, is hard-pressed to mitigate the excesses of 
Pryor's backwoods dialect. Instead of firmly grounding his performers in 
reality, heightened though it may be, director Robert Houston Broyles plays up 
the parody, leaving Pryor's play stranded in the dark of the moon with no dawn 
in sight.

THEATER BEAT: 'SCIENCE, PRIMITIVES' SURPRISES AT TOWNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the name suggests, "Science and the Primitives" at the Towne Street Theatre 
tackles the clash of cultural and philosophical opposites but in unexpected 
ways.  
</P>
<P>
 When an idealistic but naive explorer (Mark Laing) sets out in 1885 to 
establish his Utopian vision in the wilds of South America, he embodies the era 
of Western imperialism with its pre-Freudian faith in the supremacy of 
rationality. The stage seems set for a lesson in multicultural tolerance as he 
gets his comeuppance at the hands of the savages he hopes to civilize. 
</P>
<P>
 But playwright Bernardo Solano is after less predictable quarry. The would-be 
conqueror soon finds himself trapped in a remote cave, where his journey takes 
a more inward path. Mixing elements of Indian mythology and archetypal 
psychology in a highly stylized allegory, the play becomes a surreal descent 
through the psychic muck beneath the veneer of reason. From the hero's initial 
imbalance, his quest leads him through chaos, psychic dismemberment, 
reconnection with the soul and eventual rebirth in "a timeless age with a truer 
nature." Picture "On the Verge" meets Carlos Casteneda, and you've got the 
idea.  
</P>
<P>
 Raf Mauro's staging for this ambitious material makes good use of his 
agreeable ensemble's talents but shows the telltale symptoms of 
metaphysics-on-a-budget, with an abundance of leotard-clad performers 
proclaiming "I am Flame burning in the sea" and whatnot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Galici is an engaging presence as the play's sarcastic blind narrator, 
while Nancy Renee proves sympathetic as the hero's Indian mate. Also featuring 
versatile Sandra Lora and Jonathan Craig Williams, the cast cycles through 
multiple roles as the hero's spiritual allies and opponents, including a 
soaring eagle, a sensual serpent, a sinister jaguar and a crafty bat. Looks 
like all those "become-an-animal" exercises in acting class turned out to be a 
good investment after all. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Science and the Primitives," Towne Street Theatre, 799 South Towne Ave., 
Los Angeles. Sundays, 2:30 p.m. Ends Dec. 18. $15. (213) 466-1767. Running 
time: 2 hours. 'Mayfly' Takes Look at Broken Families 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the antique clutter of a former stagecoach-depot-turned-private 
sanctuary, an unlikely stab at intimacy brings momentary clarity to the chaotic 
lives of a lonely recluse and a self-absorbed slacker in Judy Montague's "Dance 
of the Mayfly." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner in Attic Theatre Ensemble's 2nd Annual New Plays Festival, this 
tightly constructed drama is a serious-minded meditation on splintered families 
and their legacy of alienation. What it needs, however, is a point of entree 
for audience sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-aged protagonist (Gil Johnson) tries to keep his mind on learning 
something about the mother who abandoned him. Seeking answers from her one-time 
friend (Susan Hochtman) -- a sullen, inflexible crank who refuses to go to her 
own mother's 70th birthday party -- he improbably ends up having an affair with 
her instead. The characters' emotional trajectories are less distinct than the 
plot logistics in Mitch Beer's staging, which never manages to make these two 
-- or any of their dysfunctional friends and relations -- particularly likable.

MUSIC REVIEW; SOME MEDIEVAL MARVELS AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Representing all that is best, rather than merely facile and trendy, in the 
current revival of interest in medieval music, the five-member Ensemble Project 
Ars Nova brought slices of 14th- and 15th-Century culture to life at Ambassador 
Auditorium on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The American group takes its name from a 14th-Century musical treatise, "Ars 
Nova" (New Art), emblematic of an era of extraordinary musical inventiveness 
and complexity brought about in part by new systems of musical notation. Which 
hardly means that resurrecting the lush polyphony of that time is as easy as 
reading notes off a page. It still involves a good deal of inspired guesswork 
from its most convincing practitioners, among which this superbly equipped 
quintet surely ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The three vocalists, soprano Laurie Monahan, countertenor Michael Collver (who 
also played the antique cornetto with remarkable control) and John Fleagle, a 
high baritone who took the minstrel's part by accompanying himself on a small 
harp, deliver with unfailing intensity and something approaching uncanny 
intonational accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the evening, from the opening, heartbreaking "Iherusalem, 
Iherusalem," with Collver's ethereally pure tones counterpoised by Monahan's 
ripe, unquestionably feminine ones, to the final group of songs of the 
Sephardic Jews of Spain, with splendid licks for fiddler (playing rebec and 
vielle) Shira Kammen and lutenist Crawford Young, these artists conveyed 
matters universal and immediate rather than esoteric and ancient. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, thematically dedicated to "Pilgrims and Pilgrimage Routes" to 
Jerusalem, offered as well a generous sampling of the powerfully communicative 
art of such masters of the time as Francesco Landini and Guillaume Dufay, and 
the various Anons who contributed to the richness of the French court of 
Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow us to suggest, however, that Ensemble Project Ars Nova pay some 
attention to its written and spoken presentations: The skimpy printed notes 
told us next to nothing about the composers or their milieu, and while Fleagle 
may sing like a dream, his halting spoken explanations provided more puzzlement 
than clarification. HERBERT GLASS

FROM THE HEART; SONGWRITERS CIRCLE' AT THE PALOMINO SHOWCASES ARTISTS FIRMLY 
ROOTED IN THE ACOUSTIC TRADITION OF AMERICAN MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly 
about music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The small crowd beneath the soft stage lights of the Palomino is sitting 
shoulder to shoulder right now. And among the five singer-songwriters is Judy 
Toy, in denim vest and jeans. She is strumming an acoustic guitar in the 
lilting style of an old country waltz. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice is a brave quiver as she sings: "Take me dancing by the river / Wipe 
the tear from my eye . . . before you say goodby."  
</P>
<P>
 Those around her are also holding guitars, and soon she's inspired some 
unrehearsed accompaniment from two of them -- host Muffin and Steve Hill, the 
author of at least five No. 1 country hits during the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sort of musical moment that demands attention and is just the kind of 
thing Palomino owner Sherry Thomas listens to while alone in her car. "To hear 
someone sing something they wrote from the heart -- it just gives me the 
chills," Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
 That feeling ultimately led Thomas to establish "Songwriters Circle" on Sunday 
nights at the club, an evening modeled partly after her memories of those at 
Nashville's Bluebird Cafe, where it's acoustic songwriter night every night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The songwriter is so unrecognized," says Thomas, who traveled to Nashville 
twice a year in the '70s and early '80s with her late husband, Palomino 
co-founder Tommy Thomas, an original member of the Country Music Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly songwriter showcase, which will probably move to Wednesday nights 
in January, is another step in returning the Palomino to its position as the 
West Coast venue for American-roots music. In bygone days, stretching back to 
the club's opening in the 1940s, artists from Johnny Cash to Linda Ronstadt 
were regulars on this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like it's classical," Thomas says of the acoustic country 
performed at the songwriters showcase. "It's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 For singer-guitarist Wesley James, who is more accustomed to performing with a 
full country band, the solo acoustic experience leaves him feeling "naked," he 
says. "I was waiting for the band to kick in, and the band's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 "I get an audience," adds Cody Bryant, a country and bluegrass artist. "I get 
to hear good songs. I get inspiration. There's a special charge when you get up 
there. It's also a great way to see how songs go over." 
</P>
<P>
 Early this night, Muffin dedicates his first song to Thomas, who watches much 
of the show smiling from behind the bar. Wearing a New York Yankees cap and 
jersey, he sings: "I met her at the Palomino / She drove down from Mendocino, 
to that honky-tonk I love to play."  
</P>
<P>
 Muffin, whose real name is Jim Caputo Yessian, first performed at the Palomino 
in 1975, when he tied with actor-comedian Jim Varney (now of "Ernest" movie 
fame) for first prize on talent night. He also remembers watching a sold-out 
late-'70s performance by Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt get nearly shut down 
by fire marshals for overcrowding. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who was sitting in 
the audience, had to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until this year that the Bronx-born Muffin landed at the 
Palomino as a continuing presence. Besides hosting the "Songwriters Circle," he 
also helps Thomas wade through the dozens of CDs, tapes and promotional 
packages that arrive in the mail for the club owner every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would probably go up there and do it even if there was no audience," 
Muffin says of the weekly showcases, where artists are not paid for their 
performances. "We just love to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Muffin (who earned his nickname as a 10-year-old for having a round, 
muffin-shaped face) says that several songwriters who have met on the show have 
begun collaborating on songs. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of atmosphere seemed not to exist at all when Toy first arrived in 
Los Angeles from Oregon about six years ago. The old Los Angeles folk rock 
scene that had Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, the Eagles and others hanging out at 
such local clubs as the Troubadour and Palomino had long since disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 So for more than three years, Toy ended up playing lead guitar with an active 
alternative rock band called the Creamers, which subsequently recorded several 
independent records. "For me as a songwriter and a singer, (the rock 'n' roll 
genre) just wasn't where I wanted to be," she says now. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, acoustic music has found a place again on the Los 
Angeles music scene. That's manifest in all the acoustic showcases at small 
clubs and coffeehouses scattered across the city. None of these, though, have 
the weight of the Palomino's history. "You're on stage with the ghosts of 
everyone who has ever played up there," Muffin says. 
</P>
<P>
 To add credibility to "Songwriters Circle," he is trying to interest some 
major folk and country artists to sit in occasionally among the featured 
performers. And he'll continue to mix new artists with those who have earned 
more professional credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to share the stage with other singer-songwriters, Toy says, 
"is inspiring. It helps me to learn about the craft of songwriting. Everybody 
has their own approach to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting next to her during the performance tonight is Hill, who has written 
songs for the Desert Rose Band, the Dillards, Roy Rogers and others. He also 
has his own band, which performs at clubs throughout Ventura County, but says 
he is attracted to the Palomino showcase for the special attention the songs 
are given. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People listen," says Hill, who began his career as a songwriter in 1972 with 
the encouragement of his roommate at the time, songwriter Rodney Crowell. "A 
good song always breaks down to acoustic guitar and a vocal. If it works that 
way, then you've got something." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Toy: "The job of a song is to take people somewhere. If you really move 
the audience then your job is done." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill believes that the success of the acoustic-based "MTV Unplugged" series of 
television performances and albums is no accident. "There's something about 
playing music on wood that's thrilling," says Hill, who for a time led an act 
called the Slingshot Band, which recorded an album for Polygram in 1982. 
"There's nowhere to hide. You have your own soul in the palm of your hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Songwriting is kind of a lonely business," he continues. "It's nice to take 
that feeling you had writing it in your living room, not colored up with 
electric guitars, and bring it here. It's like holding your baby." Where and 
When

TIME FOR TWO LOVES; VERSATILE TIM RUSS PLANS TO CONTINUE PLAYING JAZZ GUITAR 
WHILE JOINING THE NEW 'STAR TREK: VOYAGER' SERIES.

<P>
 Look to Woody Allen for inspiration. The actor-director and funnyman is the 
winner of more Academy Awards than he cares to pick up, recognized around the 
world. And yet every Monday night he's just another clarinet player with a club 
gig, his fame at least temporarily irrelevant, forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 For actor-musician Tim Russ, that escape must be paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Russ is a celebrity. At least not until Jan. 16, when he debuts as a 
Vulcan crew member in the new "Star Trek: Voyager" television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, if the show is successful, Russ and the rest of the cast may become the 
targets of mountains of letters, E-mail, interview requests and other demands 
on their time. Still, Russ also wants to be sure to get out with his guitar 
every now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings up the example of Allen, and his love of jazz. "If he can do it 
with a schedule like he's got, on a regular basis, then I have all the hope in 
the world that I can do it at least on a semi-regular basis," Russ says. "I do 
enjoy the playing." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Russ brings his mix of jazz and pop standards Sunday night to 
Common Grounds coffeehouse in Northridge. Performing material from sources as 
varied as Duke Ellington and James Taylor, singer-guitarist Russ will be joined 
by drummer Jim Martin and keyboardist Claude Voisy, a former music director for 
Cirque du Soleil. Singer Rita Wolf will also join the trio for selected songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that his income seems -- at least temporarily -- secure with the new 
series, Russ sees his music primarily as a personal release. He's been playing 
professionally since he was 16, years before he became an actor. He arrived in 
Los Angeles in 1981 after attending college in the Midwest, and quickly began 
playing Westside clubs as part of a band called From the Hip. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1983, he was mixing music with acting through a role in the Los Angeles 
production of "Dream Girls," starring Jennifer Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Subsequently, I haven't played full time since I started working full time as 
an actor," Russ says. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared in a modern version of "Romeo and Juliet" performed in 1993 on the 
CBS Studio Center lot in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his work, however, has been in television, although largely in 
short-lived series. In 1986, he played the sidekick in the futuristic action 
series "Highwayman." The next year he was in a sitcom called "The People Next 
Door." He also appeared in several pilots that never made the jump to series. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All along, Russ flirted with the "Star Trek" universe. He considers himself a 
major fan of the original series, and in the mid-'80s he read for the role that 
went to LeVar Burton in "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Russ also read for a 
part on "Deep Space Nine" that was ultimately written out of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally won a guest spot on "The Next Generation" (after several tries), 
and appears in the opening segment of the new "Star Trek Generations" movie. 
</P>
<P>
 His TV role as a Vulcan tactical officer on a lost starship has kept him busy 
since September. By the time he arrives at Common Grounds on Sunday, Russ will 
have filmed Episode 4 of the new series, which is set to air locally on KCOP-TV 
(Channel 13). 
</P>
<P>
 But Russ is determined to find time for his music. "I could put all this stuff 
in mothballs, sell all my equipment and never play again," he says. "Or I can 
do this, and go on and keep it alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go to hear someone playing, I want to play. I just can't see 
myself saying 'Oh, I used to play' 10 years from now. 'I used to have a band.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Russ understands that his participation in the new series may attract 
hard-core fans of "Star Trek" who might not otherwise come to hear him play. 
"As long as they can appreciate something that we're doing up there, I think 
I'll be happy," he says. "Even if they are into 'Star Trek,' I know they listen 
to music sometimes." Where and When

A LINK TO THE PAST; TIES TO WOMEN'S 'CULTURAL HISTORY' ARE EXPLORED IN AN 
EXHIBIT AT PIERCE COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 One can identify with and appreciate the essence of an artwork in and of 
itself without any knowledge of an art ist's life. But often one can also learn 
a lot about an artist from an artwork, because art is really inseparable from 
the person who created it. 
</P>
<P>
 For its annual members' show this year, the Southern California Women's Caucus 
for Art set out to organize an exhibit of work that would represent a variety 
of women's voices, cultural identities and experiences. The group -- part of a 
national organization of more than 3,500 members -- asked Amalia Mesa-Baines, 
an artist and a writer and lecturer on Latino art, to curate the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a person that a lot of women look up to," said Anita Holguin, the 
local organization's president. "She's well-known for promoting cultural 
awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Mesa-Baines selected 31 works -- paintings, prints, mixed media, sculpture and 
photography -- by 14 artists for the show, entitled "Living Links to Cultural 
Images." It is on view in Pierce College's Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of the show is that we are our past, we are extensions of our past," 
said gallery director Joan Kahn. "The art is an extension of that cultural 
history, in respect to the individual artist. You just can't escape the fact 
that (your) art is you. These are pieces that the artists felt really 
represented their cultural history." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the artists' backgrounds may be different, common themes run through 
several works on display. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Gage's very large silk painting "Mother Dreaming" portrays a dynamic 
woman connected to her baby by an umbilical cord. Gage has infused this mother 
figure with boundless energy through her robust illustration of the female 
form, her use of bold colors and the small images of everyday objects that seem 
to be floating within the woman's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn, pointing out the effort and skill necessary to paint on silk and to do 
so in such detail, said: "Each little bit is virtuosic. As a whole, it becomes 
this great image." 
</P>
<P>
 Vibiana Aparicio-Chamberlin presents two other more delicate views of 
motherhood in her prints "Madrecita" and "Virgen Negra." The elegant sculpture 
"Cast Iron Virgin" by Darlene Nguyen-Ely is primarily wood, but the Virgin's 
halo and ladder-like wings are made of iron. Perhaps Nguyen-Ely intends to 
comment on the mettle needed to fulfill the role of the saintly mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Decker used glass pieces and other found objects to build her petite, 
earthly "Angel" sculpture. Her considerably bigger "Altar" incorporates 
cast-off surfboards to make a statement about California culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop culture meets religion head-on in Simone Gad's mixed-media piece, "All 
This and Madonna." 
</P>
<P>
 Adorning an image of a young Elvis Presley on stage, with fans thrusting 
themselves toward him, are sequins, a pot of plastic flowers, a deck of "The 
Best of Elvis" playing cards and a framed Madonna and Child image. With breezy, 
broad brush strokes of paint, Gad unites all these elements to make a wry 
commentary on our culture's penchant for idol worship. 
</P>
<P>
 In a different vein, Nancy Webber finds similarities in the faces of ordinary, 
contemporary people and those who lived long ago. She does this by creating 
works that feature side-by-side photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her "Olmec Head / Juan Manuel Munoz" pairs her photo of a stone Olmec head 
with her shot of a worker at a Cancun hotel. "Mayan Musician / Lihiu Zhang" 
juxtaposes the musician with the likeness of a Ph.D. candidate at USC's School 
of Cinema-TV. The resemblances of the two faces in each work would be 
remarkable even if they weren't separated by many centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists represented in the show: Linda Arreola, Nancy A. Jones, Rosalyn 
Mesquita, Alyce Quinonez-Rodriguez, Masako Takahashi, Thelma Toles and Rosa M.

DREAMING OF A DARK CHRISTMAS; PLAYWRIGHT MARION GALLO ASSEMBLES AN UNATTRACTIVE 
CLAN AT A HOLIDAY DINNER IN HER GRIM COMEDY 'HOME FIRE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes frequently about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When asked where in the world she dredged up the violent, foul-mouthed and 
foul-minded family at the center of her play "Home Fire," playwright-director 
Marion Gallo gives one of those pained, did-you-really-have- 
to-ask-that-question expressions. Looking for a second as if she has gulped 
down her entire salad whole, Gallo pauses in a booth at a Universal City 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I put this?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Her hesitation is quite understandable. The Baldasari family is one ugly clan. 
Rocco is freely cheating on wife Rita, and their two children, Andrea and 
Bobby, fill their hours insulting everyone and each other. Rocco's brother 
Danny is terrorized by his mother Mary's emotional manipulations, while Danny's 
wife, Laura, tries to psychoanalyze it all. "Home Fire," opening tonight at 
Theatre West, puts all of these people, and more, under the same roof for a 
Christmas dinner that might be Lucifer's version of Noel. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's best to assume that Gallo imagined all the bile and madness and 
scatology that course through her very black comedy, she didn't. Without going 
into much more detail, she says, "This family lives and breathes in Brooklyn. 
Are they going to read this?" 
</P>
<P>
 When she started writing "Home Fire" in 1988, Gallo had been driven by her 
fear of gun-toting men, especially the unbalanced sort. "The mixture of guns 
and men absolutely scares me to death," she says, "and with that as a catalyst, 
my imagination went on to tell me a million other stories," some of which ended 
up in her play. 
</P>
<P>
 Understand -- this was a new thing for Gallo in 1988. The Bronx-born writer 
had stumbled into the theater world like somebody getting dropped off at the 
wrong address. Growing up, she found out that she was too short to be a dancer. 
Then, she wanted to be an actor, but she had a stuttering problem. Her next 
option was to go into art, and she enrolled at the Pratt Institute of Design, 
which led her into the fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I presented annual reports to fashion sellers," Gallo says, "I found 
that I didn't stutter if I read from written notes. Then, at a costume party, 
people loved an act I made up, and out of nowhere, I just signed up for an 
acting class." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo admits that her teacher, Warren Robertson, didn't exactly teach her how 
to act. "But because he specialized in Primal Scream therapy (developed by 
Arthur Janov), he had me screaming for two years, and I lost my stuttering for 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Diving into the New York cabaret circuit with a solo act, Gallo subsequently 
snatched an award as best comedienne from the Association of Concert and 
Cabaret Artists for her show "A Comic Affaire." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, she says: "I never thought of myself as a writer in New York. It 
never occurred to me that I could even sell my material. I would get offers and 
turn them down. In 1983 and '84, I was one of the most deeply-in-the-fog human 
beings you'd ever see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo continued soloing in Los Angeles with her show "Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!," which 
brought her to the Cast Theatre -- precisely the theater one would think of as 
ideal for the savage satire of "Home Fire." Gallo says that she showed her 
script to the Cast's artistic director Diana Gibson, "who really liked it and 
probably would have done it, but I knew that the Cast's stages were too small 
for the staging I had in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Gallo had discovered that Theatre West was a good place to workshop a 
new play on a sizable stage. And workshop it she did -- "until I realized," she 
says, "that it wasn't what I wanted, and I didn't want to fool with it anymore 
until I hit on what it needed." 
</P>
<P>
 This happened when Gallo saw director Daniel O'Connor's staging of Howard 
Korder's brilliant black comedy, "Search and Destroy," in Hollywood. "Until 
then, 'Home Fire' had been an unbroken sequence of action," she says. " 'Search 
and Destroy' showed me that you can write with impact in a bunch of short 
scenes. I didn't think you could have so many short scenes on stage. It was a 
revelation." 
</P>
<P>
 As Danny, the photographer who can't muster the courage to tell his mother 
that he might be leaving for greener pastures in Italy, actor James DiStefano 
says that he likes "the conflict Danny is in, this universal idea of things 
that keep us from moving on with our lives. This play's a monster -- it's a 
huge, emotional play that has so many aspects to it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of my humor," says Gallo, "is also part of my bitterness. Bitterness 
that I've felt at times, for instance, that life was cheating me out of 
something. I know that my writing can be very hurtful, very sarcastic. It's a 
dark humor, which I hope I don't lose. If I do, I'll write very differently." 
</P>

Christmas. Where and When

THEATER REVIEW; PLAY DOESN'T QUITE MAKE A KILLING; COMEDY'S THIN SCRIPT HAS 
CHARM. TWO CAST MEMBERS PULL OFF STELLAR PERFORMANCES, BUT OTHERS ARE OVER THE 
TOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ray Loynd writes regularly about theater 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time, long ago, when plays and movies about theater people -- 
their egos, schemings and offstage traumas -- were fun to watch. The characters 
were so brittle, glamorous and hyper you wanted to run out and become an actor, 
or maybe, as a last resort, even a frustrated playwright or harried producer. 
</P>
<P>
 That narrow, self-inflated world, largely structured around the drama of an 
opening night, has been zanily re-created in "Making a Killing," a West Coast 
premiere of a comedy with farcical elements originally produced in Vermont 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The impulse behind the production is to enjoy a lighthearted laugh about an 
alcoholic playwright (Michael Bauer) who pretends to jump off the Washington 
Bridge on his opening night to garner favorable reviews, his very arch 
actress-wife (Theresa Sanchez), their nefarious producer (understudy Michael 
Kelly at the performance we attended) and the playwright's staccato-talking 
agent (Alexandra Handy). 
</P>
<P>
 The material is as thin as a wafer, which is part of its outdated charm. On 
the other hand, this kind of entangled charade, light on characterization, 
needs the keenest of players to pull it off, and the production certainly has 
two of those -- Sanchez's conniving wife and understudy Kelly's two-timing 
producer-lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Their comic timing is often hilarious, and if Kelly's bulky, smarmy producer 
is an understudy, you can only wonder how good the regular actor (Johnny Lage) 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably the other two actors (Handy's agent and Bauer's playwright) 
contribute flavorful twists and turns, but director Katherine Huston has given 
each of them much too long a leash. Each is over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy's smart-talking agent is a blunt cliche. Full of New York-ese speech 
patterns, she opens up the play in such a blitzkrieg of cackling patter you can 
hardly understand her. She mercifully settles down as the play progresses. More 
seriously misdirected is Bauer's playwright, hiding away in a Vermont cabin in 
a mind-defying con game involving both his wife and producer (who are gradually 
exposed as secret lovers). 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer giggles all the time, which gets tiresome, and his sudden, unexpected 
lurch into personal angst -driven suicidal autobiography doesn't work, either 
in playwright John Nassivera's need to turn suddenly intimate or in Bauer's 
teary acting about his attraction to drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Huston's two-level set design nicely alternates the action, bouncing 
between office and cabin, embellished by Tom Jackson's pinpointed lighting 
design. Apt original music is performed and arranged by Henry Gonzales and 
Handy. 
</P>
<P>
 The title is taken from playwright Robert Anderson's line (reprinted on the 
program's cover), "You can make a killing in the theater, but you can't make a 
living." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Making a Killing."

GETTING OUT THE WORD; HOT HOUSE IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD CELEBRATES THE READING LIFE, 
WHILE ENCOURAGING WRITERS TO SHARE THEIR WORK DURING WEEKLY LITERARY EVENINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

readings for The Times.

<P>
 It's not easy to be a book fiend in Los Angeles, which is sometimes 
characterized as the world capital of passive entertain ment. Yet San Fernando 
Valley litera ture lovers may be heartened by the arrival of Hot House, a North 
Hollywood coffee bar built on a reverence for good writing. 
</P>
<P>
 From its inventory of used books to its out-of-print search service to the 
portrait of Steinbeck over the kitchen door, the place celebrates the reading 
life, while encouraging writers to share their work during weekly literary 
evenings. Hot coffee, fresh cafe food and Saturday-night jazz complete its 
offerings, which are presented in an intimate, down-to-earth style that eschews 
trendiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're over 30, it's easy to feel not quite part of the club in hip, 
young coffeehouses," says Amy Dovaston, 32, who opened Hot House in August with 
her husband, Karl, and a partner, Jon Baer. "Here, by having good readings, 
good food and good music, we hope to draw a lot of different people -- and get 
them reading more books." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dovaston, the dream of a place where writers could read and musicians 
could jam goes back to her childhood, when her pianist father played with 
Charlie Parker and other jazz stars, and her writing mother hung out with beat 
greats such as Allen Ginsberg. Photos of Billie Holiday, Art Pepper and Dexter 
Gordon adorn the walls of Hot House, and jazz is always playing in the 
background.  
</P>
<P>
 Dovaston has worked at Dutton's bookstores, mainly in North Hollywood, for 
more than eight years, and she has recruited a lot of her Dutton's friends to 
read on Thursday nights. She has also, according to bookseller Davis Dutton, 
created Hot House in the same spirit with which she approached his store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amy brought a love of contemporary beat writing and literature noir to us," 
he says, "and she's re-created that era very skillfully in this coffeehouse."  
</P>
<P>
 As coffee-bar style goes, Hot House is spare but sophisticated, with homespun 
touches including a checkered floor and a rattan monkey hanging from the 
ceiling. Rosy light shines from wall sconces onto the usual mix-and-match 
furniture and a collection of '50s-era memorabilia. Board games pile on a 
window ledge, and a magazine rack offers everything from Vanity Fair to Mother 
Jones to Out in the 'Hood magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening customers, mostly in their 30s and 40s, who drift in to read or write 
over coffee in the quiet room, tend to stay for scheduled events, which never 
involve a cover charge or a minimum. "Having money," says Dovaston, "is not a 
requirement for appreciating the program." 
</P>
<P>
 What is required is the kind of attention customers such as Sarah Wood, a Cal 
State Northridge English major, bring to readings of fiction as well as poetry. 
According to Wood, "I'm unswervingly dedicated to story. Tell me a story and 
take me away." 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical java parlor, noisy with coffee makers and restless, talkative 
customers, a prose reading can be hard to pull off. At Hot House, patrons stay 
in their chairs, the machines shut down and the readers -- usually mature 
writers with professional track records -- hold the floor on the strength of 
words rather than the power of theatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One recent evening, a blend of poetry and prose, featured actor and writer 
David Abbott of North Hollywood and two poets who write fiction, Beth Wolfson 
of Northridge and Suzanne Bazell of Santa Monica. Abbott's short story, "Pity," 
read like an action-packed meditation on the nature of dreams, memory and 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfson, who teaches poetry at Barnsdall Arts Center in Los Angeles, read 
several short, related prose pieces on childhood, in addition to some poems. 
Bazell, a registered nurse, presented poems about reunions, and the renewal and 
resolution of old conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me," says Bazell, "reading my work is part of completing it. It's the 
finishing of a thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfson described her own poetry as "pretty cerebral," and speculated that she 
couldn't have read it in a more typical coffeehouse setting. Hot House, she 
concluded, is unique, because "Amy is a gifted appreciator." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Literary readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Hot House, 12123 Riverside Drive, North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Open readings at 8:30 p.m. the first Thursday of the month, other 
literary events at 8:30 p.m. most remaining Thursdays.

 "Video Jam '94," an exhibition of Cal State Northridge stu dent video art, 
will be presented Thursday in CSUN's Little Theater. These are the works of 
students in the school's fine arts department, not its radio / television / 
film department. The art students' work is done with a different orientation, 
says Jack Riley, instructor of the video arts classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These works represent an experimental approach to the video medium, in 
contrast to regular TV. These works are personal artistic statements," Riley 
says. "These artists are completely free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of it is really outrageous," Riley adds, recommending viewer discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of about 25 video artists will be presented. Featured works include 
computer animation and music videos, in addition to personal and political 
narratives. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Vitale, a CSUN Arts Council scholarship winner last year for her work 
in computer animation, will present another computer animated project, "Andy & 
Rufus." Andrew White's "Whiskey Wisdom" combines crayon drawings with computer 
animation, and John Ledell's "Project Molecular Change" combines computer 
animation and live action. Louis Posen's music video, "1-2-3-Slam," will also 
be screened. 
</P>
<P>
 Video Jam '94 will be presented from 8 to 9 p.m. Thursday in the CSUN Little 
Theatre in the Speech Drama Building, 18111 Nordhoff St. A reception that will 
precede the screenings at 7:30 p.m. will include a live interactive video 
presentation and refreshments. Admission is $2. Call (818) 885-2242.

 CELEBRITY MUSIC-MAKING: Many churches and temples are busy presenting holiday 
music programs, but Metropolitan Community Church in the Valley stands out. 
Actress and singer Edie Adams will emcee its Yuletide event, "Christmas in Song 
1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Applegate, the church's director of music, says this annual concert, 
which was hosted last year by actress Sandy Duncan, has become a tradition for 
many Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come to get in the mood for the holiday season," Applegate says. "Our 
audiences have grown from about 300 to 600 people just by word of mouth. We 
(the church) only have a membership of 125." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music and Columbia School of 
Drama, first gained popularity on "The Ernie Kovacs Show" on television in the 
early 1950s. In 1955, she married Kovacs, who died in 1962. She won a Tony for 
her Broadway performance as Daisy Mae in the musical "Li'l Abner" in 1956 and 
had her own network television show, "Here's Edie," in the early 1960s. Her 
numerous other credits include the films "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World," "The 
Apartment" and "Under the Yum Yum Tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate says the program -- which is being held this year at the Church of 
the Valley in Van Nuys -- is produced by his church as part of its outreach 
program to the community. It will feature about 100 performers doing sacred and 
secular holiday material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas in Song 1994" will be presented at 5 and 8 p.m. Saturday in the 
Church of the Valley, 14602 Kittridge Ave., Van Nuys. Tickets are $10. Call 
(818) 762-1133.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 MORE MOVIES: Entering the busy holiday season, Valley movie-goers will have a 
larger menu of choices. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month, one new film complex, the Mann 9 in Granada Hills, at 16850 
Devonshire St., (818) 363-7298, opened and another, the Pacific's Northridge 
Cinemas, 19401 Parthenia St., (818) 993-1711, expanded from six to 10 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge venue boasts state-of-the art sound and projection systems in 
all auditoriums, plus access for the handicapped and special aids for the 
hearing-impaired. Additionally, both the box office and snack bar are able to 
make credit and bank card transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Theatres plans to open an additional 18-screen megaplex in Woodland 
Hills in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills complex also offers state-of-the-art projection and sound 
equipment, access for the handicapped and hearing aids. 
</P>
<P>
 Its concession bay is able to conduct both ticket and refreshment sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, a walk-up movie ticket ATM is in the lobby. Also in the lobby is 
an electronic patron information system that provides customers with 
information on show times, minutes remaining before upcoming shows and seating 
availability.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: MAGIC WITH MIRRORS; FRAMEX HAS LOW PRICES AND MORE THAN 
1,000 CUSTOM MOLDINGS IN STOCK FOR SPECIALTY FRAMING. 
</P>

<P>
 When trying to make your living quarters feel larger, the phrase "do it with 
mirrors" can take on spe cial meaning. Mirrors can be magical, opening up 
space, bringing in light -- basically working wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 A mirror store that will frame to your specifications is not too hard to find, 
but a frame specialist that will frame mirrors is unusual. Framex, which offers 
some of the San Fernando Valley's best deals on custom framing, has just opened 
a new department that focuses on the custom framing of mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent comparison shopping at several mirror and/or glass stores around the 
Valley proved the point that Framex also offers hard-to-beat prices on custom 
mirror framing. A one-quarter inch first-quality domestic mirror (36-by-48 
inch) with a one-inch bevel was $94.98 at Framex -- and up to $160 elsewhere. 
The nearest in price was Mirror Magic in Tujunga at $104.15. Although some of 
these stores had mirrors that already were framed, none offered the custom 
framing services that Framex does. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 1,000 custom moldings in stock, Framex can frame any mirror, 
cut to any size, with or without a bevel. Of course, the labor involved in 
beveling increases the cost of the mirror. Without beveling, the $94.98 quote 
would fall to $55.80. 
</P>
<P>
 When buying a mirror, it is important that it has superior silver and 
abrasion-resistant backing. This is particularly vital when the mirror will 
hang in a bathroom, where moisture has a tendency to run down the mirror, 
causing the blackening often seen on the bottom and sides of many mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevels of any size, from one to three inches, and virtually any shape mirror 
can be made. If you want Mickey Mouse or a palm tree, it can be done. Just 
bring in the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Framex has an introductory offer that's hard to beat. You'll get a clean-cut 
(no bevel) mirror (up to 24 by 36 inches) free and 20% off the price of framing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some inventory is already framed and on the wall in a room set aside for 
mirrors. The prices and workmanship are excellent. A stunning black lacquered 
frame with a gold fillet (an inner frame) measures 32 by 42 inches with a 
one-inch bevel and is $295. A comparison price at several other mirror stores 
ran between $350 and $425. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other extreme, a 24-by-36-inch mirror framed in a silvery gray mica was 
$49, and a mahogany framed mirror was only $39.

VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS: GIFTS WRAPPED IN STYLE; FABRIC PIECES OR 
SCARVES CAN ADD AN ELEGANT TOUCH TO HOLIDAY PRESENTS. A TARZANA DESIGNER GIVES 
SHOPPERS THE CHANCE TO BE CREATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Innovative San Fernando Valley gift givers are putting a new spin on the old 
idea of elegant wrapping by using scarves to conceal the holiday booty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a clever way of giving two presents, both the wrap and the contents," 
says Phyllis Maxx, who has a signature boutique in Tarzana. There, customers 
can custom-design a scarf to go with an outfit. The wrap can be matched with 
the outfit's fabric or done in a complementary color. Prices range from $15 for 
a simple velvet number to $200 and up for an intricate, multi-fabric scarf with 
beaded trim. Labor and fabric affect the cost, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each package becomes a different thing. Since I am a designer, the wrap 
reflects my artistic sensibility and (the customer's)," Maxx says. 
</P>
<P>
 An even cheaper variation on the same theme involves using fabric squares to 
wrap gifts. At House of Fabrics in Canoga Park, sales associate Sam Rabadi says 
she has already assisted a few customers with yardage for just this purpose. 
"It's something different, and that appeals to some people," says Rabadi, who 
sells a variety of holiday printed fabrics priced between $2.99 and $6.99 per 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 One simple wrapping method involves sewing two squares of fabric together to 
form a pocket for a gift. Lazy gift-givers can even place a present on a 
bandanna, tie the corners together and finish the whole thing with a ribbon. 
</P>

 BEEP ME UP, SCOTTIE: Just when you thought you'd seen every conceivable 
beeper, out pop yet more fashionable incarnations. Seiko now offers a beeper 
watch, and there's also Swatch the Beep (now there's a clever moniker!). 
</P>
<P>
 The new Swatch is named for its unique paging system. The display communicates 
phone numbers or coded messages, which enable the person sending the 
communication to ensure that it's private. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 20 numbers can be featured in the memory, but only eight can be 
permanently protected from erasure. There is a silent mode function, which 
allows the display to indicate how many messages have been received. As with 
any beeper, the device must be hooked up via a mobile phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 The watch, which sells for $175, comes in four styles in shades of blue or 
red, or combinations such as green, red and yellow or brown and gold. Although 
it looks much like a traditional Swatch, the face of the new style features a 
horizontal bar where incoming information appears. San Fernando Valley 
Christmas shoppers will soon be able to find these timepieces at The Good Guys 
in Woodland Hills, Studio City and Northridge, but until shipments come in, 
special orders will be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiko's MessageWatch combines a pager with the ability to receive weather 
forecasts, stock market updates, winning lottery numbers, voice mail 
notifications and sports scores. It's even possible to add a personal voice 
mail greeting. Available in styles suitable for men, women and teens, the watch 
comes in several fashion colors including teal, gray, yellow, khaki and black. 
</P>
<P>
 Set to arrive at Rich Time Jewelers in Chatsworth, the watch has a 
manufacturer's suggested retail price of $79.95. Like the Swatch model, the 
Seiko device must be hooked via a mobile phone company. Richard Sarayudeji, 
owner of Rich Time Jewelers, says customers have been asking for the novel 
item. "We think they will be very popular, especially with kids," he says.

 ICE CREAM ANYONE?: The bold brights touted by highfalutin fashion designers 
for winter have enjoyed mixed success, so the experts decided to rethink the 
color explosion for spring. The latest shades are subdued, almost chalky, and 
far from blinding. Even so, they are a welcome respite from last spring's bland 
neutrals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think women will be excited about the more feminine looks being offered 
this spring," says Annalisa Sharp, assistant store manager of Rebel, a woman's 
upscale clothing boutique in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp says spring shoppers can expect soft palettes of baby pink, powder blue 
and buttercup yellow. Like the colors, Sharp says, shapes will be softer, too. 
Jackets will be less architectural, sweaters less fitted. Look for relaxed 
linen suits and little cotton sweaters to become the season's staples. 
</P>
<P>
 Teddy Zach, who owns the Body boutiques that feature avant-garde women's 
fashions in Studio City and Encino, agrees the trend will be hot for '95. 
</P>
<P>
 "The newness of it appeals; it's very light and pretty," affirms Zach, who 
says the store is expecting beaucoup shipments of sportswear echoing the 
ultra-feminine trend.

HAPPY TRAILS FOR 2; JOHN AND JULIE GENSLEY HAVE LED NATURE WALKS THROUGH THE 
SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS FOR DECADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 John and Julie Gensley are showing a visitor around their ruggedly beautiful 
35-acre Santa Monica Mountains ranch. They point out the old outhouse, a 
defunct water well and the active beehives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't see me, but I was saying hello to all my old friends," Julie says 
with a chuckle, referring to the native plants that abound on the land the 
Gensleys have owned for 52 years. The two nature walk docents, who conduct 
tours at Soka University, have been teaching Santa Monica Mountains lore to 
visitors since before there were state parks in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're old fogies," says John, 86, with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to the top of the mountain ridge and recalls the day last year when 
what he called "a canopy of flames" came over the crest and roared down toward 
the house. Julie, 84, went ahead with a planned trip, figuring John knew what 
he was doing. After all, firefighters had made the Gensleys' something of a 
command post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the sprinklers going," John recalls, "and I thought I had the place 
pretty well cleared, and I thought, now here I am all alone. What do I do 
next?" Luckily, two firetrucks pulled up, right on cue. 
</P>
<P>
 After the flames were out -- the fire stopped inches from the patio -- there 
was "a shower of sparks, just like a Fourth of July firecracker up there -- 
beautiful," John remembers, still awe-struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire came to (within) one foot of their house," marvels Earlyn Mosher, 
manager of community relations for Soka University. "To me, that was like, 
nature respects them. Nature protected them because that's what they do for 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gensleys helped establish the nature walk program in 1990 at Soka 
University, which recently dedicated its new demonstration garden to them. 
Officially, it's the John and Juliana Gensley Botanical Research Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is, as human beings I respect them so much because they're so 
young. They're aged, but they're younger than most people. I want to be like 
them when I grow up," Mosher, who is 45, says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Julie grew up not far from each other in a then-ritzy Los Angeles 
neighborhood near MacArthur Park. They met in 1931 at a horseback riding party. 
"The horses that were assigned to us spent the whole evening together. They 
liked each other," recalls Julie. The couple married the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lived simple and saved our money, because we knew we wanted to buy a place 
that was far enough out that it would be wild and beautiful, and near enough in 
that we could get there every weekend and not have to wait until vacations," 
Julie says. Before buying their mountain home, the couple lived in Hermosa 
Beach. Julie was a professor of education at Cal State Long Beach; John had a 
career in banking. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, John and Julie would bring their young son and daughter up 
on weekends to sleep in sleeping bags on the land while their house was being 
built. Their involvement with various community groups led them to invite 
visitors to the ranch; these rambles turned into the area's first nature walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no state parks at the time in the area, and we were practically 
the only resource that was available," Julie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Their knowledge of the local flora and fauna became well-known -- Julie was 
called "the oak tree lady" because of her expertise -- and she and John were 
among the earliest docents at Topanga State Park and later Malibu Creek State 
Park, where Julie still volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie says she's mostly self-taught. "You pick it up a day at a time, and when 
you've lived as many days as I have, it's a lot," she says with a laugh. But 
she also remembers her father taking her on walks and pointing out plants and 
flowers when she was a toddler. Her knowledge rubbed off on John. 
</P>
<P>
 They helped form Friends of Soka University in 1986, after being impressed 
with how the Soka administration cleaned up the property and seemed to respect 
its natural beauty. Julie suggested the nature walk program as a way to 
publicize the university and give it some good public relations. (The Japanese 
language school, which had hoped to expand, is trying to fend off a bid by the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to condemn much of the land for use as a 
park visitors center.) 
</P>
<P>
 Soka created the demonstration garden at Julie's request. On a recent visit, 
Julie walked a visitor around and showed how the garden answers the question 
she is most often asked on nature walks: "What's the best time to see 
wildflowers in the Santa Monica Mountains?" 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Santa Monica Mountains, there are wildflowers blooming every day of 
the year," she says proudly. The garden demonstrates just that. It also 
provides a sort of outdoor-classroom starting point for the nature walk, which 
takes visitors to the top of a steep hill and back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say, 'I just can't hike that far,' " says Julie, who still does 
the climb regularly. In the garden "you get an overview." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie points out interesting tidbits -- mugwort grows near poison oak, and its 
leaves contain an antidote to its poisonous neighbor; hummingbirds are native 
only to North and South America; you can always tell a sage by its square stem. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'How can you remember all these things?' " Julie says. "My 
earliest memories are of flowers. I remember bringing flowers to my grandmother 
when I was 2. First thing, when I'm in a new environment, I look for the 
flowers. My husband's that way with cars. We'll be driving along, and he'll 
say, 'Look, look!' And I'll say, 'Oh, crape myrtle!' And he says, 'No, I meant 
that BMW.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Though Julie says John is planning to scale back his nature walk duties in 
favor of less strenuous volunteer work, she has no plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even look into the future that far," she says. "If I've got an 
opportunity today, that's terrific."

REVIVING SOCIAL GRACES; SOME SAY THAT TEACHING YOUNGSTERS ETIQUETTE IS THE BEST 
WAY TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE ADULT WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Over the past 20 years or so, good manners have fallen into disrepute. A man 
holding open a door for a woman or pulling out her chair is regarded as 
hopelessly outdated. A woman serving tea or snuffing candles rates right up 
there with hoop skirts and corsets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many parents these days are looking back nostalgically to a day when 
youngsters were taught respect, and the rules of behavior for children and 
adults were more clearly defined. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that the appearance of social graces is all that is lacking 
in today's youth.  
</P>
<P>
 "It really is not just about finishing-school manners, respectful behavior, or 
manners of children toward adults," says Faye Snyder, founder of the Institute 
for Professional Parenting in Mission Hills. "You're talking about an entire 
upbringing." 
</P>
<P>
 While there is little doubt that manners still have an awful lot to do with 
the "magic words" of please and thank you , many parents are finding that 
teaching their youngsters etiquette is the best way to prepare them for the 
adult world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We teach our girls how to put on a formal tea, how to address and respond to 
formal invitations, how to shake hands and make a formal introduction, how to 
conduct meetings," says Mary Straney, president of the San Fernando Valley 
chapter of the National Charity League, a national volunteer organization for 
mothers and daughters. "But really we are teaching them the feeling of 
self-esteem. They can walk into a situation that may seem foreign but they are 
not caught unaware or unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
 However you frame them, good manners go to the heart of the way people treat 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still believe in men opening doors for women," says Sally Fleer, a former 
publicity director and special events coordinator for Bullock's department 
store. "I've been married 33 years and my husband always treats me courteously. 
We have mutual respect for each other and that is the root to all 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 As just about anyone would agree, such civilized behavior begins, for a child, 
at home. "If you want your children to have good manners, you have to treat 
them with good manners," Snyder says. "You must say, 'thank you,' every time 
your child does something for you." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many people believe that the decline in social graces can be 
attributed to the breakdown in the family. "Families don't sit down to dinner 
anymore, and that's where young people learn table manners," says Alys Swan, 
director of admissions for Powers International of Glendale, where youngsters 
take etiquette classes. "By being together, sharing family thoughts, parents 
can teach children to sit up straight, to use the right fork, even if it's only 
once a week." 
</P>
<P>
 For parents who feel they don't have time to teach those basic lessons, or for 
those parents who want to reinforce the lessons taught at home, there are 
places to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to formal classes taught at schools such as Powers International, 
the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts emphasize rules of good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 12 points of Scout law and three of those include courtesy, kindness 
and friendliness," says Terry Richardson, senior district executive of the Boy 
Scouts of America, Verdugo Hills Council. "We teach the boys ethics and action, 
to treat others with respect and to say, 'If I were in this situation, how 
would I feel?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For more traditional training, parents might want to consider sending their 
children to a cotillion, which may be on the pricey side, or joining a charity 
league, which may require an extensive volunteer commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manners are stressed throughout our meetings," says Kathy Logue, coordinator 
for the Swarthout Valley Cotillion, which offers social dancing lessons in 
Calabasas and Northridge. "We teach the youngsters how to sit, we talk to them 
about telephone manners, we remind them of such basic items as covering their 
mouths when they yawn in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are hungry for rules in their lives, they are hungry for the 
niceties," Logue says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although teaching youngsters the rules and niceties is -- for the most part -- 
straightforward, there are always areas open for debate. One of these is the 
question of how young people should address adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't care if my child uses Mr. or Mrs., " Snyder says. "Children 
can become befuddled by grown-ups throwing their weight around with a one-way 
respect system." 
</P>
<P>
 But some parents feel that only young children, those who might have 
difficulty pronouncing longer names, should be on a first-name basis with 
adults. "It depends on the age level," says Kimber Lee Wilkes, who teaches 
etiquette at Pierce College in Woodland Hills. "I usually recommend that 
youngsters first use Mr. and Mrs. If the adult says, 'Just call me so and so,' 
that's fine. But it shows a certain amount of respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, manners are about just that -- respect: respect for oneself and 
respect for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is up to the adults to lead by example," says Rob Kaspar, an assistant 
scout master of Troop 303 in La Crescenta. "You can't demand respect. You can 
only give it and hope it's reciprocated."

3-HOUR TOUR: SHOPPING'S CHANGE OF PACE; VISITORS TO OLD TOWN PASADENA FIND AN 
ECLECTIC, ARTSY WORLD OF DINERS, CLOTHING SHOPS, BOOKSTORES AND THEATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Now that Melrose Avenue is going down for the third time in the sea of 
self-conscious too-hipness, we must abandon it for a new place to people-watch, 
shop and dine, and we have found it -- in Old Town Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the area could pass for a studio back-lot set -- dressed for 
the 1940s, but with so-very '90s shops and restaurants. Quaint architecture, 
darling brick alleyways, artsy design supply houses, upscale resale shops, art, 
clothing, jewelry, theaters, and, in seemingly every other building, some kind 
of bistro, cafe, trattoria, cucina, coffeehouse or diner. All this within about 
a 12-block radius of Fair Oaks Avenue and Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 We park in the parking garage just east of Fair Oaks on Green Street, which is 
a block south of Colorado, but there are numerous lots in the area and helpful 
signs directing you to them. Figure on paying $5. (Street parking is metered, 
including Sundays.) Old Pasadena is bordered roughly on the north by Holly 
Street, on the south by Green Street, on the west by Pasadena Avenue and on the 
east by Arroyo Parkway. We confine our walking to busy Colorado Boulevard, with 
an occasional foray south one block (though it's worth a side trip north to 
Union Street for the resale shops). 
</P>
<P>
 1 p.m.: From the parking garage we emerge on Raymond Avenue, which will be the 
eastern edge of our tour. We can't resist wandering into the small but 
well-stocked Distant Lands travel bookstore across the street. Here you can get 
a map of Easter Island or a video of Greece. There are guidebooks of every kind 
("Eating in Japan," "How to Beat Jet-Lag"), plus travel commentaries that range 
from the classics to contemporary humor. 
</P>
<P>
 1:15 p.m.: At Fair Oaks, we head west, down the south side of Colorado. On a 
sunny Sunday, the sidewalks are busy, but not overly crowded, with 
fresh-scrubbed families pushing strollers, leather-jacketed bikers and babes, 
actor/model wanna-bes (read: waiters on their day off), drop-dead-cool literary 
types, dudes with backward baseball caps and Regular Folks like us. 
</P>
<P>
 Several performers warble on tenor saxes or amaze with magic tricks (then 
there's the guy whose act consists of standing perfectly still, which is 
actually kind of cool.) 
</P>
<P>
 We encounter a sidewalk French fry tasting, or rather a French fry sauce 
tasting in front of the Fantastic French Fry Co. (A young man challenges the 
authenticity of the Hungarian ketchup.) Lunch-time diners linger over coffee in 
the sidewalk cafes. We avoid the little alley that beckons us to Heminger's 
Fudge & Chocolate Co. and instead opt for the more expensive but less fattening 
Girasole, a beautiful store offering colorful, mostly Italian pottery (rooster 
pitcher, $46, big mugs, $28) and Irish pine furniture. There's also a 
trendy-looking clothing store and Grolet Gallery, for reasonably priced Native 
American jewelry and pricier art. Down another alley is Merida, an authentic 
Yucatan restaurant (how about a steaming bowl of goat?) 
</P>
<P>
 2 p.m.: Across Fair Oaks is Dodsworth, another '40s-looking diner. We duck 
into Penny Lane, a new-and-used CD and tape store that also has cards, 
magazines and some rock 'n' roll collectors items. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake's, at the head of the alleyway, has burgers and billiards and, out front, 
bikers are lounging around as if they were paid to be there to provide 
atmosphere (but apparently weren't). Chinese at Chopstix. Sticky Fingers is a 
candy store that specializes in the sugar-free -- and therefore conscience-free 
-- variety. At the end of the block is a cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 2:30 p.m.: A side trip one block south on De Lacey Avenue. OK, if you don't 
like this place, get thee to a yogurt shop, but fans of red hot chili peppers, 
and we don't mean the band, will want to spend some time in Hot Hot Hot, a 
delightful little store stocked with hot sauces from around the world, emphasis 
on Jamaica and the American Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you never use a drop, the bottles are worth having (or for inexpensive 
giving) just for their labels: Vampfire, Hot Bitch on a Beach, Scorned Woman, 
Hellfire and Damnation, Satan's Revenge and, our personal favorite, Religious 
Experience. The store also has T-shirts with peppers on them, posters with 
peppers on them, hot chips to dip into hot sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosh, thirsty? Across the street is DeLacey's Club 41, another 
reminder-of-bygone-days restaurant and bar whose sign outside promises "Booths 
for Ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 2:45 p.m.: Back on Colorado, still heading west. An African American gentleman 
plays a trumpet in an old-standards duet with an elderly white woman on 
electric piano. Halfway down the block is the Cellophane Building, a 
faux-Moorish affair with a nifty neon sign. 
</P>
<P>
 3 p.m.: At Pasadena Avenue, cross Colorado and turn back to the right. Here 
you have newer influences, such as the ubiquitous Starbuck's Coffee. It opens 
into an enormous Barnes & Noble bookstore that feels more like a library than a 
retail outlet, with tables and chairs for reading scattered throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Across De Lacey, still heading east on Colorado, we have an upscale, Palm 
Springs-ish stretch of Crate & Barrel, The Gap, A.B.S., Boulevard Shoes, Johnny 
Rockets down a little alley, Armani Exchange, Banana Republic, restaurant Il 
Fornaio down another little alley, Victoria's Secret and J. Crew. Phew! 
</P>
<P>
 3:30 p.m.: Now we cross Fair Oaks to find a guy making balloon critters for 
kiddies. Diners and people-watchers enjoy the shady outdoor seating at the 
trattoria Mi Piace, next to the outdoor diners partaking of the great-looking 
sandwiches at the Pasadena Baking Co. Del Mano Gallery displays ceramics, 
jewelry and, conveniently, handmade jewelry boxes. Next door, Impromptu, a 
large gift shop with the usual items -- ceramic Mona Lisa, $21, crockery cat 
dish that says Tuna Breath, $10.50. 
</P>
<P>
 3:45 p.m.: Now we're back on Raymond. You can either extend your tour by 
heading north. (Resale shops on Union Street! And -- big surprise -- more 
restaurants.) 
</P>
<P>
 Or trudge your weary way back to the parking garage. But before you go, it's 
worth a half-block detour south of Green Street to 99 S. Raymond, to behold the 
Castle Green Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a spectacular, turreted, Moorish-style building that easily recalls 
its days as the grand Webster Hotel, originally built in 1890 and designed by 
Frederick Roerhing, architect. The fountains and benches are inviting under the 
soaring palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, they don't have this on Melrose.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A POST-TEMBLOR TUMBLE AT ART'S DELI; THE LANDMARK FEATURES 
REASSURINGLY GOOD STANDBYS, BUT THERE ARE SOME DISAPPOINTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Friday in Valley Life!

<TEXT>
<P>
 Art's deli was one of the more highly publicized casualties of the Northridge 
quake. The landmark restaurant was closed for months because of damage, but 
reopened at the end of September, amid considerable fanfare, almost completely 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm suffering aftershocks myself after three recent meals at the new Art's. 
People say the more things change, the more they stay the same, but much of 
what I ate there was simply not what I remember from the old Art's. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, it looks mostly the same, except for the addition of a lot of 
spruce-colored panels and a couple of hundred glossy white wall tiles. Art's 
remains the quintessential deli space: a partially open kitchen, a well-stocked 
deli counter, bustling waitresses loaded up with huge platters and a noise 
level that borders on ear-splitting. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of owner Art Ginsburg's standbys, especially his corned beef and 
pastrami sandwiches, remain sumptuous and delicious, the standard by which the 
San Fernando Valley measures such things. The meats are perfectly steamed, 
sliced thin and piled up to the sky on good, crusty deli rye. One of my 
Brooklyn-born friends pronounced the corned beef dry but tasty. If it's moist 
you're after, go with the flavorful pastrami (bearing in mind that the moisture 
comes more from fat than from meat juices). 
</P>
<P>
 But now to the hard realities. Some of Art's food, notably a few items that 
should be the hallmark of a good delicatessen, simply do not cut the mustard. 
Stuffed derma (called kishke in Yiddish) is a prime example. I was brought up 
to love this greasy carrot-and-flour-stuffed sausage, traditionally made from a 
natural casing. Now, it's true that no deli makes kishke the way Ashkenazi Jews 
used to in Eastern Europe. Art's, though, goes too far -- it cuts the kishke 
up, fries the pieces and throws in a bowl of gluey, insipid brown gravy for 
dipping. 
</P>
<P>
 Kreplach are meaty fried dumplings that resemble the pot stickers in a Chinese 
restaurant. (Of course, pot stickers have a pork stuffing, unthinkable in a 
deli.) Art's are big, meaty and well fried. Too bad the filling isn't tastier. 
It reminds me of sour meat loaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The soups could be improved, too. The bean and barley soup is bland, the sweet 
and sour cabbage soup is overly sweet. The chicken matzo ball soup is made with 
a thin broth that looks and tastes as if it came out of a jar. In the center of 
the bowl sits a matzo ball. I wouldn't say mine was heavy, folks, but it would 
have had trouble floating in the Dead Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the assorted cold plates, try the the one with Art's creamy chopped 
chicken liver, a nosher's delight. The potato salad, sliced tomato and onion on 
it, is a perfect companion for Art's good rye bread. 
</P>
<P>
 No complaints about any of the smoked cod, whitefish or lox. They're all fine 
comfort food, though nothing as memorable as the high-priced (and worth it) 
stuff at the new Barney Greengrass the Sturgeon King in the Beverly Hills 
branch of Barneys New York. And I quite enjoyed my fried kippers, onions and 
eggs one blustery morning, served with a veritable mountain of home-fried 
potatoes. (A kipper is a smoky, dark-skinned herring. The Scots have been 
eating them at breakfast for centuries.) 
</P>
<P>
 Stuffed cabbage, an entree, is rolled with another dense filling, this time 
made from meat mixed with rice, then braised. It isn't bad if you don't mind 
the sweetness of raisins and tomatoes. An entree with a similar sweetness is 
short ribs in the pot, something like pot roast (and a good cut of meat, at 
that) served in a huge, gleaming metal tureen. Art's also serves a good-sized 
portion of roast chicken, albeit with slightly flaccid skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Count the waitresses at Art's among the restaurant's charms. You'd better have 
that order ready, honey, when these women unfurl their pads, or they might just 
skip away for another five minutes to let you think about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Count the oddly pale, medicinal-tasting half-sour pickles and ill-conceived 
triple decker sandwiches among things to look askance at here. Those full-color 
photos on the walls are the triple-deckers, and to anyone who can finish a 
Kathy's Special -- pastrami, chopped liver and tomato -- I wish a hearty mazel 
tov . 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to fancy some of the desserts, which are inescapable -- you have to 
walk past the pastry counter to get to any table. My favorite is a fudgy 
mini-chocolate bundt cake, served warm, but there are also an unctuous, 
cinnamon-rich rice pudding, a crumbly confection of coconut, chocolate and nuts 
called a Magic Bar and an assortment of good Danishes. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad Art's is back, but I'm not ready to become a regular until the 
kitchen shows a little more finesse. Meanwhile, some friends of mine who live 
south of the boulevard have been eating here three times a week, proclaiming 
the second coming. I think they're being sentimental. Or maybe they just live 
too far away from Brent's. Where and When 
</P>
<P>

 GREENER PASTURES: After 12 years in Castaic, a world-famous jockey school has 
packed up and hoofed it for Texas -- another victim of bad economic times and 
the Northridge earthquake. Kristyn Goddard, owner of Paradise Ranch Racing 
School, said the quake scared clients away, forcing September's move to San 
Antonio. . . . "As much as we love California, this has been a real good move," 
she said. "Our business just doubled overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 WORKS OF ART: It was one of the more publicized casualties of the quake. Art's 
Deli in Studio City had to close, leaving regulars licking their chops and 
counting the days until it reopened. But some doubt that the deli's fare is as 
good as it once was. . . . In Valley Life! (Page 34) today, critic Max Jacobson 
writes: "I'm glad Art's is back, but I'm not ready to become a regular until 
the kitchen shows a little more finesse." 
</P>
<P>
 HIGH NOTES: The road to fame and fortune is littered with obstacles. But 
upstart musicians around the Valley say it's better to play and fail than not 
to play. . . . Bassist Halina Janusz, above, of the group Good Dog Nigel, tunes 
up during a recent rehearsal. See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 NO PARKING: More quake news: Their cars were crushed Jan. 17, but only now can 
residents of Northridge Meadows pick up the vehicles. The Meadows collapsed in 
the quake, killing 16 and burying about 60 vehicles. Attorney Alison Tharpe 
said former residents have until Dec. 14 to retrieve what's left of their cars 
or the city will impound them. . . . None of the 45 remaining cars are much to 
look at. Tharpe said most have had their tires and radios stolen.

 ACT OF KINDNESS: Since Glenn Gershan lost the electronic voice keyboard that 
allows him to communicate, offers of help have poured in. Tonight, the 
Associated Student Union at Valley College will present Gershan with $500. . . 
. And all the proceeds of the theater department's premiere of Moliere's "The 
Would-Be Gentleman" will help Gershan replace the $4,500 device. Aaron Curtiss

 UPHILL CLIMB: The number of Ventura County students with limited English 
skills has risen an average of about 1,200 students a year since 1990. . . . 
But state officials say there are only 289 fully certified bilingual teachers 
in the county. That makes for a 79-to-1 ratio of students to teachers. . . . 
The heartening news: Teachers in some districts are earning credentials that 
allow them to instruct non-English speakers without being fully bilingual. 
Still, said Kathleen Hawing of Ventura's school district: "We're encouraging 
teachers to go for the credentials."

 PUPPY LOVE: A Thousand Oaks family is fighting for the lives of their two 
Rottweilers, accused of harassing residents (B4). One of the dogs was purchased 
as a family Christmas gift last year. . . . County animal workers prohibit pet 
adoptions the two weeks before Christmas if the animal is intended as a gift. 
"It's so nuts on Christmas Day," said Kathy Jenks, head of animal regulation. 
"It's just not a good time with all the commotion." And experts warn: There's a 
right way and a wrong way to find just the right cuddly canine (Life & Style, 
Page 3).

 FETE OF FIRE: Hot dogs, pizza, hamburgers -- a typical teen-ager's diet. . . . 
But junk food is also standard fare for veteran politician Alex Fiore, who was 
roasted by fans and friends in honor of his 30 years on the Thousand Oaks City 
Council (B5). . . . The food at the good-natured party was almost as off-beat 
as the jokes.

 POPULAR SCIENCE: Science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury will appear Sunday at 
Ventura's Phantom Bookshop. . . . It will mark Bradbury's second book-signing 
at the Main Street store. At a similar event a year ago, fans lined up with 
armloads of books for the prolific author's signature, store owner John Anthony 
Miller said. "People just came in here with stacks of books," he said. This 
year, fans will be restricted to three books -- one of which must be purchased 
at the store. Learning the Language Skills

 Funeral services will be held Saturday for Madeline Evans, area director of 
the Orange County Special Olympics, who died Tuesday of congestive heart 
failure at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
 During her 26 years with the Special Olympics, Evans coordinated training and 
competition activities for more than 2,000 mentally impaired athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also active with the Orange County Assn. for the Retarded, served as a 
director of the Orange County Council for Exceptional Children and was an 
adviser to the Orange County Developmental Disabilities Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Connecticut native formerly chaired Assemblyman Richard Robinson's 
Advisory Committee on the Handicapped and served from 1979 to 1986 on the state 
Department of Education's Advisory Commission on Special Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Hime, board president of the Anaheim-based Special Olympics, said Evans 
had been in poor health in recent years. Due to complications from diabetes, 
both her legs were amputated below the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "She touched the lives of thousands of mentally retarded individuals 
throughout Orange County," Hime said. "It was kind of ironic, being a champion 
of the handicapped for so many years and ending up disabled herself."  
</P>
<P>
 Evans is survived by two daughters, Pattye Downing of Antelope and Jenee 
Maurer of Brea; a son, James Gallagher of Anaheim, and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral is scheduled for 10 a.m. at Memory Garden Memorial Park & 
Mortuary, 455 W. Central Ave., Brea. Burial will immediately follow at the 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family is requesting donations to the Orange County 
Special Olympics, the American Diabetes Assn. or United Cerebral Palsy.

FAIRY-TALE WORLD OF PINE; EDUCATION: SIXTY OXNARD KINDERGARTNERS GET A LESSON 
ABOUT CHRISTMAS TREES WHILE TOURING A 12-ACRE FARM IN SANTA PAULA. 
</P>

 Five-year-old Fernando Turrubiartes of Oxnard hopes Santa will bring his 
family a Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a very tall and green tree, just like this one, in the living room at 
my house," Fernando said as he touched the needles of a 10-foot-high pine tree 
while traipsing among hundreds of fragrant trees at a Santa Paula farm. "And I 
want a lot of bright balls and lights on the tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando is one of hundreds of schoolchildren who will roam the fairy-tale 
world of a pine forest this month during tours of Faulkner Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Each December, about 1,500 to 2,000 children visit the farm, where they learn 
how evergreens are planted and grown, farm owner Lin Ayers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the children don't know where their Christmas tree comes from or how 
they grow," Ayers said. The tours "give them a chance to have fun while 
learning about the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Breathing the aroma of pine and basking in the warm autumn sun, 60 
kindergartners from Oxnard's Rose Avenue School enjoyed their first visit 
Thursday to a Christmas tree forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour at Faulkner Farm began at 10 a.m. with a train ride in open-air 
boxcars around the 12 acres of the farm where the trees are grown. 
</P>
<P>
 As the red train whizzed through fragrant fields of Monterey and redwood 
pines, the youngsters loudly expressed their curiosity at the wonders around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't look like the ones on TV. They are very green," said Manuel 
Cabrero pointing to the trees. But then he bent his head down and spotted a 
huge black spider crawling on a tree. "Look, look, the spider is eating the 
tree!" 
</P>
<P>
 After the 15-minute train ride, the youngsters wandered among the trees 
learning how they grow, produce seeds and how they are pruned. 
</P>
<P>
 Their teacher, Mary Jean Gallagher, told them that the seeds come from pods on 
the trees called cones and when the seeds grow they become baby trees, called 
seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does a tree need to grow?" Gallagher asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need water and sun," said an excited Manuel. "And I think air."  
</P>
<P>
 "That's very good. But they also need soil and care," Gallagher said. "And it 
takes four years for a tree to grow and be ready for a family to chop it up and 
take it home." 
</P>
<P>
 As they strolled among the trees, the students also learned how to tell the 
age of a tree by counting the rings in a cross-section of its trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 While instructing the students to determine how old some of the cut trunks 
were, she said, "Every time we see you counting we'll give you a hip, hip, 
hooray." 
</P>
<P>
 And in small groups they went hunting for chopped trunks whose trees had 
already traveled to the living rooms of families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite often at their age, they are more interested in Santa than in trees," 
Gallagher said as she watched the children. "But this group seems truly excited 
about the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, who has taught in the Oxnard Elementary School District for 33 
years, said the trips serve not only to expand the students' cultural 
experience but to build their vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really learn fast and this is the best way of teaching," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the one-hour tour, Fernando's wish for a Christmas tree came 
true. Each of the students was given a live sapling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to plant it," Fernando said, "and I hope it will grow tall just 
like the ones here."

INSURANCE STING ENDS IN 12 ARRESTS; RAIDS: CHIROPRACTORS AND LAWYERS ARE 
ACCUSED OF DOUBLE-BILLING SCHEMES AND PAYING TO RECEIVE PATIENT REFERRALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Targeting lawyers and chiropractors who "buy" patients and bilk the insurance 
industry, 150 law officers swarmed across Ventura County in 26 simultaneous 
raids Thursday morning to end a yearlong insurance-fraud sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Just minutes after 9 a.m., officers flashed badges and search warrants at 
suspects' homes and offices from Ojai to Agoura Hills. Then they set about 
seizing hundreds of pages of allegedly bogus workers' compensation claims, 
X-rays, computer records and other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon they had arrested 12 people, including one reserve Oxnard 
police officer who also worked as a chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids capped a yearlong undercover probe by Ventura County prosecutors and 
state and national insurance investigators that Ventura County Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury dubbed "Operation What's Up Doc." 
</P>
<P>
 And they netted suspects accused of two practices that cost the insurance 
industry billions each year: double- and triple-billing insurers for single 
treatments, and "buying" patient referrals with fees that are often billed back 
to the insurance companies -- an illegal process known as "capping." 
</P>
<P>
 Two district attorney's investigators set themselves up in a Thousand Oaks 
office for much of a year, posing as Oak Tree Medical Marketing -- a referral 
service that offered to steer workers' compensation claimants to doctors and 
lawyers for a fee, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Tree mailed out letters to doctors and lawyers from Joseph R. Carter, its 
fictitious president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Professional," began the letters, promising "a resource capable of 
generating a new patient or client base." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter ended, "I look forward to the many exciting opportunities available 
to professionals interested in establishing a mutually profitable business 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and lawyers responded, but once they learned that Oak Tree was 
charging fees for patients, most were too honest to take the bait. 
</P>
<P>
 Several said 'Oh, yes, but you know that what you're doing is against the 
law,' " Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, others signed referral agreements, "bought" patients and even 
counseled the undercover investigators on how to cover their tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them the opportunity without crossing any entrapment lines," Bradbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chiropractors and physicians offered money and were prepared to pay money 
for patients," said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. John Geb, who runs his office's 
fraud unit. "That's called capping, and it's against the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Some suspects paid fees of $300 per patient, while others agreed to kick back 
30% of the insurance payments to Oak Tree in exchange for patients, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, undercover detectives and investigators showed up at chiropractors' 
offices for two or three treatments that were often billed to insurers as if 
they had visited twice as frequently, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Tree partners played the part of prosperous businessmen to the hilt. 
Clad in expensive suits, they drove a Mercedes and a Porsche supplied by the 
National Insurance Crime Bureau, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 And they recorded nearly every conversation with the suspects on audio tape -- 
and some on video, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation went smoothly -- although at one point a suspect stopped for 
lunch at a Chinese restaurant in Ventura and spotted one of his "patients" 
noshing with his undercover colleagues, some of them sporting guns and badges.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the suspects also had the Oak Tree boys followed to make sure they 
were legitimate, but the mock business remained intact, Bradbury said, and the 
storefront referral service continued "selling" patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the offices raided Thursday were billing hundreds of thousands of 
dollars annually in fake workers' compensation claims, said Michael L. Powell 
of the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit investigative group funded 
by the insurance and rental-car industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and attorneys involved in it "are prostituting their professions," 
said Jerry Treadway, of the California Department of Insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the California Legislature upgraded capping from a misdemeanor to a 
felony, Treadway said, because it inevitably leads to fraudulent insurance 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is often called the workers' comp fraud capital of the world," 
Geb said. "And it can't help but radiate out of Los Angeles" to neighboring 
areas such as Ventura County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is due to go on for another four to six months before 
charges are filed against the 12 suspects, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 people arrested Thursday will be arraigned on a variety of fraud and 
capping charges under the insurance and business and professions codes, and 
more charges may follow, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office identified those arrested as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Martin Harary, 50, an Oxnard attorney. When an investigator asked 20% of the 
final settlement for personal injury cases, Harary allegedly paid for two 
patients and referred them to an Oxnard chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Clemens, 48, the chiropractor, allegedly to pay fees of $300 per 
patient and 30% of the total settlement for personal injury cases. On May 20, 
an investigator went to his office posing as one of the patients, and Clemens 
allegedly paid $150 for the referral. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Gary Rick, 49, a Ventura psychologist, allegedly signed a contract and 
paid undercover agents for two patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Fontenot, 43, an Oxnard police reserve officer who worked as a 
chiropractor in Camarillo, allegedly billed insurers for services he did not 
render. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steven Spunt, 34, Fontenot's office partner, who allegedly signed a contract 
agreeing to pay Oak Tree $300 a month for patient referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley chiropractor John Clark, 47, allegedly discussed with an 
undercover investigator ways of defrauding an insurer. His office manager, 
Debra Martyn, 30, also was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moorpark chiropractor Michael Hemphill, 47, and his wife, Julie Hemphill, 
45, allegedly paid for five patient referrals and filed fraudulent bills with 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Westlake Village law partners Steven Gross, 50, and Rand E. Pinsky, 45, 
allegedly met with the Oak Tree partners and Julie Hemphill and agreed to pay 
for client referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 * And Agoura Hills attorney Donald Wylie, 46, allegedly filed false claims 
with the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
 And there may be others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have developed a significant number of leads regarding other 
professionals" involved in capping and fake billing, who were not arrested, 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered them amnesty from prosecution if they step forward in the next 30 
days and agree to testify about the crime.

SATICOY MAN DENIES GUILT IN FATAL SHOOTING; COURTS: AUTHORITIES SAY THE SUSPECT 
IS LINKED TO A GANG. THE VICTIM WAS A CABRILLO VILLAGE FATHER OF FOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Saticoy man pleaded not guilty Thursday to murdering a Cabrillo Village 
father of four, described by police as an innocent victim of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolfo Leo Martinez, 21, is scheduled for a Jan. 5 preliminary hearing on 
charges of murder and shooting at an occupied dwelling in connection with the 
Oct. 1 slaying of Jose Guadalupe Gutierrez, 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was shot in the heart as he stood chatting with a friend outside a 
small building where he had led an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Residents said 
they heard several shots, and detectives believe the bullets were fired by gang 
members from railroad tracks just outside Cabrillo Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, there's no indication that whoever was the shooter knew this 
particular individual and singled him out," Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger A. Inman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez's death left his two sons and two daughters, ages 5 to 18, without a 
parent. Their mother died of cancer several years ago, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who is in the Ventura County Jail with bail set at $250,000, was 
arrested Nov. 11 during one of the largest gang sweeps in recent county 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Martinez is the only one charged at this time with Gutierrez's 
murder, Inman said other arrests are possible. More than one type of bullet 
casing was found at the scene of the crime, indicating that more than one 
weapon was fired, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one bullet struck Gutierrez, but anyone who took part in the shooting 
could be charged in his death, Inman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, legally, anybody who went there to fire into the village can be 
legally guilty of murder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have said Martinez is a member of a Saticoy gang believed responsible 
for the shooting. Authorities will not name the gang to avoid giving it 
notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman said the reason for the shooting is unknown. All the shots appear to 
have come from the same spot and were fired at one general location. But 
authorities do not know if the shooters intended to hit anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without eyewitnesses seeing the shooting, you can't assume whether (the 
shooters) were aiming at any figures or were just shooting in a general 
direction," Inman said. "(However), the lighting was such that you would expect 
that they would have been able to see the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years prosecutors often have avoided a preliminary hearing by taking 
murder cases to the county grand jury and obtaining an indictment. But Inman 
said there is a good chance there will be a preliminary hearing in this case.

COUNTY MAY WIDEN HUNT FOR EXECUTIVE; HIRING: A REPORT TO SUPERVISORS RECOMMENDS 
A STATEWIDE RECRUITMENT OF CANDIDATES FOR THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR'S POST.

<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors is considering spending as much as 
$70,000 for a statewide search to replace chief administrator Richard 
Wittenberg, who is leaving in January to take a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting a consensus the board reached in private meetings, county Personnel 
Director Ronald W. Komers said that while several local candidates are 
qualified for the job, he believes a more extensive search is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chief administrative officer position is one of the most important in 
county government and, in my opinion, requires an individual with substantial 
California county experience," Komers wrote in a report to the board. "I 
believe the citizens would be best served by a statewide recruitment to assure 
that the board have an adequate number of candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors John K. Flynn and Maggie Kildee said Thursday they would probably 
support a statewide search but hoped this would not discourage local candidates 
who are interested in applying for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a number of qualified candidates in the county," Flynn 
said. "I don't want them to feel reluctant to (apply) just because it's a 
statewide search." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Komers' office usually conducts its own executive searches, Kildee 
said she would prefer to hire a private consultant because of the complex 
nature of the administrator's job. Kildee said it would also help avoid any 
potential conflict of interest should a local candidate, particularly a current 
county official, apply for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "With an outside consultant we could eliminate that problem," Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee initially preferred a nationwide search but agreed with Komers and 
others that it would be helpful for Wittenberg's successor to have some 
knowledge of California's laws and budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly elected Supervisors Frank Schillo and Judy Mikels, who will be sworn in 
Jan. 3, have participated in closed-door meetings with current board members 
about finding a replacement for Wittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he supported the statewide search, but Mikels could not be 
reached for comment. Flynn and Kildee said that they were unaware of any 
opposition that Mikels might have to the current board moving ahead with the 
search process. 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee said she expects both Schillo and Mikels to attend Tuesday's board 
meeting when the issue will be decided. Any concerns they might have could be 
voiced then, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Komers said he is recommending that the county hire one of four 
California-based firms to conduct the search for a new manager at a cost 
ranging from $27,000 to $70,000. The one-time cost, he said, would be covered 
by funds from the existing budget of the chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The four executive search firms recommended for the board's consideration are: 
Norman Roberts & Associates of Los Angeles, Ralph Anderson Associates of 
Sacramento, Heidrick & Struggles of Los Angeles and David M. Griffith & 
Associates of Carmichael. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board agrees to hire a consultant, Komers said he expects a statewide 
search would then take between 60 to 90 days to provide a list of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kildee and Flynn said the board is still mulling over what to do 
about an interim replacement for Wittenberg. Both said it's possible that a 
temporary replacement would be named soon, but Flynn said he would prefer to 
wait until Schillo and Mikels have taken office before making that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg, the county's top manager for 16 years, announced last month that 
he had accepted the top executive job in Santa Clara County. His last day is 
Jan. 21.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; STATE 
OFFICIALS TO SIDE WITH COUNTY IN MEDI-CAL FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials indicated in a letter released Wednesday that they will side 
with Los Angeles County in its battle to win reimbursement from the federal 
government of millions of dollars in Medi-Cal claims. The long-running dispute 
could leave the county with a huge hole in its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In the draft letter to the Board of Supervisors, officials from the state 
Department of Health Services call a decision by federal authorities to 
postpone action on the reimbursement claims "unfair and unjust." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter is expected to be put in final form today and sent to the federal 
Health Care Financing Administration, which has expressed doubts about 
reimbursement claims by California counties. According to the letter, federal 
health care officials fear that paying off California's reimbursement claims 
will set a precedent for other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is seeking $640 million in reimbursements for the administrative 
costs of running its Medi-Cal program over the last three years. The sum has 
been included in the county's 1994-95 fiscal year budget, and its subtraction 
could force more budget cuts.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; DOES PRAYER BELONG IN THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A constitutional amendment restoring "voluntary prayer" in public schools was 
proposed to Congress last month, rekindling controversy over the separation of 
church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would allow school officials to institute a group prayer at the 
beginning of each class day. It would not, however, make prayer mandatory, 
allowing students unwilling to participate to sit silently or leave the room 
during the designated period. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents label the measure "divisive," claiming an organized system of prayer 
would marginalize some religions and invoke guilt in students choosing not to 
pray. Those who favor the amendment contend that more guarantees of liberties 
for religious students should be written into the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the amendment would reverse a series of Supreme Court decisions 
that, since 1962, have barred officially sponsored school prayers. A similarly 
worded proposal in 1984 led to the approval of the Equal Access Act, which 
allows secondary school students to pray together on campus during non-class 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Should organized prayer be allowed back into the public school classroom? 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Hardman, California chairwoman of the Christian Coalition 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out as a very religious nation. Now, our country is being pulled 
apart by division. It's killing us and we have to come together. My only 
concern is over how school prayer will be handled. Prayer cannot be led by 
teachers or students because that could lead to imposing one religion over 
another. A moment of silence (suggested by President Clinton)would be useless 
if it's not directed. A teacher should explain that the purpose of (a moment of 
silence) is to communicate with your own god. All these horrible things are 
happening in our schools these days, yet, some people are concerned that prayer 
in schools will negatively affect the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Schwartzbart, member, Americans United for Separation of Church and 
State 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has their own relationship with God. Why must all students pick the 
same moment to explore that relationship? A moment of silence is really a 
moment of nothing, which may be belittling to some religions. It will make some 
people feel like they're second-class citizens. An atheist should not have to 
see his civil rights infringed upon in that manner. There's (also) the 
possibility that people favoring (this measure) are attempting to use it as a 
steppingstone to advance a more specific policy. It gives teachers the 
opportunity to inject their own religious beliefs into the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 James Goss, chairman, religious studies department, Cal State Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be problems existing between religions that are specifically 
oriented and those who refer to a more general type of God. If a general prayer 
is instituted in the schools, specific-minded groups wouldn't find it very 
meaningful. Yet, if you get specific, you'll present a problem with everyone 
else. We're so much more pluralistic now than from when the Founding Fathers 
had prayer instituted. It's less possible to talk about a general ethos today 
and call it our culture."  
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Kakuyei Tada of San Fernando Valley Hongwanji Buddhist Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since our sect does not pray, we oppose any prayer occurring in public 
school. Buddhist children would feel very intimidated by being around others 
that are praying. Prayer and meditation belong to the home and temple 
environments, not public schools. We have no equivalent to prayer. Our religion 
is a different concept than the Judaic/Christian tradition."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; CITY SEEKS TO SELL 3 TRUSSES FROM HISTORIC 
BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For sale: one used, 66-year-old green bridge. Contact Fillmore Mayor Pro Tem 
Roger Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a new, wider and safer Bardsdale Bridge opened last month, the 
historic green bridge that spans the Santa Clara River on California 23 had to 
be removed. Crews this week began dismantling the one-third-of-a-mile-long 
structure and hauling away the concrete rubble and twisted re-bar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city paid about $40,000 to keep eight, 135-foot-long, 30-foot-high 
trusses that weigh 66 tons each. Workers are using two bulldozers -- one to 
pull and one to push -- to drag the trusses to an empty lot at the foot of 
Central Avenue, about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the city intends to use five of the trusses: two to span Pole 
Creek at Santa Clara Avenue, two across Pole Creek at River Street and one 
along a bicycle path planned for the foot of Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves three trusses that Fillmore hopes to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really haven't talked a lot about price," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell initially opposed keeping the trusses when the state offered to sell 
them to Fillmore two years ago. The asking price: $1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saved the city some money," Campbell said jokingly of his initial hesitancy 
to take the trusses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Campbell said it wasn't worth the city's time and money to 
preserve the old bridge purely for its historic value. But in those two years, 
the three proposed uses for the trusses arose. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Bardsdale Bridge was deemed unsafe because it was too narrow and had 
structural defects. The two-lane bridge was 20 feet wide with no shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 state Department of Transportation report showed that 16 accidents 
occurred on the bridge between 1986 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made you nervous when you drove across," said longtime Fillmore resident 
Lucian Meyers, 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bridge's aesthetic appeal, Meyers said, he prefers the newer 
concrete one. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't stand in the way of progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new $6-million bridge is 40 feet wide with eight-foot emergency lanes on 
each side. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the concrete span lacks the charm of its metal predecessor, the two 
do share one distinguishing characteristic: graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction superintendent Denis Stellenberg said crews will sandblast the 
marks from the bridge before they leave in February. But he expects vandals to 
strike when the crews are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're bored kids," he said. PAUL ELIAS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; SPRAYING OPPONENTS TO HOLD MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group opposed to the aerial spraying of malathion over eastern Camarillo 
will host a town hall meeting Monday that will feature a panel of doctors and 
scientists specializing in the health effects on people exposed to pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held in the Orchid Room of the United Food and Commercial 
Workers Hall, 816 Camarillo Springs Road, Camarillo, said Terri Gaishin, 
chairwoman of Group Against Spraying People, or GASP. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Maggie Kildee will moderate the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaishin said GASP seeks to present the public with alternative views from 
medical doctors and scientists on the health effects of the spraying, which has 
been ordered by state agricultural officials to combat the Medfly infestation, 
discovered Sept. 29 in an east Camarillo orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Six panelists have been scheduled to appear for the 7 p.m. program, Gaishin 
said. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN TIED TO KILLING IN SAN BERNARDINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A routine check of fingerprints revealed Thursday that a driver arrested in 
connection with two hit-and-run accidents in Ventura is wanted in San 
Bernardino for allegedly killing an acquaintance and intimidating two 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police took Felipe Nery Cruz into custody Wednesday morning after he 
led them on a cross-town chase that ended when he abandoned his car at Victoria 
Avenue and Valentine Road, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz had no identification with him and told officers that his name was Thomas 
R. Rivera. But a check of his fingerprints at County Jail turned up a different 
name and the homicide warrant issued April 14 in San Bernardino, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino Police Sgt. Roger Poyzer said Cruz is suspected in the April 4 
slaying of Javier Mercado, 30, with a .22-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Poyzer said the killing occurred at a house where a party had been under way 
for hours. Just before 3 a.m., a group of people confronted Cruz in front of 
the house. Cruz then pulled a rifle from his car and fatally shot Mercado, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the killing, Cruz tried to intimidate two witnesses, then fled, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Cruz was being held in Ventura County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to be transferred to San Bernardino County to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the homicide, Cruz has outstanding warrants in San Bernardino 
for spousal battery and a probation violation, police said. JULIE FIELDS

said. 
</P>
<P>
 The screenings -- which include tests for hypertension, cholesterol levels and 
skin cancer -- will be held from 8 a.m to 4 p.m. both days in the conference 
center at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested residents must make an appointment before showing up at the center,

274-9355. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants must also have a personal physician to whom test results can be 
sent, Doss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each examination takes about 20 minutes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross is offering the free service to Ventura County residents to gain 
exposure for its health insurance plans, Doss said. 
</P>

 Police are still looking for the gunmen who shot two men in separate incidents 
in Oxnard, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Vasquez, 20, was shot in the chest from a passing car about 7 p.m. 
Wednesday as he walked alone on Colonia Road.Oxnard police spokesman David 
Keith said gang slogans were yelled from the car before the shot was fired. He 
said police do not know what caliber weapon was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said Vasquez was listed in stable condition in St. John's Regional 
Medical Center on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours later, police were called to 831 S. E St., where they found Joseph 
Moraga, 29, of Santa Paula shot several times in the hip, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said Moraga was shot as he stood in an alley behind a residence. Moraga 
was standing with several other people when three men passed the group in the 
alley and one of the men shot Moraga, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said no motive for the shooting is known, but both incidents are thought to 
be gang-related.

 Moraga was listed in serious condition in the intensive care unit of St.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; TESTIMONY PROMPTS CALL FOR MISTRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who says she was molested as a child by a Camarillo church teacher 
told her story to a jury Thursday, prompting a request for mistrial when she 
unexpectedly testified that another girl had been victimized as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Ken W. Riley said he was "very concerned" about the 
woman's testimony against Robert C. Rose, who is charged with molesting a 
13-year-old girl last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he denied the defense request for a mistrial, Riley halted the 
prosecutor's questioning of the 23-year-old woman and blocked the appearance of 
another witness in an attempt to minimize the potential damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's testimony was intended to bolster the prosecution's case by 
showing that Rose had a history of molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, 49, is not charged with molesting the woman because the statute of 
limitations has expired on the alleged act, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trial began, Riley ruled that the woman could testify about what 
Rose did to her. At the same time, the judge precluded the testimony of two 
others who claim Rose molested them as children. 
</P>
<P>
 While the woman was testifying, she unexpectedly said that another girl was 
with her on one occasion and also participated in sexual activity with Rose. 
Defense attorney James M. Farley strenuously objected, saying the jury had been 
tainted by the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Saundra T. Brewer responded that she cannot control what a 
witness says and she did not know the woman was going to mention another 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose is charged with 10 felony child molestation charges involving the 
13-year-old girl. At the time of the alleged offenses, he was director of the 
youth religion education program at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church in 
Camarillo. BARBARA MURPHY

THOUSAND OAKS; SALVATION ARMY GETS OK TO SOLICIT AT MALL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bells will be ringing today at the Janss Marketplace in Thousand Oaks, and 
Salvation Army officials are elated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowing to public pressure and legal arguments from the charity group, mall 
officials reversed an earlier decision to deny the group permission to solicit 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The group had posted a kettle at the mall for 20 years and had counted on 
raising $10,000 this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Rice, director of the charity's legal and insurance department at the 
Los Angeles division headquarters, said Thursday he offered Bill Mendelsohn, 
Janss Marketplace manager, legal advice on court cases governing access rights 
and that Mendelsohn was "very gracious." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said Mendelsohn had expressed concern about "the intimidation element of 
other organizations" but had no problem with the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelsohn himself declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of access to shopping areas is real and of national significance," 
said Cathy Ramsdale, regional director of the group's Ventura County Service 
Extension. "We believe the state and federal constitutions and public sympathy 
support our presence in malls, shopping centers and at retail store locations."

 "This is totally unacceptable, and we are intending to file a lawsuit," said 
Kevin G. DeNoce, vice president of the Deputy Dist. Attorneys Assn. "The county 
ought to treat its employees a lot better than this." 
</P>
<P>
 The salary dispute centers on a total of $49,500 in pay raises given to 22 
prosecutors and five public defenders during the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 County Auditor-Controller Thomas Mahon said Thursday that the pay raises, 
granted by the county personnel office, violated a freeze on salaries and 
promotions imposed by the Board of Supervisors in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said the error was not the fault of the employees, and that the county 
is making every effort to resolve the issue peaceably. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he will ask the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to approve a plan 
that would allow most of the attorneys to pay back the money they owe by 
exchanging unused vacation or sick leave for a cash payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done this in the past in certain cases," Mahon said. He added, 
however, that at least five of the attorneys would have to make cash payments 
because they had not accrued enough vacation time to replace the money owed. 
</P>
<P>
 But DeNoce said that the attorneys are entitled to the pay raises and would 
not comply. 
</P>
<P>
 In their lawsuit, he said, the lawyers plan to challenge the board's decision 
to freeze salaries and promotions, a decision made without any input from 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not know when the lawsuit against the county would be filed, 
DeNoce said he would be writing a legal memorandum to the auditor-controller 
within the next week or two outlining the attorneys' position. CARLOS V. LOZANO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STEP TAKEN TO EASE JUDGES' CASELOADS

<P>
 Hoping to ease the caseloads for Ventura County's judges, court officials 
announced Thursday that they will hand off some child support cases to a newly 
appointed court commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard attorney Manuel J. Covarrubias, who has served as a judge pro tem in 
family law cases, will become a court commissioner assigned to child support 
and other municipal court cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Covarrubias said in a statement that he had been anxiously awaiting the 
opportunity to work as a court commissioner, whose duties are similar to those 
of a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very gratified to have been selected and . . . I am looking forward to 
taking on the position and challenges and am ready for some hard work," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials said the appointment should help judges lighten their 
calendars so people will not have to sit in the courtroom for hours waiting to 
be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should really help expedite the process," said Florence Prushan, 
assistant executive officer for the courts. "We've been waiting for this for a 
while, and we're excited to get this program started." 
</P>
<P>
 The new position will be funded in part by a federal grant aimed at improving 
the court's ability to handle increasing numbers of child support cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Covarrubias will begin taking cases Jan. 3. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOY SCOUTS' DRIVE TAKES IN $130,000

<P>
 A monthlong drive to fund programs that teach children leadership skills and 
foster responsibility netted the Boy Scouts of America more than $130,000, far 
exceeding past efforts, club leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 A scout auction and golf tournament held during one week in November helped 
raise money for programs that serve more than 7,000 local youths.In previous 
years, the scouts had experienced a decline in donations, dropping as low as 
about $15,000 last year, scout officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers credited this year's fund-raising success on an effort to include 
more local business leaders and corporations in the charity events. 
</P>
<P>
 "When business people support the Scouts, they in effect are showing how much 
they care about our young people," said Jon Light, president of the Ventura 
County Council, which administers all local Scout programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Light said the Scouts used their ingenuity to come up with new campaigns 
to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fund-raising by using candy sales was so competitive that we weren't raising 
much at all," Light said. "We switched to popcorn and it made a world of 
difference. Everyone's fighting for the same money so you have to get 
creative." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: UTILITY WARNS OF HIGH GAS BILLS DUE TO COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County residents cranked up their heaters last month during an 
unusually bitter cold spell -- and this month they are going to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Southern California Gas Co. issued a warning Wednesday that 
customers should expect their gas bills to be four to seven times higher than 
usual as a result of last month's chilly temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "As customers get their bills, they may be surprised," spokeswoman Vicki Cho 
Estrada said. The utility has 203,000 customers in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas usage across Southern California was up by about a third last month 
because more people were using heaters to keep warm, Cho Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
 When customers get their bills this week, a gas-usage comparison will be 
included to explain the sudden price increase, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility traditionally issues warnings in January or February that explain 
bills will be higher as a result of colder weather. But the company rarely 
makes such announcements as early as November, Cho Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The November temperatures were much colder than normal (this year)," she 
said. "That's why we are issuing a warning." TRACY WILSON

THORNTON'S LIFE WAS BLEAK, WITNESSES SAY; TRIAL: DRIFTER ACCUSED OF KILLING 
NURSE KELLIE O'SULLIVAN SLEPT IN HIS CAR UNTIL IT WAS TOWED AWAY, HIS 
GRANDMOTHER SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Before Kellie O'Sullivan's death, Mark Scott Thornton was a homeless teen-ager 
who slept wherever he could -- in his beat-up old car and at a low-budget 
motel, defense witnesses testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses, including Thornton's 68-year-old grandmother, described 
Thornton's life as bleak and bereft of any opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old defendant is charged with murder and could be sentenced to the 
gas chamber in connection with the nurse's death Sept. 14, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly five weeks of testimony from prosecution witnesses, defense 
attorneys began presenting witnesses of their own on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 They seized the opportunity to put forth a defense apparently aimed at 
eliciting juror sympathy for their client. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses told the jury that, before the nurse's slaying, Thornton was 
a high school dropout forced to live on the streets after his parents evicted 
him from their Thousand Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his predicament, Thornton tried to improve his condition, the 
grandmother, Lois Thornton, and others said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sought help from a local charity that provided him with temporary relief, 
according to one witness. Eventually, witnesses said, he resorted to sleeping 
inside his 1976 Datsun B-210, comforting himself with a blanket and an afghan 
pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 But that housing arrangement was ended in October, 1992, when sheriff's 
officials towed his car and ordered it stored. Lacking the money to retrieve 
it, Thornton moved to Oceano in San Luis Obispo County to live with his 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris objected repeatedly to the line of 
questioning, but Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath allowed much of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Thornton shot O'Sullivan in order to steal her Ford Explorer. 
He used the truck to kidnap his girlfriend before being arrested five days 
later. O'Sullivan's body was found in the Santa Monica Mountains 12 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Under direct examination from Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson, Lois 
Thornton gave the most detailed testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Thornton's mother, Markita, was unmarried when Mark Scott was born in 
July, 1974, but his mother married the boy's father two years later. Lois 
Thornton said she helped raise her grandson and was very close to him. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending a meeting with her grandson in October, 1992, at the Conejo 
Valley School, a Thousand Oaks continuation high school, the grandmother asked 
Thornton to live with her. He came two weeks later, after his car had been 
towed away.  
</P>
<P>
 The grandmother did not detail Thornton's problems at school, but testified he 
was "a confused young man, disillusioned" at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 That Thanksgiving, she said, they ate a free dinner at the Veterans Hall in 
Pismo Beach. On Christmas Day, they were fed at a church dinner for the needy. 
The church gave Thornton his only gift: a hand towel and some toiletries, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She said when she tried to enroll Thornton in school in San Luis Obispo, 
school district officials said it did not have a program "suitable for his 
needs." Thornton had been a special-education student, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Thornton said her grandson left her home in February, 1993, having lived 
there three months. 
</P>
<P>
 She visited him on Labor Day, 1993, when he was renting a room in a Thousand 
Oaks home, about two weeks before O'Sullivan's death. During that visit, he 
pulled a gun from under his mattress and showed it to her, Lois Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by defense attorney Olson if she could recall what the gun looked like, 
the grandmother's abrupt response drew laughter: "Yes. A gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, however, did not laugh. He wiped tears from his face. 
</P>
<P>
 When shown the murder weapon under cross-examination, Lois Thornton said it 
could be the same gun she saw that day.

HEARING TO DECIDE FATES OF TWO DOGS; ANIMALS: WITNESSES ACCUSE THE ROTTWEILERS 
OF TRIPPING AND FRIGHTENING THEM. THE OWNER AND FAMILY SAY THE PETS AREN'T 
VICIOUS. 
</P>

<P>
 The fate of their family pets hanging in the balance, Rocky Hale called his 
teen-age daughter to the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you love your dogs?" the father asked, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said Tami Hale, a Newbury Park eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want your dogs to be killed?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do your dogs deserve to be killed?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue were two Rottweilers, Heidi and Rommel, who have repeatedly escaped 
to chase, trip and, it is said, sometimes bite neighbors. In an unusual 
proceeding known as a dangerous-dog hearing that stretched more than four hours 
Thursday, the Hale family fought to save Rommel from a death sentence and Heidi 
from a spaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, an inspector for the Camarillo public works department, vowed to leave 
no stone unturned in the defense of his dogs. Sam Morris, the hearing officer 
from Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control, said the hearing was by far 
the longest he has seen in almost three years of conducting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there were only three or four dangerous-dog hearings a year in 
all of Los Angeles County. A verdict will be announced within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers and fearful neighborhood residents said the dogs were 
dangerous and their owners had proved themselves unable to control them. 
</P>
<P>
 John Andersen said one of the dogs tripped him and bit his running partner at 
6 a.m. on Nov. 16. "I'm still scared," said the 137-pound Andersen, who said he 
runs 70 to 80 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rommel, the male dog and the older of the two, weighs 130 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen suffered scrapes and cuts from his fall, but returned to the 
neighborhood after the attack to assist animal control officers in capturing 
the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Virginia Suggs, said her husband had been attacked by the 
dogs while riding his bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to get off his bike and use his bike as a shield, because the dog was 
still coming on," Suggs said. "He was very scared." 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor, a dog owner herself, described stalking the dogs in a car with a 
camera, trying to get pictures to prove they were running loose. Another dog 
owner accused the Hales of a "lack of concern," because the dogs were out "a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 "I could feel the fear coming up my legs," said one neighbor. "I was afraid 
because they were coming at me and one of them was growling." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said his neighbors disliked him because he played loud music, had a 
broken-down truck in his front yard and owned the large dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, who said he has always wanted to be a lawyer, raised a series of 
questions about the testimony of his neighbors and about the propriety of the 
proceeding itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said Andersen "could have tripped over a pothole. He could have tripped 
over anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the dog did trip Anderson, why didn't it finish off its prey? Hale 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the bodies? Where are the victims?," he asked. "They're 
Rottweilers. They intimidate people, but they are not vicious. People are 
afraid of the breed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said he recently built a dog-proof enclosure in his back yard, believing 
that doing so could avert a dangerous-dog hearing and guarantee the return of 
his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said Animal Control Sgt. Frank Bongiorno had derailed the compromise. 
Bongiorno greeted Hale with a handshake at the start of the hearing, but Hale 
showed nothing but contempt for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd have known it was you I wouldn't have shaken your hand," Hale said to 
Bongiorno. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad blood between the two goes back to June, when, according to testimony, 
Bongiorno threatened the Hales with hefty fines and jail time for failing to 
control their dogs. But Bongiorno said the fines and risk of jail would 
disappear if the Hales would only sign their dog over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have taken his intimidation, our dogs would be dead right now," 
Hale said Thursday. "The man has been vindictive. He's been out to get our 
Rottweilers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bongiorno said Rommel was "aggressive" and a danger to public safety. Heidi, 
when with Rommel, has a "pack mentality," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said he was notified only Tuesday that the hearing was going to take 
place Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not enough time to prepare a case," said Ventura County Humane Society 
President Joyce George, who faxed a statement to Hale Thursday. The statement, 
which Hale read in the board room at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, called 
for the hearing to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to calling his daughter Tami as a witness, Hale also called his 
wife, Peggy, his 17-year old son, Shane, and his 6-year old daughter, Tanya. 
They all testified that the dogs were good-natured. Tanya said Rommel slept on 
the floor next to her bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths said they had taken the dogs to school and to the beach without any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs were being held at the Agoura Animal Shelter and not present at the 
hearing. "They can't testify," said Bob Ballenger of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said he was not optimistic about the dogs' chances. "We'll lose Rommel. 
There's not a doubt in my mind about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, the hearing officer, will recommend a decision to the director of 
animal care and control, who will make a decision on the case. The decision is 
subject to appeal, but Hale said he probably lacks the funds to pursue the case 
further. 
</P>

 Los Angeles County handles animal control for the city of Thousand Oaks under 
a 2-year-old contract.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: SCHOOL BOARD HAS POOR ATTENDANCE RECORD AT DECATHLON 
BANQUET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 MARK THEM ABSENT: The Los Angeles Unified School District's annual Academic 
Decathlon awards banquet earlier this week drew the best and the brightest from 
the city's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't much of a draw for the Board of Education. Only San Fernando 
Valley board member Julie Korenstein showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 The other six board members couldn't make it, according to their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Barbara Boudreaux, had a prior speaking engagement that night. And board 
member Warren Furutani explained, "This is only the second one I've missed in 
eight years. But I've been sick so I'm trying not to go out as much." 
</P>
<P>
 The decathlon, which tests students' knowledge in 10 subjects, is often seen 
as the school system's shining light. Last year, the team from Taft High School 
in Woodland Hills won the local, state and national competitions. This year, 
the team from Marshall High in Los Feliz captured the local title. 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein, who regularly attends the Biltmore Hotel dinner, doesn't even 
represent the winning school nor does she represent their competitors, Taft and 
El Camino Real. But she said the event is "a real shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most exciting thing that L. A. Unified has -- it really is," 
Korenstein said. "With all the headaches and heartaches I go through, this is 
just wonderful and positive. It recharges me. It's great to see the kids -- 
they couldn't be more excited at a football game than they are competing 
against each other academically." 
</P>
<P>
 The banquet, held in a ballroom at the Downtown L.A. hotel, also is attended 
by parents, administrators and teachers. Supt. Sid Thompson not only attended, 
he handed out some of the awards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board members' absences didn't go unnoticed. "Shame on them," sniffed 
one district employee at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OFFICE POLITICS: Ever since City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky won election to 
the County Board of Supervisors, some of his council colleagues have lobbied 
for his coveted post as head of the council's Budget and Finance Commitee. It 
is a role that bestows the power to recommend dramatic changes to the city's 
$3.9-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly as important has been the behind-the-scenes maneuvering to get his 
office space: a roomy, third-floor spread with a view of Mayor Richard 
Riordan's offices across a light well. The digs are appealing because they are 
close to the council chambers, where the members gather three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, office assignments have been decided on the basis of seniority, 
giving veteran lawmakers first shot at roomier suites and leaving newcomers the 
remnants. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Councilman Richard Alarcon has been the only person to formally submit 
a bid for the office with Council President John Ferraro. If successful, 
Alarcon would abandon his second-floor offices, which one City Hall worker once 
described as "a pit." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Jackie Goldberg and Mike Hernandez have also expressed 
interest in Yaroslavsky's office. Of the three, Hernandez has the most 
seniority, having been elected in 1991. Goldberg and Alarcon were elected last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Hall insiders wonder whether it would be logical to postpone the 
game of "musical offices" until after June, when elections for eight council 
seats may spark a new round of moves. One cycle of office rotations may be 
cheaper and easier to coordinate than two, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 But then again, logic does not carry the day at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 RAIL LINE REDUX: When he steps down from the County Board of Supervisors next 
week, Ed Edelman will also be retiring from the chairmanship of the powerful 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. His successor? None other than fellow 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, with whom Edelman battled for years over the 
planned east-west San Fernando Valley rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman won the war in October when the MTA board opted to go with a mostly 
subway system instead of an elevated line over the Ventura Freeway, which 
Antonovich favors. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the passing of the baton, Antonovich will be in a position to guide 
the agency's agenda, which might include some more plumping for the Ventura 
Freeway alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't necessarily mean trying to reverse the decision outright as the 
MTA staff now goes about trying to secure federal funding for the project. 
Habib Balian, Antonovich's transportation deputy, believes the Ventura Freeway 
option will "naturally" look more attractive to the feds because of its lower 
cost -- an issue that might resonate more with Republicans who have taken over 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the change in Washington, now there'll be a rethinking of priorities," 
Balian said. "We still contend that the numbers they used for construction of 
the subway is not feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the east-west Valley line, Balian said, Antonovich will keep tabs on 
other projects important to his district: the Pasadena Blue Line extension and 
a Burbank-Glendale light-rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TRAVELIN' MAN: In some circles, it is desirable to be considered a "jet 
setter." But not when the cost of air miles and hotel accommodations are picked 
up by the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he was elected to the Los Angeles City Council in June, Richard Alarcon 
has racked up the miles by making nine trips to various government conferences 
around the country at a total cost to the taxpayers of $7,835. That does not 
include the trip Alarcon took this week to a conference in Minnesota. That's 10 
trips in 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous trips have taken the freshman lawmaker to Colorado, North 
Carolina, San Francisco and San Diego as well as several jaunts to Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Castro, Alarcon's chief of staff, said the councilman attends many 
meetings of the National League of Cities because he is a member of a committee 
that is studying economic development, a topic vital to his working-class 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very involved," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Valley's other freshman council member, Laura Chick, has 
stuck to her campaign promise of spending no taxpayer money on travel.  
</P>
<P>
 She has, however, charged the city for registration fees to two government 
conferences for a total of $475.

FIORE GETS A TEASING TRIBUTE; THOUSAND OAKS: AT ROAST FOR 30-YEAR COUNCIL 
MEMBER, RETIRING MAYOR IS NEEDLED FOR HIS JUNK-FOOD LOVE AND OTHER HABITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just as plates of elegant mixed baby greens were placed in front of 250 
Thousand Oaks residents and city officials, a Domino's Pizza deliveryman 
arrived in the ballroom of the Hyatt Westlake Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearing high a large pepperoni pizza, he scanned the room then headed directly 
for Alex Fiore's table, depositing the pie in front of the outgoing mayor, who 
laughed then passed out pieces to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the pizza set the tone of a community roast Wednesday night for 
Fiore, a teasing, sometimes tasteless, but nonetheless loving tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore will preside over his last council meeting Tuesday night after 30 years 
on the Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's well-attended roast it was evident that Fiore is known as much 
for his love of junk food as for his longevity on the council. Surprise 
deliveries from Taco Bell and Burger King arrived shortly after the pizza, and 
as the mayor sat down on the dais he was doused with table salt, a lei of hot 
dog links was draped around his neck and a paper crown popped onto his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our Burger King," quipped City Manager Grant Brimhall. 
</P>
<P>
 With Fiore watching warily from one end of the dais, speaker after speaker 
stood up to poke fun at the 68-year-old politician's every bad habit, from 
slipping off to the race track to excessive and unwanted flirtation with women 
at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fiore's wish list, joked Brimhall, would be "low-cut and short dresses for 
the women at City Hall, more makeup, a return to the security of a 
male-dominated society and public recognition that behind every Italian man is 
a voluptuous woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing for effect, Brimhall pointed forward, then to his sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in front of him, and to the left of him and the right of him," he said, 
while Fiore cracked his trademark wide smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Brimhall was one of many during the evening who poked fun at the frequency 
with which Fiore disagrees with council members Elois Zeanah and Jamie 
Zukowski, who did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes time to go to that great council chamber in the sky," he said, 
"I think, Alex, you might make it to heaven, even if it is on a 3-2 vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Larson, area manager for Southern California Edison, was the only woman 
among the nine roasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roast?" she said. "How about a roost. After 30 years, Alex, it's about time 
you stepped down." 
</P>
<P>
 Larson said Fiore's wife, Katy, had filled her in on his home life. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me, 'Every morning he gets up, brushes his teeth and sharpens his 
tongue,' " Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Tigers Manager Sparky Anderson, a longtime winter resident of Thousand 
Oaks, was the master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would only catch an event like this for Alex Fiore," Anderson said, adding 
that he is a big fan of Channel 10, which airs council meetings on Tuesday 
nights. "At times it is funnier than 'Laugh-In.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Switching gears temporarily to a serious note, Anderson brought a round of 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "There ain't ever going to be another Alex Fiore," he said. "Thousand Oaks 
won't have anyone again that cares more about this city than Alex Fiore." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the jokes started flowing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man created this community," said Conejo Chamber of Commerce President 
Steve Rubenstein. "Ask him, he'll tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 The ringleaders of a five-year campaign to recall Fiore are probably buried in 
the cornerstone of the new Civic Arts Plaza, Rubenstein said, while Fiore shook 
his head and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Assistant City Atty. Mike Martello imitated David Letterman, reeling 
off a Top 10 list of the reasons Fiore was retiring, including that he 
"couldn't bear the thought of life without Frank Schillo," that "Domino's 
wouldn't deliver to the new Civic Center," and that wife Katy "found out that 
the council meetings don't last all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Hirschhorn, a composer who has won two Academy Awards, played the piano 
and sang a tribute to Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our greatest pioneers, a hero for 30 years, oh that's the story of 
Alex Fiore," he sang. "A legend who inspires folks, a legend who has done so 
much for Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 The ballroom of the Hyatt was decorated with blown-up photographs of Fiore, as 
a young Navy officer, riding a donkey, standing on a ridgeline above the city 
at sunset, and a shot of him in a sailor suit, clutching a ball and staring 
into the camera. His jaw is set and he looks ready to do battle, even as an 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
 When all the roasters were finished, Fiore had his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost a pleasure to be here this evening," he said, before unleashing 
his acerbic wit on his friends, reminding Rubenstein that he used to work at 
the International House of Pancakes and attorney Chuck Cohen that he remembered 
the days "when you could get 500 bucks of law for five bucks from Chuck. Now 
you get five bucks of law for 500 bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Fiore said he was not offended by any of the jabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course not," he said. "They were mostly all made in jest." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great fun," he added. "I've never had such a good time."

HEAVEN; ARE THERE BRIGHT LIGHTS AND ANGELS? CAN YOU SURF? EVERYBODY'S WONDERING 
WHAT GIVES IN THE AFTERLIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROY RIVENBURG, LOS ANGELES TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 In heaven, Peter Kreeft found himself in an immense cathedral, surrounded by 
thousands of souls dressed in white robes. Suddenly, a door swung open and 
voices whispered, "Hush! Here he comes." Kreeft, assuming it was the Lord, 
watched as "in stumbled a fat, disheveled, bewildered German man." It was 
Ludwig van Beethoven -- and the robed souls welcomed him into Paradise by 
singing the "Ode to Joy" from his Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Kreeft woke up.  
</P>
<P>
 But even though this visit was just a dream, Kreeft knows the place better 
than most people. A philosophy professor at Boston College and author of two 
books on heaven, he is one of the latest in a long line of afterlife explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, heaven has been imagined by poets, debated by theologians and 
mapped out by visionaries who claim to have been there. 
</P>
<P>
 What they describe is a realm of floating lights, colors that can be tasted, 
and creatures with flesh and bone fashioned from emeralds. It is a dimension 
where time runs backward and forward, water turns into glass and -- for Mormons 
-- dead souls rule their own planets. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there is a new surge of speculation about what lies beyond the grave. 
</P>
<P>
 The graying of baby boomers, the passing of their parents and the specter of 
AIDS are "making people think about death," says religion historian Colleen 
McDannell. "People who aren't supposed to be dying are dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Books with such titles as "Embraced by the Light" and "Life After Life" have 
bobbed to the top of bestseller charts. Talk shows buzz with guests recounting 
near-death experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 And philosophers grapple with such questions as, "If heaven isn't in outer 
space, why did Jesus ascend skyward to get there?" "Will Paradise get boring?" 
and even, "Is there surfing in the afterlife?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a place that's supposed to be eternal, the afterlife sure has changed a 
lot over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancient Jews, who sometimes tried to contact the dead through seances, 
believed that all spirits went to a dark, silent underworld cave called Sheol, 
says McDannell, a University of Utah professor who co-authored "Heaven: A 
History" (Yale University Press, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until six centuries before Christ that the concepts of heaven and 
hell began forming. That's when two Jerusalem poets composed Psalms 49 and 73, 
introducing the idea that good people would get preferential treatment after 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 But details were scarce. The original heaven was thought to be an eternal 
study hall, says Richard Hecht, a religious studies professor at UC Santa 
Barbara. The righteous sat at desks, learning from God. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Christianity arrived -- and the concept of heaven lurched through a 
series of transformations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book of Revelation, for instance, the celestial kingdom featured 
lightning, a glass ocean and six-winged, multi-eyed animals guarding the 
Almighty's throne. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 2nd Century, it had metamorphosed into a land of 
free-flowing wine, banquets and super-fertile humans giving birth to platoons 
of children. That, in turn, gave way to St. Augustine's mysterious vision. 
</P>
<P>
 While sitting in a villa in Italy, Augustine wrote, he and his mother were 
transported to Paradise, an experience so emotionally intense that she lost all 
desire for earthly pleasures. "The (vision) had severed her from worldly 
attachments as well as loosening her soul from her body," McDannell and 
co-author Bernhard Lang write. "Within a fortnight, (she) was dead." Later 
images of heaven reflected cultural trends, the authors say. As cities came to 
prominence in the 12th and 13th centuries, heaven took on an urban look, with 
buildings and streets made of jasper, gold and pearls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Renaissance produced a sensuous afterlife of fragrant gardens, angelic 
melodies and the ability to kiss another person from thousands of miles away 
"with the same pleasure as when the lips actually meet," they write. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, concepts of Paradise have seesawed between austere, God-centered 
eternities and earthly landscapes full of activity. The latter became 
especially popular after a middle-aged Swedish mining official's alleged visit 
to the next world. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1744, the story goes, Emanuel Swedenborg encountered a supernatural force 
that hurled him to the ground, forced him to pray and then took him to the land 
of the dead. What he saw -- parks, cities, strange weddings and "garments that 
shown like flaming light" -- started an avalanche of afterlife speculation, 
McDannell says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, more than 50 books about heaven were published between 
1830 and 1875. And by the turn of the century, the increasingly modern 
hereafter was equipped with theaters, time-travel machines, amusement parks, 
suburbs and schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Mark Twain jumped into the debate, slamming one account -- which 
envisioned departed souls playing pianos, eating gingersnaps and living in 
Victorian cottages -- as "a mean little 10-cent heaven about the size of Rhode 
Island." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, although nearly 80% of Americans say they believe in heaven, the old 
imagery has lost much of its allure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the skies roll back like a scroll and the angelic trump sounds," says 
author Kreeft, "many will simply yawn and say, 'Pretty good special effects, 
but the plot's too traditional.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Clerics and theologians also seem jaded. Some no longer believe in an 
afterlife; others ignore heaven in favor of social justice issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even evangelicals shy away from this topic," McDannell says. "They are 
focused on the Bible and it doesn't give a lot of clues (to what heaven is 
like). It's more exciting to talk about (Armageddon) than about whether we'll 
have harps or electric guitars (in Paradise).  
</P>
<P>
 "So what's happening, more than ever, is that there's a gap between 
intellectual, seminary-trained ministers and the average person. Theology is 
not providing any reassurance about what will happen to people after death," so 
the vacuum is being filled by movies, books, near-death visions and alternative 
religions.  
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's "theologians," for instance, have presented their versions of the 
great beyond in such films as "Ghost," "Defending Your Life" and Diane Keaton's 
documentary, "Heaven." In the latter, one boy theorizes that the deceased will 
walk on cotton balls, eat pale food and -- as a result of heavenly sex -- give 
birth to "little dead people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports columnists, too, are turning into amateur Augustines. Scott Ostler, in 
a 1993 piece on Paradise, imagined God's kingdom as a realm with "absolutely no 
Astroturf or phony, man-made surfaces for any sport. Even billiards will be 
played on real grass." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most startling accounts of the afterlife, however, come from 
people who have "died" and been brought back to life.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the imagery is reminiscent of LSD hallucinations. Near-death returnees 
speak of "imbibing colors" and being permeated by fragrances or music. On a 
recent episode of NBC's "The Other Side," a boy who nearly drowned at age 4 
recalled traveling through a rainbow-colored tunnel to a cathedral full of 
shimmering crystals. He also spoke telepathically with a bumblebee. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ex-deceased talked about "being in the presence of a golden tree made 
of millions of tiny lights," says Mally Cox-Chapman, a Connecticut journalist 
whose book "The Case for Heaven" is due out in spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox-Chapman suggests that the estimated 8 million near-death experiences in 
recent years are God's way of helping modern society to believe in an 
afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an Ezekiel or Mohammed were in the world today," she says, "they'd be 
diagnosed as delusional and locked up. So we have people in our high-tech 
temples (hospitals) telling our high-tech priests (doctors) that they've been 
to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, back-from-beyond episodes date to ancient times. The apostle Paul, 
possibly after being stoned and left for dead in Lystra, wrote that he was 
temporarily taken to heaven. And medieval records have yielded scores of 
afterlife eyewitnesses, although the testimonies differ significantly from 
their 1990s counterparts.  
</P>
<P>
 During the Middle Ages, most people went to hell or Purgatory, says Carol 
Zaleski, a religion professor at Smith College and author of "Otherworld 
Journeys: Accounts of Near-Death Experience in Medieval and Modern Times" 
(Oxford University Press, 1987). Also, those who did reach heaven were more 
likely to meet the patron saint of their church than to reunite with relatives, 
as is now commonly reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, skeptics ascribe near-death visions to a combination 
of cultural influences and biochemical reactions in the brain, which continues 
to function several minutes after the heart stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of Betty J. Eadie's best-selling story, "Embraced by the Light" (Gold 
Leaf Press, 1992), note that she claims to have revived after being dead up to 
several hours -- a medically impossible feat -- and that she refuses to release 
hospital records. Other observers are amused that all the New Agers who admire 
her book apparently don't realize that Eadie is Mormon and that her work is 
infused with Latter-day Saint teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book is very LDS," McDannell says. "It fits in quite nicely (with Mormon 
theology)." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that accounts for some of its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Christian churches have given up any kind of ritual connection with the 
dead," McDannell says. "But people want that . . . (especially) when they lose 
someone they love. Mormon (rituals) allow you to help someone after they're 
dead. And I think that's one of the reasons their religion is growing so 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mormon heaven -- a place of glass and flames -- families will reunite and 
be given control of their own planets. Like God, a former human himself in LDS 
theology, resurrected Mormons become divine beings who populate these new 
planets by having sex and sending their spirit offspring to inhabit mortal 
bodies.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other speculation about heaven involves everything from time travel to 
surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 To explain the vagaries of eternal time and space, for example, Kreeft 
steamrolls past Einstein's theory of relativity to create a fifth dimension 
(no, not the pop-soul group of the late '60s) and even a sixth dimension.  
</P>
<P>
 "Time is like a floor, and our lives in time are like buckets of water spilled 
out along that floor," he writes in "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About 
Heaven . . . but Never Dreamed of Asking" (Ignatius, 1990). "Eternity is like 
all the water gathered together in a bucket." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, time travel becomes possible. On Earth, "the past is dead and closed and 
therefore unchangeable. . . . But for those in eternity, all time is alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth dimension is also where Jesus went during his ascension, Kreeft 
says: The Bible passage that describes him rising into the clouds "was not 
meant literally, as if you could follow him in an airplane and watch him pierce 
the stratosphere. But I don't think it was just symbolic, either. I think (the 
apostles) saw something (real). He moved upward and changed dimensions 
simultaneously." 
</P>
<P>
 Another mystery Kreeft ponders is the possibility of afterlife surfing. "I ask 
myself seriously if (it exists) because it is the most mystical experience I 
know on Earth," he explains. And Kreeft believes all earthly pleasures are a 
foretaste of heavenly joys. 
</P>
<P>
 His conclusion: Wave-riding might not take place literally, but "it isn't 
zapped away (either). It will be perfected and intensified . . . (into) surfing 
in God." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that brings up the boredom-frustration dilemma: If heaven is 
changeless perfection, won't people eventually get tired of it? Likewise, if 
perfection is always just out of reach, won't people be eternally frustrated? 
</P>
<P>
 There are no easy answers, concedes Father Augustine DiNoia, a theologian for 
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. "I think we have to trust God on 
that one. . . . He is infinitely interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 DiNoia compares Paradise to having friends over to watch a football game. "The 
game is important, but being together is what people look forward to. . . . 
Heaven is like any (earthly) fellowship, only to the nth degree. . . . It is an 
ultimate personal communion with God and other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers prefer more traditional descriptions of the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Burton Russell, working on a heaven history to complement his 
four-volume set on the devil, is mesmerized by Dante's surreal vision of rivers 
of liquid light and flesh and bone of emerald. 
</P>
<P>
 McDannell and Lang write about Martin Luther's afterlife, in which "the Elbe 
River will flow with pearls and precious stones, the sky will be able to send a 
shower of coins, and trees may have silver leaves (and) golden apples."  
</P>
<P>
 "Today's theologians have gotten too abstract," Russell says. "The tradition 
is much more powerful."  
</P>
<P>
 Another holdover from the past is Purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of the most surprising developments in modern heavenology is that 
a concept once considered anathema by Protestants is winning endorsement from 
evangelicals and fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some major, big-name (conservative) theologians who now believe in 
an 'intermediate stage' before heaven," says Gary R. Habermas, co-author of 
"Immortality" and a philosophy professor at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University. 
"They don't call it Purgatory, but there's not a big difference between what 
they're saying and what Kreeft describes." 
</P>
<P>
 Kreeft, drawing on the writings of C.S. Lewis, another evangelical favorite, 
likens Purgatory to a sort of cosmic bathroom, "where you wash up for heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment of death, we are still imperfect," he says. There has to be a 
place where a life review occurs and "all the effects on your character from 
sins, vices, bad habits and ignorances are washed away."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone wants to get to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 In the goofy Weekly World News supermarket tabloid, for example, a Pittsburgh 
man who supposedly died and went to hell before doctors revived him says 
Satan's kingdom is a better bet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's loaded with fast cars, free booze, babes in bikinis, slot machines and 
greasy fried food, he reported. "When (they) told me it wasn't my time yet, I 
was really disappointed. . . . I want to be having fun with all those dudes 
down there. But I guess Satan has plans for me here on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old bachelor also said he intends to lead a sinful life so he 
doesn't end up in heaven by mistake: "I know where the fun is now. No way do I 
want to spend eternity with a bunch of boring goody two-shoes in Paradise." 
Which Way, L.A.?

hell. For a reprise of that story, check the TimesLink on-line service,

PRAY TELL: QUESTIONS ABOUT HEAVEN

<P>
 Where is heaven? Possibly in Oregon. There, a self-described "bureaucrat for 
Jesus" named Paul Revere has been issuing Kingdom of Heaven license plates and 
passports from a 34-acre estate that he says belongs to God. Oregon officials 
aren't quite convinced, noting that Heaven owes more than $10,000 in property 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there animals in the afterlife? Thomas Aquinas, the great medieval 
Catholic theologian, said no. But others -- including an Anglican archbishop 
who believes monkeys have immortal souls -- contend that God will renew and 
perfect all creation in the next world. Even "ants, bugs and all unpleasant, 
stinking creatures will be most delightful and have a wonderful fragrance," 
predicted Protestant reformer Martin Luther. Scholars disagree over whether 
dead pets will be resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there sex after death? Not likely. Although a case has been made in the 
past for celestial sex (medieval visionaries saw virgin women receiving kisses 
and sensual embraces from Christ, and 19th-Century clergy allowed for 
lovemaking between reunited spouses), most theologians don't buy it. They note 
that Jesus said there would be no marriage in heaven, and that post-mortem 
procreation seems illogical. Not to worry, though. "Spiritual intercourse" with 
God and other souls will reportedly make earthly sex seem insignificant. People 
who worry about no sex in heaven are like children who wonder if they will be 
able to eat candy during intercourse, philosophers say. They can't imagine a 
pleasure so fantastic it renders candy obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Will rock music be allowed inside the Pearly Gates? In theory, yes, says 
heaven expert Peter Kreeft. Even if rock composers end up in hell, their tunes 
could be saved under a philosophical ploy called "spoiling the Egyptians." Just 
as the Israelites justified plundering gold from Pharaoh because it was for 
God's service, early Christians decided they could lift ideas from pagan 
philosophers because "all truth is God's truth." Kreeft concludes that "good 
music written by bad people belongs to heaven by right." OK, but what happens 
to disco? 
</P>
<P>
 Is there food in the next world?: Jesus dined after the Resurrection, so it 
stands to reason that other residents of heaven also will be able to eat -- 
although purely for pleasure, not survival, theologians say.

THE GOODS; THE PUPPY CHASE; BUYING A NEW PET SHOULDN'T BE DONE ON A LARK. DO 
SOME PLANNING, ASK QUESTIONS AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY FOR A LONG TERM

 People select dogs for all kinds of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jack Russell terrier is currently the canine flavor of the month, due to 
the charms of Eddie, the Jack Russell starring on TV's "Frasier." In other 
times, "101 Dalmatians" and "Beethoven" upped the popularity -- and the prices 
-- of Dalmatians and St. Bernards. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though it's tempting to fall in love with a dog on-screen or even 
bring home the adorable puppy for Christmas, selecting a companion of years' 
duration requires planning and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a dog comes into my house and pees on my rug, it's there for life," says 
Warren Eckstein, author of "How to Get Your Dog to Do What You Want" (Fawcett, 
1994).  
</P>
<P>
 If you've made the decision to get a dog for someone for Christmas, it's best 
to wrap up a leash or biscuit with a note from Santa saying, "Puppy on the way 
-- later." 
</P>
<P>
 A new pet requires a safe, nurturing environment. Glass ornaments and easily 
toppled trees, poinsettia and mistletoe, turkey bones and chocolate are all 
puppy hazards. In the middle of the Christmas rush, puppies can't get the kind 
of undivided attention they need those first few days away from the litter. 
Then, "When things get back to normal after the holidays, the last thing people 
want to do is housebreak the puppy or stop it from chewing up their new 
Christmas gifts," Eckstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 When the time comes to get your puppy, the advantages of buying a purebred are 
that you can be quite sure how large it will grow and what it will look like, 
and you'll be able to make an educated guess about its adult personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best source for a puppy is a responsible breeder who is concerned first 
with health and temperament and second with appearance," says Wayne Cavanaugh, 
vice president of communications for the American Kennel Club. It's important 
to select a breeder with a good reputation and with whom you feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the breeder if you can speak to former buyers and the veterinarian who 
cares for the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspect the kennels for cleanliness and check the temperament of the adult 
dogs. Don't be put off by a breeder who asks you questions about your 
qualifications to care for a dog. "The more questions you are asked, the more 
responsible the breeder probably is," Cavanaugh says. 
</P>
<P>
 For a good indication of how a puppy will look and behave, study the dam and 
sire. When possible, ask to see the grandparents as well. If either parent 
growls at you, keep looking. "The mother shouldn't display shyness or 
aggression," Cavanaugh says. "During lactation, it's common for the mother to 
lose some of her coat, but she shouldn't have mange or sores." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedigrees are family trees that indicate how tightly the parents and litter 
have been bred. In-breeding between fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, 
and brothers and sisters should be attempted only by breeders with decades of 
knowledge and experience, Cavanaugh says. The degree to which dogs can be 
line-bred to other relatives depends on the size of the breed's gene pool and 
the breeder's expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Observe the litter at 7 or 8 weeks -- old enough to leave the mother. Avoid 
the shy puppy in the back of the box as well as the one teething on your hand. 
Novice dog owners are best off with moderately active pups that greet them and 
then back off. Watch the pup that interests you for as long as possible to see 
how it interacts with people and its littermates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The puppy should be plump and lively with sparkling eyes and a shiny coat," 
Eckstein says. "His breath should be fresh, his gums firm and pink, and his 
teeth should be white. The rear should be clean, not encrusted with feces, 
which could indicate diarrhea or some other illness." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how healthy a pup appears, it should be taken immediately to a 
veterinarian for an examination. The vet can tell you which defects are typical 
of specific breeds and check for them. For example, deafness is a problem among 
Dalmatians. Shar-peis routinely suffer from skin and eye problems, and breeds 
with dropped ears -- such as basset hounds -- are susceptible to ear infections 
and ear mites. 
</P>
<P>
 Because hip dysplasia is common in medium-sized and large breeds, make sure 
the breeder has had the parents -- and preferably also the grandparents -- 
certified by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals. 
</P>
<P>
 For any breed, but especially spaniels and collies, experts also recommend 
that the sire and dam have a recent certification by the Canine Eye Registry 
Foundation. The certification, in the areas of night blindness and progressive 
retinal atrophy, is valid for only one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeders should be able to supply both CERF and OFA numbers for the dam and 
sire. Do not take the breeder's word that the parents' hips and eyes are 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 When you buy a purebred puppy, don't leave the kennel without a blue slip. 
This is not the dog's actual registration, but the application to register the 
animal with the AKC should you wish to. Also, you should have a guarantee that 
you can take the puppy to a veterinarian and if it is found defective, it will 
be replaced or your money refunded. 
</P>
<P>
 Man's best friend doesn't come cheap. The going rate for a "pet-quality" 
purebred puppy is $300 to $500; show-quality puppies run $400 to $800. Older 
dogs with ribbons and titles can fetch several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the basic laws of supply and demand, a dog's popularity, lineage and 
availability largely dictate its price. Fashion and fad are also key in the 
pricing equation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike cars, there is no sticker price when it comes to puppies," says Sue 
Stalioraitis, who manages the classified advertising in Dog World magazine. 
"AKC papers and price do not denote quality. It's really buyer beware."

SOME WAYS TO ENSURE YOU GET THE PICK OF THE LITTER

 Choosing a dog is like choosing a roommate. By boning up on the physical and 
temperamental characteristics of various breeds, owners can narrow down the 
choices to those that best fit their personalities and lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the dog be good with young children? Certain hardy, mellow breeds such as 
the golden retriever and Labrador retriever are widely regarded as excellent 
family pets, while breeds such as the Pekingese and Yorkshire terrier are 
considered too snappish around youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Will you have time to exercise the dog properly? Weimaraners and Dalmatians 
require a great deal of exercise, while others such as basset hounds and 
Newfoundlands are more lethargic. Are you looking for a watchdog? Rottweilers 
and German shepherds make classic guard dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are having trouble telling a Shih Tzu from a Lhasa apso or a Welsh 
springer spaniel from an English springer spaniel, there are many good 
resources. Breeders, trainers and veterinarians can provide valuable, 
breed-specific information; dog shows are an excellent way to see various 
breeds in action. Or unleash yourself at the pet section of a library or 
bookstore. Here is a sampling of canine resources: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Perfect Puppy: How to Choose Your Dog by Its Behavior," Benjamin L. Hart, 
DVM, and Lynette Hart; W.H. Freeman and Co., 1988. Ranks 56 breeds according to 
behavioral traits of concern to owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Right Dog for You," Daniel F. Tortora; Simon & Schuster, 1980. Provides a 
systematic approach to choosing a compatible dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedigree Selectadog. To find out which breeds are best suited for a particular 
lifestyle, send for a questionnaire to 3250 E. 44th St., Vernon, Calif. 90058.

breeds from the sporting, hound, working, terrier, toy, non-sporting and 
herding groups. AKC Customer Service Department, 5580 Centerview Drive,

 Many who seek pets prefer the lower cost and good feeling of rescuing an 
animal from a pound or shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed-breed dogs can be healthier and more even-tempered than purebreds.But in 
picking a mutt, experts recommend using as much caution as when buying from a 
breeder. At the shelter, ask to visit with the dog away from the caged area and 
barking dogs. Take the animal to the vet before taking it home and falling in 
love with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shyness may be an indication of abuse. But this shouldn't necessarily deter 
prospective owners. "Just because a dog has a bad background, doesn't mean it's 
a bad dog," says author Warren Eckstein. "It may just need some tender love and 
care. Sometimes abused dogs turn out to be the best dogs in the world." SUSAN

'IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE'; DEATH: THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR CAN 
LEARN A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE FROM WHAT THEY LEAVE BEHIND -- HOW THEY LIVED, THEIR 
JOYS . . . AND THEIR FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sandy West, a call girl-turned-millionaire, had a peculiar request: to be 
buried wearing her favorite nightgown in the driver's seat of her red Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 After she died of a drug overdose in 1977, it would take a crane to hoist the 
sports-car-size concrete casket into a six-plot-wide grave and $26,000 to carry 
out her wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchestrating the funeral were Lonnie Armstead and his staff at L.A. County's 
public administrator's office. Unknown to many, these 32 public officials 
typically handle money matters for people who die alone. 
</P>
<P>
 They confiscate and liquidate the property of those without heirs, generating 
about $1 million for the state general fund. And in cases in which heirs are 
feuding over an inheritance, the public administrator acts as the decedent's 
guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 By sifting through diaries, letters, tax returns and bank statements, the 
administrators determine the value of someone's life and resolve any financial 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "We see people through their property," Armstead says. "They're not dead to 
us. We see the pain in their life, the joys. By the end of the investigation, 
we feel like we know the person intimately." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his 23 years as a public administrator, Armstead has come across 
millionaires who lived in poverty and bitter heirs who hoarded riches. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army surplus store owner, for example, left $300,000 to his six children. 
But when they began fighting over assets excluded from the will, a public 
administrator intervened to sniff out and inventory all of his worldly goods 
for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the man lived in a rundown Long Beach home, he had squirreled away a 
fortune in safes stored at his children's homes and in remote areas. 
Administrators unearthed $1.5 million in gold and silver bars in a bolted safe 
buried near Riverside. But even with that treasure and more to divvy up, the 
heirs' squabbling continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family was so picky that they complained about things like a $2 straw and 
a bag of plastic forks that weren't inventoried," Armstead says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 400 to 500 cases his office oversees every month, a few involve public 
figures, such as Howard Hughes or Herve Villechaize of "Fantasy Island." But 
the case of the call girl, Armstead says, was one of his most extraordinary and 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials conservatively estimated West's worth at $12 million. Born into 
poverty, she survived as a young woman through "low-level" prostitution, rising 
to become a Beverly Hills call girl who earned up to $500 a night. By 28, she 
had married into a multimillion-dollar Texas fortune, garnering a 
$300,000-a-month allowance. She once rented out the former Perinos Restaurant, 
a then-exclusive Hollywood spot, for a private $33,000 lunch with her dog, 
Armstead says. 
</P>
<P>
 West left behind two wills and six feuding potential heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years of legal wrangling, the public administrator sold her assets -- 
everything from a $1-million stamp, wine and jewelry collections to exotic dogs 
to her Beverly Hills estate -- paid her creditors and divided the remaining 
funds among the heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other cases have been pending for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The public administrator's office generally steps in either when property goes 
unclaimed or when the probate court assigns it to mediate among heirs. Deputy 
administrators must meticulously comb each room in a home or business, 
identifying and recording each item and tagging it with a price. A trucking 
company moves in next, packaging and sealing all materials into 4-by-8-foot 
wooden crates for storage in a 75,000-square-foot Pico Rivera warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a large variety of property -- just as wide as the population we deal 
with," Armstead says. "One day we'll find a Skid Row derelict in a $150 
apartment room. The next day it's an international wheeler dealer.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are all kinds of stories of people and what they do. It's amazing how 
people live."  
</P>
<P>
 He recalls the case of the millionaire stock investor who was found dead in a 
Skid Row hotel room. He had eaten the same meals in the same restaurant for 20 
years, Armstead says, and had stuffed rolls of money inside the room's walls.  
</P>
<P>
 And who could forget the bird man, a recluse whose 1,000-bird collection of 
canaries and parakeets left an inch-thick layer of waste throughout the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Such deaths often leave unanswered questions, Armstead explains. Once 
auctioned off, that which once defined a person's identity quietly dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time people think of death, it's usually a bad thing," says David 
Nelson, general manager of Nationwide Auction House, the contractor for the 
public administrator's office.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of disheartening to think sometimes that somebody's possessions for 
80 years all have to be sold. It makes you think about your own life."

RSVP; BALLET FANS PARTY DOWN BEFORE 'ROMEO'

 Business talk gradually began to give way to musings on art and romance as the 
straight-from-the-office, business-suited crowd mingled at the pre-performance 
reception for the San Francisco Ballet's production of "Romeo and Juliet" on 
Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The party was underwritten by 
J.P. Morgan & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Stick-on name tags were handed out so there would be no mistaking who was who 
at the party in the Pavilion's Salvatori Room. A few women, especially those 
wearing currently fashionable velvet, weren't too keen on the idea. "I'm not 
putting mine on. It ruins your clothes," declared Shirlee Fonda, who arrived 
with Connie Wald as guests of Sunnie Evers, a San Francisco Ballet executive 
committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 Those contented to be tagged included Felisa Vanoff, who was hosting Martin 
Manulis, Doug Cramer, Jill Cartter, Alan and Nancy Livingston, the Getty 
Museum's Harold Williams, Caroline Ahmanson and Jan Del Amo. 
</P>
<P>
 While guests feasted from the buffet table on three types of pasta and 
super-rich petit fours -- sustenance for the upcoming three acts of dance -- 
James Doolittle, who is presenting the ballet company's six performances, said: 
"I think one of the reasons I love presenting dance is because, of all the 
performing arts, it's the one that gets tremendous response from the young."  
</P>
<P>
 There were some children in the crowd, among them actress Mary McDonnell's 
daughter, Olivia, eager to see her first professional ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing herself as "an old hoofer" who had danced on Broadway before 
turning comedian, Rita Rudner admitted ballet had never been her forte. "I had 
good extension, good turnout, good jumps, but bad feet. Once when I auditioned 
for ballet, I was told to try typing." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Randa Haines, who said she hopes to make a movie about ballroom 
dance, said she dances salsa. "I fell into it accidentally about seven years 
ago when someone took me to a salsa club and in a couple of hours I moved from 
complete indifference to total passion."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, ex-FBI Director William Sessions happily expressed pride in his 
dancing daughter, 24-year-old Sara, who performs as Lady Capulet. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll get to see her, with her flaming red hair, tearing across the stage in 
a rage," he said, something his listeners found an accurate description.

ORANGE COUNTY CALENDAR; PIANO TRIO GETS TO THE HEART OF RAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beethoven and Brahms composed from the heart, as everyone knows. But Ravel? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, as the Golub-Kaplan-Carr Trio showed in a program of these 
composers sponsored by the Laguna Chamber Music Society and the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society on Wednesday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Composed on the eve of the World War I, Ravel's Trio in A minor usually 
emerges as the composer's deliberate effort to remain objective and cool rather 
than to reflect the traumatic time his society had entered. Not in the hands of 
pianist David Golub, violinist Mark Kaplan and cellist Colin Carr, however. And 
more power to them. 
</P>
<P>
 From passing easily in the first two movements between bucolic insouciance and 
surging cross rhythms -- and clarifying the music's structure in the process -- 
the players turned to heavier stuff in the third, the Passacaille, venturing a 
deeply felt protest of mounting desolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs was a muscular and complex interpretation, and, in juxtaposition with 
it, the opening measures of the finale emerged as a spectral sunrise. Life -- 
or maybe simply energy -- goes on: But it achieves no special catharsis. 
</P>
<P>
 At a less demanding level, Beethoven's infrequently encountered Fourteen 
Variations on an Original Theme in E-flat, Opus 44, also allows a survey of 
various emotions, as the composer takes a couple of nondescript, meandering 
arpeggios for a base to pursue episodes of wit, good-natured humor and darker 
moodiness. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't do it with supreme cohesion or well-apportioned equality among the 
three instruments, however. But the musicians here found the appropriate air of 
improvisatory spontaneity that suited the composer's nimble shifts in 
character, without losing their nuanced and responsive ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 They closed the program with a magisterial and sensitive interpretation of 
Brahms' Piano Trio in B, which, if it did not probe all the depths of this 
remarkable score, still richly responded to its warmth and nobility. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical problems of balancing the three instruments surfaced despite the 
forward placing of the violin and the cello. On this occasion, the piano tended 
to dominate. Still, the music-making remained vibrant and compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scherzo from Brahms' Trio in C minor was the encore.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOWL GAMES; TOWNSEND TRADES GLORY FOR HIS TEAM'S SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Townsend of Rancho Santiago heard the speech by defensive coordinator 
Tom Nelson early last summer and said a gigantic smile washed over his face. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The news was awesome. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago was switching defensive schemes to one similar to the "Desert 
Swarm" made famous by Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 As a defensive end, Townsend had one responsibility in the new method. "They 
told us that all the ends did was go after the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, from Villa Park High, spent his summer dreaming of sacks and the 
big-time scholarship offers that were sure to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 But five days before the first game, Nelson and his staff tinkered with the 
lineup. Townsend was moved to the "whip" linebacker spot, where he was 
responsible for playing the run and pass. There were other changes in the unit 
as well, and the somewhat confused Dons were beaten soundly by El Camino, 
55-28, in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't have people in the right spots yet," Coach Dave Ogas said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Already depressed from the loss, Townsend, 6 feet 3 and 230 pounds, was given 
more bad news at the next practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He was being moved to defensive tackle. Now his primary job was to take on 
blockers and free others to get sacks and tackles.  
</P>
<P>
 "He made a sacrifice for the team," Ogas said. "I know he didn't want to do it 
but he did. He's the real nucleus of our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend didn't hide his disappointment about the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "End is such a glory position," he said. "I really had my heart set on it. I 
was frustrated and let them know. I couldn't get anything right at first (at 
tackle). It was a whole new position to learn, but coach (Joe Jacobs) has 
really helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the loss, Rancho Santiago has won nine games in a row (all with Townsend 
starting at tackle) and is ranked sixth in the nation and No. 1 in Southern 
California. The Dons play Los Angeles Valley (9-1) in the Simple Green Orange 
County Bowl at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that Townsend's sacrifice has helped the team, but it did 
cost him in statistics. Doubled-teamed on almost every play, he has one sack 
and 26 total tackles. Meanwhile, defensive ends Kent Miller and Dustin Williams 
have combined for 21 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Townsend, an All-Mission Conference Central Division second-team 
selection, isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is by far the most fun I've ever had on a team," he said. "None of us 
want this season to end. I'm totally going to miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend's opinions on everything are hardly a secret around the Rancho 
Santiago program. He's a member of Dons Corp, a group of players Ogas honors 
for their leadership ability. The group meets every Friday before games to 
discuss the direction of the team and to air complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of those guys that when he talks the players listen," Ogas said. "As 
coaches, we listen to him as well." 
</P>
<P>
 But Townsend, 20, initially didn't offer his views aloud. He said he was 
intimidated for about the first half of last season and remained quiet as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the season progressed, he played more and his confidence rose. He 
slowly became the vociferous person who criticizes teammates for not working 
hard in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He was added to the Don Corp late last season and was elected again this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my pet-peeve," he said about players relaxing in practice. "But 
sometimes they tell me if I'm yelling too much." Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Fuentes set a Rancho Santiago single-season record for touchdown passes 
with 19. The Dons will be without starting fullback Kevin Pola (496 yards and 
11 touchdowns) and defensive back and special teams player Fernando Salas. Both 
were ejected in Rancho Santiago's victory over Saddleback in the regular-season 
finale and must sit out the next game under Mission Conference rules.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; SCC COACH WONDERS IF STRATEGY WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California College men's basketball Coach Bill Reynolds occasionally 
gives his team a chance to play against higher-level competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Vanguards played Utah and Southeast Missouri State. Texas El 
Paso is a good possibility next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, SCC played San Diego State of the Western Athletic Conference, and as 
expected, lost, 76-54. But Reynolds isn't sure of how big a step up the 
Vanguards took this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, they are not a very good Division I team," he said. "I'd be 
surprised if they could win a game in the WAC this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a lot of talent but we aren't competing very well right now." 
</P>
<P>
 SCC (2-2) has been hampered by injuries. Kevin Carlson, from Fullerton College 
and Katella High, has had a chipped bone in his foot and a dislocated finger 
and played for the second time Wednesday in a 78-66 victory over Christian 
Heritage. Chauncey Woolridge, from Orange Coast, Cal State Fullerton and Santa 
Ana High, played for the first time against San Diego State after recovering 
from a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolridge and Chris Kostoff, a shooting guard from Capistrano Valley High, 
Irvine Valley College and the University of San Diego, made a combined three of 
19 shots from the field against San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC next has a three-game trip to the Bay Area, playing Bethany on Friday in 
Scotts Valley, Dominican on Saturday in San Rafael and Holy Names on Monday in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Christian Coach Lee Erickson also tests his team against higher-level 
competition, and the Royals, who play in the National Christian College 
Athletic Assn. Division II, are amid a stretch of three tough teams. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to the NAIA's Concordia, 109-68, Wednesday, and to NCAA Division 
II Cal State Dominguez Hills, 106-97, Thursday, the Royals (6-3) play Division 
III Cal Lutheran Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for us to play higher, for us to have to play above our comfort 
level," Erickson said. "We have a number of stretches like this and they will 
help us be competitive during playoff time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Christian, the NCCAA Division II runner-up last season, is ranked No. 
1 this year. Senior Charles Ross, a two-time All-American, is averaging 28 
points and 13 rebounds and junior Chuck Henderson is averaging 19 points and 
seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No edge: Accustomed to losing, the Chapman women's basketball team had trouble 
Tuesday when it took the lead against Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers led by five early in the second half, but couldn't hold the lead 
and eventually lost, 85-74. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we take the lead, we tend to relax a little bit instead of pouring it 
on," Chapman Coach Mary Hegarty said. "If we don't find that edge we are going 
to be in close games the rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Hegarty said the Panthers also missed too many easy shots and didn't rebound 
well, giving up 17 offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up is a game at Cal State Los Angeles tonight.

SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' TENNIS INDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONSHIPS; VAUGHAN'S RUN COMES TO 
HALT IN QUARTERFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corona del Mar's Nina Vaughan was good for one upset, but mental and physical 
exhaustion caught up with her Thursday in the Southern Section Individual 
tennis quarterfinals. Her remarkable freshman season ended with a 5-7, 6-4, 
6-3, loss to Santa Barbara San Marcos' Kara Warkentin at the Lindborg Racquet 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was being really aggressive, hitting a lot of angles and moving me 
around," Vaughan said. "She knew I was tired and was running me around." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan defeated third-seeded Brandi Freudenberg of El Modena, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1, 
in the round of 16, making it Freudenberg's earliest tournament exit in four 
years. She reached the semifinals as a freshman and junior and the 
quarterfinals as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tight," said Freudenberg, who has signed a letter of intent with UCLA. 
"I came out really slow. I wasn't moving well at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Freudenberg's sluggishness had to with a quadriceps muscle she pulled 
in the girls' 18 nationals last week in Detroit. Still, she won the last four 
games of the second set and appeared to have momentum heading into the third 
set. But a 10-minute break seemed to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had time to stiffen up," she said. "I didn't want to take a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan, who complained of being tired between sets, went out and hit winner 
after winner and wiped out Freudenberg in the last set, 6-1. The baseline 
winners kept coming for Vaughan in the first set against Warkentin, who beat 
Vaughan, 6-4, during the season. But she hit the wall in the second set and 
Warkentin began dictating the points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just played three, third-set tiebreakers last week in St. Louis (at the 
girls' 14 indoors) and I didn't get back until Monday," Vaughan said. "I've 
just played too much tennis. I need a couple days off." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustion wasn't the problem for Villa Park's Faye DeVera, but Palos Verdes 
Peninsula's Amanda Basica's forehand and steady play was. After beating Los 
Angeles Marlborough's Kate Callaghan, 7-5, 6-2, in the round of 16, DeVera was 
beaten by the top-seeded Basica, the world's 12th-ranked player in the girls' 
18 division, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to come in off her high balls, but my timing was off and I shanked a 
few and almost hit some people on the other court," DeVera said. "So I stopped 
trying that." 
</P>
<P>
 DeVera and Freudenberg were hoping for better draws, especially after 
second-seeded Violette Ahn of Beverly Hills pulled out with an illness before 
the tournament began. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have redone the draw," Freudenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said DeVera: "When I saw the draw, I laughed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills' Michelle Johnson and Katie Tierney weren't laughing after blowing 
leads in all three sets to Peninsula's Alyson and Shana Gray in the 
quarterfinals before losing, 7-6 (7-2), 5-7, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just weren't focused to play in the third set," Tierney said. "We just 
didn't have the desire. We were ahead and playing good, but we got tentative 
and let them back into it." 
</P>
<P>
 The only survivors from Orange County were Corona del Mar's fourth-seeded team 
of Megan Wachtler and Alissa Scott, who didn't drop a set in advancing to 
today's semifinals, which begin at 9 a.m.

WOODBRIDGE BEATS EDISON, LIVES UP TO ADVANCE BILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who wondered just how good Woodbridge is this season, the first-game 
results are in. 
</P>
<P>
 Good. Very good.  
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge, which lost only one starter from a team that won its first 32 
games and was a Division II State finalist, showed up with a team Thursday that 
was bigger, stronger and deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, led by sophomore transfer Krissy Duperron and sophomore holdover 
Erin Stovall, scored a 65-47 victory over Edison, another team that is likely 
to be among the county's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have any weaknesses," Edison Coach Dave White said. "They and 
Brea-Olinda are in a class by themselves. No one is better than those two." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison (1-1) scrimmaged Brea this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight- and six-point runs in the first quarter helped the Warriors to a 
12-point lead. When Edison's best player, Marie Philman (seven of eight from 
the field, 20 points), sat down the final 3 minutes 42 seconds of the second 
quarter with three fouls, Woodbridge reeled off 11 straight and took a 39-21 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 That lead reached 21 in the third quarter, but Edison outscored Woodbridge, 
10-1, in the final 2:50 to cut it to 11. It was as close as the Chargers would 
get. 
</P>
<P>
 Duperron, a 5-foot-10 transfer from Riverside Notre Dame who had played with 
some Woodbridge players on a local traveling team, scored 14 points and had 
seven rebounds; Stovall had 16 points, including eight in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Duperron is) a very steady player," Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs said. "She 
doesn't quite match (Philman) athletically, but she's just as strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "She makes us the No. 1 team in the county. Not that we're that much better, 
but we're so strong up front, you have to give us the nod."

NEWSWIRE: MIAMI'S SAPP WINS LOMBARDI AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warren Sapp, a junior defensive end at Miami, on Thursday became the first 
member of the Hurricanes to win the Lombardi Award as the nation's top lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp, 6-foot-3 and 284 pounds, beat out Arizona defensive end Tedy Bruschi, 
Nebraska offensive tackle Zach Wiegert and Florida State linebacker Derrick 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 For the season, Sapp had 84 tackles, 10.5 sacks for 62 yards in losses, four 
forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and 25 quarterback pressures. Miami 
(10-1) will play No. 1 Nebraska (12-0) in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp was the leader on a Miami team that led the nation in total defense this 
season, holding opponents to 220.9 yards per game. Now he must consider jumping 
to the pros or playing another year at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to brag on him too much, I've love to have him around for his 
senior year," Miami coach Dennis Erickson said. "And, I wouldn't be surprised 
if he decided to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp was the third Miami lineman to be nominated for the Lombardi Award. The 
others were Jerome Brown in 1986 and Russell Maryland in 1990.

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; BIG GAME COMES DOWN TO THE DEFENSE; LOS 
ALAMITOS: GRIFFINS WANT TO USE THEIR SPEED TO NEGATE MATER DEI'S SIZE AND 
STRENGTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Memo to Jim Van Gorder and Robert Brakke, Los Alamitos assistant football 
coaches. Your boss has one simple request. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Jim and Bob, please find a way to stop this Mater Dei offense. You've 
done a great job all year, so I figure one more great game plan isn't too much 
to ask.  
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely, Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, all this Mater Dei team has is strength, speed, finesse and balance 
. . . and they've averaged more than 38 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to stop a few of the things they do well and slow them 
down," Barnes said. "It would be crazy to think we can manhandle them." 
</P>
<P>
 Manhandle is not in the Griffin vocabulary. The biggest Los Alamitos defensive 
starters are Brandon Hart and Ryan Wanigasekera, who are 6 feet 1, 205 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Griffins have compensated for lack of size with quickness and 
aggressiveness. Los Alamitos constantly blitzed linebackers Hart, Wanigasekera, 
Mike Kahn and Chris Bagley to confuse Long Beach Poly last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked and the Griffins posted a shutout, holding on for a 7-0 
victory. Defensive back Damon Houston caused a fumble and Brandon Hart 
recovered the loose ball at the Los Alamitos 18 with two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you have to be the best, but you have to shut people down 
when you have to," Barnes said. "You don't win championships without defense. 
We proved that the other night." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the only time the Los Alamitos defense made the big play. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Dax Houston and Wanigasekera helped the Griffins preserve a 
victory over Esperanza this season. Clinging to a 35-32 lead with 52 seconds 
remaining, Houston sacked Aztec quarterback Chris Stretch, causing a fumble, 
and Wanigasekera recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 In 47 consecutive games, the Los Alamitos defense has delivered. During their 
record-setting Southern Section unbeaten streak, the Griffins have posted 17 
shutouts and allowed 9.2 points per game. Although the offense gets the 
headlines racking up points, the defense gets the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense will have to find a way to get the ball back against Mater Dei. 
Perhaps the only way the Griffins can accomplish that goal is to disguise their 
blitzes and coverages. 
</P>
<P>
 That's no easy task. Mater Dei quarterback John Flynn is a three-year starter 
who has completed 69% of his passes for an average of 205 yards per game. He 
has thrown 24 touchdown passes but only four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "John called 75% of the game at the line of scrimmage," said Mater Dei Coach 
Bruce Rollinson after the Monarchs' 31-7 thrashing of Loyola in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to be successful, we need perfect execution on defense," said Brakke, 
the Griffins' defensive coordinator.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Griffins blitz, they can try to stuff the running lanes and hope Dax 
Houston and the front seven will put pressure on Flynn.  
</P>
<P>
 But then the Los Alamitos secondary of Brad Melsby, Ife Ohalefe, Damon Houston 
and Tom Carbajal has man-to-man coverage on a talented Monarch receiving corps. 
Fleet-footed Rod Perry, who leads the county in receiving yardage and has 
scored 14 touchdowns, is Mater Dei's big-play receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Griffins play softer zone coverages to stop the big pass play, the 
Griffins could get pounded on the ground by Mater Dei's Steve Bodnar and Joey 
Trampush, who have combined for more than 2,200 yards rushing and 34 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 They run behind an offensive line that averages 257 pounds and their leader is 
one of the county's best, 6-4, 265-pound tackle Matt Motherway.

THE STREAK; LOS ALAMITOS MUM ABOUT 47-GAME ROLL GOING INTO TONIGHT'S DIVISION I 
SEMIFINAL AGAINST MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is taboo to talk about the streak in the football locker room at Los 
Alamitos High. Such conversation is likely to land a player in Coach John 
Barnes' doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the North Orange County campus, however, anything goes. That might explain 
why the streak is a frequent topic for local reporters and is even plastered on 
several billboards that line the street in front of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never talk about it as coaches or with the players," Barnes said. "We're 
proud of it, but it is not what we're about. It's not our only identity." 
</P>
<P>
 What Barnes is trying not to refer to is the 47-game unbeaten streak that Los 
Alamitos has put together over the last four seasons. It began innocently 
enough with a playoff-saving victory over Anaheim Katella on Oct. 31, 1991, and 
has not stopped since. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's 7-0 victory over Long Beach Poly in the Division I quarterfinals 
increased the streak to 47, breaking the section record of 46 shared by Temple 
City and Canyon Country Canyon. The state record is 53 by St. Helena from 
1960-65. 
</P>
<P>
 The last school to defeat Los Alamitos was Anaheim Esperanza, which also 
represents the only blemish on Los Alamitos' streak. The schools tied, 14-14, 
for the Division II title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite competing in the state's toughest section, the Griffins have not had 
many close calls during the streak. They have outscored opponents, 1,594-413, 
and have 18 shutouts. They have scored 40 or more points 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The streak includes 13 playoff victories and three sectional titles. Despite 
being elevated to Division I this season, Los Alamitos has a 12-0 record and is 
ranked No. 2 in the Southland by The Times behind La Puente Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes knows the not-discussed streak is in jeopardy. Los Alamitos faces 
Orange County rival Santa Ana Mater Dei, also 12-0, in the semifinals tonight 
at 7:30 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we walk into the locker room and say we've got to win tonight 
so we can up the streak to 48," said Barnes, 134-46-7 in 16 seasons. "I'm proud 
of what we've been able to accomplish and I'm very proud of our kids, but we go 
out each week to win that game and nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ends tonight, it's been a great run," he said. "It was never a goal, 
and I never would have expected it. It's something I'll probably enjoy more 
when I look back on it years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, 45, has built the Griffins into a power with one of the Southland's 
most prolific passing attacks. Quarterback Tim Carey flourished in 1991 and 
'92, throwing for 5,916 yards and 56 touchdowns, before accepting a scholarship 
to Stanford. His replacement, Mike Good, passed for 2,943 yards last year. He 
is now at Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Kevin Feterik inherited quarterback duties this season. Although he sat 
out three games because of a broken bone in his throwing hand, Feterik has 
passed for 2,583 yards and 27 touchdowns with only four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos' explosive offense has helped keep the streak alive. Trailing 
league rival Huntington Beach Edison, 12-7, with 38 seconds to play earlier 
this season, the Griffins stormed back. They returned a kickoff to the Edison 
48-yard line, and two plays later Feterik connected with Tony Hartley on a 
15-yard touchdown pass to give his team a 15-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kids just go into every game knowing they are going to win, not 
thinking they can win," said Edison Coach Dave White. "We got as close as 
anybody, and even though we played a better game we still couldn't beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Brad Melsby, a three-year starter at Los Alamitos with receiving 
yardage of more than 2,800 yards, has not lost in his 41 varsity games. He said 
the key has been not taking any opponent lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make sure that we get up for every game," Melsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barnes: "The thing that bothers me the most about the streak is that when 
it finally comes to an end people are going to say we really weren't that good 
anyway. I know better, but I'm still not going to want to hear that. We've been 
good at times and lucky at others."

WON'T BE WITH TEAM AT COTTON BOWL. ROBINSON SAYS IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE.

 Don Lindsey, former USC defensive coordinator, said Thursday that he had not 
resigned that position but had been fired by Coach John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief USC news release Wednesday quoted Robinson as saying that the decision 
on Lindsey's departure "was reached mutually between Don and I and is effective 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lindsey said Thursday, "I am deeply offended at any suggestion that I 
quit. I've never quit at anything in my life. John called me into his office 
and told me I wouldn't be coaching at the Cotton Bowl (against Texas Tech on 
Jan. 2). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very upset at the abruptness of it, to be asked to leave before the 
season was over. And I want my players to know that I didn't quit on them. I'm 
heartbroken that I won't be with them in Dallas.  
</P>
<P>
 "I gave 12 years of my life to USC. I think I deserved (to finish the 
season)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, adding he was particularly upset at a Times headline reporting that 
he had quit, said he realized that USC's defense had not played well in a 7-3-1 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shortcomings of the defense this season, whether it was tackling, 
stopping the run . . . whatever, I take total and complete responsibility for 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in coaching 30 years. I know what happens when you fail. And I 
failed. But I have no problem with failure -- that's part of coaching. I can 
accept responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not hiding from anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied that he and Robinson had clashed over defensive philosophy, as 
a Times source related.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, 51, was the first assistant hired in January, 1993, after Robinson 
began his second term at USC. Lindsey had worked as an assistant to John McKay 
and Robinson from 1971-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, who lives in Arcadia, said Robinson had called him in '93, while 
Lindsey was an assistant at Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 "John asked me to come here," he said. "I didn't call him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He then asked me to be his offensive coordinator (Lindsey became defensive 
coordinator after a week when Mike Nolan took a job with the New York Giants). 
And partly out of loyalty to an old friend, I agreed, and I brought my family 
out here.  
</P>
<P>
 "If John had just said (this week), 'Look, I'm sorry you haven't been 
successful with the defense. Just take some time between now and the Cotton 
Bowl to look for another job. . . . ' I wish it had happened that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said Thursday he thought this week was the right time for a change, 
for both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The college jobs that are available are out there right now," Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "For Don's sake, I wanted him to be free now to devote all his time to finding 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 "After looking at the defensive personnel all year, I have a clear picture, a 
specific direction I want to go in with the defense. I felt it was the right 
time for a change."

PRO FOOTBALL; THREE SEAHAWKS INJURED IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Seattle Seahawk players were injured, one critically, Thursday night in 
Kirkland, Wash., when their vehicle hit a utility pole, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Chris Warren, the fourth-leading rusher in the NFL with 1,096 
yards, and rookie running back Lamar Smith were two of the players, but neither 
was in critical condition, ESPN reported. The third player was not identified. 
A police spokeswoman in Kirkland reported that Warren was the driver of the car 
and that Warren was being charged with vehicular assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were taken to Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue. The crash 
knocked out electricity to 4,500 customers for an hour, the Journal-American 
reported.

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; BIG GAME COMES DOWN TO THE DEFENSE; MATER 
DEI: MONARCHS HOPE TO AVOID GETTING INVOLVED IN A HIGH-SPEED CHASE WITH THE 
GRIFFINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Welcome to a defensive coordinator's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad, go down to your dad's Chevy and turn around. I'll fake it to ya. Tony, 
you run to the manhole cover and turn around. Stan, you go deep.  
</P>
<P>
 It's street football, Los Alamitos style. Their attitude: Just try and stop 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei defensive coordinator Eric Johnson will attempt to reel in Los 
Alamitos' offense in tonight's Southern Section Division I semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to somehow stop this from becoming a scoring contest," Johnson said. 
"If it does, the last team with the ball will win. In that case, my advice 
would be not to punt in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 The key is in his secondary, which will have to blanket receivers Brad Melsby, 
Tony Hartley and Stan Guyness. A trio that has speed and savvy. And none of 
them drop too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting them the ball is Kevin Feterik, a junior quarterback who has thrown 
for 2,583 yards and 27 touchdowns despite missing 3 1/2 games because of a 
broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Those four -- with a little support from a decent offensive line and an 
average running game -- are the heart of an offense that averages 33.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen anything like them," Johnson said. "We've played a couple 
teams that had one receiver who was close to their level. But we haven't had to 
deal with three like them. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you design, you got to cover those receivers." 
</P>
<P>
 So welcome to your private hell Robbie Tritz, Kevin Braga, Jason Lundstrom and 
Peter Campbell, the secondary that will face the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik picked them apart twice in summer passing leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone can beat (Los Alamitos) in a passing league," Johnson 
said. "Hopefully it will be different with linemen rushing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs have one advantage. While they haven't seen the likes of Los 
Alamitos' offense, the Griffins have not run into a defense this talented. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei has allowed 11.3 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of this defense is it plays like a unit," Monarch Coach Bruce 
Rollinson said. "Each week a different kid is rising to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week it was Braga, who intercepted two passes in a 31-7 victory over Los 
Angeles Loyola. This week, one guy won't be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson will try to take the pressure off the secondary by pressuring Feterik. 
The Monarchs made pass a priority against Mission Viejo and it produced two 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they have the muscle up front to do it with Matt Motherway (6 feet 4, 
265 pounds), Bryan Williams (6-5, 235) and Kevin Donahue (6-3, 262). Johnson 
will mix and match blitzes, trying to keep Feterik off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
 That has been tried. Marina sacked Feterik three times and rushed him into 
hurried throws on several plays. Feterik still threw for 228 yards and three 
touchdowns in a 34-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can stay with one thing against them," Johnson said. "You 
have to adjust and throw different things at them. At the same time, you have 
to keep from confusing your own players." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos had three close games this season. None of those defensive 
strategies would be advisable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long Beach Poly rotated coverages and blitzed often. The Griffins scored 
only one touchdown in the 7-0 victory. But they also turned the ball over three 
times inside the five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Edison nearly knocked off the Griffins. The Chargers stayed close by 
holding onto the ball for long stretches. Still, Feterik drove the Griffins 48 
yards in two plays that took 26 seconds for a 15-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Esperanza tried to play last-one-with-ball-wins and lost, 35-32. The Aztecs 
made the fatal mistake of giving up the ball with two minutes left. It took 
Feterik only 48 seconds to go 83 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to have the ability to adjust to whatever you throw at them," 
Rollinson said. "We're going to play physical and just try to hold on."

SIDES FIND SOME AGREEMENT IN NHL NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL Players Assn. made two concessions Thursday that might help move 
negotiations toward a resolution of the three-month-old lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 During an eight-hour session in Chicago, players -- who had agreed to a rookie 
salary cap -- lowered their requested limit for first-round picks to an average 
of $1.25 million from an average of $1.5 million, the Canadian Press reported. 
Owners are seeking a limit of about $750,000 a season for players' first three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The news service also said the sides have agreed in principle to unrestricted 
free agency for players who are 28 and have 10 years' professional experience 
or eight years' NHL service. Players dropped their opposition to each club 
designating a "franchise player," and retaining the right to match free-agent 
offers made to those players. 
</P>
<P>
 However, owners want the designation awarded to the highest-paid player on 
each club, and players propose that it be any player earning the average of the 
top 26 salaries in the league, or about $3 million. Clubs would be permitted to 
keep franchise players three years beyond their 28th birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 They have yet to agree on whether salary arbitration will be non-binding, as 
owners are asking. The NHL also wants to limit the number of players eligible 
for arbitration to two per club per season. 
</P>
<P>
 The lockout has wiped out 347 games and has reduced each club's schedule to 60 
games, from 84. Players and club executives have generally agreed that an 
agreement by mid-December would be necessary to play a schedule of 50 or more 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton Oiler General Manager Glen Sather, who has taken a hard-line approach 
in advocating salary controls, joined the talks, which will continue today. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' delegation included Marty McSorley of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not discuss the league's proposed payroll tax, which has been the 
most contentious point throughout the negotiations.

 Quarterback Chris Chandler, who will work as backup to Chris Miller on Sunday, 
said he will be looking for the opportunity to be a starter when he decides 
where he will be playing next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler signed a one-year, $600,000 contract with the understanding that he 
was No. 2 to Miller, who received a three-year, $9-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In four starts, Chandler is 2-2 while completing 62.9% of his passes with five 
touchdowns and two interceptions. Miller, 2-6 as a starter, has completed 51.9% 
of his passes with 12 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chandler: "Ultimately, you'd like to know you are the No. 1 guy, but at 
the very worst you'd like to compete for the starting job. Anywhere you go, be 
it here or somewhere else, that's something I'm going to want."

 The Rams said Thursday they had fallen 32,234 tickets short of selling out 
Anaheim Stadium in time to lift the local television blackout for Sunday's game 
against the New Orleans Saints. . . . Miller has claimed released quarterback 
T.J. Rubley's number. Miller, who had worn No. 13, will wear No. 12 against the 
Saints. T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; REPORT: MONTANA IS SET TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kansas City Chief quarterback Joe Montana plans to retire at the end of the 
season, according to a report in today's New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 The report cited unidentified league sources. There was no elaboration. A call 
to Chief spokesman Bob Moore was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, 38, is finishing his second year with the Chiefs after spending 14 
seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and winning four Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 He was injured last week against Seattle with what the Chiefs said was a 
sprained left foot. Backup Steve Bono has been handling the bulk of the work in 
practice this week and is expected to start Sunday against Denver.

TENNIS / DAVIS CUP FINAL; RUSSIANS PLAY SWEDES FOR PAY, BUT QUESTION IS HOW 
MUCH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Named to play in today's opening match in the Davis Cup final against 
four-time champion Sweden, Alexander Volkov was asked what the occasion means 
for his Russian tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov, 27, is the man on the spot in a country making its first appearance in 
a Davis Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, the first Kremlin leader to play the game 
seriously, is expected in the Olympic Stadium to watch Volkov play Sweden's 
Stefan Edberg. Other Russian VIPs have joined in the cheerleading, eager for a 
national celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 But Volkov, erratic on the court and enigmatic off it, wasn't exactly exuding 
Russian pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean anything yet to reach the final," he said at a news 
conference Thursday. "We haven't received any money. When we get the money, 
we'll divide it up. Then ask me what it means. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joke, of course," he added after a pause. "But in every joke, there's 
a grain of truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that, unlike the Swedes, Russia's Davis Cup squad is a collection 
of talented mercenaries -- the first generation of post-Soviet players to 
benefit fully from international prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 20, the team's rising star, has earned almost $1 million 
this year and is the world's 11th-ranked player. Volkov and the third team 
member, Andrei Olhovskiy, have each earned about half that. 
</P>
<P>
 Matches will be held in a 12,000-seat indoor stadium filled with Russians who 
probably understand hockey better than tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden got the luck of the draw, which put Kafelnikov against Magnus Larsson 
in today's second match. That will mean less rest for Kafelnikov before he has 
to team with Olhovskiy in Saturday's doubles match against Jan Apell and Jonas 
Bjorkman. 
</P>
<P>
 The series winds up Sunday with Kafelnikov facing Edberg and Volkov playing 
Larsson.

 Quarterback Chris Chandler, who Sunday will work as backup to Chris Miller, 
said he will be looking for the opportunity to be a starter when he decides 
where he will be playing football next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler signed a one-year, $600,000 contract with the Rams with the 
understanding he was No. 2 to Miller, who received a three-year, $9-million 
deal.Injuries, however, have forced the Rams to start the quarterback who has 
been the healthiest each week. 
</P>
<P>
 In four starts, Chandler has compiled a 2-2 mark, while completing 62.9% of 
his passes with five touchdowns and two interceptions. Miller, who is 2-6 in a 
starting role, has completed 51.9% of his passes with 12 touchdowns and 13 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' front office has made no move to open negotiations on an extended 
contract or new deal for Chandler, who becomes a free agent at season's end, 
because it is waiting for Coach Chuck Knox & Co. to determine what is happening 
at the quarterback position as it relates to next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being free definitely opens other doors for you," Chandler said. "It will be 
interesting, but we still have four more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately you'd like to know you are the No. 1 guy, but at the very worst 
you'd like to compete for the starting job. Anywhere you go, be it here or 
somewhere else, that's something I'm going to want." T.J. SIMERS

RAM DEFENSE NEEDS FOURSOME TO GET MORE FEARSOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he promised he would, Ram defensive end Robert Young chased down New 
Orleans quarterback Jim Everett, and it was time to plant him in the Superdome 
Astroturf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But just as Young got to him, Everett pulled a fast one and slipped away -- 
another potential sack gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' defensive front has watched films of Everett slipping from their 
grasp all week, stirring memories of him completing his first eight passes en 
route to a 17-for-26, 206-yard performance in the Saints' 37-34 victory Oct. 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Jim Everett, the former Ram quarterback and victim of the Phantom 
Sack in the 1990 NFC Championship Game against San Francisco. The Rams couldn't 
sack a guy who once sacked himself? 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, Everett might have gone down when Robert was chasing him on that 
play, who knows?" defensive end Fred Stokes said. "Instead, he fought his way 
out of it and made the completion." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes and Young watched Everett time after time avoid the rush, get rid of 
the ball at the last second and taunt them behind near-perfect protection, 
spotting New Orleans a 14-0 lead with two long drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Rams could get to those "happy feet," as safety Anthony Newman 
called them, Everett was dancing all over the sideline in celebration. The Rams 
barely made him shuffle in the pocket, with Young dropping him for a harmless 
10-yard loss in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense prepares for Sunday's rematch in Anaheim Stadium with only eight 
sacks in the last six games -- tying the Rams with Tampa Bay and Seattle for 
27th in the league during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we have to get to him quick," Young said. "Jim's having a great year, 
and you can't take anything away from him. But we know if we get him rattled 
up, we can change the course of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams haven't done much of that lately. They are 2-4 in their last six 
games, and the defensive front -- tackles Sean Gilbert and Jimmie Jones, and 
ends Young and Stokes -- has produced only 5 1/2 sacks in that span. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same front four that ESPN compared to the Rams' legendary Fearsome 
Foursome in the fourth week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened to a pass rush that once showed so much promise? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been kind of quiet," defensive coordinator George Dyer said. "It's 
something we're working on every week, because we have to get it rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of little things, basically we have good pass rushers, but we 
just have to get back in sync, where we're dominating and rushing the passer." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Ram defense has given up only five rushing touchdowns this season 
(first in the NFC), it is tied with Buffalo and the Jets for 19th in the league 
in sacks with 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we haven't been trying," Stokes said. "We've been getting to 
people, we just haven't been getting them down. We've had a ton of hurries, but 
people don't look at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they look at sacks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gilbert, the right tackle, has only one sack (last week against San Diego) 
since missing the Giants and New Orleans games because of tendinitis in his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stokes, the right defensive end, has one sack this season, matching the 
total by rookie free agent D'Marco Farr. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jones, the left tackle who was lured away from the defending Super 
Bowl-champion Cowboys with a four-year, $7.5-million deal, has four sacks for 
35 yards in losses. He's the leading tackler on the starting front with 40, 
which ranks seventh on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Young, the left defensive end, leads the team in sacks with 6 1/2 for 30 
yards in losses. Although he got off to a great start with four sacks in his 
first three games, he has only 1 1/2 in the last four. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing against some pretty good offensive lines -- San Francisco, 
the Raiders, New Orleans," Young said. "And teams don't get worse at pass 
protection as the season goes on, they get better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not Supermen, we can't get there all the time. We're doing some pretty 
good rushing, sacks are just hard to come by." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the Rams go against a Saints offensive line that has allowed Everett 
to be sacked only 14 times for 119 yards in losses, tying them with Miami for 
third in the league with fewest sacks allowed. In contrast, Ram quarterbacks 
have been sacked a combined 27 times for 193 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a tremendous job of protecting Jim right now," Dyer said. "He's 
getting the ball off and the receivers are getting open. He's not getting 
rattled, and he's hanging in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a real challenge to get back there because of the timing of 
their passing game and their line." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams know Everett can be rattled. They watched him self-destruct last year 
when he was sacked 18 times in nine starts. But which Everett will they see on 
Sunday -- last year's version or the confident one who beat them six weeks ago? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched film of Jim and he was really pumped up against us," Stokes 
said. "He wanted to go out and prove something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he'll be that pumped up this time, because he won. He knows he 
can win against us, and that may work to our advantage." In a Rush? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' defense is 19th in the league in sacks this season with 22, and the 
starting defensive front of Sean Gilbert, Jimmie Jones, Fred Stokes and Robert 
Young have produced only 5 1/2 sacks in the past six weeks. A look at the Rams' 
defensive front:

EX-BOXING FIGURE FLORES DIES IN FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnnie Flores, a prominent figure on the Los Angeles boxing scene and a 
decorated World War II soldier, is dead at 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Streicher, his son-in-law, said Flores' body was discovered Wednesday at 
the bottom of an elevator shaft at the Lincoln Heights gymnasium where Flores 
had been employed and coaching boxers since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-floor of the building, which once was a jail, was converted into the 
Los Angeles Youth Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Streicher said the building is old and in poor condition, and he suspects 
Flores might have stepped into an empty shaft on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have well been an accident," Streicher said. "It seems as though the 
elevator was stuck between the second and third floors. He may have opened the 
door on the first floor and fell to the bottom. It's a 12-foot drop, but he hit 
his head. He was killed instantly." 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report had yet to be filed on Flores as of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who trained such fighters as Jerry Quarry, Dwight Hawkins and Ruben 
Navarro, was known as "Mr. Amateur Boxing." He is credited with luring 
countless wayward youths into gymnasiums. 
</P>
<P>
 At the old Lincoln Heights jail, Flores converted holding tanks into boxing 
rings and cells into changing rooms. He was inducted into the Golden Gloves 
Hall of Fame in 1989 and the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 During World World II, as an Army infantryman, Flores earned the silver and 
bronze stars, as well as a purple heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Streicher said his father-in-law once captured 15 German soldiers. In 1944, 
Flores was seriously injured when a round of artillery fire exploded above an 
abandoned farmhouse in which Flores and five others had sought refuge. All five 
of his comrades were killed. Flores was struck with 33 pieces of shrapnel and 
spent years recovering from his wounds. He was never able to resume what had 
been a promising boxing career. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who lived in Castaic, is survived by Rose, his wife of 52 years, and 
three children. Funeral arrangements are pending.

BURNS MOVES UP TO DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Burns, 34, who has coached the USC safeties for the last two seasons, 
was named by Coach John Robinson as the Trojans' defensive coordinator 
Thursday, succeeding Don Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled that John had that kind of confidence in me, to give me this 
chance," said Burns, in Texas on a recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson also said Thursday that he had made one more staff change for the 
Trojans' Cotton Bowl game against Texas Tech, moving defensive line coach Doug 
Smith to offense to work under offensive line coach Mike Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said Burns will be in charge of the defensive game plan for the 
Cotton Bowl game but added, "I'll have some input too." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, 59, said the vacant defensive line position will be temporarily 
filled by "an elderly gentleman, who still retains his great speed." 
</P>
<P>
 He meant himself.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll spend a high percentage of my time between now and Jan. 2 with the 
defensive line, and over the next year too," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he will hire another defensive coach after the Cotton Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said no one should expect major defensive changes for Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got seniors who we need big games from in Dallas, and this is not the 
time to throw a whole new system at them," he said. "I want them fresh for the 
game, eager to play, not feeling like they've just come out of boot camp." EARL

THOROUGHBRED RACING; OLD, GRAY MARE GETS A HARD SELL FOR ECLIPSE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The danger for owners who campaign for their horses at Eclipse Awards voting 
time is the potential backlash. Hype can turn off voters, just as it might 
influence them. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Lavin has been living dangerously for years. Even though he's chairman 
of a company that makes hair spray, Lavin doesn't use the stuff. His wife, 
Bernice, has reminded him of this from time to time, most recently last month 
when Lavin's fast gray 6-year-old, One Dreamer, scored the biggest upset of the 
day in the Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 There might have been a fall breeze in the winner's circle, but it was the 
mare -- not the hair -- that was foremost in Lavin's mind. Since an 8-year-old 
Leonard Lavin and his father saw Reigh Count win the Kentucky Derby in 1928, he 
has been close to horses. Few have been closer than One Dreamer, a daughter of 
Relaunch, another gray who gave Lavin a victory in the Del Mar Derby in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 So Lavin doesn't care if his zeal hurts at the Eclipse ballot box. He has 
never won a title, and he can't let this election go by without going to bat 
for his horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sky Beauty's a great mare," Lavin said the other day, calling from his car 
phone from in suburban Chicago. "But I think I've got the best mare in the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 The voters must decide whether Sky Beauty's pre-Churchill Downs record means 
more than the Breeders' Cup Distaff, in which One Dreamer outran a formidable 
field at 47-1. Lavin's candidate for the best filly or older mare title 
finished more than 12 lengths ahead of Sky Beauty, who ran last in the 
nine-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Breeders' Cup, Sky Beauty was favored to win the Eclipse Award. She 
was undefeated for the year, having rolled up five victories from May to 
September on her home New York tracks. But her campaign turned into a 
reflection of last year when she was also dominant early before finishing fifth 
in the Distaff at Santa Anita and blowing the Eclipse for best 3-year-old 
filly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sky Beauty's record is a strange one. In 18 starts, she has lost only four -- 
three on tracks outside New York and the other on a foul after she had finished 
first at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder whether the horses Sky Beauty was beating in New York this year had 
the class that the horses had in the Distaff," Lavin said. "My horse didn't 
need her (home) track with her to win. She won on an off track early in the 
year at Churchill. She won on both firm turf and soft turf at Arlington. Then 
she won on a fast dirt track in the Breeders' Cup. Hollywood Wildcat (winner of 
the 1993 Distaff) was lapped on One Dreamer early and couldn't keep up. And 
Heavenly Prize, who ran second (by a neck) at Churchill, is probably the best 
3-year-old filly in the country, but she wasn't going to pass us if we went 
around again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat, struggling with the cuppy Churchill Downs surface, ran 
sixth in the Distaff. One Dreamer finished the year with four victories, a 
second and a third in eight starts. Her best losing race was a fourth-place 
finish on grass in the Beverly D at Arlington International in late August. She 
lost by only 1 1/2 lengths and the 1-2 finishers were Hatoof, the probable 
female grass champion after a second-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Turf; 
and Flawlessly, champion distaffer on turf in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Chicago handicapper wrote us off in the Distaff and said, 'Must be 
dreaming,' " Lavin said. "But we thought we had a real shot, because the mare 
had never run a bad race." 
</P>
<P>
 Relaunch, bought by Lavin at a yearling auction for $73,000, has sired about 
one-third of Lavin's more than 40 stakes winners. Not an automatic horse to 
vote for by any means, One Dreamer was an easy horse to root for because of her 
struggling beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "She ran only once at 3 and really didn't get started until she was a 
4-year-old," Lavin said. "She had that cyst on a lung and almost died before we 
got it taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Lavin and his trainer, Tom Proctor, wanted to run One Dreamer once more this 
year, to give the voters something else to think about and finally settled on 
the one-mile Top Flight Handicap at Aqueduct last Friday. New York is where 
many of the Eclipse voters go racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got some heat in one of her knees," Lavin said. "So we decided to retire 
her." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal worked a half-mile Thursday in :49 4/5 and trainer Richard Mandella 
said that the 6-year-old gelding will run Sunday in the $100,000 Native Diver 
Handicap. . . . Nine distaffers are entered for Saturday's $100,000 Bayakoa 
Handicap, including Miss Dominique, who ran third at 77-1 in the Breeders' Cup 
Distaff. Others entered in the 1 1/16-mile race are Magical Maiden, Borodislew, 
Dancing Mirage, Glass Ceiling, Thirst for Peace, Fondly Remembered, Enchanted 
Spot and Klassy Kim. The high weights are Miss Dominique and Magical Maiden, at 
120 pounds. . . . Randy Romero, trying to make a comeback after a short-lived 
retirement earlier this year, won Thursday with Sabreen, a filly who dropped 
from stakes company to $50,000 claimers after losing by 34 1/2 lengths in two 
previous starts.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; RECORD PICK-SIX PAYOUT POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Park's pick-six payout is expected to go well over $500,000 today as 
the exotic bet enters its third day without a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has won the bet, in which you are required to pick the winner of six 
consecutive races, for two performances causing a carryover of $257,013. The 
usually large crowd tonight is causing race officials to estimate that a single 
ticket could return as much as $650,000. The record for a single pick-six 
ticket at Hollywood Park is $619,799, set in 1992.

HIS FIELD OF VISION WASN'T SYLMAR; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: AFTER DREAMING OF 
PLAYING FOR SAN FERNANDO, MARQUEZ HAS CHANCE TO TAKE SPARTANS TO CITY TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Marquez's earliest recollections of football began on a hard, dusty field 
nine years ago at Sylmar High. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 8 -- and a starting center for the North Valley Little Bears. Like most 
of his young teammates, Marquez fantasized of someday playing for San Fernando 
High, football pride of the East Valley in the late 1960s and into the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, Marquez dismissed the Sylmar program as a joke. Nothing could 
be better, he thought, than being a Tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all we thought about," Marquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much changed in the years that followed even though his family moved to 
the Santa Clarita Valley in the seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez and his buddies still practiced on Sylmar's football field, dreaming 
of the San Fernando program while enjoying hearty laughs about the futility of 
Sylmar's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to laugh about (Sylmar) all the time," Marquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez, who transferred from Saugus to Sylmar in May, isn't laughing anymore 
-- and neither are his former teammates, many of whom play for Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 170-pound quarterback is unbeaten in 12 starts at Sylmar and 
hopes to increase that streak tonight at 7:30 when the Spartans (12-0) take on 
Carson (4-8) in a City Section 4-A Division semifinal game at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez's penchant for getting his passes into the end zone is remarkable. 
More than 26% of his completions this season have been touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez, who has completed 71 of 129 passes (55.0%) for 1,352 yards, has 
thrown for 19 touchdowns, nearly twice as many as any other Spartan quarterback 
since Coach Jeff Engilman took over in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our quarterback has never been the big guy in our scheme of things," said 
Engilman, whose Sylmar teams have produced at least one 1,000-yard rusher each 
season. "(But) you go with what you've got." 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior at Saugus, Marquez completed 60 of 129 passes (46.5%) for 1,134 
yards and 10 touchdowns. The Centurions finished 5-4 and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not six months later, Saugus Coach Jack Bowman heard that Marquez was 
considering a transfer to Sylmar. Marquez, his mother and stepfather denied the 
rumors, according to Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Marquez's parents assured Bowman that their son was staying 
put, Marquez checked out of Saugus, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez contends the transfer was necessary because his stepfather's job moved 
from Palmdale to Pico Rivera and he wanted a shorter commute. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his former teammates and friends at Saugus think he transferred 
because he wanted to play at Sylmar, not because of his stepfather's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me because I know it's not true," Marquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 With an inexperienced quarterback at the helm, Saugus managed just four 
touchdown passes during the regular season, the lowest production in the 
Foothill League. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bowman, whose team this year was 6-4-1 and advanced to the second round 
of the playoffs: "To be quite honest, I really don't care. We did fine. We're 
happy with what we did (this year). We wouldn't have done any better that's for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Marquez's ability to read defenses and throw passes on the run 
prompted Engilman to change his offense this season, especially inside the 
opponent's 20. 
</P>
<P>
 For Engilman, Marquez is the response to Sylmar's 22-21 loss to Carson in the 
4-A semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to be more balanced and it really showed when we weren't able to 
throw the ball against Carson last year," Engilman said. "They played us with 
nine-man fronts. . . . The plays were there but (quarterback Eddie Lopez) just 
couldn't complete 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, neither could Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an intense Banning pass-rush, Marquez was sacked five times, threw three 
interceptions and fumbled twice. The Spartans somehow managed to win, 28-27, in 
a California tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Engilman pulled Marquez late in the game and went to a wishbone offense in the 
middle of a drive. Sylmar moved downfield and scored, but it didn't do much to 
bolster Marquez's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Marquez) thought I had lost confidence in him," Engilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Obbie Brown, a Sylmar assistant coach, pulled Marquez aside at practice Monday 
and tried to reassure him that everything was status quo in the Spartan camp. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Engilman, Brown told Marquez, "Hey, we wouldn't have you in there 
if we'd lost confidence in you. We would just be with the wishbone right now. 
You don't know Engilman . . . as soon as he loses confidence, you're no longer 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Engilman doesn't want Marquez fearing his removal. To defeat 
Carson, the defending City champion, Engilman will need Marquez, the wishbone 
and any other trick he can muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, who wouldn't want to rely on a quarterback who has practiced on the 
same dusty, weather-beaten field since childhood, compiling a 7-0 record on 
that field as a high school senior?

HEAVY HITTER; CLEMENTS, NORTHRIDGE'S ALL-TIME LEADER IN KILLS, MAKES SURE THEY 
COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Her coach dubbed her "Game Player," early in the season because of her 
propensity to play at a dramatically higher level in matches than in practices, 
and Missy Clements of Cal State Northridge says the nickname fits her to a T. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, who has more kills than any player in Northridge volleyball history, 
doesn't loaf in practice, but neither does she train with the same high 
intensity as her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like she doesn't try," teammate Heather Anderson said. "She's not 
that bad. But for a game, she definitely picks it up a notch." 
</P>
<P>
 Or two, or three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know any athlete that plays at the same level from practice to games, 
but I just happen to be one of those players who goes from way down here to way 
up here," Clements said, raising her hand from near the floor to above her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just never been a practice player. I've hated practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Put her in a match, however, and the usually laid-back senior becomes the 
driving force for a team that opens play today in the National Invitational 
Volleyball Championship in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game, I'm just really psyched up," she said. "I love to play under 
pressure. I love to play in front of crowds. If they could get a crowd to go 
into practice, I'd be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of that, the 5-foot-11 Clements has racked up some big numbers during 
her four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 She has 1,372 kills and is averaging a school-record 4.83 kills a game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 459 kills this year are a career high and rank second on the all-time 
Northridge list behind Kristy Olson, who had 546 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Clements, Aimee Stone (366 kills) and Anderson (318), Northridge (17-8) 
is a high-powered attacking team, although how well the Matadors block and play 
defense will ultimately determine their success in the 20-team NIVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Northridge's players were disappointed Sunday when they were not 
selected to play in the 48-team NCAA Division I tournament, Clements is 
grateful to be competing in the postseason as the clock winds down on her 
college career. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clements, Anderson and Ana Kristich, the four-year odyssey is filled with 
ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
 All three players were recruited by then-Matador Coach Walt Ker out of high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, Cal-Hi Sports' 1990 State player of the year, and Kristich were 
teammates on a La Habra High team that won State Division II titles in 1989 and 
'90. Anderson played for a Clovis High squad that posted a 69-6 record during 
her final two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 As freshmen, Clements and Kristich started on a Northridge team that posted a 
16-18 record. 
</P>
<P>
 As sophomores, Clements, Anderson and Kristich played key roles as the 
Matadors (27-8) advanced to the Division I playoffs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they were swept by USC in the first round, the future looked bright 
for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the program began to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ker, who had a 401-144 record in 14 seasons, resigned in January, 1993, citing 
"family considerations." 
</P>
<P>
 It was later learned that two members of the 1992 squad filed sexual 
harassment charges against him with the school and several former players 
alleged that he had consensual sexual relations with team members in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 When Northridge couldn't find a replacement, Matador men's Coach John Price 
agreed to coach the women for one season even though he never coached women 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to go through hell with John, but it was for a purpose," she said. 
"Our year with John made us a lot more competitive with each other and with 
other teams, but it just didn't pay off right away during the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Price guided Northridge to a runner-up finish in the 1993 Division I men's 
tournament, but the women posted a 12-17 record and failed to qualify for 
postseason play for the first time since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Lian Kang Lu last December steadied the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, an assistant at UC Santa Barbara from 1984-93, is regarded as one of the 
top technical coaches in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned so many more things from him in one season and in the spring 
than I have in years of playing for someone else," Clements said. "I totally 
believe that he knows what he's doing when he coaches women." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu frankly discusses Clements' strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the game, she always fights, she always wants to win, she's always 
positive," he said. "But it's hard to get her to practice. . . . She is a very 
good attacker. Her wrist work is very good. But her passive skills, her 
blocking, her passing, her digging, are not so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Clements hasn't decided to play after college. She wants to let her body heal 
-- she has dislocated her left knee three times during her career -- and after 
that her plans are best described as unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 She has lost interest in her major, environmental health, and isn't close to 
graduating. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements said wistfully she would like the job of Julie McCoy, cruise director 
on the television series "The Love Boat." 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, how great a job is that? I'm a people person. I love being around 
people. I have a great time with them. I already know that I can't have a desk 
job for the rest of my life." Clements' Career

MATADORS ARE IN THE DEEP END OF POOL; WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: WITH FEW SUBS, COACH 
WORRIES ABOUT FATIGUE AS CSUN FACES FOUR PLAYOFF MATCHES IN TWO DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Lian Kang Lu has coached the Cal State Northridge women's team to a 17-8 
record in his first year at the helm, but he is concerned with the team's lack 
of depth as the Matadors open pool play today in the National Invitational 
Volleyball Championship at Municipal Stadium in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which has won five consecutive matches, will play Oregon State at 
9:30 a.m. PST and Sam Houston State at 5 p.m., followed by contests Saturday 
against Connecticut (noon) and Minnesota (5 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 If the Matadors win their pool, they advance to the semifinals at 8 a.m. 
Sunday. The semifinal winners will meet in the championship match at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we don't have many substitutes, I am worried about fatigue," Lu said. 
"Playing four matches in two days will not be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is expected to use its standard starting lineup of outside hitters 
Missy Clements, Aimee Stone and Rene Goth, middle blockers Heather Anderson and 
Ana Kristich and setter Kathleen Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Balderama will be used as a back-row substitute for Goth, but no other 
Northridge players are expected to play, barring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Minnesota (18-14) and Oregon State (15-15) have unimpressive records 
compared to Sam Houston State (28-7) and Connecticut (27-7), Lu said they are 
the teams to beat. Many of their losses have come against tough Big Ten or 
Pacific 10 Conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge lost in four games to Oregon State on Oct. 8 before winning seven 
of its last eight matches.

ANGELS HOPE TO CLOSE DEAL FOR ORIOLE RELIEVER SMITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels have prepared a two-year contract offer for free-agent closer Lee 
Smith and hope to sign him within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very possible we could come to an agreement soon," said Brian David, 
Smith's agent. "We've been moving in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, originally considered long shots in the bidding for Smith, are 
said to be willing to offer Smith a two-year guaranteed contract that would pay 
a base salary of about $2 million a year, plus incentives and award bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Mead, the Angel assistant general manager who's negotiating the deal with 
David, declined to confirm or deny the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith saved a major league-leading 33 games for Baltimore last season, and was 
on pace for his fourth consecutive 40-plus save season until the Aug. 12 
strike. Smith, 37, baseball's all-time saves leader, has produced at least 29 
saves in 11 of the last 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, saddled with the league's worst-ranked bullpen last season, have 
had a reliever save 25 games only twice in their 34-year franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Houston Astros offered a free-agent contract to Smith to become 
a setup man for Mitch Williams. This time, the Angels want Williams to be the 
setup man for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lee enjoyed Baltimore, but I wouldn't say that's a clear preference for him," 
David said. "Lee wants to get the right deal and the right situation. That 
could be Baltimore, or that could be somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, Angel pitcher Mark Leiter was honored Thursday as the fifth 
recipient of the Tony Conigliaro award. The award is presented to a major 
league player "who has overcome adversity through the attributes of spirit, 
determination and courage that were trademarks of Tony C." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter's 9-month-old son died April 4, 1994, of spinal muscular atrophy. Yet, 
Leiter started five days later, and yielded two runs in six innings in the 
Angels' 6-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Angel first baseman J.T. Snow was diagnosed Thursday with a sprained 
biceps tendon of the left shoulder. Snow, who injured the shoulder a month ago 
playing in Venezuela, will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test Wednesday 
to ensure surgery is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who batted only left-handed in Venezuela, said he will return to 
switch-hitting for the 1995 season. "I'll go with what got me where I am," he 
said.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: DRAWING A FINER LINE BETWEEN REAL NEWS AND 
GERALDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the final gasp of the November ratings sweeps, "Eyewitness News" 
reporter Marianne Bannister blew the lid off of pantyhose on KABC-TV Channel 7 
("This is a control top"), and KCBS-TV Channel 2 teased a story by showing an 
outline of a male and asking, "Who is this guy? Find out today at 5 on 'Action 
News.' " They were television's most searing journalese since Channel 2's 
suspenseful report, earlier in November, on walking in high heels. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more somber note, Wednesday was also the day that the fissure separating 
tabloiders and so-called mainstream media narrowed to a barely discernible 
hairline. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalyst was Denise Brown, sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, who was 
murdered last June with her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. The vehicle was 
Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first time she had accused O.J. Simpson of slaying his former 
wife, Nicole. But doing so for the first time in the course of a formal TV 
interview -- especially with the high-profile Rivera -- guaranteed the 
fireworks that followed.  
</P>
<P>
 Her Tuesday night comments about Simpson ("He did it . . . he murdered my 
sister") were a deafening cannonball that resonated on newscasts throughout 
Wednesday louder than the guns of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in effect merging 
talk-show host and former ABC News reporter Rivera with the so-called 
legitimate media that he loves to disparage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that Rivera, since being fired by ABC in 1985, had gained entre to 
regular newscasts on those occasions when KCBS, the station that airs his 
syndicated program here, chose to graft him onto its own "Action News" in a 
cross-promotion strategy designed to assist both parties in the ratings. And in 
1988, there were those news clips of the infamous "Geraldo" race ruckus that 
earned the host a broken honker, the bandages for which he proudly wore like a 
Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
 But his interview with Denise Brown, followed Wednesday by obnoxious rebuttals 
from those ever-tasteful Simpson attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran 
Jr., was the first time within memory that a Rivera interviewee, and not just 
himself, had made news. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it was hard separating the two. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Simpson attorney Shapiro, arrogantly saying that he and his associates 
would "forgive" the victims' families for speaking out against their client, 
who set off Denise Brown and sent her to Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 That she gave her first full-blown television interview on Simpson's alleged 
guilt to Rivera was significant, and unfortunate, for it automatically gave her 
account a tabloid taint (the curse of Geraldo) it didn't deserve, and him 
respectability he didn't deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "PrimeTime Live" -- the program on which Denise and other members of the 
Brown family had given a much more subdued interview last September concerning 
the murders -- had scheduled its own interview with her for Thursday night, one 
it reportedly had anticipated getting exclusively. Excerpts of that accusatory 
interview, with questioner Diane Sawyer, were also in circulation Wednesday. As 
were portions of a previous interview that Joan Lunden had conducted with 
Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, on ABC's "Good Morning America." Goldman 
indicated then that he, too, felt Simpson was guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Rivera who struck first this week with Denise Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that "PrimeTime Live" or "Good Morning America" have been noticeably 
holier than any other somersaulting media in covering the Simpson-Goldman case, 
only that when it comes to perceptions of sensationalism, Rivera carries to 
every story a ton of baggage that tends to overwhelm the message. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was not his rambunctious daytime program, "Geraldo," on which 
Rivera spoke to Denise Brown about the case. For whatever reason -- whether her 
choice or his -- her comments surfaced on Rivera's lower-key CNBC cable 
interview show, the one where he wears glasses and comes on, comparatively, at 
least, like C-SPAN. Granting Denise Brown two for the price of one, however, he 
opened his Wednesday "Geraldo" with an excerpt from her CNBC interview and a 
promise of future chats with other members of her family, then turned to his 
show's main agenda: "When we come back from commercial, Eddie Sexton and his 
dirty family secrets exposed!" 
</P>
<P>
 What were Rivera's secrets vis a vis Denise Brown? Katie Couric wanted to know 
when she interviewed him Thursday on "Today," the morning show on NBC, which 
also owns CNBC. Rivera told Couric that he had been pursuing an interview with 
Denise Brown for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Couric wondered if he felt that media interviews of those closely associated 
with the Simpson-Brown case were in any way injurious to the O.J. Simpson 
trial, being presided over by Judge Lance Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Rivera didn't think so. "Judge Ito has his job," he said, "and you and I 
have our job." 
</P>
<P>
 Our job. The NBC News job and his job. One job, one entity. They were all in 
this together, raising clasped hands like candidates at a political rally. The 
line separating so-called legitimate news and Geraldo news was now barely 
visible to the naked eye, a fact symbolized by Rivera's union with Couric and 
NBC legal analyst Jack Ford in a discussion of the Murder Case of the Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of Geraldo Rivera was now complete. The time was right for it; the 
news environment of the '90s demanded it. TV's elder statesman of sleaze had 
gone around, and come around, and now was being warmly welcomed and tightly 
embraced like an old pal by those who once had regarded him as a stain on their 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 He was back, all right, and even more dramatically, he was back on his own 
terms.

TALK SHOWS PROVE TO BE A TOUGH MARKET TO CRACK IN L.A.; TELEVISION: NOVEMBER 
RATINGS SWEEPS FINDS LOCAL VIEWERS STICKING WITH THE TRIED AND TRUE DESPITE 
ONSLAUGHT OF NEW SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All of this year's new crop of talk shows were rejected by local viewers 
during the just-concluded November ratings sweeps, proving that it takes more 
than a celebrity host or quirky accent to make a splash in the potentially 
lucrative but overcrowded talk field. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps all that some of these shows need is time, because several 
seemingly flat-lined veteran talk hosts made big gains simply by sticking 
around, according to statistics released Thursday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. for 
the November sweeps -- one of four annual ratings periods used by local 
stations for bragging rights and to set some advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilu Henner and Suzanne Somers, two prime-time stars turned daytime hosts 
this fall, showed little acceptance. Henner's show at 11 a.m. on KNBC-TV 
Channel 4 drew only 8% of those watching television at that hour, and Somers' 
did even worse at noon on Channel 13, losing to reruns of "The Brady Bunch" and 
tying for last in the time period with "Gordon Elliott," another rookie talk 
show on KTTV-TV Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows starring Susan Powter, Star Jones and Marilyn Kagen on KCAL-TV Channel 9 
and Dennis Prager on KTTV similarly bombed in the local market, which includes 
Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. So did KCOP's entire late-night 
lineup, including the Brandon Tartikoff-produced "Last Call" and the Arsenio 
Hall replacement, "The Jon Stewart Show." "Last Call" attracted only 2% of the 
audience at 10:30 p.m., while Stewart, the MTV graduate, saw Conan O'Brien on 
KNBC grab more than four times his audience in their head-to-head contest at 
12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the news for KCOP was glorious for several of its veteran 
talk hosts. The audience for "Jenny Jones" at 2 p.m. was up 34% over a year 
ago. "Montel Williams" at 4 p.m. leaped 41%. And "Ricki Lake" at 5 p.m. soared 
61% over November, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite talk of risky changes and an early slump in September, "The Oprah 
Winfrey Show" on KABC-TV Channel 7 did about as well as always and won the 3 
p.m. showdown to remain the overall talk-show champ here, beating runner-up 
Lake by nearly 100,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oprah" also proved its worth by providing KABC with a huge lead-in advantage 
for the station's afternoon news block, propelling the Channel 7 newsroom to 
wins at 4 p.m., 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., even though the station's numbers overall 
for the 2 1/2-hour stretch were down a few percentage points from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 4 was second throughout the entire news block, showing some small 
gains over last year, while KCBS again was third. 
</P>
<P>
 While KCBS also trailed at 5 p.m., its ratings were 27% higher than a year 
ago, apparently thanks to the addition of anchor Ann Martin, whom Channel 2 
lured away from KABC last summer with the most lucrative contract in local news 
history.  
</P>
<P>
 But that was nothing compared to the station's numbers with Martin at 11 p.m. 
Helped also by the station's series on Judge Lance Ito and the huge lead-in 
audience delivered by CBS' miniseries "Scarlet," Channel 2's late news jumped 
80% over last year and leapfrogged over slumping KABC, which lost about 8% of 
its audience, into second place. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC gained about 25,000 households from the previous year to win the 
advertising-rich 11 p.m. competition. Channel 4 also convincingly won the 
early-morning news battle from 6 to 7 a.m., increasing its audience by nearly 
25%. KABC finished second, KTLA third and KTTV fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the independents, "The KTLA Morning News" continued to pound all 
competitors at 7 a.m., easily knocking off all three network morning shows and 
KTTV's local offering. KTLA again won the 10 p.m. news battle with a gain of 
13% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the network level, CBS won the sweeps competition in total households, 
followed by ABC, NBC and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 But in what most executives consider the far more important demographic 
categories for which advertisers pay a premium, ABC was first among adults aged 
18 to 34 and 18 to 49 and tied with NBC for top honors among adults aged 25 to 
54.

SCHUMANN'S 2ND SYMPHONY SCORE SELLS FOR $2.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The manuscript of a Schumann symphony, lost for more than 50 years, was sold 
at auction for a record $2.3 million in London on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a record not just for a manuscript by Robert Schumann but for any 
19th-Century score, Sotheby's auction house said. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the manuscript of the German Romantic composer's second symphony, 
written in 1846-47, was bought by Robin Lehman and his wife in New York City in 
a telephone bid through a dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're well known as private collectors and a large part of their collection 
is on loan to the Pierpont Morgan library in New York," said James Kirkman, who 
took part in the bidding on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of the manuscript from an anonymous private collection ranked 
among the most momentous sale events in music for 50 years, Sotheby's said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many places Schumann marked the score so heavily with revisions, 
deletions, erasures and scratchings-out in pencil, ink and brown crayon that 
new passages had to be pasted in on top," Stephen Roe, head of Sotheby's Books 
and Manuscripts department, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lifting these back one can see layer upon layer of working and reworking -- 
earlier versions that have been hitherto unknown to scholars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The manuscript had been expected to sell for around $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scholars believed the manuscript had been lost when an Allied bombing 
raid on Leipzig during World War II destroyed the premises of the music 
publishers who then owned it.

SETTLING DOWN IN BOYS TOWN; YOUTHS: AT THE ORANGE COUNTY SITE, MANY TROUBLED 
GIRLS AND BOYS ARE GIVEN A CHANCE TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND WHILE LIVING IN A 
FAMILY ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As 16-year-old Patrick gazed across the darkened neighborhood, his eyes 
settled on a distant hill. There, in the cool of night, the lights of Joplin 
Boys Ranch sparkled like a beacon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love looking up there," he said, pointing toward the juvenile detention 
center. "It reminds me where I could have ended up." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Patrick and the other long-term residents of Boys Town Southern 
California could have been sent to any of several facilities for troubled 
youths. Instead, they were given a reprieve of sorts -- a chance to turn their 
lives around at one of the newest satellite campuses established around the 
country in recent years by Father Flanagan's Boys Home, better known as Boys 
Town. In effect, Boys Town was their last chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Boys Town Southern California is home to 17 troubled boys and girls 
from throughout Orange and Los Angeles counties. Most of them were placed there 
because of continuing problems at home and in the community -- including gang 
activity and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Boys Town is a small version of the original Boys Town, a 
76-home residential program located in the incorporated village of Boys Town, 
Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1917 by Father Edward J. Flanagan, a Roman Catholic priest who 
borrowed $90 from a friend to open a home for wayward boys in downtown Omaha, 
its look has changed significantly in recent years. Gone is compound-style 
living that for decades characterized Boys Town. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Orange County campus, which opened last spring, includes five new 
homes on Flanagan Road, each comprising about 4,500 square feet. Each home is 
managed and occupied by a specially trained married couple who have 
responsibility for up to six youths in addition, in some cases, to their own 
children.

 Currently, 12 boys and five girls are living at Boys Town Southern California; 
most were placed there by their parents, who pay a fee based on their incomes, 
or by the Orange County Department of Probation or the Orange Department of 
Childrens Services. The five homes are expected to be fully occupied by 30 boys 
and girls by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the kids who have trouble, who are in gangs or on drugs, come from 
families that are disorganized, chaotic and generally dysfunctional," says 
Michael L. Riley, site director for Boys Town Southern California, which has 
offices in nearby Lake Forest. "It's in our families where we learn our social 
skills, how to cope with our thoughts and how to behave toward one another. 
It's in our families where we learn confidence and self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 "When Father Flanagan started Boys Town, he used the premise that there are no 
bad boys -- just bad environment," Riley says. "The thinking is that if you 
take these kids, remove them from their bad environments and give them good 
skills, they will turn out to be productive citizens." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Boys Town, which now has 14 facilities outside Nebraska, started its national 
expansion in 1983 with a satellite campus in Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 John Melingagio, a spokesman for the organization, said the nationwide move 
was a result of the then new director, Rev. Val J. Peter's, vision "that 
children be treated in their own communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, Boys Town Southern California was launched in Lake Forest. A 
number of programs eventually were started, among them a short-term emergency 
care program for abused, neglected or runaway boys and girls based in Long 
Beach, an in-home therapy for families in crises, and placement of children 
into foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 76 acres of land were purchased in Trabuco Canyon with funds 
drawn from the Boys Town Foundation Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of community meetings outlining plans for the homes were held in 
South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always concerns about the kids," Riley said, adding that few local 
residents opposed the establishment of a Boys Town in the area. "There were 
some concerns that the kids we would enroll might bring chaos to the 
neighborhood. Of course, that doesn't happen. At our other locations around the 
country, it's pretty clear that our kids are the best monitored and best 
behaved in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to watch our kids -- most parents don't have to watch their kids. 
We're ever vigilant with our kids because they need monitoring and they need 
limit setting," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In each home, Boys Town provides a structured environment designed to teach 
children how to live successfully within a family. 
</P>
<P>
 They awaken early each morning, prepare breakfast, complete any other chores 
that might be required that morning, attend nearby public schools, return home 
after school, work on their homework and help prepare dinner. Each evening, a 
family meeting is held to discuss any problems or issues that may have arisen 
during the day. Solutions usually are arrived at democratically -- by a vote of 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we teaching them?" Riley asked. "We're teaching them how to 
negotiate, how to work through difficulties in an appropriate fashion. We're 
teaching them proper communication skills, how to share their discomfort and 
anger in an appropriate way." 
</P>
<P>
 Boys Town imposes a point system on all new enrollees -- they receive points 
for appropriate behavior and lose points for unacceptable behavior. Those who 
accumulate a specific number of points earn privileges for the next day, such 
as additional free time, sweet snacks or use of the television or telephone. 
Eventually, they progress to a weekly point system, then on to a system of 
"natural and logical consequences." Finally, they are discharged, in some cases 
back to their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the program is on teaching values and appropriate social skills, 
such as accepting instruction and criticism and interacting with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to beat these kids down, then to build them back up again," 
Riley said. "The whole purpose is to show these kids that when you engage in 
inappropriate behavior, there will be consequences. Then, we'll show them how 
to replace that behavior with an appropriate behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children at the Orange County campus have similar backgrounds -- 
they were members of gangs, used illegal drugs, engaged in fights and 
experienced significant family conflicts. One such person is Grant, 17, who 
entered Boys Town Southern California in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a junior at nearby Silverado High School, Grant works part time as an 
office assistant at Boys Town Southern California's Lake Forest headquarters. 
He is eager to make something of his once-conflicted life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it a lot here," Grant said. "Before I arrived I was getting straight 
Fs. Now, I'm getting straight A's. I'm hoping to go on to college once I leave 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick, a sophomore at Trabuco Hills High School, also has high hopes for 
himself once he leaves Boys Town. He plans to use his past involvement with 
drugs to help others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to work in drug rehabilitation," he said, adding, "If I hadn't come 
here, I'd probably be living in the gutter." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, Patrick and two younger children with similar backgrounds live at Boys 
Town with Andrew and Andrea Arambula and their two children, ages 1 and 3. The 
Arambulas, who share a comfortable apartment at the rear of the house, attended 
an intensive three-week training session at Boys Town, Neb., to prepare them 
for their positions as "family teachers." As part of their ongoing training, 
they meet regularly with Kathryn L. Moscrey, the coordinator for residential 
family services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arambulas' home is located in a cul-de-sac and is surrounded by four other 
Boys Town residences. The five girls who are participating in the program -- 
Boys Town began accepting girls in 1979 -- live across the street and are 
allowed to interact with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't take kids who are dangerous," Riley said. "Those kids go to locked 
facilities. Most of our kids have either made a suicidal attempt or gesture or 
have at least had some suicidal thoughts. There really is nothing to fear from 
these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that each child who is admitted to the program agrees to stay for at 
least one year; the average length of stay is 18 months. Only children who 
appear likely to benefit from a long-term stay at Boys Town are allowed to be 
sworn in as "citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only a few Boys Town Southern California enrollees have cause 
problems, and those have been minor. Two ran away, although both quickly asked 
to return and were welcomed back. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, nearly 600 youths have been successfully treated through the 
various programs offered at Boys Town Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shawnmari Kaiser, a clinical social worker at Fountain Valley Regional 
Hospital, said she learned of Boys Town Southern California through her own 
research and has recommended its programs to parents and psychiatrists. She 
described the program as "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 "The residential program is very supportive of the family unit, and that's 
important," she said. "They don't try to take the place of the parents; rather, 
they think in terms of reuniting the child with the family." 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "I've recommended their parenting class to a number of parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, one of Boys Town's most staunch supporters has been Bobs 
Watson. Watson, a child actor who later spent more than two decades as a 
Methodist minister, co-starred in the 1939 film "Boys Town" and in the 1941 
sequel "Men of Boys Town." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who credits his brief relationship with Flanagan on the set of those 
movies with helping to guide him toward the ministry, said he is "ecstatic" 
about the establishment of a Boys Town campus in Orange County, where he owns a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to see it come to fruition," he said. "Boys Town is a part of me -- 
I really mean that. Father Flanagan had such an impact on me that I can never 
see a child in any way other than the way in which Father Flanagan did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father Flanagan loved me, not because I was a movie star but he loved the 
boy. That really impressed me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys Town is the hallmark of all charities. It's a modern miracle."

 Attending school is a money-making proposition. A typical high school graduate 
earns $212,000 more in a lifetime than a high school dropout, according to the 
Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a friend or relative (18 or older) who doesn't have a diploma, 
give them the word. They can sign up for high school diploma programs offered 
through local school districts. Garden Grove Unified School District, for 
example, offers the course at its Chapman-Hettinga Education Center. Diplomas 
are accepted by community colleges and four-year institutions. There are no 
residency requirements, and classes are free. 
</P>
<P>
 Call school district offices at a location convenient to you for more 
information about specific programs. Spirited Debates 
</P>
<P>
 School spirit run amok? At Irvine High School, debate was swirling over the 
principal's objection to a time-honored chant that derides freshmen (using one 
of Beavis & Butt-head's favorite phrases). At Brea Olinda High School, seniors 
were having a hard time explaining the large '95 etched into the school's lawn 
with salt, killing the grass.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; TAKE A HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE MONETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Christine Monette is a senior at 
Rosary High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County has a lot to offer teens brave enough to venture into its 
uncivilized corners. 
</P>
<P>
 From 42 miles of the Pacific Ocean coastline to the Santa Ana Mountains and 
the foothills, there are many wonders to behold. Within Orange County's 782 
square miles are more than 150,000 acres of parks, preserves and public lands. 
There is much to explore -- from forest slopes and grasslands to jagged sea 
cliffs and dark canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you venture from the highways and high-rises you can encounter eagles, 
deer, coyotes, fox, rabbits and even badgers. Other varieties of creatures can 
be found in streams and tide pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to explore the variety Orange County has to offer is by hiking. 
Unlike jogging, you can view the sights at a leisurely pace and be free to 
savor the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking allows you to experience nature, get exercise, meditate, relieve stress 
and often gain the perspective you need to solve problems. Plan to hike with 
someone, because there is safety in numbers, and nature is fun to share. When 
hiking, always let someone know where you're going and approximately when 
you'll be back; you don't want to get stranded and not have anyone know where 
to find you. 
</P>
<P>
 You can plan an all-day outing or take a short hike after school. Make your 
hike what you want it to be. 
</P>
<P>
 There are trails for all levels of experience. If you're new to hiking, start 
out easy and work your way up, improving with practice and extending your 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 The same theory applies to what you need. While hiking is a low-overhead 
hobby, you need to be prepared. The most important part is comfortable walking 
shoes. Tennis shoes are fine for an easy hike, but for more difficult ones it's 
best to have a pair of hiking shoes with good foot and ankle support. Good 
thick socks are also important to cushion your feet and help prevent blisters.  
</P>
<P>
 Lightweight cotton is a good material for clothes. Long sleeves and pants help 
protect you from insects, sunburn and poison oak, but you might get hot. If you 
opt for shorts, loose ones that allow easy movement work best. Hiking is also 
easier without things in your pockets. If the weather is cold, layering will 
allow you to peel off what you don't need once you warm up. Gloves and a cap 
are important in cold weather, as is rain gear if there is a chance of showers. 
In warm weather, a light-colored hat is best and provides good protection from 
sunburn, glare, rain, wind and bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also need a small backpack or fanny pack for your personal belongings. 
Each hiker should carry his own things in case he is separated from the group.  
</P>
<P>
 When hiking, always take water and remember to drink it to prevent 
dehydration. (Never drink from streams, no matter how clear the water looks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit is a good snack for quick energy. Other things you should consider, 
depending on the kind of hike and time of day, are insect repellent, 
sunglasses, camera, flashlight, first-aid kit, sun block, map, compass, pocket 
knife, whistle and bandanna. A bandanna is good because it can be used as a 
washcloth, towel, headband, sling, cool compress or napkin. Remember to watch 
the weight when you pack for your hike. The pack should be comfortable, not too 
heavy. You're visiting nature, not moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before you begin, loosen and stretch your muscles. Slow walking warms up all 
your muscles and can help prevent strain. Comfortable and efficient walking is 
not about speed, which will only produce fatigue. Maintain your energy output 
-- that means slowing down with shorter steps when the trail climbs and 
speeding up with longer steps when the trail levels off. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch for slippery grass, sand and rocks. Swinging your arms will help provide 
stability. Don't walk with your hands in your pockets -- you won't be able to 
break your fall if you loose your balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware of the environment. Watch for things such as poison oak, ticks, 
rattlesnakes -- even mountain lions.  
</P>
<P>
 Poison oak has three shiny leaves and is found in both bush and vine form, 
usually in canyons and hillsides in semi-shady areas. You should wash your 
clothes and bathe when you return home in case you did come in contact with any 
irritants. Be sure to check for ticks, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Rattlesnakes can be found in rocky and brushy areas, along ridges and stream 
bottoms. They are more common in the daytime from early spring to mid-fall and 
at night in the summer and early fall. Rattlers are seldom seen in extreme heat 
or cold. 
</P>
<P>
 If you see a mountain lion, stay away and report your sighting to park 
officials. Caspers Park has been closed indefinitely to hikers under 18 
following a mountain lion sighting there. 
</P>
<P>
 In nature, many animals want to avoid you almost as much as you want to avoid 
them, so your best defense is simply to make your presence known.  
</P>
<P>
 Show concern for the trail and other hikers. Leave no trace of your presence 
behind -- following the admonition "take only memories, leave only footprints." 
Don't cut trail switchbacks because it breaks down the trail and speeds up the 
erosion process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once you know what to take and how to hike, you need to know where to hike. 
The best place to find trails is at local parks; they are the most accessible. 
To get you started, here are some popular hikes in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Onofre State Beach off Interstate 5 offers easy to moderate hikes. The 
northern section of the state beach extends from the Orange County line at 
Trestles Beach to the San Onofre nuclear generating station. The beach offers 
eight roads and paths allowing you to look at vegetation on the bluffs and 
eroded sea cliffs, then descend through ravines to reach the beach and explore 
the coastline. Here you have a chance to see dolphins, sea lions, harbor seals 
and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crystal Cove Park just south of Corona del Mar is a stretch of cliffs and 
oceanfront backing up to the San Joaquin Hills. The park is open from dawn to 
dusk. A visitor's center has maps posted to get you going on everything from 
the coastline to rugged backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another coastal hike is available at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, 530 
acres of wetlands partly open to the public, including the mouth of the Anaheim 
Bay and the Santa Ana River. There is a 1.5-mile path around Bolsa Chica 
Slough, although Coast Highway creates a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The foothills can be explored at Santiago Oaks Park, made up of two former 
ranch properties just east of Villa Park. The visitor's center is in a 
refurbished 50-year-old ranch house. Nearby you can explore a rock-cement dam 
from 1892. Windes Nature Trail is 0.7 miles long but leads to the summit of 
Rattlesnake Ridge, so it can get steep in places. 
</P>
<P>
 * Irvine Regional Park is a great place to spend the day because it has other 
attractions as well as hiking. There is a boating lagoon, small zoo, wildlife 
and historical exhibits and horse stables. Picnic and playground areas can be 
enjoyed after hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Some good reference books are "Nature Walks in O.C." by Alan McPherson (Bear 
Flag Books); "Afoot and Afield in O.C." by Jerry Schad (Wilderness Press), and 
"Dayhiker" by Robert Wood (Ten Speed Press).  
</P>
<P>
 Talk to others interested in the activity to learn where they like to hike. 
School clubs and groups such as the Sierra Club and Audubon Society often have 
guided hikes. Remember that conditions constantly change. If possible, call 
ahead to the Forest Service or local park for up-to-date information.  
</P>
<P>
 Hiking is the most fun when you include a lot of exploring and try out new 
trails. So, get off the couch and give nature a try. Hiking can be a great 
lifetime habit you begin to enjoy as a teen.

 School officials in Hollidaysburg, Pa., dropped a requirement that high school 
students shower after gym class, after the American Civil Liberties Union 
threatened to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU argued that the requirement violates students' privacy by forcing 
them to go naked in front of their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is 100 percent what we were looking for," said Vic Walczak, executive 
director of the ACLU's Greater Pittsburgh chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to hold seminars about the values of showering, that's fine. It 
was the mandatory nature, the intrusiveness that we were concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began when Wendy Hardie circulated a petition over the summer 
asking the school to lift the physical education department's requirement. 
Hardie graduated last spring from Hollidaysburg Area High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district in central Pennsylvania refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the physical education department and school superintendent agreed 
in a closed-door meeting of the school board to drop the requirement.

 Two new albums music fans will want to add to their list of must-haves: "Twice 
Removed" from Sloan and "Dub 56" from The Toasters. Thanks to DGC and Moon 
Records for the goods! "Twice Removed" provides more of a punk sound than 
Sloan's debut, "Smeared." This foursome from Nova Scotia illustrates a variety 
of influences, from the crisp, pop sounds of R.E.M. and the Lemonheads to the 
vintage rock of the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 This 12-track album has a vast range of songs dealing with life experiences 
and everyday social subjects and also displays a wide variety of styles. The 
result is an excellent melange of songs, from the Cobain-like riffs of "Deeper 
Than Beauty" to the Beatles-ish "I Hate My Generation" to the gripping melody 
of "Coax Me." 
</P>
<P>
 The usual love songs with light lyrics, such as "You are surely special/I like 
you, I like you" in "Penpals" are common on this album. This album is surely 
special. I like it, I like it. It's a well-blended bowl of everything, having a 
crunch pop sound with nothing gritty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toasters, a band formed just as the last of the 2-Tone acts exited the 
scene, have released their fifth album in 10 years, "Dub 56." The album 
illustrates the band's ska roots and its "East Side Beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Toasters show a wide spectrum of sounds, including the upbeat ska of 
"Little Hidden Secrets," the Jamaican roots of "Legal Shot" and the traditional 
ska of "Sweet Cherie." The result is a range of ska styles rolled up into the 
basic theme of ska-equality. This theme is implied throughout the ska scene and 
by most ska bands, and the Toasters are no exception. In "Freedom" the group 
sings, "I don't pick my friends by the color of their skin/or the language they 
speak." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dub 56" is a great album by one of the greatest ska bands around today, and 
its recognizable sound rings true. It's a skaboom!

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; 'MY SO-CALLED LIFE' REFLECTS MORE 
THAN SO-CALLED REALITY

 "My So-Called Life" is a show about one adolescent teen and her friends 
struggling through high school life. When I first saw this show, I liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Thursday at 8 p.m., I find myself watching and thinking how it relates 
to the real lives teens go through. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," where all the 
kids are rich, spoiled and take everything for granted, "My So-Called Life" is 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela, the main character, who dyed her hair red, lives in a middle-class 
home with a kid sister who secretly admires her, a dad who's going through 
midlife crisis and a mom who is constantly trying to be close to Angela but 
never succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela (played by Claire Danes) has one friend known for being slutty, another 
friend who is bisexual and, of course, there is Jordan Catalono (played by 
Jared Leto), a very cute guy on whom Angela has a crush. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, ABC has been thinking about taking "My So-Called Life" off the 
air. Why? Because it has fewer viewers than the shows it's up against: "Mad 
About You," "Friends," "Martin," and "Living Single."  
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for fans, ABC this week decided to order four more episodes of "My 
So-Called Life," bringing the total to 19. The network still has not committed 
to keeping the show for the whole season, though. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like people don't like this show. It seems that all the critics have 
given it "thumbs up." I know, too, that just about every person in my school 
watches "My So-Called Life." It always has a good message. After every episode, 
I find myself learning something about life. There has not yet been one episode 
that I wasn't thoroughly satisfied with.  
</P>
<P>
 It puzzles and greatly disappoints me that ABC is even considering removing 
this show, not only from Thursday night, but forever. I really wish they would 
reconsider.

GIRLS, BOYS HAVE IT EQUALLY BAD IN SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rather than trying to decide whether boys or girls have it worse in school 
("Boy Trouble," Nov. 23), consider what feminists have been saying for years: 
Our system of rigidly dividing up character traits between genders leaves both 
groups ill-prepared to deal with the myriad stresses, public and private, that 
they'll encounter as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys like Ken, who belched aloud in class during a discussion about love to 
hide his embarrassment, are discouraged from developing ways of communicating 
their feelings about relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural definitions of masculinity compel boys to act aggressively, and so 
they learn to express emotion only on the football -- or battle -- field.  
</P>
<P>
 The father who calls his son's aggressiveness "natural" should ask himself how 
often the child was encouraged to display a (supposedly "feminine" and hence 
devalued) trait, like vulnerability. We tell half of the population that they 
can never show any insecurity and then wonder why they express "tremendous 
amounts of anger" instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile girls, encouraged to talk about their feelings, do end up articulate 
in English class. But from early on, cultural pressures to be pretty will far 
outstrip any emphasis on their intelligence. And since the standard for female 
beauty disseminated via advertising simply cannot be achieved by anyone without 
anorexia and airbrushing, girls develop the impaired self-esteem documented by 
many cultural studies. 
</P>
<P>
 So which gender has it worse? That's easy: They both do.

 Robin Abcarian's "It's a Whole Newt World" (Nov. 23) reminds me of the lady 
watching a parade march by and she proudly says, "Oh, look, everybody is out of 
step but my Johnnie!" Quit whining, Robin. Newt Gingrich stood on the Capitol 
steps and stated the GOP "contract with America." America got the message, as 
Election Day proves.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; DECONSTRUCTING THAT CURSED SHAKESPEARE PLAY; WITCHES 
AND JESUITS: SHAKESPEARE'S MACBETH BY GARRY WILLS ; OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS 
$19.95, 205 PAGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Garry Wills sets up a riddle on the very first page of "Witches and Jesuits" 
-- "If 'Macbeth' is such a great tragedy," he asks, "why do performances of it 
so often fail?" -- and then he devotes the rest of his book to solving it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macbeth," Wills explains, is regarded as a cursed play in theatrical legend 
and lore. Even if actors manage to avoid the misfortune, mayhem and death that 
have attended earlier productions, they are doomed to artistic failure on the 
stage: "Nobody has ever succeeded as Macbeth," critic Kenneth Tynan wrote. And 
so superstitious actors refer to "Macbeth" only as "the Scottish play" to avoid 
speaking its name out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I make 'Macbeth' too weird?" Wills ponders. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as we soon learn in "Witches and Jesuits," Wills has turned his attention 
to "Macbeth" for quite a different purpose: He argues that the play is 
mishandled by modern actors and directors, and misunderstood by modern 
audiences, because we no longer appreciate its historical resonance or its 
inner meaning. And he takes it upon himself to explain what is really going on 
in "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills says "Macbeth" is actually "a Gunpowder play" -- that is, Shakespeare 
uses the story of Macbeth's murderous conspiracy against the Scottish crown as 
a way of chronicling (and commenting upon) the history of Guy Fawkes and the 
Gunpowder Plot of 1605, a conspiracy that tried to assassinate King James I and 
destroy the government of England by blowing up Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Macbeth' looks like a different play," Wills insists, "when we consider it 
in this context." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills is best known, of course, as an elegant political biographer ("Nixon 
Agonistes") whose points of reference run to the classics. But his book on 
Macbeth is hardly a departure from his political writings or his literary 
tastes; indeed, Wills uses the text of "Macbeth" to explain Renaissance 
politics and history in contemporary terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Wills harks to the early 17th Century, when "a religious cold war existed 
between England and papal Rome" and the Protestant throne of England narrowly 
(and rather miraculously) avoided overthrow at the hands of shadowy plotters 
suspected to be agents of the Pope. A Jesuit might be regarded the same way 
that a communist was regarded in the '50s, Wills suggests, and gunpowder was as 
every bit as fearful as the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to grips with (the Gunpowder Plot)," he writes, "posed some of the 
same problems Americans experienced in the shock after Pearl Harbor, or after 
the execution of President Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to an elaborate propaganda campaign orchestrated by the king himself, 
the miraculous defeat of the Gunpowder Plot was celebrated in ballad and broad 
sheet in Shakespeare's day. But, as Wills convincingly demonstrates, "Macbeth" 
is a subtle, sophisticated and almost encrypted account of the very same story. 
</P>
<P>
 Wills decodes the text of "Macbeth" to show us how Shakespeare turned current 
events into popular entertainment that survives as classic theater. The witches 
and their conjuring of "Night's black agents" are made to stand for Jesuitical 
plotters against Protestant authority, and both Macbeth and his lady are their 
traitorous but troubled minions. 
</P>
<P>
 What Wills does especially well is to point out the sometimes baffling lines 
of the original text and then parse them out in terms that we can understand. 
For example, when Macbeth declaims that "The wine of life is drawn, and the 
mere lees / Is left this vault to brag of. . . ." he is using language that his 
audience understood as a reference to the sub-chamber where the Gunpowder 
Plotters planted their explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Vault,' " explains Wills, "was the 'grassy knoll' of Gunpowder writings." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills' musings on Macbeth originated as a series of formal lectures at UC 
Santa Barbara and the New York Public Library. Now he has gathered together the 
threads of his curiosity -- not only the text of Macbeth but also the props, 
costuming, stagecraft of the play as performed in Shakespeare's day -- to give 
us a vast historical tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
 His book is a scholarly, highly specialized and slightly eccentric effort, a 
true labor of love, but somehow Wills manages to convince us that a fresh 
reading of the old play has its rewards. And so love's labor is not lost in 
"Witches and Jesuits."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; HOTEL, GUESTS GLITTER ON BEHALF OF CLINIC; MORE THAN 
$65,000 IS RAISED FOR HEALTH CARE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES. THE 'CHRISTMAS FANTASY' 
FASHION SHOW AND LUNCHEON DREW 650 PEOPLE.

<P>
 An elegant holiday setting, a glitzy fashion show and a Christmas theme -- 
it's a winning formula that has worked for the South County Community Clinic 
Auxiliary for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the auxiliary's 10th anniversary luncheon and fashion show drew a 
sellout crowd of 650 to the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point. The $65-per-person 
luncheon included a fashion show featuring the latest looks from stores at 
South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Net proceeds were expected to exceed $65,000 and will go to the San Juan 
Capistrano-based clinic, which provides health care to needy families of south 
Orange County. Wings of Desire 
</P>
<P>
 "We always seem to come back to angels and fairies," said Thyra Decker, a 
committee member, explaining this year's theme, "A Christmas Fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers traditionally hold their luncheon in early December, when the hotel 
is decked out in lights and ribbons for the holidays. Guests, most of them 
women dressed in their holiday best, first crowded into the courtyard to see 
the holiday vignettes created by auxiliary members. 
</P>
<P>
 They entered a drawing to see who would walk home with one of the six 
vignettes, each stocked with all kinds of decorations and gifts and valued at 
around $3,500. One scene, "Culinary Corner," offered assorted kitchen wares 
such as a bread-making machine, coffee maker, knife set and wine rack. "It's a 
Small World" overflowed with toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Christmas Fantasy" vignette featured a traditional holiday scene with a 
decorated tree surrounded by gifts, including a Victorian doll, crystal 
candlesticks and a floral pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the presents are wrapped. You don't have to do anything," said Gaye 
Birtcher, founder of the auxiliary who worked on the vignette. "You just need 
to put people's names on the tags and you're done -- that's my Christmas 
fantasy." Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Crawford, event chairwoman, said the luncheon was a sellout (more than 
100 people had to be turned away) because "people remember the show and the 
vignettes." 
</P>
<P>
 Next the crowd moved into the ballroom, where tables were illuminated by tiny 
glowing Christmas trees topped with Tinkerbell ornaments. There, guests were 
served chicken breast with pistachio lemon crust and candied ginger carrot 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch the lights dimmed, and all eyes turned to the stage, where a 
gigantic gift box opened to reveal sugar plum fairies dressed in white who 
danced down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 They were followed by models sporting holiday and cruise wear from Calvin 
Klein, Barneys New York, Emporio Armani and a half-dozen other South Coast 
Plaza retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Models were occasionally joined by men in tuxedos bearing red roses for women 
in the audience.  
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception, the auxiliary has raised more than $1.2 million for the 
clinic. The clinic recently added a Mobile Medical Van, custom-designed to 
provide easy access to health care for South County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the crowd were: Linda Berkshire, auxiliary president; Zara Cerni and 
Beth Carney, event co-chairwomen; Margot Hughes-Lopez, executive director of 
the clinic; Monica Bergquist, Eileen Dombrow, Lois McFarlan, Cynthia Pagano, 
Anita Houston, Barbara Naud, Juin Foresman, Melba Roelen, Ruth Rothwell, Electa 
Anderson, Diane Shaber, Mame Mertes, Eunice Parker, Cindy Boragno, Billur 
Wallerich, Thomas and Carolyn Bent, Ninetta Herbert and Diane Robinson. KATHRYN

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: ADVICE FOR ORANGE COUNTY BOND INVESTORS: DON'T PANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The potential debacle brewing with Orange County's public investment fund will 
probably slam the California municipal bond market in coming days, but the 
damage isn't likely to be permanent, many analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 That means most investors who directly or through mutual funds own tax-exempt 
muni bonds issued by or tied to Orange County -- or bonds from the other 
issuers that have money invested in the O.C. fund -- should avoid panicking and 
selling. You'd just be playing into the hands of professional investors eager 
to snap up bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear that Orange County could suffer financial distress from what are so far 
unrealized losses in its now $18.5-billion investment portfolio caused 
potential buyers to pull back from O.C.-related bonds in trading late Thursday, 
some muni bond analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had trouble getting any bids" on O.C. issues after the news broke, one Los 
Angeles trader said. But the market wasn't active anyway, he said, so the day 
offered little insight as to what may happen with bond values today. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's concern, of course, is that O.C. and the other 180 government 
entities that have invested public money with Orange County Treasurer Robert 
Citron will incur losses that could impair their ability to pay interest on 
their debts, or to repay the debts when due. 
</P>
<P>
 If Orange County "starts to default on any payments, then as big as Orange 
County is, it will probably chill the rest of the California market as well," 
said Harold S. Pittman, Ventura County's treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Napoleon Brandford III, vice chairman of San Francisco-based bond 
underwriter Grigsby Brandford & Co., called the O.C. fund's trouble "really an 
isolated incident as we can tell so far," adding that, long-term, Orange County 
"is in great shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran bond analysts noted that, in general, Citron's fund doesn't 
single-handedly back up bonds issued by the fund's investors. In fact, most of 
the bonds outstanding from these issuers, including Orange County, would 
normally be backed by taxes or other revenue collected on an ongoing basis on 
behalf of projects funded by the bonds -- such as roads, water and sewer 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever stood behind the bonds yesterday still stands behind them today," 
said Zane Mann, publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor newsletter 
in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many of the issuers' bonds may carry private insurance that would 
assure timely payment of interest in the event of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Mann and other experts say prices of any bond whose issuer is an 
investor with Citron may well tumble in the days ahead -- sending yields up 
sharply -- as the market reacts to the possibility of problems. "You will get 
that panic effect," said Walt Beveridge, who manages short-term muni funds for 
Charles Schwab & Co. in San Francisco. "It's just inherent in these 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's Investors Service estimates that investors own about $780 million in 
bonds issued directly by Orange County, including pension bonds and 
certificates of participation used to fund county infrastructure projects. 
Other tax-supported debt issued by O.C. government entities, such as 
transportation authorities, totals about $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann noted that much of the money in Citron's fund may represent "reserve 
account" dollars set aside for individual bond issues. Generally, bond issuers 
always have one year's worth of interest payments put aside to give investors 
comfort that they will receive their interest on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Any threat to those reserve accounts, Mann said, will cause potential buyers 
of the bonds in question to demand a higher yield from sellers, to compensate 
for the risk that interest might be late -- even if the possibility of that 
happening is remote, given that taxes and other revenues are regularly flowing 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 What's important for investors to remember, Mann and others say, is that there 
has historically been very little risk of loss in individual municipal bonds if 
you can hold them to maturity. What happens to their underlying prices in the 
interim doesn't affect the interest you receive or the principal amount you'll 
eventually be repaid. And defaults in recent years have been extremely rare, 
despite the fiscal distress the state of California and its local entities have 
endured. 
</P>
<P>
 For owners of muni bond mutual funds, however, the situation is different: 
Because the funds have no set maturity, any losses incurred as fund managers 
trade out of temporarily devalued bonds may never be recovered. Thus, new 
problems for California muni issues, even if short-term in nature, could cause 
anguish for fund owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the mammoth California muni bond market -- estimated to be worth 
more than $120 billion -- had been attracting new buyers in recent days, as 
many investors began to view tax-free yields of 6% to 7% on long-term muni 
issues as particularly lucrative. Muni yields had surged anew over the past 
month or so as interest rates in general rose on concerns about the economy's 
strength and the potential for higher inflation in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Now even those muni bond issuers who aren't invested in Citron's fund fear 
that investors will paint all California bonds with the same brush, forcing 
issuers of all kinds to pay higher interest rates if they issue new securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The major independent bond-rating services, such as Moody's and Standard & 
Poor's Corp., said Thursday that they had made no decisions on the ratings 
accorded to Orange County bonds and those of other issuers invested in the O.C. 
fund. "Moody's is having ongoing discussions with (county) officials to review 
the situation," the rating agency said. "At this time we have taken no ratings 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the agencies should eventually brand Orange County bonds as less safe 
because of the investment fund's troubles, "it may also influence" the 
agencies' views of other California counties, said Ventura County's Pittman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, muni bond market veterans note that the California market has suffered 
a number of blows to its image in recent years, none of which have proved 
devastating for very long. In the early '90s, for example, many investors 
feared that so-called Mello-Roos bonds issued for real estate projects would 
see massive defaults as the state's real estate market tanked. But that didn't 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the state's many natural disasters since 1990 haven't more than 
temporarily shaken investors' faith in California bonds and the ability of the 
issuers to honor their debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the California muni market's biggest problem has been the same 
problem that has affected all types of bonds: the surge in market interest 
rates this year as the Federal Reserve Board has tightened credit for the first 
time in five years. Rising market rates devalue older bonds issued at fixed 
rates and make investors reluctant to invest in new bonds, for fear of seeing 
rates climb ever higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Until long-term interest rates begin to decline again, the market turmoil 
incited by Orange County's problems could mean that California muni owners' 
patience will be tested that much more severely. But that will also spell 
opportunity for investors who may view higher California muni yields as quite 
attractive in the long run.

 Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is in advanced discussions about investing in 
the fledgling Hollywood studio headed by Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg 
and David Geffen, knowledgeable sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The precise nature of Gates' possible involvement in the venture is unclear. 
Sources say he would probably serve as both an investor and technology adviser. 
Interestingly, they say Gates has also let it be known that he harbors 
directing ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' name first surfaced in connection with the studio in October, when 
Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen announced they were joining forces. At the 
time, they shot down reports that Gates and others were involved. On Thursday, 
all of the parties declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources, who have called the previous reports of Gates' possible involvement 
premature, say the talks have recently taken on a more serious cast. But they 
also warn that Gates has been known to back away from promising-looking 
discussions before. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, 38, has the resources to play at any level in Hollywood. He ranks at 
the top of the latest Forbes list of the 400 richest individuals, with a 
reported net worth of $9.35 billion. His wealth is derived from the runaway 
success of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, the world's largest computer 
software company, which he started with classmate Paul G. Allen in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates is said to be intrigued by Hollywood, and he has been linked in the past 
to discussions with Creative Artists Agency Chairman and industry matchmaker 
Michael S. Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of Gates' relationship to the studio partners is also unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, Ovitz, Katzenberg and Geffen know one another, and all were at 
investment banker Herbert Allen Jr.'s annual Sun Valley retreat last summer. 
Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen are said to be seeking as much as $2 billion 
in backing for their unnamed studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, their company is gradually taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday they announced a $200-million joint venture with Capital Cities/ABC 
to develop television programs. And on Wednesday they announced that Helene 
Hahn, Katzenberg's longtime head of business affairs when he was Disney studio 
chairman, will oversee all business and legal affairs for the new studio. The 
three are also said to be in advanced negotiations to take over space in Playa 
del Rey. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Pictures, the entertainment company being formed by veteran Hollywood 
executives Mike Medavoy, Peter Hoffman and Arnold Messer, appears to be close 
to taking flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix partners have spent the past several months globe-trotting in 
search of investor backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman declined to comment on reports that the company expects to set out 
with $75 million to $100 million in seed money, but he did say things are "very 
close" to coming together. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures Entertainment, Medavoy's old employer, is said to be one likely 
backer as a co-financier and/or distributor of movies produced by Phoenix, but 
sources said there are separate discussions with other studios. Medavoy headed 
Sony's TriStar Pictures unit until January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix partners are also in talks with Onex Corp., a Toronto-based 
company with $1.4 billion in assets and interests in everything from auto parts 
to airline catering. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, a former Carolco Pictures executive, heads a production, packaging 
and consulting company called CineVision. Medavoy supervised the production of 
Oscar-winning films such as "Platoon" and "Dances With Wolves" at Orion 
Pictures before joining TriStar. Messer was formerly with Columbia/TriStar 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 Medavoy said it's too soon to discuss the company's plans. But sources say 
Phoenix will be involved in areas outside film production, including foreign 
financing deals. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners' fund-raising crusade has brought them in contact with everyone 
from Southeast Asian investors to British conglomerates. In the United States, 
the company was said to be in serious discussions with super-investor Kirk 
Kerkorian earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix declined to comment on that report. But a spokesman for Kerkorian 
confirmed that the discussions took place. Alex Yemenidjian of Kerkorian's 
Tracinda Corp. said Kerkorian has "a very high regard" for Medavoy but 
ultimately decided to invest elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say we got very close and pulled out (would be) a mischaracterization," 
Yemenidjian said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like we looked at it and didn't like it," he said. "We entered into 
discussions to consider it. During those discussions other things came up . . . 
other investment opportunities that prevented us from going into that 
transaction. We just got busy with other things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Studios got off to an early start in the Academy Awards derby 
Monday by sending out a glossy brochure that promotes 13 of its films for Oscar 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In deference to the talent, studios usually go to great lengths to avoid the 
appearance of favoring certain of their films over others. But the number of 
screenings scheduled for each film offers a good indicator of where Disney 
stands. "The Lion King," the critically acclaimed hit, has the most showings, 
at six. Next is "Quiz Show," a bigger success with critics than with 
moviegoers, with five. The quirky "Ed Wood" gets four. And the troubled "I Love 
Trouble" has only one.

COMPANY TOWN; THE GATT VOTE: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; HOLLYWOOD'S NEW READING OF 
PACT SUPPORTS PASSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There has been no rewrite of the GATT script in the year since European 
protectionists essentially barred entertainment from the agreement. 
Nonetheless, Hollywood's new reading of the treaty is that GATT, though highly 
defective in some areas, may not be so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago this month, trade negotiators hammered out the GATT agreement in 
Geneva that left open the possibility that Europe -- mainly the French -- could 
continue to impose barriers on U.S. entertainment exports. At the time, 
Hollywood cried foul and threatened an international dogfight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry has since gone beyond quietly accepting its fate, to the 
point of actually supporting passage of the far-reaching trade treaty this week 
as it finally worked its way through Congress for official ratification. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, GATT -- short for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- 
passed the Senate late Thursday after approval by the House earlier in the 
week. It now awaits President Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we were bitterly disappointed last year in the final agreement, 
to oppose this agreement doesn't make sense. This agreement, defective as it 
is, is better than no agreement," said Fritz Attaway, general counsel for the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America, the industry's chief lobbying arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's seeming change of heart stems from two things. First, GATT 
includes intellectual property protections that the entertainment industry 
hopes will stem the growing tide of pirated videos, albums and entertainment 
software proliferating in such areas as China, Russia and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood estimates its piracy losses at $2 billion a year. GATT provides for 
measures to help battle piracy, with the threat of trade sanctions hanging over 
countries that fail to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, there is the feeling in the industry that lowering trade barriers 
worldwide is good for business overall because it will stimulate the economies 
of developing nations, which in turn will eventually boost demand for 
Hollywood's products. 
</P>
<P>
 "When economies boom, people have more money and go to the movies," one studio 
chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some executives say there has been a clear surge in the movie business 
in Mexico, which they attribute in part to the enactment of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, MPAA President Jack Valenti, one of GATT's most vocal critics 
a year ago, noted the industry's "tremendous disappointment in the European 
Union's unwillingness to commit to tearing down its trade barriers against 
America's creative community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Valenti went on to praise the agreement for including the intellectual 
property protections and the overall opening up of trade avenues. "Any pact 
that achieves both those goals is to be lauded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say there aren't concerns. France and a handful of other 
European countries are still aggressively limiting the amount of U.S. 
entertainment allowed into their countries, chiefly that which airs over its 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations have been strained in other ways. United International Pictures, the 
foreign distribution arm of Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures and 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, has been threatened with being dismantled on antitrust 
grounds. The dispute is now on the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hollywood is encouraged that the enthusiasm for quotas in Europe is 
inconsistent and that quotas have been enforced only sporadically. Germany and 
Britain, for example, are lax about enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In one peace overture, Walt Disney Co., through its Miramax unit, recently 
said it would promote the distribution of French films and invest up to $30 
million in European co-productions. What's more, entertainment executives 
believe that even the French will eventually face internal pressure to lift 
barriers as services such as video on demand develop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Companies developing these services, the reasoning goes, won't sink money into 
the projects unless they are assured that a wide range of movies and programs 
will be available on their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be comfortable for the French to sit behind their Maginot 
line of quotas," said Jonas Rosenfeld, president of the American Film Marketing 
Assn.

THE GATT VOTE: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; GATT IS LOOKING GOOD TO CALIFORNIA; 
COMMERCE: IT HAS MORE GLOBAL TRADE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. FROM TOYS TO RICE, THE 
ACCORD WILL MEAN MORE BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the talk about opening foreign markets and leveling the playing field 
for U.S. trade, the world trade accord will mean one thing to Barbara Willey, 
an executive with Woodland Hills toy importer Applause Inc.: cold cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the pact will cut or eliminate U.S. duties on imported toys, "over a 
period of five or six years we could have a savings of easily $1.3 million," 
she said. That's a substantial sum for a firm with annual sales of about $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 For California almond growers, who represent about 99% of the $800-million 
U.S. industry, the new accord will cut tariffs on exports to Europe and Asia. 
Because almond farmers export about 70% of their crop, GATT translates into $40 
million to $45 million annually in new business or savings from lower tariffs, 
said Walt Payne, president of Blue Diamond Growers, the state's largest 
producer of the nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 All over California, which has more international trade than any other state, 
makers of everything from Barbie dolls to integrated circuits stand to gain 
from Congress' ratification of the new trade accord under GATT, the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Meanwhile, importers of toys, fabrics and 
others goods will pay lower prices. That means foreign consumers will pay less, 
for example, for a six-pack of American beer, while Americans will pay less for 
stuffed animals made in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will benefit some California industries more than others. It 
will lower tariffs and other trade barriers during the next several years on 
agricultural products, beer, wine, semiconductors, furniture, drugs, medical 
instruments and other items going abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some businesses, the accord will have only indirect benefits. The 
agreement for the first time will remove trade barriers to financial services 
such as banking and insurance. But nothing will happen right away: GATT simply 
sets in motion a process to open up foreign markets in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates worry that the accord's creation of a new World Trade 
Organization, which will rule on trade disputes, will set the stage for attacks 
on California's environmental, labor and consumer laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think . . . laws in California are particular lightning rods for 
challenges" as impediments to trade, said Andrew Wheat, head of an anti-GATT 
group founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a host of California firms, GATT will mean business. 
</P>
<P>
 State rice farmers can look forward to boosting exports by a third, sending 
200,000 metric tons of rice a year to Japan alone as that nation opens its rice 
markets to imports. South Korea has also agreed to U.S. imports. 
</P>
<P>
 New rice exports will translate into $100 million a year for state farmers, 
and every 1,000 additional tons shipped roughly translates into two new jobs, 
said Bill Huffman, a spokesman for the Farmers' Rice Cooperative in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 GATT also promises to strengthen protections of intellectual property rights 
for products such as software. 
</P>
<P>
 That's important for Amgen, the Thousand Oaks biotech company that has 
genetically engineered a line of drugs for cancer and kidney dialysis patients. 
Amgen, which sells about 20% of its products overseas, looks forward to the 
protections GATT promises as it contemplates entering new markets in Latin 
America and Asia, where copyright laws are weak or not enforced, company 
spokesman Peter Teeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 For exporters such as Douglas Aircraft Co., the Long Beach maker of commercial 
jets such as the MD-11, the accord will level the playing field against its 
European rival, Airbus Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the World Trade Organization will have more clout than previous 
groups to resolve trade disputes, and European officials will no longer be able 
to ignore trade-body rulings if they favor Douglas over Airbus, as they have in 
the past, spokesman Tom Williams said. But does the new accord automatically 
mean Douglas will sell more jets? 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily, Williams acknowledged. "We're more dependent on the market," 
he said. "Exports have been . . . slow due to the worldwide economic downturn . 
. . in commercial aviation." 
</P>
<P>
 The domestic textile and apparel industry stands to lose under new provisions 
of GATT that phase out U.S. barriers to imports of products produced in 
low-wage nations. For Los Angeles, one of the centers of the U.S. garment 
industry, the concern is that a flood of cheap imports will create competitive 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, said George Rudes, owner of Los Angeles women's sportswear maker Saint 
Germain, the industry here has faced low-priced imports for years and is 
surviving because of inherent advantages: quicker delivery times and better 
design and quality. 
</P>
<P>
 And GATT could create some advantages. Manufacturers such as Saint Germain 
could buy cheaper imported fabric from overseas. And increased international 
trade could boost the U.S. economy, increasing general demand for clothing.

THE GATT VOTE: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; WORLD TRADE BLOCS 
</P>

<P>
 The new World Trade Organization is the international governing authority for 
the myriad trade rules negotiated by more than 100 nations in Geneva last year. 
As envisioned by the treaty, global tariffs would be slashed an average of 40%, 
government subsidies would be reduced and many trade barriers affecting food 
and other products would vanish. Yet there will remain an alphabet soup of 
regional trade alliances. Export mania is spreading, and many nations have lost 
enthusiasm for old-fashioned trade restrictions. Part of the significance of 
the global trade deal is that many tariffs paid by non-members of regional 
pacts will be lower than before. In addition, the World Trade Organization 
plans to negotiate further tariff reductions in the future, aiding trade 
partners who are not members of the same regional alliance. The membership of 
trade alliances is changing fast, though, and old boundaries are blurring. Here 
is a glance at some of the agreements and alliances, large and small:  
</P>
<P>
 1. Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): APEC was established 1989 to 
promote trade and investment in the Pacific Basin, in response to a more 
exclusive East Asian zone advocated by Malaysia. APEC's 16 members, who 
represent 40% of global trade, include Japan, China, South Korea, Hong Kong, 
the United States and Canada. APEC members set free trade by 2020 as a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 2. European Union (EU): This expanding market is the offspring of the European 
Economic Community, launched in 1957 as Western Europe struggled to recover 
from World War II. Despite Norway's recent vote not to join, the EU is a highly 
effective example of regional economic cooperation, and its influence is 
expanding. Longtime members include Germany, France and Italy, and the addition 
of Austria, Finland and Sweden next year will bring the EU roster to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 3. North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA): The 1993 deal has bound 
Mexico, the United States and Canada in an increasingly "North American" 
market, in which trade barriers and tariffs are gradually vanishing. NAFTA, not 
quite 1-year old, has received generally positive reviews as trade has expanded 
solidly among the three neighbors. Fears that it would prompt an exodus of U.S. 
jobs into the cheaper labor market of Mexico have proven unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Several smaller alliances include: 
</P>
<P>
 4. Andean Group: Launched in 1969 to increase economic ties within South 
America. Its success has been limited by members' reluctance to abandon 
individual trade policies in favor of collective agreements. Members are 
Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Fromed in 1967 to promote 
economic and cultural cooperation in Southeast Asia. Members, which grant each 
other preferential duties on many products, are Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations pact (CER): The 1983 deal 
aimed for a manufactured-goods free-trade zone encompassing the two nations. 
Subsequent agreements covered most services, along with efforts to harmonize 
product standards, customs procedures and business laws. 7. Caribbean Community 
and Common Market (CARICOM): Established in 1973 to promote economic 
integration among less-developed nations in the region. Members include 
Antigua, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, 
Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 
Trinidad and Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Central American Common Market: Under this 1960 pact, Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua are working toward a common market. 
But progress has been hindered by protectionism and ideological differences 
among the countries. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Southern African Development Community (SADC): This 10-nation pact emerged 
from a 1979 organization dedicated to cooperating on regional development plans 
and to reducing the nations' economic dependence on South Africa. But progress 
has been hindered by the members' weak economies. In August, South Africa 
joined the group, which is widely considered the key economic and political 
alliance in the region. Other members are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, 
Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Southern Common Market (Mercosur): Established in 1991 to create a common 
market among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, Mercosur is off to a 
strong start. Tariff reductions are stimulating business, and trade among 
members has more than doubled since 1990. 11. RUSSIA: Economic relations 
between Russia and other nations of the former Soviet Union have been chaotic 
after the unraveling of Comecon, their former economic alliance. But the 
western world beckons: Earlier this year, Russia signed an agreement with the 
European Union lifting most barriers to Russian exports. Russia and Western 
Europe also agreed to start official talks in 1998 to establish a Europe-Russia 
free trade zone.

 Single-Family Home Sales Rise in State: Sales of detached homes were up for 
the third straight month, a sign that the battered market is recovering despite 
rising interest rates, the California Assn. of Realtors said. On a seasonally 
adjusted basis, the number of single-family detached homes that closed escrow 
during October was up 1.3% over September and 1% above October, 1993, the 
association said. At the same time, the median price of such homes was 
$180,100, down 0.7% from September and 2.4% below prices in October, 1993.

 FCC May Increase TV Station Ownership Limit: The agency is finalizing a 
proposal to raise the maximum number of stations a single company can own, 
industry officials said.Under current rules, established to encourage diversity 
among TV owners and in programming, owners are limited to either 12 stations or 
a number that collectively serves no more than 25% of the U.S. population. Now, 
in recognition of industry competition, the Federal Communications Commission 
is floating a plan to raise the limit to 18 stations. It also has told industry 
officials that it will propose relaxing the population limit to 30% or 35%.

 Chemical Bank to Cut Jobs: In a sweeping austerity move, the New York-based 
company said it will eliminate 3,700 positions, sell most of its New Jersey 
operations and put nearly $1 billion in bad property loans on the 
block.Chemical Banking Corp. has been struggling to reduce expenses since it 
merged with Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in 1992. The actions will cost the 
nation's fourth-largest banking company about $410 million before taxes in the 
fourth quarter ending Dec. 30. Analysts estimated that the charge will reduce 
fourth-quarter earnings by 50 cents per share.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS AND BONDS HIT BY ROBUST ECONOMY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New reports of unexpectedly strong economic activity resurrected fears of 
higher interest rates and sent stock prices tumbling and bond yields higher 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders also said that worries about possible losses on Orange County's 
huge investment fund -- another victim of rising interest rates -- reverberated 
in markets and raised concerns about the health of the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrial average slumped 38.36 points to 3,700.87, 
after having been down as much as 48 points late in the day. Broader indexes 
also plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said several rounds of high-volume computerized selling worsened the 
Dow's losses. But they said the market's negative tone was set by another rise 
in interest rates, as economic reports pointed to new strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said its index of manufacturing 
growth rose to 61.2% in November from 59.7% the previous month. That was the 
highest reading since February, 1984, and stronger than analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate reports, the Commerce Department said Americans' incomes surged 
1.4% in October, and the Labor Department said first-time claims for state 
unemployment benefits dropped by 12,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The data was "considerably stronger than people were anticipating," said 
Robert Walberg, senior stock analyst at MMS International in Chicago. It 
indicates "that the economy remains robust, which increases the likelihood that 
the Federal Reserve (Board) will tighten (credit) down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yield inched up only 
modestly on the news, to 8.01% from 8.0% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But shorter-term yields continued their climb to 3 1/2-year highs. The yield 
on the three-month T-bill jumped from 5.72% on Wednesday to 5.77% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are poised for more bad news today, when the government reports on 
November employment -- considered the first important look at broad economic 
trends in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, sellers swamped the market after two days 
dominated by bargain hunters. In the broad market, declining issues outnumbered 
advancers by 15 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 19 to 9 on Nasdaq. 
Trading was active. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp drop in technology stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite index down 9.71 
points to 740.61. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the stock market's growing problem is the fresh allure of 
short-term interest rates, such as on bank CDs. Those yields are drawing more 
investors away from stocks, threatening a sustained downtrend in share prices 
if for no other reason than lack of demand, some experts warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The market was pushed lower by a broad selloff in computer stocks, as 
concern mounted about glitches in Intel's Pentium chips. Intel fell 1/2 to 62 
5/8, extending Wednesday's 2 3/8-point drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Other losers included computer makers Dell Computer, down 3 5/16 to 39 3/4; 
Apple, off 1 1/16 to 36 3/16, and Gateway 2000, down 1 5/8 to 20 1/4. CS First 
Boston downgraded some of the PC makers, citing potential expenses tied to the 
problem with Pentium chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal computer stocks were also hit by an announcement by Hewlett-Packard 
that it will cut prices on some PCs. Hewlett lost 2 5/8 to 95 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retail stocks fell on surprisingly weak November sales figures. The 
losers were led by electronics retailer Best Buy, which plunged 11 3/8 to 32 
7/8. Other issued falling included Wal-Mart, down 3/4 to 22 1/2; J.C. Penney, 
down 3 1/2 to 42 1/2, and Gap, off 3 to 32 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among industrial issues losing ground, International Paper sank 1 3/8 to 70 
1/8, GM dropped 1/2 to 37 5/8 and Xerox slumped 2 to 96 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch fell 1 1/2 to 36 1/2 on rumors -- denied by the investment 
firm -- that it has suffered large losses on investments involving Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stock analysts said the drop in Merrill's stock, and general worries 
about financial fallout from the giant Orange County investment fund's 
securities losses, helped depress stocks across the board late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, stocks also closed lower. In London, the Financial Times 100-share 
average fell 41.8 points to close at 3,039.6, while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX 
was down 1.67 points at 2,046.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended the day at 19,013.60, off 62.02 points. 
Mexico's market was closed for the presidential inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few bright spots in Thursday's markets: The dollar advanced broadly, 
hitting a seven-week high against the Japanese yen, buoyed by the strong 
economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar was quoted at 99.34 Japanese yen, the highest level 
since Oct. 13, and up from 98.93 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. currency also changed hands late in New York at 1.573 German marks, 
up from 1.569.

 Purchasing Managers Report Increase: Manufacturing soared in November for the 
15th straight month and at the fastest pace in nearly 11 years, the National 
Assn. of Purchasing Management said.The group's purchasing managers index rose 
to 61.2% in November from 59.7% in October. Any figure over 50% points to 
manufacturing growth. The index was at its highest since February, 1984, when 
it was at 61.3%. In another report, the Commerce Department said Americans' 
incomes surged 1.4% in October, the biggest jump in eight months and the ninth 
straight gain. In yet another report, the Labor Department said the number of 
Americans filing the first time for state unemployment benefits dropped last 
week to the lowest level in two months.

IDB LINKS ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE TO CRIMINAL PROBE OF FIRM; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: IT 
CONFIRMS FEDERAL GRAND JURY SUBPOENAED JEFFREY SUDIKOFF AND OTHER OFFICER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 IDB Communications Group for the first time linked Chief Executive Jeffrey P. 
Sudikoff, one of two men who controls the Los Angeles Kings hockey franchise, 
to an ongoing criminal investigation into the telecommunications company's 
controversial accounting methods. 
</P>
<P>
 In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public Thursday, 
the Culver City-based company acknowledged that subpoenas were issued in 
October and November by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles seeking information 
on a variety of matters, including "certain entities in which Jeffrey P. 
Sudikoff and another officer of IDB are personal investors and transactions 
between such entities and IDB." 
</P>
<P>
 IDB did not identify the name of the other officer, but Sudikoff and IDB 
President Edward Cheramy have previously said in interviews that they invest 
together in real estate and other investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff did not return calls. An IDB spokesman said he did not want to 
elaborate on the information in the filing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate disclosure, IDB also acknowledged for the first time that the 
SEC, which is conducting a formal investigation of its own into the company, 
issued a subpoena to Sudikoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure, which comes as IDB is on the verge of being acquired by 
Mississippi-based LDDS Communications, goes well beyond a disclosure last week 
in which IDB for the first time confirmed the criminal investigation into its 
accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The company at the time said only that a grand jury was looking at the 
company's first-quarter results and information surrounding the abrupt 
resignation in May of Deloitte & Touche as IDB's auditors in a dispute over the 
company's accounting methods. It did not mention Sudikoff. Thursday's 
additional disclosure was made because Sudikoff is a candidate to become an 
LDDS director after the merger, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff, whom Fortune magazine earlier this year dubbed one of "America's 
smart young entrepreneurs," bought 72% of the Kings as a personal investment 
with fellow IDB director Joseph M. Cohen from embattled sports mogul Bruce 
McNall last May. McNall, who remains a minority owner, has agreed to plead 
guilty next week in a separate criminal case to four criminal counts, including 
two counts of bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deloitte resignation in May sent IDB's stock crashing by more than 50%.

CHRYSLER MOVES TO REWARD INVESTORS, INCLUDING NO. 1; AUTOS: COMPANY, PARTLY AT 
URGING OF KERKORIAN, HIKES DIVIDEND AND RELAXES POISON PILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Answering in part the demands of mega-shareholder Kirk Kerkorian, Chrysler 
Corp. on Thursday announced a dividend increase, stock buyback and easing of 
its anti-takeover defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions -- some expected for months -- were approved by the board of 
directors in its first meeting since Kerkorian, owner of 9% of Chrysler's 
shares, asked on Nov. 14 that steps be taken to boost the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved a 60% dividend increase to $1.60 annually, endorsed a 
$1-billion stock buyback to begin early next year and relaxed its anti-takeover 
"poison pill" provision to increase the percentage of stock one person can 
control to 15% from 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased," said Alex Yemendijian, an executive with Tracinda 
Corp., Kerkorian's Las Vegas-based operating company. "These are all steps that 
will enhance the value of Chrysler shares for all shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler stock slipped 75 cents Thursday to close at $47.75 in heavy trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares were trading just below $46 in 
mid-November, before Kerkorian made his demands. 
</P>
<P>
 While taking steps to reward shareholders, company officials said they would 
not be derailed from strengthening Chrysler's financial statement, spending 
heavily on future products and preparing for the next economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, the company said it would fully fund its pension plan and set 
aside $7.5 billion cash by year's end. It also is continuing to reduce debt and 
has increased by 10% its five-year capital spending program on future products 
to $22.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident that our plan is the correct one and that our financial 
position will continue to strengthen," said Robert Eaton, chairman and chief 
executive of Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts praised Chrysler's moves. "The board sent a big message that the 
prospects for the company are very good," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, analyst with 
S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobaccaro said Chrysler probably would have raised its dividend and initiated 
a stock buyback anyway, but that Kerkorian served as a catalyst in forcing the 
board to act sooner in some areas than it would have otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian, who made his fortune in the airline and entertainment industries, 
said on Oct. 14 that he wanted to increase his stake in Chrysler to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 But such a move was prohibited by the company's poison pill.

THE GATT VOTE: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; INDUSTRY-BY-INDUSTRY IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The GATT agreement will pare tariff barriers, cut subsidies and protect 
intellectual property rights. Here is brief look at the impact on various U.S. 
industries: 
</P>
<P>
 * Agriculture: American farmers will be able to boost sales of wheat, corn and 
rice. European subsidies for agriculture will decrease, and Japan will buy 
increasing amounts of U.S. rice, beef and dairy products. California growers 
should benefit substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aircraft: The European Union will restrict its heavy financial subsidies for 
the Airbus. This will help expand worldwide sales for American-made planes, 
with Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas standing to benefit. Apparel: U.S. 
clothing manufacturers are expected to be hit hard by rising imports. But 
California's bustling industry, with local designers and fast turnaround times, 
should be able to handle the competitive pressure by keeping in close touch 
with rapidly changing fashions and styles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Automobiles: Voluntary restraints by Japan on auto shipments will end, 
allowing expanded sales to the United States and Europe. But American auto 
exports, particularly of parts, will be helped by reductions in tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Movies and television: The industry is disappointed because foreign 
governments can still enact quotas limiting American movies and TV programs, 
but Hollywood welcomes provisions in GATT that it believes will help battle 
piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecommunications equipment: Boom times are expected for high-quality, 
U.S-made telephones, switches, fiber-optic cable and other equipment, as 
foreign countries remove tariffs and other barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computers and computer accessories: Already the world leader in computer 
innovation, the United States will boost sales of everything from hard drives 
to software as local tariff barriers fall in more than 100 nations. U.S. 
strength is in the high end of the market, which encompasses more sophisticated 
machines and programs. Silicon Valley will share in the prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intellectual property protection: For the first time, GATT members are 
pledged to take action against pirates of videos, movies, software and computer 
games. U.S. industries welcome the effort but are unsure if the campaign will 
be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Construction equipment: U.S. makers of tractors, dump trucks, excavators, 
bulldozers and other big-ticket items will carve out significant markets in 
developing countries, where high tariffs sometimes blocked access. ROBERT A.

winery in 1973 when TMI acquired Parducci Wine Cellars, said he was barred from 
entering the winery. Jim Martin, president of TMI, said Parducci was fired 
because of his relationship with personnel at the facility.

 Retailers See Strong Finish in November: Last weekend's promising start to the 
holiday shopping season rescued the nation's retailers from an otherwise dismal 
November, the big store owners said in announcing sales figures that, while 
mixed, forecast a generally strong holiday season. Analysts said November's 
results bode well for the holidays because consumers showed a strong appetite 
over the Thanksgiving weekend for gifts such as electronics and 
jewelry.Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said sales from 
stores open at least a year rose 5.4% from last November. Kmart Corp. said such 
sales rose 4.2%, and Dayton Hudson's rose 8.7%. The company owns department 
stores, the Target discount chain and the Mervyn's clothing chain. Los 
Angeles-based Broadway Stores Inc. said sales increased 0.2% in November.

 Intel Reveals 2nd Bug in Pentium Chip: The company said it has fixed the 
problem, which was discovered in some of its top-of-the line computer chips, 
but new microprocessors without flaws won't be widely available to computer 
makers for several weeks. The second bug, which was discovered in the third 
quarter, slowed the performance of the 100-megahertz Pentium chip running in 
some multiprocessor computers and has been corrected, Intel Corp. said. The 
disclosure of the additional flaw comes as the world's largest independent chip 
maker struggles to contain the furor about a flaw in the Pentium that wasn't 
disclosed by the company until a debate sprang up on the Internet.

 Maybe It's the Long Lines: When it comes to dealing with the public, grocery 
checkout clerks were rated the least helpful or friendly, according to a survey 
of 1,312 consumers by marketing consultant Wunderman Cato Johnson, part of the 
advertising agency Young & Rubicam. Airline check-in employees were the 
second-most annoying, flight attendants were third and airline phone personnel 
were fifth.The No. 4 spot went to hotel check-in clerks. Department store 
salespeople ranked sixth on the list of least effective, bank officers ranked 
seventh, bank tellers eighth, cable TV phone personnel ninth and rental car 
phone personnel 10th. The employees rated most helpful and friendly included 
credit card phone representatives, at No. 1, followed by rental car desk clerks 
and long-distance phone personnel.

 Living High on the Hog: Hog prices are the lowest they've been in 20 years, 
but you wouldn't know it from supermarkets in most parts of the country. 
Although scattered meat companies and supermarket chains are beginning to trim 
retail pork prices, many are not yet passing along the 33% drop in the price of 
hogs since August.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average 
retail price of pork had dropped only about 1% to $1.97 a pound by October, the 
latest data available. One rule of thumb is that consumers should reap roughly 
a third of any drop in hog prices. In this case, that would be about 22 cents a 
pound. High prices are swelling the profit margins of meatpackers and retailers 
and upsetting farm groups and farm state legislators, who had hoped that lower 
retail prices would encourage Americans to eat more pork.

 Help in Becoming Well-Heeled: Rose-Lee, a Beverly Hills-based footwear 
company, has designed shoes with interchangeable heels that allow women to 
change a heel's height from one inch to 3 1/2 inches.The shoes were designed by 
an orthopedic surgeon and a nurse practitioner who say they've seen an endless 
stream of patients complaining of back, knee and ankle pain that can be 
attributed to high-heeled shoes. The shoes come with two sets of heels, which 
can be unscrewed with a special key or a coin. The shoes will retail for about 
$90.

 Banking Without a Bank: Bankers are increasingly installing automated teller 
machines in grocery stores and fast-food restaurants instead of in their 
branches, a survey by industry newspaper American Banker shows.Of 3,000 ATMs 
installed by the top 50 U.S. banks from June, 1993, to June, 1994, nearly 700 
were installed away from branches, a 21% increase. Bankers say they are placing 
the machines in grocery stores, gas stations and office lobbies to make it more 
convenient for people to get at their money. BankAmerica Corp. recently said it 
would place ATMs or mini-branches in 300 Lucky supermarkets in California.

 Cash Card Goes Global: Visa International on Thursday introduced the first 
"electronic purse" that can be used around the world. The prepaid card, called 
Visa TravelMoney, allows consumers to get cash in different currencies from 
more than 200,000 Visa/PLUS ATMs at favorable exchange rates.Customers can buy 
the cards at an on-line bank terminal with any amount of money. The card can be 
used immediately to draw cash in the local currency at any Visa/PLUS ATM. Six 
banks in Mexico, Britain and the United States, with a total of 68 branches, 
will issue the cards in a six-month pilot program. The banks are Bancomer, 
Banco Mexicano and CONFIA in Mexico, Bank of Scotland in Britain and Colorado 
National Bank and First Bank System in the United States. The cards are to be 
offered by Visa's other member banks after the pilot.

'LOCAL LONG-DISTANCE' PHONE RATES TO BE CUT; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: UTILITIES 
OFFICIALS WARN CONSUMERS TO EXPECT A BLITZ OF CONFUSING PROMOTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 AT&T, MCI, Sprint and other phone companies, as expected, said Thursday that 
they will undercut by a sizable margin the rates that Pacific Bell and General 
Telephone will charge for "local long-distance" calls as of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-distance carriers filed their rate plans with the California Public 
Utilities Commission, providing the first glimpse at how rates will shake out 
once that market opens to competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the new rates were incomplete Thursday and comparisons were 
difficult to make. PUC officials warned that consumers should brace themselves 
for a confusing promotional blitz by the phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Sprint promised a two-month promotional rate of 1 cent per minute 
for residential customers making calls to points more than 12 miles away within 
the same local calling area. That rate will inevitably climb much higher as of 
March 1, however. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI and AT&T, meanwhile, weighed in with rates as much as 25% below Pacific 
Bell's. 
</P>
<P>
 However, these lower rates will be offset for many customers by sharply higher 
rates for basic monthly service, which will continue to be provided exclusively 
by Pac Bell and GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples of the new rates: a three-minute call between Los Angeles and an 
Orange County location 32 miles away would cost a Pacific Bell customer 36 
cents and an MCI customer, 29 cents. A 10-minute call between San Diego and 
Ramona would cost a Pacific Bell customer $1.16 and an AT&T customer, $1.09. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, MCI, Sprint and other long-distance carriers have historically been 
prohibited from offering local toll service, which has been the domain of 
monopolies such as Pac Bell and GTE. But in September, the PUC decided to open 
the market for local toll calls to competition, making California one of the 
last states to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC handed the local carriers a key advantage by dictating that callers 
would have to dial a five-digit access code to reach any other company.

STATE TO RECONSIDER MILK PRICE DECISION; AGRICULTURE: CONSUMER GROUP CHALLENGES 
PRICING FORMULA. DAIRY FARMERS DEFEND INCREASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Food and Agriculture, in a rare move Thursday, 
reopened hearings on a year-old decision that has driven retail milk prices in 
California to their highest levels ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports, had requested 
the review, calling the state-imposed price increase a "hidden tax to 
consumers." It is the first time in memory the department has agreed to 
reconsider a pricing order. 
</P>
<P>
 The department sets farm prices, which are what dairy farmers charge 
processors for milk. Though retail prices are not regulated, changes in farm 
prices affect what consumers pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, at the urging of dairy farmers, the department changed the 
formula it uses to calculate farm prices, boosting them by 15 cents a gallon. 
The department said a new formula was needed because half the state's 2,200 
dairy farmers weren't making enough money to cover production costs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new formula in effect, a state survey shows, the average retail price 
for a gallon of whole milk hit $3.02 in the Los Angeles area in October, an 
all-time high. The amount is 14.3% higher than in October, 1993, when the 
average price was $2.64. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union wants the department to scrap the current formula and return 
to the old method of calculating milk prices, which was based in part on 
production costs in California and consumer demand for milk. The current 
formula is linked to the price the federal government sets for cheese in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 A return to the previous formula would lower farm prices by an estimated 12.5 
cents a gallon, which translates to a reduction of about 25 cents retail. 
</P>
<P>
 California's dairy farmers have countered Consumers Union's request with one 
of their own. Arguing that farmers are not earning an adequate return, they are 
seeking an adjustment to the current formula that would boost farm prices by 
1.6 cents a gallon. That translates into a retail price increase of about 3 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state rules, Food and Agriculture Secretary Henry J. Voss must make a 
decision on the proposals within 62 days. There was no indication Thursday on 
how he might decide. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing again draws attention to the upward march of milk prices in the 
state at a time when there is a nationwide surplus of milk. Consumers Union 
argues that California has kept its milk prices "artificially high," protecting 
dairy farmers at the expense of consumers, especially the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization argues that the price hikes forced low-income families to 
allocate a bigger chunk of their food dollars to milk. Many physicians consider 
milk important to children's health, and there is no comparably priced 
substitute for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Snyder, co-director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union, said 
state-mandated prices have encouraged farmers to step up milk production, 
though demand isn't growing. The surplus should be causing prices to fall, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Goold, vice president of Western United Dairymen in Modesto, said farmers 
need a price increase to help cover higher production costs caused primarily by 
increased feed costs, a lingering result of last year's floods in the Midwest. 
He attributed the increased production to more efficient farming methods that 
result in higher yields per cow. 
</P>
<P>
 Goold said the impact of the Consumers Union proposal would be severe, putting 
farmers back to where they were more than a year ago and possibly putting many 
of them out of business.

CONSUMER BRIEFS: 'MORNING AFTER' PILL LABELS SOUGHT

 A group of organizations has filed a petition with the Food and Drug 
Administration asking the agency to require relabeling of six brands of oral 
contraceptives to tell women how to use them as "morning after" pills. The 
petition says that six oral contraceptives sold in the United States are proven 
to be effective as emergency postcoital contraceptives.They are Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories' Ovral, Lo/Ovral, Nordette and Triphasil, and Berlex Laboratories' 
Levlen and Tri-Levlen. Although the drugs are sold as emergency contraceptives 
overseas, the companies have not included that use on labels in the United 
States, said Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and 
Policy, which filed the petition on behalf of the American Public Health Assn., 
the American Medical Women's Assn. and Planned Parenthood of New York . The 
groups want the labels to explain how to use the products as morning-after 
pills: two Ovral pills no later than 72 hours after intercourse and two more 12 
hours later, or two four-pill doses of the other brands, the first no later 
than 72 hours after intercourse and the second 12 hours later. Wyeth-Ayerst 
declined to comment; Berlex officials said no one was available to comment.

 Safety of Car Seats Studied: The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration is investigating claims that a child car seat made by Gerry Baby 
Products Co., a unit of Huffy Corp., may be defective. The agency said more 
than 5,000 people have complained that the Gerry Securelock Model 690 is 
difficult or impossible to close. Eleven children have been injured because the 
seat's buckle opened during accidents, the NHTSA said.

COMPANY TOWN; CABLE INDUSTRY ACTS TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; TELEVISION: 
$10-MILLION EFFORT COMES AS PHONE COMPANIES PREPARE TO OFFER DUPLICATE 
SERVICES.

<P>
 The cable industry is promising to compensate customers for late or missed 
service calls as part of a broad image-improvement effort announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting March 1, customers will get $20 for missed or late calls. Prospective 
customers will receive free cable installation if a technician misses or is 
late for an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the guarantees are voluntary, virtually all of the nation's 11,000 
cable systems have pledged to provide them, said Decker Anstrom, president of 
the National Cable Television Assn., which spearheaded the plan. Those 11,000 
systems serve about 59 million people.  
</P>
<P>
 The customer service initiative, announced at an industry convention in 
Anaheim, is designed to close "a credibility gap" with consumers, Anstrom said. 
Poor service was one of the factors that prompted Congress to re-regulate the 
industry in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most corrosive thing for our industry is wounding by anecdote," Anstrom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many cable systems have improved their service but that what sticks in 
people's minds are the horror stories. "Everybody has a story about a cable 
company," Anstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The service guarantees don't apply in the event of natural disasters, severe 
weather or labor disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is part of a larger industry effort to have consumers think of cable 
television when they think of telecommunications products and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10-million effort comes as cable and telephone companies are racing to 
get into each other's businesses and as cable faces formidable competition from 
new high-powered satellites that allow people to receive an array of programs 
using a small receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative will focus on promoting the ways in which advances in cable 
technology can change customers' lives, and on how cable's role in connecting 
schools and producing programs for classroom use will improve the nation's 
educational system. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry also plans to monitor system compliance with the customer service 
guarantees, educational efforts and other aspects of the program, Anstrom said.

COMPANY TOWN; WORKERS' COMP INSURER ACCUSED OF 'PREDATORY PRICING'; COVERAGE: 
CALCOMP DENIES THAT IT HAS ANY POLICY TO REQUIRE ITS BROKERS TO GIVE REBATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The California Department of Insurance on Thursday accused a Northern 
California insurance company of violating a state law requiring minimum rates 
for workers' compensation coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said Novato-based California 
Compensation Insurance Co. appeared to be offering rates below the minimums set 
by the state by requiring independent brokers to rebate to customers part of 
their commissions -- up to 55% for certain CalComp incentive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice constitutes unfair competition designed to win customers with low 
rates ahead of the repeal of the minimum rate law, Garamendi said. Effective 
Jan. 1, workers' compensation carriers will be free to compete on rates without 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tactics used by CalComp are, pure and simple, predatory pricing," 
Garamendi said in a statement. "By offering big discounts, the company 
blatantly tried to take business away from other carriers which, because of the 
minimum rate law, could not legally offer lower rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at CalComp, which is the first insurance company cited by the 
Insurance Department in connection with the minimum rate law, denied that they 
ever instructed their brokers to use their commissions to lure customers with 
promises of lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has never been CalComp's practice or policy to require brokers to give 
rebates," CalComp spokesman Kurt Davis said. "The brokers can take the 
(commission money given to them by CalComp) and go to Acapulco if they want. If 
they want to distribute the money to their clients, they can do so." 
</P>
<P>
 CalComp, a subsidiary of Rancho Cordova-based Foundation Health Corp., could 
lose its license to sell workers' compensation insurance in California if the 
state can prove its charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there is up to 55% going to brokers as commission, there is an implied 
requirement on the part of the insurer for the broker to give that money back 
to the policyholder," Insurance Department counsel Bruce Patton said.

ORANGE COUNTY'S FUND VALUE FALLS $1.5 BILLION; FINANCE: OFFICIALS SEEK TO CALM 
180 CITIES AND AGENCIES AND PREVENT RUN ON ONCE HIGH-FLYING PORTFOLIO. 
</P>

 In a financial tremor felt coast to coast, officials disclosed Thursday that 
Orange County's investment portfolio -- guided by a risky financial strategy -- 
has plunged in value this year by nearly $1.5 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 None of the 180 or so cities and other agencies that rely on the county to 
invest their surplus funds and some pension and other accounts have pulled out 
of the investment pool, whose complex bond holdings have been hammered by the 
year's unexpected rise in interest rates. Indeed, county officials said the 
largest investors have signaled that they will ride out the current 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 A rush by government agencies to withdraw funds from the pool -- worth $18.6 
billion after falling 7% in value since January -- could force the county to 
begin selling its holdings, which might accelerate the losses and financially 
hamstring local government.

 "A run on the asset pool will be a death spiral," said Zane Mann, editor of 
the California Municipal Bond Advisor in Palm Springs. "It would force the 
treasurer to sell more (securities) in a bad market." 
</P>
<P>
 The losses in the giant investment portfolio came to light Thursday after 
rumors swept Wall Street that Orange County was suffering cash-flow problems. 
By the time county officials held a news conference in midafternoon to deny the 
rumors, the shock waves had jolted financial markets and raised serious 
questions about the potential fallout: 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street brokerage that has extended Orange County 
$2.5 billion in credit to purchase securities, promptly denied rumors that it 
may be exposed to losses as a result of the sharp decline in the county's 
holdings. The rumors caused Merrill's stock to drop $1.50 per share on the New 
York Stock Exchange, to $36.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials announced that they had hired a Wall Street investment 
adviser to review the portfolio, assess potential damages and make 
recommendations about how investments might be changed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials also revealed that cities, school districts and other government 
agencies -- all investors in the pool -- met this week with top county 
officials, who attempted to calm their fears about the plummeting investments. 
Administrators said it was too soon to say how government budgets would be 
affected, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * Major Wall Street credit rating agencies Moody's Investors Service and 
Standard & Poor's, both of which now give Orange County bonds nearly the 
highest possible rating for safety, plan to meet with county officials next 
week to analyze the situation. Lower bond ratings would raise the cost of 
borrowing for the county's government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) called on county Treasurer Robert L. 
Citron, the manager of the county's investment pool, to either resign or 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bad investment decision with the people's money," Conroy said, 
citing Citron's extensive use of borrowed money to bet on investment market 
trends. "He was shooting craps with the people's money, and the dice rolled 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The losses incurred by the county fund, one of the nation's largest, represent 
a dramatic reversal for Citron. In recent years, the fund's investment returns 
have been the envy of the industry, averaging over 9% annually. But critics 
have objected that Citron, 69, was taking too much risk with public money. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many large institutional investors, the county essentially had borrowed 
money short-term to invest in longer-term bonds, using its clients' funds as 
collateral. That strategy worked well while interest rates were declining from 
1990 through 1993 and while the difference between short-term and long-term 
rates was wide. The fund's profit was basically the "spread" between short and 
long rates, plus the rise in value of older long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tactic has gone awry this year, as interest rates in general have 
soared with the expanding economy. That has cut the value of long-term bonds 
issued at lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, like most money managers, did not see the reversal in interest rates 
coming. In a report to the County Board of Supervisors in September, 1993, he 
wrote: "Certainly there is nothing on the horizon that would indicate that we 
will have rising interest rates for a minimum of three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county used "leverage" -- or borrowed funds -- extensively, its 
losses have been magnified, just as its gains were magnified when interest 
rates were falling. The squeeze has come in part as the securities firms that 
loaned the money have demanded that the county put aside more cash to 
"guarantee" the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the county's portfolio is leveraged two to three times its value 
through such transactions as "reverse repurchase agreements," according to 
Tanya Styblo Beder, a principal at Capital Market Risk Advisors, the firm that 
the county has hired to review its portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the fund's $1.5 billion in losses were realized, they would 
represent about 20% of the actual amount, excluding leverage, that government 
agencies have put into the investment pool -- $7.8 billion. For that reason, 
agencies have been told that if they want their money back now, beyond normal 
withdrawals, they will be paid 80 cents on the dollar.  
</P>
<P>
 Another key problem for the fund is that Citron has invested a significant 
amount of the borrowed money in securities known as "derivatives" -- hybrid 
investments that often represent a higher-risk bet on the direction of interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Those securities' losses, too, can be magnified when interest rates go against 
the investor's expectations. Moreover, because of their complexity, derivatives 
that have tumbled in value have become difficult for some investors to sell at 
any price. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials stressed Thursday that the losses in the portfolio so far are 
only on paper; most of the securities in question have not been sold, so the 
losses have not been realized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a liquidity problem," said Matthew Raabe, Orange County's assistant 
treasurer-tax collector. "It's something we need to work through, but it is not 
a crisis and it is not catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, who remained in the background, made a brief defense of his investment 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 15 years I have been managing the portfolio this way," he said. "What I 
did was not irresponsible in any manner, shape of form." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and Wall Street analysts said that as long as the county is not 
forced to sell securities prematurely at their current depressed prices, it 
conceivably could ride out the crisis and wait for the investments in question 
to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Orange County's chief administrator held two emergency meetings 
with investors -- on Tuesday and Thursday -- to request that they not draw 
higher-than-normal amounts of money from the pool. The investors include every 
Orange County city except Garden Grove and San Juan Capistrano and every county 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that immediately, everyone thought, 'I wish I could get my money out 
of here,' " said Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District, which 
has $300 million in the investment fund. "But after a while, the general 
feeling was, we all live in this county and raise our kids here and it's to 
everyone's benefit to hang in here together." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no investor has requested that its funds be withdrawn from the pool, 
county officials said. Raabe said the 11 largest investors -- including the 
Orange County Transportation Authority -- have agreed to keep their money in 
the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county officials attempted to minimize the impact of the situation, 
they acknowledged that there could be a severe financial blow to the county and 
other investors in the county investment pool if participants panic and 
withdraw their money -- or if interest rates continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not affect the county employees or the county constituency in any way 
unless people do not cooperate and we are forced to sell our securities," said 
Raabe. "At this point in time, the only danger is that people will decide not 
to work with us and we will have to sell securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe said the county's current problem is a lack of cash on hand. If 
investors decided to withdraw from the investment pool, they would have to get 
out at current market value and incur some losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very worst case scenario is that if everybody who is working with us 
chooses not to, we would have to liquidate the portfolio, and all of the 
investors would have to share in a $1.5-billion loss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is virtually no risk to the county's retirement system, Raabe added, 
because the retirement board has invested only 5% of its money in the 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said it appears that the county 
"will not make as much interest as we had previously anticipated." The county 
had planned to collect about $172 million in interest from its investments this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's counterpart in Los Angeles, Sally Reed, said her county does not 
face similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not take these kinds of risks," she said. "The problem Orange County is 
finding is they have investments with long-term maturity. They, clearly, have 
not been as conservative as others." 
</P>
<P>
 Complex derivative investments have been the source of controversy all year, 
as rising interest rates worldwide have triggered large, unexpected losses for 
companies such as Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greeting Cards and numerous 
municipalities. In an extreme case earlier this year, a New York money manager 
lost $600 million of his clients' money within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regulators worry that the complex and risky nature of the investments 
could threaten the stability of the nation's financial system, and there have 
been calls in Congress to ban derivatives. But the investments are a 
fundamental part of many investment portfolios, serving in their most benign 
form as hedges against market fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Price, president of FGIC Capital Market Services in New York City, 
which also manages funds for municipalities, said Orange County officials 
should have disclosed to investors the day-to-day performance of their 
portfolio, particularly given the aggressive, high-risk positions it has taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Orange County pool is one of the most aggressive that's managed by public 
officials," said Price, who appeared with Raabe at a forum sponsored by a trade 
publication in Santa Monica in September. "As an accounting principle, I do 
think there's a matter of disclosure involved here," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials met with Moody's and Standard & Poor's in New York two months 
ago and "received a clean bill of health," Raabe said. Orange County currently 
holds an AA rating, one notch below the highest rating possible. 
</P>
<P>
 John Moorlach, a certified public accountant who ran against Citron this year, 
compared Orange County's financial crisis to that in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, 
where the county government shut down its investment fund in October under 
similar circumstances. Moorlach noted that the official in charge of the fund 
in Ohio had not yet resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of Moorlach's campaign was his insistence that Citron was 
taking too much risk with public money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a great day," Moorlach said Thursday. "We are praying for him. 
This is the worst thing you could go through." 
</P>
<P>
 Chriss Street, a Newport Beach investment banker and well-known critic of 
Citron's, said he was dubious about the county's effort to keep its investors 
calm. "That's like saying, 'The plane is on fire and there are 20 passengers 
and there are 10 parachutes, so please don't grab a parachute and jump,' " 
Street said. 
</P>

and Scot J. Paltrow in New York contributed to this story.

BLACK FIREFIGHTERS TELL OF BATTLING BIAS ON L.A. FORCE; PERSONNEL: SEVERAL WHO 
WERE FIRED OR QUIT HAVE SUCCEEDED ELSEWHERE. THE DEPARTMENT DEFENDS ITS RECORD.

<P>
 Nearly 17 years have passed since Calvin Wells was booted out of the Los 
Angeles City Fire Department, but the pain still remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a battalion chief with the Pasadena Fire Department, he contends that he 
was targeted by training supervisors who have weeded out a disproportionate 
number of black recruits over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It leaves a bitter taste in your mouth," said Wells, 35, who was raised in 
South-Central Los Angeles and still lives in the city. "I think about it every 
time a Los Angeles firetruck rolls by." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells is one of a number of black Fire Department recruits who were fired but 
later launched successful careers in other fire departments. From his class 
alone, the fired rookies include another battalion chief and an engineer with 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department and a firefighter with the Long Beach 
Fire Department. Another African American rookie in that class was later 
rehired by the Los Angeles City Fire Department and is now a captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is racism and sexism in the Fire Department," said Capt. Roy Harvey, 
35, who contends that he has weathered much racial abuse during his 16 years on 
the force. "I'm saying absolutely that it does happen and has happened. And the 
people who say they haven't seen it have been closing their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Long regarded as one of the finest forces in the nation, the 3,100-member city 
department has recently come under increasing scrutiny for its hiring and 
promotion practices. A harshly critical city audit released last month 
concluded that white men dominate top posts and that women and minorities have 
been harassed and given unfair evaluations by supervisors, all in an effort to 
run them off the force. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, according to department data, 34% of all black recruits in 
the city Fire Department have either quit or been fired during their first year 
-- a rate twice as high as that of white firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who has studied sexual harassment and racial 
discrimination in the city's work force, has vowed to fully examine the Fire 
Department and has scheduled two hearings this month that are certain to 
generate even more heat on the department and its chief, Donald O. Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Summoned before Goldberg's Personnel Committee last month, Manning praised the 
department's minority hiring record, saying significant strides have been made 
during his tenure. He dismissed the audit findings as the grumblings of 
anonymous firefighters and a few embittered former employees. The chief was 
supported by a roomful of firefighters, some of whom testified that they had 
neither seen nor heard of harassment or discrimination in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Roger Gillis reiterated that position Thursday, calling such 
allegations "absolutely, unequivocally false." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done everything possible," he said, "to make it an equal and fair 
program for everybody of all ethnicities." 
</P>
<P>
 But in interviews with The Times, black firefighters have painted a far 
different picture of life inside firehouses across the city, alleging that 
officials at all levels in the department have allowed discrimination to 
flourish. To hammer home that point, the 225-member Los Angeles Stentorians, an 
advocacy organization for the city's black firefighters, has planned a news 
conference for today to detail alleged racism in the ranks and to offer their 
praise for the controversial city audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the black firefighters who were included in the Fire Department's high 
washout statistics was Charles Hopkins, 41, now a firefighter with the Long 
Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Los Angeles who grew up in the shadow of the Coliseum, Hopkins 
entered the academy after a four-year stint in the Navy. After his graduation, 
he was assigned to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins, who was the only African American on his shift, said he was ordered 
to accomplish tasks not required of a white rookie who had worked at the 
station. He said he was forced to arrive each day at 5 a.m. so he could finish 
a list of chores before reporting for duty at 7 a.m. Among other things, he 
said, he was ordered to make coffee for the 22 people in the firehouse and fill 
empty breathing apparatus bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins said he then laid out his protective clothing and that of the 
station's three captains and the battalion chief and his driver. Hopkins' next 
task was to check the oil, lights and batteries of the station's eight vehicles 
and to wash dirty dishes, make new pots of coffee and answer the telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kind of slow, aren't you boot? You better get with it!" Hopkins says he was 
constantly told by the other firefighters, who taunted him by saying that he 
could not fill the shoes of a white rookie who had recently transferred to 
another station. "That's the psychological game they play in the station," 
Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the morning chores and between fire calls, Hopkins said he was drilled 
by a captain who would probe for his weaknesses, criticize him and write him up 
for making mistakes.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're having so much trouble. Why don't you just quit?" Hopkins quoted his 
captain as saying while he flipped the pages of his note pad documenting the 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They beat you down until you're so dazed and pile things on you," Hopkins 
said. "Once you get confused, it just keeps snowballing." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, two weeks before the end of his probationary period, Hopkins said he 
and three other black rookies were terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins said they tried to protest but were told: "The evaluations speak for 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Black firefighters interviewed by The Times said that one way the department 
discriminates against minorities is through the subjectivity built into the 
training and evaluation process -- a criticism echoed in the recent city audit. 
</P>
<P>
 As one example, the 300-page audit cited a 1992 academy test on tool 
maintenance, in which points were deducted for writing "lightly sand" instead 
of "sand lightly" and "steel wool or emery cloth" instead of "emery cloth or 
steel wool." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of subjectivity, according to some black firefighters, has allowed 
training instructors and captains to flunk black rookies at high rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be one thing if it is tangible, but to be washed out on trumped-up 
charges, it hurts," said Wells, the Pasadena battalion chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells was 18 and fresh out of Los Angeles High School when he went through the 
city training academy. He said he was fired for having trouble lifting heavy 
ladders -- one week after the training segment on ladder operations had 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it looked like I was having problems," Wells recalled. "Being young 
and naive, and not wanting to destroy my chances for rehire, I didn't raise a 
stink and told them I would be back." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven months after he was fired, Wells was hired by Pasadena. Taking the 
Pasadena entry examination with him were five other blacks who were let go from 
the same Los Angeles academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on their experiences, the men said they had no doubt that they 
could have done the jobs on the city department had they been given a fair 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wells: "The only regret I have is that I got off to a rocky start and was 
denied fair and equitable treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the dismissal and treatment of minorities in the 
department has sparked internal friction and heightened racial tensions. Many 
non-black firefighters believe that the problem is not one of racism but of a 
lowering of standards, resulting in a higher washout rate among unqualified 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Representative of that faction is Capt. John Squire, a former training officer 
and 30-year veteran of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the zeal to hire black firefighters," he said, "the Personnel Department 
has abdicated any standard that has ever existed." Squire stressed that he 
feels that the vast majority of minorities who pass probation can do the job, 
but that he is opposed to any racial quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department was integrated in 1955 after a bitter, year-long struggle 
in which then-Chief John H. Alderson was fired for blocking efforts to remove 
black firefighters from segregated stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1974, the department has operated under a federal consent decree 
established to settle a discrimination lawsuit. The decree requires that the 
department retain at least 50% minorities among the recruits that it hires 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning has said the department has exceeded the requirements of the consent 
decree by hiring 57% minorities. But the department did not provide an annual 
breakdown requested by The Times showing what percentage of those minorities 
were retained, as required by the decree. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of blacks on the force has increased from 2% in 1974 to the current 
11%, which nearly mirrors their citywide population percentage of 13%. Based on 
current promotion trends, the chief noted, blacks will reach parity in the 
captain and battalion chief ranks by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, whites constitute 62% of the department's uniformed members, Latinos 
23% and Asians 4%. Women make up 3% of the force. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite these gains at the entry level, there has actually been a decrease 
in minority representation at the department's highest levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the top 20 top department officials and administrators, 95% are white men, 
and there are no Asian Americans, women or blacks, the Personnel Department 
audit found. In 1990, according to the audit, white men held 89% of the chief, 
deputy chief and assistant chief slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the alleged discrimination at fire stations, many black 
firefighters say the only place where they could find refuge was in the Fire 
Prevention Bureau, which is responsible for building inspections. Its officers 
work 40 hours a week and do not live at station houses where the abuses 
allegedly occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Department records show that, in the past 10 years, the percentage of blacks 
in fire prevention has swelled from 17% to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're respected for your knowledge," said one black fire inspector, "and 
it's a more professional environment." 
</P>

CROATIA MAY WIDEN BOSNIA WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense Minister Gojko Susak vowed Thursday that Croatia will send troops to 
seize back Serbian-occupied territory if the government calculates that the 
teetering Bihac pocket in northwest Bosnia-Herzegovina is about to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 His warning was the most ominous indication since a Serbian assault on Bihac 
intensified three weeks ago that the international community's failure to 
protect the purported U.N. "safe area" could be the catalyst for a wider Balkan 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian territory that has been under Serbian nationalist occupation for the 
last three years has been used by the rebel forces as a staging ground for 
attacks on neighboring Bihac, as well as for provocations against troops of the 
U.N. Protection Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Susak's warning of an imminent rekindling of the unfinished war with Serbian 
rebels in the Krajina region came as U.N. officials reported that heavy 
machine-gun and small-arms battles have erupted along hundreds of miles of 
long-dormant front line in Croatia. Fighting around Bihac continued to rage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bihac offensive waged by Bosnian Serbs with collaborating Krajina rebels 
has spurred fears that the nearly one-third of Croatia seized by Serbs in a 
1991 rebellion will be lost forever with the fall of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "Croatia will not wait for Bihac to fall," Susak told reporters at a news 
conference. "We are well informed about the situation there, and if Croatia 
estimates that Bihac will fall, Croatia will intervene before that." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not far from the time when Croatia not only will be able to but will 
take action," added Croatian army Chief of Staff Gen. Janko Bobetko, who noted 
that the U.N. mission has failed to provide the protection promised Bihac by a 
U.N. Security Council designation of the enclave as a safe zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian nationalists from both Bosnia and the Krajina region have continued to 
bombard Bihac with heavy artillery, and hand-to-hand combat has reached within 
half a mile of the enclave's sole hospital, U.N. spokesman Alex Ivanko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb rebels also stepped up the intensity of an apparent campaign to 
drive U.N. troops out of the region with an unprecedented cross-border 
kidnaping incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic infiltrated a 
U.N.-patrolled area of Krajina adjacent to the Bihac pocket and forced seven 
Ukrainian soldiers at gunpoint back into Serb-held Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs also fired two wire-guided missiles into the Interior Ministry building 
in Sarajevo, wounding four people, and denied passage to dozens of 
U.N.-escorted aid convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sarajevo airport remains closed to humanitarian relief flights by the 
surrounding Serbian forces, which recently positioned surface-to-air missile 
systems near the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned during a failed peace 
mission to Sarajevo on Wednesday, when Karadzic refused even to talk to him, 
that the U.N. mission might have to be withdrawn unless the fighting and 
harassment stop. 
</P>
<P>
 But Karadzic loyalists have lately shown their eagerness for a pullout of the 
U.N. forces, who were deployed to protect vulnerable civilians from the rebels' 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali attempted to pressure the Muslim-led Bosnian government to 
capitulate to the Serbian terms for peace, but Sarajevo officials have refused, 
fearing a surrender will lead to further "ethnic cleansing" and brutality at 
the hands of the emboldened Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the peacekeepers' rapidly deteriorating influence, U.N. mission 
officials refuse to call in NATO air strikes to rein in the rampaging Serbs for 
fear the heavily armed rebels will exact revenge against the nearly 500 U.N. 
hostages they are holding as human shields. Thousands of other troops of the 
24,000-strong Bosnian deployment are also within easy reach of the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community's inaction in Bosnia has heightened fears in 
Croatia that its own future is in peril if it continues to put faith in U.N. 
promises to facilitate a peaceful reintegration of the Serb-occupied region. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Anton Tus, chief military adviser to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, 
argued that the Bosnian and Croatian Serb forces are clearly working in concert 
to create a united Western Serbia from their occupied territories. Tus insisted 
the Serbs should be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot let Bihac fall. We must act before this can happen," Tus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Bihac pocket falls, it would have strategic significance for both the 
political and military options" open to Croatia for recovering the Krajina, Tus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that with Bihac's important rail, highway and river connections, the 
rebels would gain an iron grip on the land they have conquered in both 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international community, especially the United States, is wrong in its 
refusal to prevent the occupation of the Bihac area and aggression launched 
from the U.N.-protected areas," Tus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susak and other military officials have said they were prepared to send troops 
into Krajina two weeks ago when the Croatian Serb rebels were preoccupied with 
the assault on Bihac, but held back at the urging of U.S. diplomats who feared 
that would reignite the Serb-Croat war and possibly spread throughout the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another war in Croatia would have all the incivility of Bosnia but many times 
more firepower," one Western diplomat warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Tus said he believed that the Croatian leadership was "relying too much" on 
the advice to take no military action against the Krajina rebels and to put its 
faith in the U.N. peacekeeping mission that has been deployed here for 32 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 If the combined Bosnian and Croatian Serb attack force succeeds in overrunning 
the Bihac region, its 200,000 predominantly Muslim residents would likely be 
driven en masse into Croatia or central Bosnia. In either case, such a huge 
influx of refugees would provoke a humanitarian catastrophe for and political 
crises in Zagreb and Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Tus said the Zagreb leadership needs to seriously re-evaluate the advice it is 
getting from the West, especially from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The general said he opposed direct military intervention into the Krajina 
region, but supported urgent action to "tie down" the Serbian rebels so they 
cannot wreak havoc around Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Just such distractions along the 400-mile front line between Krajina Serbs and 
government forces were reported by the U.N. Protection Force on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In one five-hour period Wednesday, a U.N. observation post recorded 33 mortar 
rounds fired by Croatian troops across the U.N.-patrolled separation zone that 
runs the length of the front line, Ivanko said. Altogether, 129 "cease-fire 
violations" were reported that day in what U.N. officials characterize as the 
most serious escalation of fighting in the Krajina in months.

SENATE APPROVES SWEEPING PACT TO REVISE GLOBAL TRADE RULES; GATT: ACCORD 
DESIGNED TO OPEN MARKETS MAKES DEEP CUTS IN TARIFFS, QUOTAS. THE 76-24 
BIPARTISAN VOTE CAPS YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND POLITICAL DEBATE.

<P>
 After seven years of negotiations and a year of political debate, an agreement 
that massively reorders the rules governing world trade was approved by the 
Senate on Thursday, making deep cuts in tariffs and quotas intended to bring 
more fairness to international commerce and a burst of growth to the world 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan vote was 76 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has been a centerpiece of President Clinton's economic program. 
Administration officials said that it will open Europe, Japan and the emerging 
markets of developing nations to ever-more goods and services produced in 
American offices, factories and fields, creating new jobs in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate approval of the accord -- which was endorsed by the House on Tuesday 
and now goes to Clinton for his signature -- brought to a close the tumultuous 
103rd Congress. The President had called the lawmakers back to Washington for a 
rare post-election session to vote on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade accord will vastly expand the reach of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, created in 1947, beyond the traditional arena of 
manufacturing to cover agriculture and, to a lesser extent, financial services 
and such intellectual endeavors as the creation of pharmaceuticals and 
entertainment productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The "future prosperity of our nation" rests on the pact, said departing Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who cast his final votes in the 
Senate. "The agreement is a very good deal for America and a very great 
improvement on the current (trading) system," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, saluting the Senate in remarks at the White House Diplomatic 
Entrance, said that the vote "shows once again that our country is moving in 
the right direction, reaching out to the rest of the world and looking at the 
best interests of our own people." 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the agreement by the United States is expected to spur other 
nations to act, so that it can go into effect Jan. 1. So far, 36 of the 124 
nations considered likely to take part have given formal approval to the plan, 
among them Germany, Britain, Mexico, Chile, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. 
Japan is expected to act on the measure as early as today.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a decision that is going to have an impact around the world, a 
positive impact," said Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who is all but certain to be 
Senate majority leader when the new Congress convenes in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," Dole said. "We're going to be the big beneficiary -- the 
United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), bitter in his opposition to the 
agreement, said after the vote: "This is the gravest mistake that the U.S. has 
ever made on economic policy." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) argued that the pact would continue earlier 
trade practices and allow multinational companies to drive down U.S. wages by 
employing low-paid foreign laborers. "This is one more big drink from the same 
old bottle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As wide as the impact of the agreement is likely to be, it lit few sparks on 
the floor of the Senate. For most of the 20 hours of debate, which began 
Wednesday, there were rarely more than half a dozen senators in the chamber at 
any moment and the visitors' galleries were half empty. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord would cut tariffs by an average of 38%, eliminating them in such 
important sectors of the economy as steel, pharmaceuticals, paper and medical 
equipment. Republican and Democratic supporters alike predicted it will create 
500,000 jobs in the United States as a result of increased commerce with other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, there is general agreement that the $744 billion in tariffs that 
would be eliminated around the world, if the pact is fully implemented, will 
amount to the largest single tax cut ever enacted anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22,000 pages of the agreement spell out the minutiae of rules that make up 
the road map of international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, tariffs -- the taxes charged on imported goods -- would 
be eliminated on such diverse products as refrigerators, sewing machines, small 
motorcycles and candles, creating new competition from foreign manufacturers 
suddenly given free access to free-spending American consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there would be winners, too, in the United States as lowered tariffs 
around the world open foreign markets for U.S. companies and, the 
Administration has argued, jobs for American workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's taxes on shampoo, sunscreens and razor blades would be thrown out, for 
example. The tariff on beef would be cut from 50% to 38.5%, on oranges from 40% 
to 32%, and on whiskey there would be a whopping reduction -- from 24.5% to 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, the tax on imported beer, now 24%, would be eliminated. So, too, 
would be the 7% tariff on swine and beef livers. And makers of American potato 
chips would see the tariff on their products cut from 22% to 14.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 40% of foreign products entering the United States will be sold 
duty-free, up from 10%. For other industrial countries, that figure will 
increase to 44% from the current 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits, and some losses, will be greatest with some of the big-ticket items. 
With tariffs dropping, likely beneficiaries include makers of specialty steel 
products -- high-quality items turned out by American labor from lower-quality 
steel made overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Others expected to benefit are farmers sending their grains to Europe, where 
subsidies to farmers there would be cut, forcing them to raise prices closer to 
the U.S. level. With greater sales abroad -- an increase of $8.5 billion by 
2005, according to one study -- U.S. farmers would receive less in U.S. 
government crop subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would bring high-tech industries into the trading regime, 
affecting such products as computers, software and semiconductors, all products 
barely envisaged when developed nations fashioned the international trading 
system to impose a new economic order in the wake of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Services, which account for about 60% of the U.S. economy, will be brought 
under the rules of the international trading community and made more open, 
contributing to a likely expansion of international operations in engineering, 
advertising and health care. But in the critical area of financial services, 
covering banking and insurance, only general principles have been set forth, 
and firm commitments to lower barriers still must be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. garment industry is widely seen as likely to suffer because lowered 
tariffs and quotas will make it easier for foreign companies, some paying 
workers little more than $1 a day, to undercut the prices that U.S. clothing 
manufacturers must charge. 
</P>
<P>
 While the accord would increase copyright protections, the entertainment 
industry was disappointed that U.S. negotiators failed last year to get Europe 
to drop its barriers to foreign-made movies and television productions and thus 
will not get a boost from the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argued that in agreeing to change the rules, the United States leaves 
itself open to the demands of an international bureaucracy running the new 
World Trade Organization, which will become the new regime governing world 
commerce, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- an 
organization that, confusingly, bears the same name as the agreement itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Trade Organization, critics said, would have too much authority to 
overturn U.S. laws protecting the environment and worker safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan worked out by Dole, a panel of U.S. appellate court judges could 
be asked to determine whether the international panel was ruling arbitrarily 
against the United States. If they found that the trade body was operating 
unfairly, Congress could vote to the withdraw the United States from the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was approved by 35 Republicans and 41 Democrats, including 
California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein. Thirteen Democrats and 11 
Republicans voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 That final vote, however, was anticlimactic. The true test came earlier when 
60 votes were needed to waive the Senate's budget deficit rules. Sixty-eight 
senators voted for the waiver, while 32 were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 That earlier step was necessary because budget law requires Congress either to 
cut spending or raise taxes to match revenue that will disappear under the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the trade plan would cut tariffs in the United States by $12 billion 
over the next five years and approximately $40 billion over 10 years -- 
although the measure ultimately would produce, by the Administration's count, 
three times as much in tax income as a result of greater economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, the vote and the lobbying that preceded it created some of the 
strangest pairings in modern Washington, linking liberals and conservatives on 
both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the economic interests of individual states, rather than ideology, 
dictated votes, with corn-state senators -- Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and 
Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), for example, citing the agreement's anticipated boost for 
agriculture exports and Robert F. Bennett, a Republican from Utah, where 
computer software has become a growth industry, cheering the accord's challenge 
to the burgeoning business in pirated computer programs. Who Belongs to the

VOWING REFORM, ZEDILLO ASSUMES TOP MEXICO POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the applause of world leaders ranging from Vice President Al Gore to Cuban 
President Fidel Castro, Ernesto Zedillo assumed the green, white and red sash 
of the Mexican presidency at precisely 11 a.m. Thursday and, in his first 
presidential address, declared a crusade against the violence, poverty, 
corruption and injustice that litter Mexico's path to the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing deep political uncertainty, public insecurity and pockets of crushing 
poverty, Zedillo told Mexico's newly elected legislature in a nationally aired 
speech that he will continue the free-market reforms that opened and saved 
Mexico's economy, although they widened the gap between its rich and poor. But 
he promised an aggressive jobs-creation program, plans to help small and 
medium-size businesses "as never before," and an unprecedented effort to 
educate all Mexicans through high school. 
</P>
<P>
 There was lingering skepticism from opposition leaders and an angry protest at 
Mexico City's Monument to the Revolution. The demonstration erupted in violence 
that left at least 40 injured, five seriously, when a small group that the 
government identified as provocateurs broke from an estimated 10,000 peasants 
who were calling for civil insurrection and attacked police with stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Riot squads withstood nearly an hour of the stone-throwing before responding 
with tear gas and clubs. The protesters set fire to a truck bearing Zedillo's 
ruling party symbol in an incident the government classified as "minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Against the backdrop of that violence, Zedillo, a Mexicali shoeshine boy who 
rose to the highest post in the land, promised to reduce the power of the 
presidency and separate it for the first time from his Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico for 65 years. And he vowed to 
radically restructure a judicial system that has made corruption synonymous 
with the police and the courts in a nation he cast as being on the brink of 
historic change. 
</P>
<P>
 As he outlined Mexico's new course after taking the presidential sash from 
outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in an emotional 15-second 
handshake, Zedillo also ordered immediate acceleration of official 
investigations into two major political assassinations that altered the course 
of Mexican history this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the widespread sense of national insecurity, Zedillo said, are the 
yet-unsolved Sept. 28 killing in Mexico City of the ruling party's secretary 
general, Francisco Ruiz Massieu, and the murder in Tijuana in March of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, Zedillo's predecessor as the party's handpicked presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not rest until justice has been served," he declared, announcing that 
"at this moment" he was directing newly appointed Atty. Gen. Antonio Lozano -- 
for the first time, a Cabinet member from the opposition -- "to significantly 
intensify the investigations and inform the public of their progress until the 
investigations come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 About Chiapas, the southernmost Mexican state where an armed peasant guerrilla 
movement has threatened to rebel anew when the ruling party's elected governor 
attempts to take office next Thursday, Zedillo said only that he is "convinced 
it is possible to achieve new negotiations that will lead us to a just, 
honorable and definitive peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican army, which crushed the rebellion in January, will maintain its 
unilateral cease-fire, Zedillo said, acknowledging that "the conditions of 
extreme poverty and neglect" in the state "fueled that violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo saved his most urgent comments for the escalating street crime, 
kidnapings, robberies and general insecurity he is inheriting from Salinas -- 
whom he otherwise praised and thanked as a president "who governed with 
vision." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few years, particularly in recent months, we have lived in a 
climate of growing anxiety and insecurity," Zedillo told his audience in the 
cavernous legislative hall. "We have suffered major public crimes that have not 
been altogether clarified; we have suffered from violence on a daily basis and 
from a deficient performance by the institutions in charge of public safety and 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, more than ever, Mexico must be a country of laws. That is what 
everyone, everywhere, is calling for. . . . In order to tackle the rampant 
crime, the frequent violations of civil and human rights and the grave public 
insecurity, we will launch an in-depth and genuine reform of the institutions 
in charge of the procurement of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding that his would be a compassionate, open and progressive presidency 
"to serve all Mexicans with dedication . . . with pride . . . with an 
unbreakable spirit and nationalist conviction," Zedillo then sped away from the 
downtown Chamber of Deputies in a motorcade to Mexico City's National Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 His parade route did not pass near the downtown monument commemorating 
Mexico's bloody 1910 revolution, where the anti-government protesters shouted 
"Zedillo Out!" and praised the Zapatista National Liberation Army for its 
rebellion in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo drove directly to the palace, where he continued to follow to the 
letter Mexico's longstanding traditions of power transition. 
</P>
<P>
 In a blizzard of green, white and red confetti that filled the air with the 
colors of Mexico's flag -- which is also the tricolor of the ruling party -- 
Zedillo stepped onto the presidential balcony of the National Palace 
overlooking an expansive historic square. He led thousands of soldiers, sailors 
and police in the national anthem, for the first time as their commander in 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the palace, Zedillo spent the next hour greeting Mexico's most powerful 
and wealthy elite -- bankers, business leaders, politicians and priests -- with 
handshakes and hugs, before adjourning to a lunch at the National Anthropology 
Museum with present and former heads of state, among them former President 
George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of his speech at the national legislature, opposition leaders 
gave Zedillo mixed reviews of his earliest performance in what all acknowledged 
is one of Mexico's most trying hours. But they made it equally clear that the 
12th consecutive PRI president will enjoy a honeymoon, however brief, with a 
loyal opposition -- something accorded few of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Gonzalez Alcocer, a National Action Party deputy, expressed 
confidence in Zedillo's political will to fulfill his cornucopia of promises. 
"I think now, because of the special circumstances in Mexico and the situation 
we find ourselves in, he is obligated to keep his promises. Because if he 
doesn't, who knows what will become of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, national legislators from the populist, opposition Democratic 
Revolutionary Party were less generous. The party's parliamentary leader, 
Senator Hector Sanchez Lopez, delivered the opening speech of Thursday's 
special inaugural session, and he used it to sharply condemn Salinas' legacy 
and cast doubt on Zedillo's ability to alter it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez attacked Zedillo for appointing to his Cabinet Ignacio Pichardo, the 
ruling party chairman accused last week of obstructing justice by the chief 
investigator in the Ruiz Massieu murder.

NATO MINISTERS AGREE TO EXPAND MEMBERSHIP; MILITARY: MOVE TO ADMIT FORMER EAST 
BLOC NATIONS COULD PUT MORE PRESSURE ON ALLIANCE. RUSSIA PROTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers agreed on a plan Thursday 
to expand membership to the East, a step that drew a sharp protest from Russia 
and could produce new splits in the 45-year-old alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 With remarkably little opposition for such a potentially controversial 
measure, the NATO ministers approved a U.S. plan calling for a yearlong debate 
over conditions for membership prior to admitting the first new members, 
probably sometime in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States has a comprehensive strategy in Europe, and today we set 
about implementing that strategy," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
after the meeting of foreign ministers of the 16-nation alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint communique, NATO said it was premature to begin selecting new 
members or even to set a firm timetable for ultimate expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alliance agreed to fix the requirements for membership and to discuss 
those provisions with each of the 24 nations that are now members of the loose 
Partnership for Peace organization. The communique said a study on the issues 
will be completed by next December. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said that applicants for NATO membership must be members of the 
partnership, a year-old organization including all but two of the former 
republics of the Soviet Union plus previously neutral Sweden and Finland. The 
two former Soviet republics that have not joined are Belarus and Tajikistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington wants to make the partnership a permanent organization to provide a 
link between NATO and the Central and Eastern European nations that fail to 
qualify for full membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev immediately dashed cold water 
on the U.S. victory. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained that NATO is moving much too fast in opening membership to 
Moscow's Cold War allies. He said it is "difficult to understand" why NATO 
would establish a procedure that might produce new members by the end of next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev refused to go through with a long-planned NATO-Moscow agreement on 
future military cooperation. He said his government "needs some time to 
clarify" NATO's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and European officials said they are optimistic that the Russian foreign 
minister will sign the agreement eventually. A NATO official dismissed his 
action as "a piece of theater." And a U.S. official said it appeared to be 
aimed at "domestic politics" in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no conditions were outlined in the communique, State Department 
spokesman Mike McCurry said Washington is determined to limit membership to 
countries with democratic governments, a provision that would rule out many 
potential members, especially former Soviet republics in Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia presumably could qualify, but Moscow opposes NATO expansion out of 
hand. Russian officials say the country does not want to join and objects to 
any expansion that would isolate and encircle Russia by admitting former 
members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev complained that "the NATO communique raises more questions than it 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting for an hour with Christopher and other NATO ministers, Kozyrev 
said he had been "greatly reassured." But he still refused to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said Kozyrev's action came as a surprise, because the U.S. government 
had briefed Russia on its plan for NATO expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 A German official said Kozyrev may have been "trying to take advantage of the 
mood" of European allies already nervous about expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the communique's enthusiastic language on expansion, it is no secret 
that several European allies are worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members, such as Spain and Italy, are said to be concerned that extending 
alliance guarantees to Central and East European nations could distract NATO 
from existing commitments in the Mediterranean region. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are unsettled by the Clinton Administration's desire to move quickly on 
the expansion issue, fearing that it could alarm Russia and cause additional 
tensions within an alliance that has recently experienced severe strain over 
its inability to stop the bloody ethnic war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO Secretary General Willy Claes admitted at a news conference that the 
alliance is facing severe strains over the crisis in Bosnia. But he said the 
agreement on expansion shows that the alliance is able to make decisions on 
matters beyond the Balkan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "NATO has been through difficult times before," Claes said. "It has always 
bounced back. This is what we have done today." 
</P>
<P>
 Claes, Christopher and most of the foreign ministers repeated: "The Bosnia 
crisis is about Bosnia and not about NATO and its future." 
</P>
<P>
 Claes, a former Belgian foreign minister, said he knows of no country willing 
to commit the hundreds of thousands of troops that would be required to force 
the warring factions in Bosnia to make peace. He said NATO will continue to use 
its warplanes in the Balkans when requested to do so by the United Nations 
command, but he said the Atlantic Alliance will not expand its role or act 
without U.N. approval. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded that the U.N.-NATO relationship has been a frustrating one for the 
alliance's air arm, which, unlike the U.N. ground force, includes American 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 In his news conference, Christopher dismissed as "quite hypothetical" a 
question about whether Washington would contribute ground troops to help 
evacuate U.N. forces from Bosnia should that step be needed. The secretary of 
state said President Clinton has not yet decided on the precise American role 
in any evacuation, although he said the United States will participate in some 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, U.S. officials in Washington said the Clinton Administration had 
agreed in principle to send U.S. troops to help evacuate the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the decision on NATO expansion deflected attention from Bosnia, it 
also highlighted other splits within the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Germany, once Europe's biggest cheerleader for a rapid expansion, now 
advocates a more measured pace, in part because it fears provoking Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a confidential telegram to Bonn 10 days ago, Germany's permanent 
representative to NATO, Hermann von Richthofen, accused the United States of 
unilaterally pushing the issue of rapid expansion in a way that could cause 
even deeper rifts within the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the telegram published in Thursday's editions of the German 
newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung quoted Von Richthofen, a grandson of the World 
War I flying ace known as the Red Baron, as claiming that Washington was moving 
ahead on the expansion issue "without consulting on fundamental questions tied 
to the policy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It almost seems as if it's boiled down to a single alternative -- to present 
a new NATO to the United States or to barely be able to keep the alliance 
together," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said any NATO 
expansion should be approved by both the European Union and the organization 
that will eventually become NATO's defense arm, the West European Union.

HUBBELL TO ADMIT TO TAX EVASION, SOURCES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. Hubbell, a close friend of President 
Clinton and a former law partner of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, has 
agreed to plead guilty to two felony charges arising from the Whitewater 
investigation, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, 46, who will admit to tax evasion and mail fraud, becomes the first 
major political figure and Clinton associate to be snared by the investigation 
of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. The plea comes in response 
to evidence gathered by Starr that Hubbell had overbilled his legal clients, 
including the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he resigned last March 14, Hubbell was the nation's No. 3 law 
enforcement official and an early appointee of the President. Not since the 
aftermath of the Watergate scandal in the mid-1970s has a former top Justice 
Department official ended up on the other end of the law as a result of a 
presidential scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Hubbell nor his attorney, John W. Nields, could be reached for 
comment. Starr and his associates declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not yet known what penalty prosecutors would seek in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Hubbell's long personal relationship to Clinton, the guilty plea 
surely will be portrayed by critics as another black eye for the President. 
Hubbell was the President's frequent golfing partner and a close political ally 
during Clinton's years as Arkansas governor. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1990 gubernatorial campaign, in fact, Clinton called Hubbell "my 
best friend." And White House counselor Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty, another close 
Clinton ally from Arkansas, told a Little Rock newspaperman in a recently 
published book that Hubbell "is the person whose company the President enjoys 
most in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming to Washington with a large entourage of former Arkansas 
associates, the Clintons have watched as many of their old friends have 
encountered difficulty in high office. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Mrs. Clinton's three Rose Law Firm partners who accepted appointments in 
the Administration, none are still serving. Former White House Counsel Vincent 
W. Foster Jr. committed suicide, former White House Counsel William Kennedy has 
returned to Little Rock, and Hubbell resigned because of his legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Hubbell stem from work that the Rose Law Firm did for the 
government in resolving savings and loan failures in Arkansas. According to the 
Associated Press, documents provided to the independent counsel by the Rose 
firm show that Hubbell double-billed the government for at least $29,400 in the 
thrift cleanup work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the government was only one of several clients overbilled by 
Hubbell. His federal financial disclosure form for 1992 listed $310,000 in 
income from Rose, which he said included some deferred earnings from 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Hubbell were a byproduct of Starr's investigation into the 
Whitewater real estate investment of the Clintons and James B. McDougal, owner 
of the now-defunct Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. The central focus of the 
inquiry is whether either Clinton or his campaign were improperly enriched by 
money from Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose firm lawyers, including Mrs. Clinton, had done legal work for Madison. 
After it collapsed, Hubbell was paid by the government to settle a lawsuit 
against an accounting company accused of negligence in Madison Guaranty's 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of Hubbell's family are deeply involved in the case as well. His 
father-in-law and brother-in-law took out nearly $1.5 million in loans from 
Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hubbell resigned in March, he said he was quitting government to deal 
with private matters relating to "compensation and reimbursement" questions 
raised by his former partners at the Rose firm. His departure caused widespread 
disappointment among career employees at the Justice Department, where he was 
regarded as a good administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is also unfortunate that private issues between me and my firm have been 
cast, by some, as being part of a broad political net called Whitewater. These 
private issues have nothing to do with Whitewater, Madison Guaranty, the 
McDougals or the President and First Lady," Hubbell said in his resignation 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said at the time that Hubbell had made "the right decision" in 
resigning and referred to Hubbell as a "good personal friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulky Hubbell was an offensive lineman for the University of Arkansas 
football team in the late 1960s. He played in the Sugar Bowl, where he allowed 
an opponent to get past him and sack the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quarterbacks and running backs are remembered for their achievements," 
Hubbell once lamented. "Offensive linemen are remembered for their mistakes."

CLINTON PROPOSES $25 BILLION MORE FOR THE MILITARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, seeking to blunt a Republican attack on the politically 
explosive issue of U.S. military readiness, Thursday proposed spending $25 
billion more over the next six years to bolster military preparedness and 
modernization of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is Clinton's first major policy initiative since the GOP victory 
in the Nov. 8 elections. It would finance more training and equipment 
maintenance, grant new cost-of-living pay increases, upgrade military housing 
and expand child-care services. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also announced that he will ask Congress in January for an extra 
$2.3 billion for the current year's defense budget to help reimburse the 
military for peacekeeping and rescue operations, which it says has siphoned off 
money needed to maintain readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Administration officials insisted that the increases had been in the 
works for months, the timing of the announcement -- which Clinton made at a 
Rose Garden ceremony flanked by the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- clearly was 
intended as a preemptive strike against the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring many of the defense cuts that Clinton had made earlier was Item No. 
6 in the 10-point "Contract With America" that Republicans used to help seize 
control of the House in last month's election. The GOP had been planning a push 
for more defense spending in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks ago, the Pentagon was forced into the embarrassing admission 
that five key Army divisions already had suffered significant declines in 
readiness as a result of the cash flow problems, despite earlier assertions by 
top officials that preparedness levels were high. 
</P>
<P>
 White House and Pentagon officials declined to say how the President would 
find the money needed to pay for the increase -- by cutting domestic programs, 
proposing new tax hikes or allowing the federal budget deficit to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew F. Krepinevich, director of the Defense Budget Project, a 
nonpartisan defense-monitoring group, said that, with the overall federal 
budget now so tight, Clinton may be forced "to stand his priorities on their 
head . . . and raid his domestic programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction from Republicans was muted. Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), the expected 
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee next year, said that he was 
heartened by the announcement but that defense spending still falls short of 
what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), who is expected to head the Senate Armed 
Services panel, expressed similar sentiments. "We have a readiness problem now 
and we will have a readiness problem after the President's initiative," he 
said. He called Clinton's plan merely "a good start." 
</P>
<P>
 There was some dispute over how far the initiative would go to close the gap 
between the long-term goals of Clinton's defense program -- to enable the 
military to fight two major regional wars nearly simultaneously -- and what he 
actually has budgeted for defense. 
</P>
<P>
 John M. Deutch, deputy secretary of defense, told reporters that by delaying 
or reducing weapons programs the Administration could eliminate the gap, which 
is now officially estimated at $49 billion over the six-year period. But many 
outside analysts disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials listed four separate parts of the initiative: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some $2.7 billion over five years to boost morale and retention rates by 
improving military housing conditions, expanding child care, welfare and 
recreation programs and providing an extra pay allowance for personnel 
stationed in high-cost areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * About $12.5 billion during the period to provide maximum cost-of-living 
allowances to military personnel -- an increase that the Administration 
eliminated as a cost-cutting move in its first defense budget but was later 
forced by Congress to provide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Up to $9.8 billion in additional funds, most of it toward the end of the 
decade, for modernizing the armed forces by buying new, presumably 
high-technology weapons to replace aging aircraft, warships, tanks, missiles 
and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 * A request for an emergency appropriation in January -- probably for about 
$2.3 billion -- to reimburse the services for money spent carrying out 
peacekeeping and rescue missions. Without these funds, they would have to cut 
training and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the money earmarked for readiness would be used to restore 
regular training schedules, reduce backlogs at military depots and maintenance 
facilities and buy more special munitions. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is expected to go to train more relief crews to help alleviate strains 
on military personnel who are in units that are constantly on the go, such as 
Airborne Warning and Control Systems aircraft, Patriot air-defense missile 
battalions and Navy frigates. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to restoring operation and maintenance funds, the money is 
expected to reduce the number of major new weapons programs that the Pentagon 
is likely to have to delay or cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorandum to service chiefs last August, Deutch asked for proposals for 
cutting or postponing as many as 10 such projects, including the Air Force's 
proposed new F-22 jet fighter, to help finance the pay hike and readiness 
programs, though he gave no dollar total for the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, he said that the cutbacks probably would not exceed $10 
billion or $12 billion, a figure he described as sharply reduced from the 
undisclosed target he had anticipated before. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the White House hoopla over the $25 billion, officials disclosed that 
almost three-fourths of the money would not be disbursed until fiscal 1999, 
three years after Clinton's current term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, despite the President's new package, overall defense spending 
still is expected to decline through fiscal 1997 before finally turning up 
again. By 1999, it would rise 1 percentage point more rapidly than inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the briefing for reporters, Deutch denied suggestions that the President's 
proposal is designed to preempt the Republicans. "This program has not been 
adjusted because of elections," he said. "It is the same program that was 
provided for before." 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials conceded that Thursday's announcement was unusual. It was 
made two full months before Clinton's budget is scheduled to be unveiled, a 
marked departure from the traditional method of disclosing such decisions as 
part of the regular budget submission. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and many nonpartisan analysts described the measure as an attempt 
to provide a short-term fix.

COLUMN ONE; IN IRAN, THE REVOLUTION UNRAVELS; ECONOMICS, NOT IDEOLOGY, IS THE 
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC'S BIGGEST THREAT AS DISILLUSIONMENT SPREADS FROM THE 
DOWNTRODDEN TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. KHOMEINI BROUGHT A TASTE OF THE GOOD LIFE, BUT 
IT'S SINCE GONE SOUR.

<P>
 In 1980, a year after the overthrow of the shah, Iran's "construction jihad" 
swept through this farming hamlet deep in the foothills of the spiny Elburz 
Mountains, bringing modernity in the form of electricity, running water, a 
public bath and a nearby school. With a corps of engineers and laborers, 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolution had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a lot more than we ever got from the shah," said Mohammed Hussein 
Miveh, the 91-year-old village patriarch, as he sat cross-legged on the floor 
of his nephew's mud-brick and log-roof home. Along the wall were a stainless 
steel sink and two battered Westinghouse refrigerators, one of them pink. 
</P>
<P>
 But 14 years later, the small army of workers hasn't been back. And the wheat, 
potato and walnut farmers of Kordehnavard -- like many of the mostazafin, or 
"downtrodden," in whose name Iran's 1979 revolution was carried out -- are 
growing angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no phones, no clinic and no roads," said Reza Miveh, the patriarch's 
nephew. "And everything's so expensive. Who can afford sugar anymore or cooking 
oil? The government should be doing much more. Sometimes we wonder whether it's 
forgotten us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic Republic of Iran, a modern theocracy, has reached a crisis point. 
Many of its most ardent backers believe the revolution has left them behind. 
Some feel it has already begun to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nation is in poverty and the country is on the verge of an explosion," 
wrote a former general, Azizollah Amir Rahimi, in a letter circulated in 
Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the controversy over the religious fervor that animated Iran's Islamic 
revolution, the force that is most threatening the regime is not ideology but 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostazafin are not the only ones who have soured. Two other groups vital 
to the regime's survival -- the young and the middle class -- are increasingly 
dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 70% of Iran's population younger than 25 and roughly half younger 
than 15, the country's youth -- most of whom don't remember the monarchy as a 
basis of comparison -- will be particularly important. 
</P>
<P>
 Meheri Fathi, 23, is one of a virtual suburb of young people in south Tehran 
who aren't happy. "I want this baby so badly," she said as she rolled her hand 
over a fully swollen abdomen. "But we don't know where we're going to find the 
300,000 rials ($111) to have it or the money to raise it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should be happy, but instead I'm sad and scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Fathi and her husband, who earns $55 a month as a textile worker, live in a 
maze of crude single-room cement hovels at the foot of a power pylon -- into 
which they are illegally tapped for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 With the near-doubling of Iran's population since the revolution -- from 34 
million to 62 million -- housing has become critically short for young people. 
Increasingly they are postponing marriage because they can find nowhere to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 The shanties built during the shah's era along the desert fringe of Tehran now 
sell for up to $1,100 -- nearly two years' pay for Fathi's husband -- and the 
government recently threatened to pull down these eyesore suburbs without 
offering alternatives. A similar move last year in the holy city of Mashhad 
triggered riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment among the young, ages 15 to 24, is also at least double the 
national average. 
</P>
<P>
 The older middle class hasn't fared much better, thanks to skyrocketing 
prices. Many standard household items are beyond easy reach of the typical 
family, and cars are often out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in my life, I feel really poor," said a U.S.-educated 
political scientist who can't afford new tires for his boxy, decade-old, 
Iranian-made Paykan. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge facing Iran's Islamic revolution is ultimately the same one that 
finally forced the failure of the Soviet Union's Communist revolution. Despite 
its oil, Tehran is on a downward economic spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 "The regime is still closer to people than either the two Pahlavi kings were, 
but a lot of stomachs aren't full," said a Tehran businessman, referring to 
Iran's last dynasty. "So the grumbling is pervasive." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's no relief in sight. Indeed, because its oil industry hasn't been 
modernized, Iran faces the prospect within the next two to five years of 
declining production, according to Western diplomats and economists in Tehran. 
Income from foreign sales is further crimped by the burgeoning population's 
domestic consumption, now growing by 3% to 5% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 With a daily quota of 3.6 million barrels, Iran is now OPEC's second-largest 
producer. But if it doesn't act soon, Iran could become a net oil importer in 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it seems an unlikely scenario, it does reflect the depth of problems 
Iran now faces," a European envoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 As its foreign debt soars above $33 billion -- produced largely by a ravenous 
wave of consumer imports after the draining eight-year war with Iraq that ended 
in 1988 -- the mullahcracy is having to decide between the people who brought 
it to power and the foreign lenders who have kept it afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crunch point is coming," predicted a Western economist in Tehran. "The 
government either meets internal demand for imports or its foreign debt 
commitment. It can no longer do both. And either way, trouble lies ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, policy has flip-flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning last year, the regime restructured its foreign debt when it was 
unable to meet payment schedules. While that bought time, the debt will also 
now eat up as much as one-third of Iran's foreign exchange revenues, in turn 
limiting its ability to import. 
</P>
<P>
 Tehran also cut back on costly subsidies for basic commodities -- from meat to 
electricity, sugar to fuel -- originated years ago to aid the mostazafin. 
Subsidies now cost up to $12 billion a year, about what Iran earns in oil 
exports, which are down to barely one-third of the revenues earned in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, consumers this year faced soaring prices and scarcities, while 
industrial production also declined as imported spare parts and raw materials 
grew hard to find. Production at a major television manufacturer is down to 30% 
of capacity; dozens of businesses have closed shops and moved into private 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation reached at least 40% a year, with some items -- sugar, butter, taxis 
-- hitting 200%, local and foreign economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Fury over hardships became rampant in the media, in parliamentary debates, in 
public discussions -- even in casual conversations with total strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you think?" a telephone information operator asked a caller. "Should 
I go to Detroit? My brother's there. I've never been out of Iran, and I hear 
it's very dangerous there. But I can't afford it here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Tehran reversed course, restoring subsidies for sugar and several 
other goods and imposing price controls. And the regime, launching an 
anti-profiteering campaign, unleashed vigilantes to search for hoarders and 
special courts to try them. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran's colorful press has since been full of headlines chronicling the 
scandalous behavior of merchants such as one in Shiraz who stashed 56 sacks of 
sugar, 800 packs of tea and 224 tires -- a crime eliciting an $8,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the restored subsidies and price controls only defer the problem and 
magnify the long-term cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subsidies are incredibly costly," conceded Ali Naqi Khamooshi, president 
of Iran's Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Mines and a member of Parliament. 
"But because of fluctuating oil prices, we haven't earned what we expected, 
which hurt our ability to import. So we couldn't prevent a sharp rise in 
prices, which brought us a real social problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 40% of Iran's population, he said, is now considered low income -- below 
the poverty line or barely above it. And the latest state intervention won't 
significantly lighten the average family's burden. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no systematic way to compare conditions now with those that prevailed 
under the shah, whose regime kept no accurate economic data. But here is a 
straw in the wind: Many Iranians, even in senior positions, have resorted to 
second and third jobs to make ends meet. Several Cabinet ministers also head 
groups such as sports federations, while members of Parliament usually have 
outside jobs as teachers, in business or at mosques. Parliament this year 
banned government workers from holding second jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Islamic Republic's successes have become as much burden as benefit. 
The number of students in primary schools has almost tripled from 7 million to 
19 million since the revolution, and university students have skyrocketed from 
fewer than 100,000 to more than 1 million. "We're proud of the numbers. But it 
also means education uses more than a quarter of our national budget -- much 
more than defense," Khamooshi said. 
</P>
<P>
 With vast shortages of classrooms and teachers, many schools are on double or 
triple shifts. Since private schools are banned, the ever-ingenious Iranians 
launched alternative "nonprofit" schools in 1992. They now account for at least 
10% of primary education, and the government is encouraging their growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Social conditions are visibly deteriorating: a middle-aged violinist, his case 
open on the pavement for donations, plays elegantly in the midst of heavy 
pedestrian traffic on Tehran's tree-lined Vali Asr Avenue; an older man sleeps 
on the sidewalk across the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Underpaid police have taken to knocking on doors of wealthy north Tehran's 
villas and bungalows to ask for "tips," which residents say they're afraid not 
to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowded, noisy and horribly polluted as Tehran is, it became one of the 
world's safer cities after the revolutionary government imposed the strict 
Islamic penal code. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is now back. Even guarded diplomats are vulnerable. A Scandinavian envoy 
and his wife have been repeatedly robbed. The wife of a Hungarian diplomat was 
murdered this fall during a robbery; her husband remains in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 For all Iran's problems, vast numbers are still living better than most of 
their Third World counterparts, diplomats say. The shops and boutiques on Vali 
Asr Avenue are still filled with the fancy dresses and high heels Iranian women 
wear under their chadors. The Qodssupermarket has stocked up on large plastic 
bottles of Wesson Oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Iranians seem to recognize that the piper may soon have to be paid, 
although, at least in this farming village, the citizenry is glad to be rid of 
the shah. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing the Pahlavis gave us were our names," patriarch Mohammed 
Hussein Miveh said with a wry smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Iranians, he got his last name by royal edict as part of the 
monarchy's modernization campaign. His was selected by officials who arrived 
just as local orchards bloomed; Miveh means fruit.  
</P>
<P>
 The situation here is probably typical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are probably better off in some way," reflected a well-known 
Iranian journalist. "Very little is exclusive anymore. The mostazafin share the 
benefits of society. They have access to education. They have appliances. They 
expect to travel, if only to a religious shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic problem for this revolution, like any revolution, is that it 
created enormous expectations -- and an insatiable appetite for things it never 
could have provided. In that sense, it was always doomed to be disappointing. 
But no one thought it would get quite this bad. And I think most people realize 
it's probably going to get worse."

 Before Gov. Pete Wilson even begins his second and final term, political 
maneuvering to replace him in the governor's office in 1998 has gotten under 
way with John Garamendi becoming the first Democrat to go public with his 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, who lost in the Democratic primary this year to Kathleen Brown, 
said after a Beverly Hills fund-raising dinner Tuesday that 1994 "was not my 
time to be governor" but made his interest in another try clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will that occur in the future? I would hope so," said Garamendi, 49, who 
leaves office as state insurance commissioner in January and expects an 
appointment in the Clinton Administration, possibly in the Agriculture, 
Treasury or Interior departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garamendi became the first to publicly show his cards, other 
Republicans and Democrats have begun preparing the political ground for 1998 
campaigns, according to campaign consultants and party insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Posturing for a run at California's top office has started earlier than 
anytime in the memory of political veterans for several reasons. Wilson is the 
first governor who becomes an automatic lame duck the minute he takes the oath 
of office -- the first to be barred from running again under the term limits 
initiative passed by voters, and backed by Wilson, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California chief executives have rarely sought third terms, they 
often have postponed a public announcement of their political plans as long as 
possible to avoid the lame-duck status that could undermine their clout with 
the Legislature. With term limits, Wilson must leave office at the end of his 
second four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in the early positioning is the possibility that Wilson might 
get elected to national office in 1996, leaving the governorship in the hands 
of a Democrat, Lt. Gov.-elect Gray Davis, now the state controller. That would 
instantly scramble the 1998 electoral picture in California. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the pressure on candidates to begin raising money early to fend 
off a wealthy wild-card newcomer -- Republican Mike Huffington was this year's 
example -- willing to spend millions to win public office. Huffington, a 
virtual political neophyte, spent more than $28 million of his own fortune and 
nearly upset Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's bid for election to a first 
full term. 
</P>
<P>
 More important for Garamendi, his campaign manager Darry Sragow said, is the 
fact that Democrats are expected to undergo a massive reassessment of their 
party's credo after the 1994 election debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are John Garamendi, you are in a unique position because you tried to 
do what it turns out would have been the right thing," Sragow said. "The 
Garamendi message in the 1994 primary clearly would stand the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are the author of that message earlier this year, it makes a lot of 
sense to pick up that message now that Democrats are looking for a message," 
Sragow added. 
</P>
<P>
 That message, Garamendi emphasized in his speech to about 150 supporters at 
the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Tuesday night, is that the Democratic Party needs 
to stand for "the working men and women of America. . . . We are going to have 
to keep that in mind as we develop our programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said he failed to implant the theme in the consciousness of enough 
Democratic voters because of the lack of funds needed to reach people via 
television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said this week's fund-raiser, the first major political event since 
the Nov. 8 election, was held to retire some of his 1994 campaign debt. He said 
the dinner, and a second one in San Francisco last night, are expected to gross 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garamendi said he will pursue a public career in Washington in the 
near term, "my work in California is not done. I will return." 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure celebrating Garamendi's 20 years in elective office, beginning with 
the state Assembly in 1974, declared that his campaign for governor in 1994 
"took the first steps to restore a bridge that has long since deteriorated in 
California" between people and their government. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this is a task that must be completed if our state is to ever regain its 
great stature," the booklet says. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren already are pinning down 
supporters for 1998 gubernatorial races, political insiders said. Another 
potential Democratic candidate is state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, who lost to 
Wilson by a wide margin in the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lungren associate said the attorney general, long considered the Republican 
odds-on favorite to succeed Wilson, has other opportunities, such as seeking 
the Senate seat of Democrat Barbara Boxer, also up in 1998, or to serve in the 
Cabinet of a Republican President should the GOP drive President Clinton from 
office in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lungren has "a strong interest in the governor's office. You will see Dan 
and his campaign aggressively reaching out starting in January to, I think, 
expand the groundwork that has been laid," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Democrats, Davis emerges from the 1994 election as the undisputed leader 
among statewide elected officials -- a "father figure" of the state Democratic 
Party, said Gary South, who managed Davis' campaign for lieutenant governor and 
who will serve as Davis' chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect he will play a very major role in what happens to the Democratic 
Party in California from this point forward," South said. "Anything beyond that 
is pure speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's position in Democratic politics is more open to speculation. After 
leading Wilson by as much as 20 points in opinion polls a year ago, she lost 
the governorship by about 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders said a campaign appears to be under way by Brown loyalists to blame 
the loss on the strategies of her consultant, Clint Reilly, who was hired in 
spring after Brown dumped the campaign management team that had served her for 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also was criticism throughout the past year that Brown, in spite of 
her prodigious fund raising and her star media attention, failed to establish a 
clear political identity of her own in contrast to her father and brother, who 
were governors of California. Critics also said that she suffered from a 
fatally flawed campaign strategy by challenging Wilson on the crime issue 
throughout last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going on vacation in Europe, Brown indicated that she planned to be 
active politically after leaving office as state treasurer, but she did not 
indicate in what fashion she would do that. Brown did not rule out another run 
for the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said a lot of Democrats still are fond of Brown, but "it has to be 
noted, she got drubbed."

12 ARRESTED IN VENTURA COUNTY RAIDS AT 26 SITES; CRIME: CRACKDOWN FOLLOWS 
YEARLONG STING DIRECTED AT CHIROPRACTORS AND LAWYERS WHO ALLEGEDLY 'BUY' 
PATIENTS AND BILK INSURERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Targeting lawyers and chiropractors who allegedly "buy" patients and bilk the 
insurance industry, 150 law officers swarmed across Ventura County in 26 
simultaneous raids Thursday morning to end a yearlong insurance fraud sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Just minutes after 9 a.m., officers flashed badges and search warrants at 
suspects' homes and offices from Ojai to Agoura Hills and began seizing 
hundreds of pages of allegedly bogus workers' compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon they had arrested 12 people, including one Oxnard Police 
Department reserve officer who also worked as a chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids capped a yearlong undercover inquiry by Ventura County investigators 
and state and national insurance officials that was dubbed "Operation What's Up 
Doc" by Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Two investigators ensconced themselves in a Thousand Oaks office for most of a 
year, posing as Oak Tree Medical Marketing -- a referral service that offered 
to steer workers' compensation claimants to doctors and lawyers for a fee, 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Tree mailed out flyers offering a "resource capable of generating a new 
patient or client base" to doctors and lawyers. Many met with investigators, 
but once they learned that the service would "sell" clients, they refused to 
take the bait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of them said, 'Oh, yes, but you know that what you're doing is 
against the law,' " Bradbury said. However, others took the offer and counseled 
the investigators on how to cover their tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them the opportunity without crossing any entrapment lines," Bradbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chiropractors and physicians offered money and were prepared to pay money 
for patients," said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. John Geb, who runs his office's 
fraud unit. "That's called capping, and it's against the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Some suspects paid fees of $300 per patient, while others agreed to kick back 
30% of the insurance payments to Oak Tree in exchange for patients, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover detectives and investigators posing as patients then showed up at 
chiropractors' offices and received treatment that was double- and 
triple-billed to insurance companies, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have developed a significant number of leads regarding other 
professionals" involved in capping and fake billing, Bradbury said. He offered 
them amnesty from prosecution if they step forward in the next 30 days and 
agree to testify about the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping and workers' compensation fraud cost the insurance industry millions 
every year. Some of the offices raided Thursday were billing hundreds of 
thousands of dollars annually in fake workers' compensation claims, said 
Michael L. Powell of the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit 
investigative group funded by the insurance and rental car industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and attorneys involved in it "are prostituting their professions," 
said Jerry Treadway of the California Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 people arrested will be charged with fraud and capping under the 
insurance and business and professions codes, and more charges may follow, 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office identified those arrested as Martin Harary, 50, 
an Oxnard attorney; David Clemens, 48, an Oxnard chiropractor, and Dr. Gary 
Rick, 49, a Ventura psychologist. The three are accused of paying for patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they plan to charge Tom Fontenot, 43, an Oxnard police 
reserve officer who worked as a chiropractor in Camarillo and who allegedly 
billed insurers for services he did not render; chiropractor Steven Spunt, 34, 
Fontenot's office partner, who allegedly agreed to pay for patient referrals; 
Simi Valley chiropractor John Clark, 47, who allegedly discussed ways of 
defrauding an insurer with an undercover investigator, and Debra Martyn, 30, 
Clark's office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they also expect to charge Moorpark chiropractor Michael 
Hemphill, 47, and his wife, Julie Hemphill, 45, for allegedly agreeing to pay 
for patient referrals; Westlake Village law partners Steven Gross, 50, and Rand 
E. Pinsky, 45, for allegedly agreeing to pay for client referrals, and Agoura 
Hills attorney Donald Wylie, 46, for allegedly filing false claims with the 
Workers' Compensation Appeals Board.

SALVADORAN ASYLUM PROGRAM MAY END; IMMIGRATION: CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS 
EXPECTED TO REMOVE SPECIAL REFUGEE STATUS. BUT BACKLOG MAKES IT UNLIKELY THAT 
ANY WILL BE DEPORTED FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration is expected to announce today that it will end a 
special refugee program for Salvadoran immigrants, but will use procedures that 
make it unlikely any would be deported for at least two years -- and perhaps 
far longer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting aside the protests of Salvadoran officials and some members of 
Congress, the Administration will formally end the program that shielded 
187,000 Salvadorans from deportation because of the long civil war in the 
Central American nation, a war that has now ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect on Salvadorans covered by the temporary program, however, is likely 
to be gradual, according to an Administration official. The refugees will have 
nine months from Dec. 31 to apply for formal political asylum permitting them 
to stay in this country permanently. Within that period they will have the 
right to continue working. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an overwhelming backlog of earlier asylum applications from many 
countries, the Salvadoran cases are unlikely to be reviewed for at least two 
years, according to officials. "With our still focusing on current 
(applications), it will take years to get through that number," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exceptions are a small number of Salvadorans who have been convicted 
of aggravated felonies and are not eligible for asylum under any circumstances, 
according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 1 million Salvadoran immigrants live in the United States, about 
half of whom are legal immigrants. The largest concentration, about 500,000, is 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's defenders have argued that money sent home by the Salvadorans -- 
estimated to amount to more than $1 billion annually -- is essential to 
maintain the country's economic stability and support its fledgling democratic 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting Thursday with Vice President Al Gore, Salvadoran President 
Armando Calderon Sol made a last-ditch plea for the program to be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will defend the interests of our compatriots and will ask for an 
extension," Calderon Sol said as he left San Salvador for Mexico on Wednesday. 
"What is being sought is a humanitarian solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol remained hopeful before the meeting with Gore in Mexico City, 
where the two leaders were attending the inauguration of Mexican President 
Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, in a letter urging President Clinton to make a third extension 
of the program, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus argued that its end "will 
potentially mean an influx of 187,000 Salvadorans into El Salvador," creating 
pressures that could be "catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
 But the State Department says that the improvement of conditions no longer 
justifies special protections for the Salvadorans. And U.S. officials have 
argued that it is necessary to ultimately end such temporary asylum programs to 
assure that there is political support for other special deals when when 
foreign crises set off other waves of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Salvadoran program was created in 1990, opponents argued that such 
programs are never actually temporary, but more often lead to permanent 
citizenship for the covered populations. That was the case with such a program 
offered to Polish refugees in the 1970s during the Solidarity movement; those 
immigrants were offered citizenship in a bill sponsored by Sen. Barbara A. 
Mikulski (D-Md.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvadoran refugees also were protected under settlement of a 1987 court 
case alleging that the Immigration and Naturalization Service was unfairly 
turning down Salvadorans' asylum applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government disputed that charge, it agreed in settling that case 
that Salvadoran asylum-seekers could remain in the United States during the 
review of their cases. And it agreed to have the cases reviewed by a new corps 
of immigration officials specially trained to be sensitive to the Salvadorans' 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Day, an immigration specialist with a Senate judiciary subcommittee on 
refugees, speculated that many Salvadorans would remain in the United States 
illegally rather than return to their impoverished land, even if they had not 
been offered the asylum. "I just don't think many will go back -- they've 
tasted America," he said.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER: THIS 'VICTORY' CELEBRATION TOOK 
CHUTZPAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Susan Brooks told them the bad news before she hopped the flight to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich's office had called after Election Day 
inviting her to the Capitol to revel in the Republican rout with seven other 
new members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 They were to be showcased as newly commissioned lieutenants in the battle to 
install Newt's new American order, bright and shining symbols of imminent sea 
changes in the way Congress does business. 
</P>
<P>
 (In the post-election lexicon, all changes are sea changes , please.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very exhilarating experience," recalled Brooks, somewhat wistfully, 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem was that in the weeklong interim between phone call and 
boarding pass, the Rancho Palos Verdes councilwoman's skinny 93-vote lead over 
Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) had slipped to a 260-vote deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right before Thanksgiving, Harman finally declared victory when her advantage 
climbed to nearly 800 votes, apparently recapturing the South Bay 36th District 
she had won two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The official count is now an 812-vote bulge, and Brooks' forces are poring 
over the ballots for possible irregularities. She still hasn't conceded defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt strange about it from the beginning," said Brooks, "but they said they 
wanted me to come out anyway. Newt -- he campaigned for me, you know -- told me 
he wanted me to just talk about the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said that the untoward development in the vote tally made her "a little 
hesitant to speak out." But no one observing her in Washington could have 
guessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, she came on with the kind of chutzpah that seems to push politicians 
to take their pratfalls in public -- like flying across the country (out of her 
own pocket, she says) to perform in a highly visible celebration of a victory 
that was not yet hers. 
</P>
<P>
 There she was on CNN, talking the talk, likening Washington to the planet 
Saturn: "And we (in California) like to think that the ring around it is the 
Beltway. The Beltway is the ring around Saturn. So, it really helps to bring 
the real world to Washington and that's what we want to be able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The appreciative Capitol Hill TV reporter threw it back to the studio " . . . 
showing once and for all that these new members already have a way with the 
sound bite." 
</P>
<P>
 No higher praise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There she was on the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour -- introduced as a "newly 
elected Republican" -- taking the federal government to task for botched 
immigration policies. (Consistent with the show's serious mien, it subsequently 
ran a correction about that representative-elect reference.) 
</P>
<P>
 There she was at the top of an article in the insider-ish Capitol Hill 
newspaper Roll Call, jockeying for position as freshman class president no 
less. A Brooks aide was quoted as "stressing her career of local and 
grass-roots activism and her ability to overcome the odds in the bid (for the 
leadership post)." 
</P>
<P>
 If this were hesitancy, what might Brooks have done with a sure victory in her 
pocket? 
</P>
<P>
 But as her three days of ersatz Washington hoopla recede toward the political 
horizon, that boiling Brooks personality has cooled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really honored to be chosen as a potential congressman," she recalled. 
"But I was very careful to avoid representative-elect . Maybe it's the Italian 
in me -- superstition, cautiousness, not wanting to jump the gun. Expect the 
worst and hope for good luck. It would have been much easier to walk away from 
this if it had been a landside (loss). Do you know what this is like? It's like 
three weeks of labor. Well, I guess you couldn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted GOP House leaders invited her to come back for freshman orientation, 
but Brooks demurred, citing a need to pursue her civic duties in Rancho Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 She promises to run again in '96 and plans to keep in touch with those 
ebullient GOP strategists who issued the original invitation to Washington, 
sensing in Brooks a comer who nearly knocked off a far-better-financed woman 
Democratic incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to maintain my ties and continue to participate in implementing the 
'Contract With America' as a citizen and a member of my congressional 
district," Brooks said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her attention is focused on the ongoing search for possibly suspect 
ballots. Brooks contends there's evidence that some ballots seem to be linked 
to abandoned homes, businesses or vacant buildings. But she cautions that she's 
making no accusations of vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like a candidate who took a Washington victory lap with an asterisk 
behind her name.

POLITICIAN FROM QUEBEC HAS LEG AMPUTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lucien Bouchard, a charismatic Quebec separatist hoping to help lead the 
mainly French-speaking province to independence as soon as next year, had his 
left leg amputated Thursday after he developed an infection, possibly from the 
so-called flesh-eating bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard, 55, was reported in serious but stable condition in intensive care 
at Saint Luc Hospital in Montreal.He entered the hospital Tuesday for treatment 
of phlebitis. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital statement said an infection developed that forced the amputation. 
Two television stations reported that Bouchard was afflicted with necrotizing 
fasciitis, which rapidly destroys skin and tissue. There was no immediate 
confirmation from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard's wife, Audrey Best Bouchard, an American who grew up in Orange 
County, was at the hospital. The couple, who married in 1989, have two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard is extremely popular in Quebec but widely despised in the rest of 
Canada as the man who wants to break up the country. His Bloc Quebecois won 54 
seats in Parliament in last year's election, making it the second-largest party 
after the ruling Liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard shares stewardship of the separatist movement with Jacques Parizeau, 
Quebec's premier, and has been tapped for a starring role in the province-wide 
campaign expected next year in anticipation of a referendum on independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The separatists believe voter endorsement of Quebec independence will pave the 
way for separation. 
</P>
<P>
 A visibly shaken Parizeau appeared on television and directed his comments to 
Bouchard. "Old friend, hold on and show the same courage you have shown so 
often in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard's leading opponent, Prime Minister Jean Chretien, issued a statement 
from Paris, where he was attending a conference on AIDS. "At moments like this, 
we put political differences aside to express our personal solidarity with the 
suffering of a fellow human being," he said.

MOSCOW BACKS OFF THREAT TO CHECHNYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moscow backed off from a threat to send troops Thursday into the break-away 
republic of Chechnya, where leaders defied the Kremlin's ultimatum and called 
on armed volunteers to defend their capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Air attacks continued on the outskirts of Grozny, claiming at least four 
lives, hospital officials said. A Russian delegation arrived from Moscow and 
began talks with Chechen officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital, which is in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia, became a 
war zone between forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, who 
declared independence from Moscow in 1991, and Chechen rebels trying to topple 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides ignored Moscow's threat to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya 
if they did not stop fighting by Thursday morning.

N. KOREA TO GET $2 BILLION IN AID BEFORE NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS, U.S. REVEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The Clinton Administration revealed Thursday that, under the agreement it 
recently signed with North Korea, the Pyongyang regime will get nearly $2 
billion in benefits before it has to submit to special international 
inspections of its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea will contribute most of the money by supplying the equipment for 
new nuclear reactors that will make it much harder for North Korea to make 
weapons-grade fuel. However, Special Ambassador Robert L. Gallucci, the 
Administration's top negotiator, also estimated that the costs to the United 
States will be "tens of millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures came at the first congressional hearing on the nuclear 
agreement. During the session of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on 
Asia, Republicans voiced considerable unhappiness about the deal the 
Administration signed in Geneva in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be giving up, virtually, on every front," complained Sen. Frank H. 
Murkowski (R-Alaska). He argued that the financial benefits North Korea is to 
receive will serve to "prop up" the impoverished Pyongyang regime, making it 
less susceptible to the threat of international economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration began negotiating with North Korea last year, after it 
refused to submit to the International Atomic Energy Agency's demand to carry 
out special inspections of two nuclear waste sites. Those inspections could 
show how much weapons-grade fuel North Korea has produced.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, North Korea does not have to submit to the special inspections 
for about five years -- until after "a significant portion" of the work is 
finished on the new nuclear reactors. Gallucci said that the work will be worth 
nearly $2 billion. North Korea will not get any of the key components for the 
reactors, however, until the special inspections are carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci argued repeatedly that the deal and the economic benefits to North 
Korea are worth the money because they stop North Korea's fast-developing 
nuclear program. It is more important to prevent Pyongyang from amassing large 
amounts of plutonium in the future than to find out immediately what relatively 
small amounts were made in the past, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Thursday whether opposition is strong enough for Congress to 
vote to reject or modify the agreement. Some Republicans are talking about 
trying to pass legislation that would effectively limit the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hearing is just the opening shot," one senior Administration official 
observed. The new Congress, led by Republicans, is going to want to conduct its 
own hearings, the official said. "It takes some doing to explain the agreement. 
This is one of those situations where hearings do help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear program now and to 
dismantle the program over the next decade as it receives a series of benefits 
from the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Those benefits include steps toward diplomatic relations with the United 
States, immediate supplies of fuel oil and the construction of two light-water 
nuclear reactors to replace North Korea's current, gas-graphite nuclear 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said the two light-water reactors that North Korea 
will receive, valued at $4 billion, will produce plutonium in a form that makes 
it more difficult to make nuclear bombs. However, one nuclear specialist, Gary 
Milhollan of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, testified at 
Thursday's hearing that the light-water reactors being supplied to North Korea 
are not risk-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although light-water reactors are less efficient at producing bomb fuel, 
these two giant reactors could turn out at least 70 bombs' worth of 
weapons-grade plutonium per year," he said. But he also said that "under the 
agreement, plutonium from the light-water reactors will not be available for at 
least a decade, whereas more plutonium from (North Korea's) smallest graphite 
reactor could be available as early as next year."

CENTRAL AMERICA; RISE OF HELMS WORRIES NICARAGUA; WITH GOP IN CONTROL OF 
CONGRESS, MANAGUA FEARS THE FAR-RIGHT SENATOR WILL REVIVE U.S. ATTEMPTS TO 
MEDDLE IN THE NATION'S POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For more than a century, politics here has been intertwined with events in 
Washington. Fortunes in Managua often depended on who was up and who was down 
in American government. And Nicaraguans routinely turned to their U.S. allies 
to resolve domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So last month's GOP sweep of Congress sent heads here spinning, and the likely 
return of far-right Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to a powerful position in foreign 
policy has become a matter of intense debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the Clinton Administration was convincing Nicaraguans that it had 
really adopted a "hands-off" policy in Central America, Helms' ascension to the 
chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to revive 
attempts at direct influence -- or interference, depending on one's 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that Jesse Helms will introduce a greater degree of 
polarization in Nicaragua (by) backing positions of the extreme right here," 
said Sandinista official Victor Hugo Tinoco. "He could find a way to go around 
(President Clinton) to make his own policy in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
 A die-hard enemy of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, which ruled 
Nicaragua throughout the 1980s and fought a civil war with U.S.-backed Contra 
rebels, Helms has often blasted the democratically elected, conservative 
government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro for being too soft on the 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms, a longtime member of the Foreign Relations Committee, was instrumental 
in blocking millions of dollars in U.S. aid to Nicaragua, money that finally 
began to flow last year. Nicaraguan officials are afraid that U.S. aid is in 
danger again. 
</P>
<P>
 The most explosive issue that Helms has championed -- and will renew -- is the 
return to U.S. citizens of property confiscated by the Sandinista regime. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. Embassy, there are 1,546 property claims pending from 
U.S. citizens. The Nicaraguan government has settled 220 claims in the past 
year, but the process is slow. Many of the compensated property owners are not 
satisfied with the bonds that the government is offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The properties, ranging from homes and farms to businesses and gold mines, are 
in the hands of former Sandinista officials, the Cuban Embassy, and, in a few 
cases, the Chamorro government. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the matter is the fact that the number of claims grows as 
Nicaraguans who become U.S. citizens add themselves to the list. But the 
confiscados , as they call themselves, are well-organized and are confident 
Helms will renew pressure on Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
 Enlisting Washington's help is a time-honored Nicaraguan tradition. Long 
before elements of the right joined with the CIA to form the Contras, a faction 
of Nicaraguans a century ago invited U.S. adventurer William Walker to take 
over the country. He was later defeated and executed. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, however, U.S. officials had taken pains not to show favoritism 
and to work with all sides, even the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Republican victories Nov. 8, some Nicaraguans are already 
planning to call on Helms. Adolfo Calero, for years a senior leader of the 
Contras, said he will use Helms' help in his upcoming presidential campaign. 
"He (Helms) has the same demands as the Nicaraguan people," Calero said. "The 
only difference is he has the power to get what he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Nicaraguans are glum at the prospect. With aid in jeopardy, Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Leal warned of an increase in "internal tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vice President Sergio Ramirez, head of a moderate Sandinista faction, 
added: "Jesse Helms will demand something even higher than an A-plus -- a grade 
that doesn't exist. He will totally shut us out."

ASIA; HONG KONG'S NEW AIRPORT FINALLY GETS OFF GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAGGIE FARLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who has flown into the airport here knows the gut-wrenching dogleg turn 
before landing, the plane skimming so close to crowded apartment blocks that 
passengers can almost see what the families inside are eating for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one plane has overshot the single runway and gone skidding into Hong 
Kong's not-so-fragrant harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like landing on an aircraft carrier," says former astronaut James Van 
Hoften. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hoften, now a vice president of San Francisco-based Bechtel Corp., is 
helping change all that. 
</P>
<P>
 He is supervising the construction of Hong Kong's $20-billion airport, which 
will replace the overburdened Kai Tak, the world's third-busiest airport, and 
some say its scariest. 
</P>
<P>
 The new airport, Chek Lap Kok, lands a different set of superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the world's largest civil engineering project -- with six times the cost 
of the giant new airport in Denver and built on a man-made island four miles 
square. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the Great Wall, but you can see it from space," says Van Hoften, 
pointing out the site on satellite photos with the practiced eye of the first 
civil engineer to ride in a rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 In the time it has taken the Denver International Airport to sort out its 
baggage-handling system, contractors in Hong Kong have quietly flattened a 
small mountain, created an island the size of Beverly Hills and started a 
suspension bridge longer than the Golden Gate to reach it. 
</P>
<P>
 And engineers promise that, even with projections of 87 million passengers 
coming and going, it will not sink, as has happened to the new airport in 
Osaka, Japan, which was built on reclaimed land. 
</P>
<P>
 The target date for completion is June 30, 1997 -- the final day of Britain's 
sovereignty here. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's last colonial governor, Chris Patten, could potentially pass the 
city's keys to his Beijing-named successor in Chek Lap Kok's VIP lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than representing cooperation between Hong Kong's past and future 
rulers, the airport has instead become a symbol of Sino-British confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain decided to build Chek Lap Kok in the wake of the 1989 massacre at Tian 
An Men Square in Beijing as a morale booster for Hong Kong, a concrete show of 
Britain's optimism that the onetime colony would remain international and 
autonomous. 
</P>
<P>
 To China, though, the implication that anyone lacked confidence in their rule 
was seditious. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport, Beijing claimed, was an extravagance designed to drain Hong 
Kong's coffers before the territory reverts to China's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 China withheld approval of the financing agreements, which straddled 1997, and 
during almost four years of talks, it looked as if the airport project would 
not fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it is really about is power and fear," says a source close to the talks. 
"Sabotaging the project to punish Britain was a true case of cutting off one's 
nose to spite the face." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, after a four-year impasse, Beijing gave Hong Kong's new airport 
the all-clear. While the politicians were haggling, workers from Poland to the 
Philippines quietly forged ahead with construction funded from Hong Kong's 
reserves, building an airport on faith and sand from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hoften tries to ignore the politics -- he has enough international 
relations to worry about on the job. On one tunneling project, for example, the 
contractor was Dutch, the site observers were British and Polish workers 
started tunneling on one side to meet Thais digging in from the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've combined 10 projects under one team," says Van Hoften. "It's my job to 
make sure they all play together."

42 NATIONS SIGN SYMBOLIC AIDS PACT; HEALTH: DELEGATES VOW PARIS DECLARATION 
WILL LAUNCH SOLID, INTERNATIONAL ACTION AGAINST DISEASE. ACTIVISTS EXPRESS 
SKEPTICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the Eiffel Tower wearing a ribbon of bright red lights, political leaders 
from 42 countries signed a global declaration here Thursday, promising to 
protect the rights of people with AIDS and to work more closely with 
organizations representing them. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration, like the ribbon on the Eiffel Tower, was largely symbolic. 
But delegates vowed that it will launch a solid, international political effort 
to drum up more money for research, improve the safety of the blood supply and 
bring the world's largest nations together in the battle against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to face the painful truth that this is only the beginning," said 
Donna Shalala, U.S. secretary of health and human services, in an address to 
the opening session of the Paris AIDS Summit. "Any breakdown in human 
solidarity is a victory for the virus." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of AIDS support groups cautiously welcomed the Paris Declaration, 
saying they were pleased that the issue was being discussed on a world stage by 
powerful political leaders, but they were also worried that most countries will 
not take the document seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Many agreed with the AIDS activists who marked World AIDS Day on Thursday with 
a protest on the Champs Elysee, laying prone beneath the Arc de Triomphe on the 
famed avenue and chanting: "Not words but action!" 
</P>
<P>
 "This declaration doesn't do much for the needs of people with the disease," 
said Arnaud Lavauzelle, president of AIDES Federation, the main association 
representing AIDS sufferers in France. "It's a compromise, a political decision 
that doesn't really help in our fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Martina Clark, an American delegate for World GNP+, the Global Network of 
People Living with HIV/AIDS, said the declaration "is just a photo opportunity 
yet again." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing from this summit that will insist on changes in, for 
example, the U.S. immigration laws," said Clark, from San Francisco. "There are 
still ways to skirt around the issue, and that is not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. immigration policy, which requires special visas for people who are 
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, came under sharp criticism from 
delegates attending the conference. Russia and Japan, whose delegates signed 
the declaration, also place restrictions on foreigners with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome who want to enter those countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Christophe Martet, a member of the French branch of ACT UP who is 
HIV-positive, said he did not believe that the Paris Declaration will make AIDS 
sufferers any more welcome in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time I go to the States, I will still have to cross my fingers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration specifically binds the countries to, as a matter of national 
policy, "ensure equal protection under the law for persons living with 
HIV/AIDS" in access to health care, employment, education, travel, housing and 
social welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the declaration seems to contradict current U.S. policy, Shalala, 
President Clinton's representative at the summit, said no international 
declaration could override American laws set by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can change a policy sitting here in Paris," she said in an interview. 
"But it means we'll keep our focus on the issue. This is really about 
solidarity in the fight against AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who complain that the declaration does not go far enough "are right," 
Shalala added. "As far as I'm concerned, until we rid the world of this 
disease, we won't have gone far enough. But this is a strong step, a building 
block." 
</P>
<P>
 Yann le Cam, vice president of a French AIDS support group, agreed that the 
summit, and the high-level government delegates who are attending, had opened a 
door that had previously been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegates to the conference, which ends Saturday, represented countries 
from five continents and included 13 prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they hoped that the declaration and the Paris AIDS Summit 
will persuade other developed countries to spend more on AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government now provides about 40% of the world's spending on AIDS 
research. And 92% of world funds to fight AIDS benefit only the developing 
world, where 8% of AIDS patients live. 
</P>
<P>
 International AIDS activists said, though, that American policy was 
paradoxical on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand, they give money, and at the same time they maintain 
irrational restrictions on foreigners with AIDS who want to travel to the 
United States," said Lavauzelle, of the French AIDS group, who was refused 
entry into the United States two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The World Health Organization says that 17 million people worldwide have been 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, and that figure will rise to 
between 30 million and 40 million within six years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional address to the summit, Yolanda Simon, a member of GNP+ from 
the Caribbean who is HIV-positive, challenged the delegates to follow through 
on their promises, especially the declaration's vow to "fully involve" 
organizations of people with AIDS in public policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your policies for the last 10 years have driven most people living with HIV 
and AIDS underground," she said. "Many of them are dying in isolation. We are 
tired of the lip service that you have been paying to us. Now what are you 
going to do when the ink on your signatures has dried?" 
</P>

AIDS IS NO. 1 KILLER OF YOUNG AMERICANS; EPIDEMIC: CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL 
DIRECTOR WARNS RATE OF INFECTION IS GROWING IN HETEROSEXUAL COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring AIDS to be the leading cause of death among Americans between the 
ages of 25 and 44, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said Thursday that the disease has moved dramatically into the 
heterosexual community and that the transmission rate there is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the history of epidemics, AIDS is among the worst in the world," CDC 
Director David Satcher told a gathering of Atlanta business and labor leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 He said knowledge of the extent of HIV infection is "imperfect and 
incomplete," but he added that "every day we're learning something new about 
the virus and moving closer to a cure." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, 400,000 people have contracted AIDS since 1981, and 
250,000 people have died from it. Increasingly the victims are intravenous drug 
users and their sexual partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "In December, 1984, three-fourths of AIDS cases were men who have sex with 
men," Satcher said. "This year, this group makes up only a little more than 
half of all cases, so you see the epidemic is changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is the leading cause of death among men in 
the 25-44 age group and the fourth leading cause in women in that same group -- 
behind cancer, accidental injuries and heart disease, according to preliminary 
1993 data compiled by the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
 Among young African American women, who make up 82% of American women with 
AIDS, it is the leading cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1985 to 1993, the proportion of people with the AIDS virus acquired 
through heterosexual transmission increased from 2% to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Satcher was one of the speakers Thursday at the World AIDS Day conference in 
Atlanta held to promote adoption of AIDS awareness and education programs in 
the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC has helped companies establish education programs and AIDS policies 
for the last two years -- making the case, as one speaker said Thursday, that 
for most employers the cost of implementing a comprehensive education program 
would be less than the medical cost of treating a single person infected with 
HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Baumhauer, chairman and chief executive of DAKA International, a 
food service management company that also owns the Fuddruckers hamburger chain, 
gave several examples to illustrate why such programs are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a college where the firm operated a food service operation insisted 
that DAKA fire or remove from campus a gay general manager suspected of having 
AIDS. The next year, employees at one restaurant refused to work with a 
co-worker married to an HIV-infected man. 
</P>
<P>
 And three years ago, a college student who believed that DAKA was hiring 
people with AIDS because she had read the firm had implemented an AIDS 
education program expressed fear that she'd contracted the disease after eating 
a salad that had blood on it. Baumhauer said the red substance was beet juice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since no vaccine is available, education remains one of our few tools to 
fight this epidemic," Baumhauer said.  
</P>
<P>
 One participant in the conference was Jerald A. Breitman, the director of 
professional relations at the pharmaceutical firm Burroughs Wellcome Co. who is 
infected with HIV.  
</P>
<P>
 He stressed the importance of companies developing a policy for educating 
employees and for handling workers who have contracted HIV, because the fear of 
unemployment along with rejection from family and friends prevents many people 
from acknowledging their illness and seeking treatment.

CLINTON OBSERVES WORLD AIDS DAY WITH LOW-KEY PRIVATE MEETING; POLITICS: IN 
CONTRAST WITH MAJOR ADDRESS LAST YEAR, PRESIDENT TALKS WITH YOUTHS WHO HAVE 
DISEASE. ADVOCATES FEAR HIS SUPPORT WILL WANE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no mistaking the symbolism of President Clinton's day Thursday -- a 
low-key, virtually secret meeting with six young people living with AIDS to 
mark World AIDS Day, and a full-dress Rose Garden ceremony with the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff to announce plans to spend an additional $25 billion on the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 The military spending announcement was the first major White House policy 
initiative since the Nov. 8 Republican electoral sweep and the first clear sign 
of how shifts in Clinton Administration political priorities will affect the 
federal budget that officials are now preparing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since the election, aides and advisers have debated long and 
vigorously how to adapt to the new political realities, with the GOP in control 
of both houses of Congress and the public seemingly ill-disposed toward 
Clinton's ideas of activist government. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has given hints that he intends to move right, to return to his 
centrist, "new Democrat" roots. But until Thursday it had been mostly talk. 
</P>
<P>
 While aides were debating ways to find a few hundred million dollars for AIDS 
programs, school lunches and homeless shelters, Clinton was out in front of the 
cameras Thursday pledging billions for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Lubinski, acting director of the AIDS Action Council, said she fears 
that Clinton's response to the November elections would be fiscal infatuation 
with the military and diminished commitment to dealing with the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the Administration had not yet decided how much money it will 
devote to AIDS prevention and treatment programs in the fiscal 1996 budget but 
that AIDS and gay rights groups would be watching closely to see how Clinton's 
policies develop over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll certainly be very discouraged if the President abandons his base, and 
we see ourselves as part of his base," Lubinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago on World AIDS Day, Clinton visited seven AIDS patients at 
Georgetown University Hospital and gave a major address on his Administration's 
efforts to combat the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, by contrast, Clinton met privately in the Oval Office with six 
young people living with AIDS. The event was not on his official schedule, and 
no reporters or photographers were allowed to record the session.

 White House aides said that Clinton asked for the private session to learn 
firsthand the problems of adolescents afflicted with AIDS and had made no 
attempt to avoid publicizing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the AIDS meeting, speaking afterward with reporters, said 
Clinton seemed concerned about their plight but proposed no new initiatives to 
fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday's announcement of additional billions for military training, pay 
raises and improved living conditions was welcomed by the military as a sign 
that Clinton is serious about repairing his relations with the armed forces.  
</P>
<P>
 Retired Army Lt. Gen. Richard West, vice president of the Assn. of the U.S. 
Army, said Pentagon officials had spoken before the November elections of 
boosting military spending by $20 billion over the next six years, but Clinton 
upped the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 West said Clinton's new budgetary enthusiasm will help his image among the men 
and women in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will give a better tone to things. Sure it will," the general said. 
</P>
<P>
 Al From, director of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group that 
Clinton once chaired, said that pledging more money for military readiness was 
an astute political move for Clinton, who is still seeking a viable future for 
his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has been urging him to move to the center to try to recapture 
disillusioned voters who may believe that he has become too closely tied to 
liberal causes and big-government solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's smart for two reasons," From said. "First, it sends important and right 
signals, and second, it's real, it has impact. This isn't making a speech; this 
is calling for more money, and he's going to get it."

7 STUDENTS CHEW LSD-LACED BUBBLE GUM; DRUGS: THEY SAY THEY BEGAN HALLUCINATING

 At least seven Marina High School students, including five drill team members, 
were recovering Thursday after they unknowingly chewed LSD-laced bubble gum 
that had been given to them by other students, parents and authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several law enforcement officials said it was the first time they had heard of 
chewing gum used to transmit drugs. But some students on campus said that 
lacing bubble gum with LSD, or "acid," is a new fad. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the episode began Tuesday about 10 p.m. as seven Marina High 
School girls who had just finished drill team practice were sitting with their 
coach in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Four boys who had been watching the team practice approached the group, and 
one of the boys offered the girls some wrapped bubble gum, according to team 
members and their parents. Five girls, all seniors, accepted. The girls began 
to hallucinate soon after they went home. 
</P>
<P>
 One team member, Angela Salinardi, 17, said she saw visions of robotic toys 
called "transformers" and "monsters from the haunted mansion at Disneyland" 
hours after chewing a piece of gum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was part of my head injury," said Salinardi, who had been in a 
coma for three days after a drunk driver struck her in April. "I was paranoid 
because I thought I would have to go to a mental institution; then I started 
crying, then I started laughing uncontrollably again." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinardi said she talked to other drill team members Wednesday and found out 
they had similar experiences. One member told Salinardi that she imagined 
herself singing a duet with slain Beatle John Lennon. The girls talked to 
police Wednesday night and turned over some of the chewed gum, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Charles Poe said investigators became aware of the LSD-spiked gum 
Tuesday night after the mother of a male Marina High student called authorities 
to say her son and his friend were "acting weird." The two boys were taken to a 
hospital, where they were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests had been made as of Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said that laboratory tests completed Thursday indicated that the LSD had 
been inserted into slits in the bubble gum. LSD was found in various pieces of 
unchewed gum that had been turned over to the police, he said.

BERLUSCONI SOFTENS ITALIAN AUSTERITY PLAN

 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi backed away from the brink Thursday, 
tempering economic austerity with billion-dollar concessions and persuading 
labor unions to scrap a nationwide general strike scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord, reached in a marathon 21-hour negotiating session with the three 
main unions, followed a decision by Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement and its 
coalition partners to stay together at least through the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders, who had mounted a general strike and a million-strong rally in 
Rome against Berlusconi in recent weeks, expressed satisfaction with the 
compromise reached Thursday over the controversial 1995 government budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to reduce Italy's sapping public deficit by $30 billion, the 
58-year-old billionaire had proposed sharp cuts in Italy's generous pension 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's agreement softened the blows, restoring full benefits to salaried 
workers who have completed 35 years of service, increasing social security for 
large and poor families and boosting aid to the lesser-developed Italian south.

TERRORIST WHO KILLED 3 GIS FREED; GERMANY: RED ARMY FACTION MEMBER IRMGARD 
MOELLER, 47, RELEASED FROM LUEBECK PRISON AFTER 22 YEARS. U.S. PROTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Irmgard Moeller was imprisoned for life 22 years ago for the murder of 
three U.S. soldiers, the Cold War was in full force, the Vietnam War still 
raged, and then-Chancellor Willy Brandt's "Ostpolitik" recognized what seemed 
to be a terminally divided Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old Red Army Faction terrorist -- Germany's longest-serving female 
prisoner -- walked free into a different world Thursday, a physically changed 
woman whose "anti-imperialist" views apparently remain much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all still a bit unreal," Moeller said as she was released in the Baltic 
Coast city of Luebeck. "A lot of people are going to ask how I survived all 
this time. I kept alive the aims for which I fought and felt the support of my 
sympathizers." 
</P>
<P>
 Her first view of the 1990s, an era of the single superpower that trades with 
an increasingly capitalist Vietnam, was punctuated by scores of supporters 
waving red flags, singing 1960s anti-war songs and chanting "Freedom for all 
political prisoners" in reunified Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. State Department protested her release on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we recognize the independence of German courts, we are disappointed 
that an unrepentant terrorist who murdered three U.S. soldiers has been freed 
from prison," the department said in an official statement. "Prior to this 
parole, the U.S. formally reiterated to the government of Germany our view that 
convicted terrorists should serve their full prison terms." 
</P>
<P>
 But the German government has made a tentative peace with the Red Army 
Faction, which is blamed for about 50 deaths in attacks on U.S., NATO and 
German business and political targets during a 20-year campaign against 
"imperialism and monopoly capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Moeller's release could set the stage for the release of seven other Red Army 
prisoners who have served at least 15 years of their life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Moeller was convicted of driving one of two car bombs into the U.S. Army 
headquarters in Heidelberg on May 24, 1972, in protest of what she claimed was 
American genocide in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast killed Capt. Clyde R. Bonner and soldiers Charles L. Peck and Ronald 
A. Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a striking 25-year-old with long, dark hair and bangs, Moeller was 
arrested six weeks after the attack and was eventually sentenced to life in 
prison plus 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In jail, Moeller refused to undergo psychiatric evaluations to determine 
whether she is still dangerous, and the German magazine Der Spiegel quoted her 
in 1992 as saying that "the armed struggle was legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, earlier this month a court in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, 
where the prison is, decided that she is no longer a threat to society and 
ordered early parole for reasons of poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who emerged from jail in jeans and a black leather jacket had long, 
graying hair and an age-lined face. She was pale and said to be suffering from 
heart and skin ailments and other problems stemming from 12 hunger strikes 
during her incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of devout Roman Catholics, Moeller was a middle-class university 
student in Munich when she moved from political protests to left-wing extremism 
in 1971, joining the underground Baader-Meinhof gang, which was soon renamed 
the Red Army Faction. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the group's attacks were a 1975 assault on the German Embassy in 
Stockholm, in which four people were killed, and a 1979 attempt to murder 
Alexander Haig, who was then NATO commander. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Army Faction received support from the Communist government in East 
Germany and got help securing training from Palestinian terrorist groups. After 
the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it was discovered that about 10 former members of 
the group had been living there under new identities. 
</P>
<P>
 German officials are still looking for a handful of Red Army Faction members 
accused of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Red Army Faction issued a statement that it would no longer 
attack "leading representatives of the economy and state." In response, the 
justice minister called for reconciliation with the group.

NEW TRADE BODY'S POWER CALLED OVERRATED; PACT: FOES SAY THE WTO WILL ERODE U.S. 
SOVEREIGNTY. BUT PROPONENTS SAY FEARS OF GLOBAL GOVERNMENT ARE UNFOUNDED AND 
CITE AGENCY'S AMERICAN ORIGINS. 
</P>

<P>
 Opponents of the sweeping world trade agreement approved Thursday by the 
Senate have persuaded many Americans that it will give birth to a new 
supra-government, a secretive, omnipotent international agency able to ride 
roughshod over U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The new World Trade Organization that will arbitrate international trade 
disputes under the agreement has stirred emotional fears that American 
sovereignty will be usurped. But supporters of the accord say that the cries of 
"one-world government" are overblown. After all, they ask, how many Americans 
now fear international legal rulings from the World Court? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, if the Serbs can kick the United Nations around, then why should any 
American worry about the WTO?" asked Jeffrey Schott, an international trade 
expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, supporters argue, the World Trade Organization, like other 
elements of the accord, bears a "made in America" stamp from top to bottom. The 
agency was first proposed by U.S. trade negotiators after Congress complained 
loudly at the refusal of other nations to abide by international trade rulings 
and was not imposed on U.S. bargainers by foreign powers eager to erode 
American clout in international trade.  
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, the new trade dispute system, rather than being a threat to us, will 
work to our advantage," argued Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), 
who voted for the agreement when it passed the House on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade analysts noted that, overall, the agreement is the product of seven 
years of detailed negotiations that were driven to a surprising extent by 
American trading interests. 
</P>
<P>
 It will slash worldwide tariffs by an average of 38%, provide new protections 
for an array of products and bring agriculture under international trade rules 
for the first time. Above all, it will mark the first worldwide agreement to 
provide greater market access for services and Information Age exports from the 
United States and other industrial nations. In return, developing nations will 
be granted improved access to the industrialized powers for their basic 
manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected benefits of the trade accord for the American economy have 
brought support from most U.S. business and agriculture organizations. The 
Administration has dubbed it the largest tax cut in history, since it will 
slash tariffs around the world by a total of $750 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the World Trade Organization remains a frightening mystery to many 
Americans and has become a lightning rod for liberal and conservative critics 
who believe that the new trade regime will cause difficulties for U.S. laws 
covering such issues as environmental protection, labor standards and 
industrial policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents range from Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist and 
former Republican presidential candidate, to Texas billionaire and former 
independent presidential candidate Ross Perot and consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with foes of the accord in the textile industry, they sought to mobilize 
public opinion against the World Trade Organization in last-minute newspaper 
and television ads, warning that the United States was on the verge of signing 
away its sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in our history, a foreign body will have the right to hear 
challenges to any U.S. law and rule against it as an obstacle to trade," argued 
Pat Choate, a Washington writer and consultant on trade.  
</P>
<P>
 "The WTO puts us in a vice and squeezes," added Michael McCloskey, chairman of 
the Sierra Club, who fears the impact of the agreement on U.S. environmental 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 For such critics, the new trade regime's basic flaw is that it will take away 
the ability of the United States to veto international trade rulings. They 
charge that the organization will give power to international bureaucrats who 
will operate in secret with no accountability and no conflict-of-interest 
rules, while stripping large nations, such as the United States, of the kind of 
representative power that they enjoy in other international organizations like 
the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the U.N., we have a veto in the Security Council, and in the World Bank 
and the IMF, we have a weighted vote on all matters equal to our quota payments 
to the organizations," noted Choate. "But the World Trade Organization will be 
the first time we will be in an international organization where it is one 
country, one vote. And we will have no more power than any other country in the 
world. That will be a new experience for the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Schott and other supporters of the trade agreement argued that the new 
system was designed specifically by American trade bargainers to prevent the 
abuses of the old system that too often hurt American interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the previous system, no sanctions could be imposed without the agreement 
of all countries involved -- including the nation on the losing end of the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 That system frustrated the United States because Washington brought more 
unfair-trade cases than any other country and too often saw other nations 
ignore the rulings. As a result, in the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, Congress 
instructed American trade negotiators to push for a stronger dispute resolution 
system in talks then underway on the new trade agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 "The opposition to the WTO is ironic because it was the U.S. that was pushing 
the hardest for it," observed a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, a panel of independent judges -- mutually chosen by all 
of the nations involved -- will issue rulings on trade disputes and a separate 
panel will be available for appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 The panels will not have the power to overturn national laws that are deemed 
in violation of the new trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they will have power to impose trade sanctions in the form of higher 
tariffs. And the World Trade Organization's director-general will not have any 
independent authority to challenge the trade policies of the United States or 
any other power. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, any nation will have the right to pull out of the WTO after 
giving six months' notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) reached an agreement with the Administration to include 
an additional safeguard that will create a review panel of federal judges to 
determine whether the United States should pull out of the agreement if its 
rulings go against American interests on a consistent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this dire feeling among some Americans that the WTO is some Stephen 
King-like beast out there around the corner," noted Kantor's spokeswoman. "But 
in reality, we are doubly safeguarded against any problems from the WTO."

 Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder 
Thursday, a day after he was chosen by fellow House Democrats as minority 
leader when the new Congress convenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from Gephardt's office said that the congressman was "resting 
comfortably" after the surgery and that he was expected to remain at Bethesda 
Naval Hospital until the weekend. "A full recovery is expected," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-year-old lawmaker had first suffered abdominal pains on Tuesday and 
tests revealed the presence of gallstones.

REPUBLICANS TARGET 1,500 HOUSE STAFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Republicans announced plans Thursday to terminate 1,500 administrative 
employees, deny them severance pay and consolidate several non-legislative 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the proposed changes still need to be ratified by the House Republican 
Conference, but Democrats complained that they had not been consulted about the 
personnel policies. Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the Democratic 
transition leader, also took issue with GOP proposals for changes in committee 
sizes and party composition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Nussle of Iowa, the Republican transition team leader, said the 1,500 
employees would be notified of their termination by Jan. 4 but could reapply 
and possibly win back their jobs. The process allows Republicans to decide who 
fills administrative jobs and whether to eliminate some of those positions. The 
affected employees work for the clerk, doorkeeper, sergeant at arms and other 
non-legislative House officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussle said House Republicans do not plan to pay permanently terminated 
employees severance pay because the House has never done so and the federal 
deficit is too high. He also announced that House employees who lose their jobs 
will not receive lump-sum payments for accrued vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with management flowcharts, Nussle announced Republican plans to 
restructure administrative offices to improve upon recent "weak reforms" and 
create the "GOP's open House." 
</P>
<P>
 One change would abolish the doorkeeper's office and transfer most of its 
functions to the sergeant-at-arms office. The doorkeeper oversees cloakrooms, 
entrances to the House floor, pages and support offices, such as the 
barbershop. The sergeant at arms is the chief security officer.

DERIVATIVES ARE COMPLEX, OFTEN RISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Derivatives are investment contracts whose values are based on, or "derived" 
from, the performance of an underlying security, interest rate or market index. 
A derivative based on interest rates, for instance, might change in value in 
tandem with the difference between bond yields in New York and Germany. Or a 
derivative's value could be based on a comparison of changes in oil prices and 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thursday's disclosure of dramatic, derivatives-linked losses in Orange 
County's investment portfolio, here are some questions and answers about these 
complex financial deals: 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this more like Las Vegas than Wall Street? 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily. If the investor is an airline that would go bankrupt if both 
its borrowing costs and fuel costs spiraled out of control, a derivative whose 
value went up as those costs rose would protect it from losses. If, on the 
other hand, the investor is simply making a bet on the direction of those 
markets, that would amount to speculation, and the potential for losses could 
be great. 
</P>
<P>
 Why have derivatives become so controversial? 
</P>
<P>
 By their nature, derivatives are complex. And given advances in the computer 
technology needed to calculate their values, they are becoming even more so. 
Several major corporations and some municipalities discovered this year that 
derivatives contracts they thought they understood actually were far beyond 
their comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 That became an issue when interest rates soared earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The "break" in the interest rate markets led to unexpected behavior among 
especially complex derivatives deals. When interest rates rise, the value of 
bonds and other debt securities falls. If this happens with unprecedented 
speed, derivatives based on those securities become exceptionally risky. Such 
staid corporations as Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greeting Cards lost millions 
of dollars; both have sued Bankers Trust Co., which created and sold the 
derivatives, charging that the bank misled them about the risks of the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly risky aspect of derivatives is that no standard or regulated 
market exists for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there other dangers? 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are also tricky because they involve "leverage" -- that is, 
borrowing money to invest. Leverage tends to improve the return of a profitable 
investment; you put up only a portion of the investment, yet reap all the gain. 
But it also exacerbates the scale of a potential loss because the investor must 
shoulder the entire loss and pay off the lender. Many derivatives transactions 
are leveraged by nature because they employ futures and options contracts, 
which require investors to put up only a portion of the money at risk. When the 
markets turn ornery, the investor can lose more than his or her initial stake. 
</P>
<P>
 What was Orange County investing in? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's derivative investments appear to have included structured 
notes. These are investments designed to pay a given return if interest rates 
remain within a certain range; if they go higher or lower than the specified 
range, the notes pay no interest, and thus their market value deteriorates 
sharply. Because interest rates have continually surprised the market this 
year, they might well have rendered structured notes worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 Do derivatives have any place in a county, municipal or other public 
portfolio? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they do. Any big investor faces difficulties moving large sums of 
money around quickly; derivatives can help by simulating the performance of a 
direct investment until the investor can actually put up his capital. In other 
cases, public investment funds might want to invest in a new market but also 
might want to or insure against, certain risks in that market.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, counties, municipalities, and other public bodies are major users of 
derivatives. Los Angeles County used a derivative when it sold bonds in 
September. To meet a requirement that the interest rate on the bonds remain 
below 8%, the county entered into a transaction called a swap, which caps the 
county's potential interest outlay at that level. In all, $7 billion in 
municipal bonds sold this year encompassed some form of the most common 
derivatives.

TRIBUNAL URGES NAVY NOT TO DISCHARGE LESBIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Navy tribunal decided Thursday that Lt. Zoe Dunning's career in the Reserves 
should not end with the statement "I am a lesbian." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of inquiry meeting at Treasure Island Naval Station unanimously 
found that although Dunning had made the statement that she is a homosexual, 
she also had proven that she would not engage in homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board of inquiry recommends retention in the Naval service," said Capt. 
Thomas Berns, senior member of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunning stood with her back to the courtroom audience while the findings were 
being read, her hands clenched. Afterward she smiled briefly as she clasped the 
hands of her lawyer, Greg Bonfiglio. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunning's attorneys had maintained that when Dunning declared her 
homosexuality at a January, 1993, rally, she was not broadcasting an intention 
to practice homosexuality but merely indicating her sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She felt that to continue to hide who she was would be a lie," Bonfiglio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Navy prosecutors told the board that they had no choice but to order 
Dunning separated from the service, regardless of her achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that under a "don't ask, don't tell" policy, service members 
who declare that they are homosexual face discharge unless they can prove that 
they will not engage in homosexual acts while in the service. Dunning did not 
do that, prosecutors said.

SHAKUR FOUND GUILTY OF SEX ABUSE CHARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after he was shot in a robbery, rapper Tupac Shakur was convicted 
Thursday of sexually abusing a woman he had invited to his hotel room and 
acquitted of sodomy and weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur, 23, who was shot five times Wednesday, was not in court when the 
verdict was read.He had appeared earlier Thursday in a wheelchair with a heavy 
white bandage on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, which reached its decision on the third day of deliberations, 
reached the same verdict for a co-defendant, Charles Fuller, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur's lawyer, Michael Warren, said he was pleased that the jury "kept an 
open mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were convicted on three counts of first-degree sex abuse, which means 
they groped and touched the woman without her consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Daniel Fitzgerald told the attorneys to return to court Monday, 
presumably to arrange a sentencing date. The conviction does not carry an 
automatic prison sentence, but the men could each get maximum seven-year terms.

TIGHT REINS ASKED ON ALIEN MARRIAGES, STUDENT VISAS; TERRORISM: FBI CHIEF 
RESPONDS TO WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING, KILLINGS OUTSIDE CIA HEADQUARTERS. THEY 
ARE CITED AS VIOLENCE LINKED TO 'UNDESIRABLES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh is calling for tighter controls on student visas 
and alien marriages as part of an intensified effort to curb terrorism by 
aliens in the United States, it was learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh made the recommendations to Deputy Atty. Gen. Jamie S. Gorelick, who 
asked him to review policies and practices on immigrants entering and leaving 
the United States in response to the World Trade Center bombing and killings 
outside CIA headquarters -- both linked to aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, now under review by the Justice Department, also proposed 
strengthening investigative powers against suspected "undesirable aliens," 
accelerating deportation appeal proceedings and limiting U.S. participation in 
a visa waiver pilot program under which 9 1/2 million foreigners entered the 
country in fiscal 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aliens coming to the United States to engage in illegal conduct know that one 
of the easiest ways to enter and remain in the country is by requesting 
asylum," Freeh told Gorelick. Under current procedures, they are asked either 
to post a small bond guaranteeing their appearance at a future hearing or are 
released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any legal procedures devised to address such aliens will fail unless they 
include provisions for the detention and removal of the alien," Freeh said. "At 
present, too many of these aliens simply blend into American society and never 
return for their immigration hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh was acting in his capacity as director of the Office of Investigative 
Agency Policies, a Justice Department unit created a year ago to end 
interagency conflicts between the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, 
Marshals Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service. He made the 
recommendation Sept. 26 in a four-page memorandum to Gorelick, which was then 
included in the Nov. 18 annual report of the new Justice Department office. A 
copy was provided to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department official said that the Freeh proposals are part of a 
larger government-wide review of steps to prevent terrorism in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh said that two categories of foreigners requiring "additional scrutiny" 
are those who enter the country on student visas but do not abide by the terms 
of the visa and those who "engage in 'sham marriages' with American citizens or 
permanent resident aliens" solely to become legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants seeking entry on either grounds "should undergo thorough scrutiny 
at the outset, as well as some form of continuing scrutiny," Freeh said. 
Follow-up investigation of students would include reviewing their academic 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the intent is not to harass an alien who lawfully opts either to 
study in this country or to marry an American," Freeh said. "Instead, the 
intent is to ascertain which aliens are using these avenues as a means to 
remain in this country indefinitely . . . to engage in unlawful conduct. I 
recognize that certain legitimate privacy interests are implicated." 
</P>
<P>
 In deportation or other proceedings against aliens, Freeh noted that 
government agencies do not use "protected or classified information," including 
that from electronic eavesdropping and confidential sources, because existing 
law does not provide adequate means to protect that information. Its 
disclosure, he said, "could compromise ongoing investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 He called for establishing a special closed court hearing on the use of such 
sensitive information at which only the government would appear. Freeh urged 
the Justice Department to reconsider "terrorist alien removal" legislation that 
would create a court to conduct "special removal hearings" against immigrants 
who take part in international terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
 That legislation, backed by the Administration, was passed by the Senate in a 
1993 crime bill that did not become law. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh criticized deportation appeal procedures on grounds that they often 
delay action for many years. "Failure to remove them swiftly from the United 
States simply exposes our country to needless risks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under present practices, some parts of an immigrant's asylum file at the INS 
are not available to other law enforcement agencies, Freeh noted. "The FBI has 
noted that, in terrorist investigations, those unavailable portions of an 
alien's asylum file could prove invaluable," he said. "Indeed, those portions 
could provide sufficient leads to prevent the commission of further terrorist 
acts or crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 He called for considering full or expanded disclosure of immigrant asylum 
files. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh also endorsed giving terrorism investigators "roving authority" under 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to intercept communications. That 
authority, now available in certain criminal investigations, would allow 
targeting an individual's telephone conversations over any phone, rather than 
limiting surveillance to specific telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such authority would enhance the FBI's ability to investigate aliens' 
terrorist activities in the United States," Freeh said.

NO CHARGES TO BE FILED IN PASSPORT SEARCH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The independent counsel who was named to investigate alleged election-year 
tampering with the passport files of an Oxford University student named Bill 
Clinton said Thursday that he would not file any criminal charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is over and there aren't going to be any indictments," said 
Joseph E. diGenova, a former U.S. attorney here who was appointed two years ago 
to investigate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 His lengthy report on the investigation reportedly will clear several State 
Department aides who served under President George Bush and were accused of 
searching through passport records for partisan political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But diGenova refused to discuss the details of his findings until a special 
three-judge panel receives his final report.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to file the report (on the investigation) by the end of the year and, 
once the court releases it, I can discuss it in detail. But I am authorized to 
say we won't be bringing any charges," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the 1992 campaign, rumors surfaced that Clinton, while studying in 
England, had traveled to the Soviet Union with the intent of renouncing his 
U.S. citizenship to protest the Vietnam War. Clinton said during the campaign 
that the rumors were false. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the State Department's inspector general, several employees at 
the State Department ordered a search of Clinton passport files from the late 
1960s to see if damaging information could be found on the Democratic 
presidential nominee.  
</P>
<P>
 Other reports said that White House officials under former Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III, who was then running Bush's reelection campaign, also had 
inquired whether any damaging details could be found in Clinton's files. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the accused officials admitted that they had indeed ordered a 
search of the passport files, but that they did so only because reporters had 
filed a Freedom of Information request seeking travel information.  
</P>
<P>
 After a 21-day investigation, Inspector General Sherman M. Funk concluded that 
several State Department aides had violated government regulations by ordering 
the search, but he also said that they did not violate criminal laws. Funk also 
dismissed the allegation that there was an organized White House effort to dig 
up damaging information.  
</P>
<P>
 Funk reported his findings to outgoing Atty. Gen. William P. Barr, who in 
December, 1992, appointed diGenova to investigate whether any criminal laws 
were violated.  
</P>
<P>
 Reached by phone, Funk, who is now retired, said that diGenova's two-year 
investigation appears to have confirmed his initial inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found there was no organized conspiracy at the White House, that the 
controls at the State Department had broken down and that people had tried to 
embarrass the Democratic candidate for political reasons," Funk said. "But this 
didn't violate any particular law."  
</P>
<P>
 He also said he was mystified by reports that diGenova would use his final 
report to criticize the inspector general for unfairly damaging the reputation 
of the State Department aides.  
</P>
<P>
 "I find that strange. I did what the law required me to do. I turned the 
information over to the attorney general," he said. "I also can't understand 
why it took him two years to do what we did in 21 days."

KEY GOP LAWMAKER RETREATS ON WELFARE REFORM LIMITS; POLITICS: REP. SHAW, LIKELY 
TO HEAD THE PANEL THAT WILL DRAFT NEW RULES, BUCKS PARTY'S 'CONTRACT.' HE 
OPPOSES DENYING AID TO UNMARRIED YOUNG MOTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Republican lawmaker expected to chair a subcommittee that will draft the 
House version of welfare reform expressed deep reservations Thursday about 
denying benefits to unmarried teen-age mothers -- a central element of the 
GOP's "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected retreat from a key provision of the GOP contract suggests that 
the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill is not fully united behind the 
aggressive legislative agenda promoted by expected House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), who is likely to chair the House subcommittee 
with jurisdiction over welfare reform, said he cannot support Gingrich's 
proposal to permanently deny cash benefits to poor women who have children 
while they are teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, contained in the legislative manifesto signed by more than 300 
GOP congressional candidates before the midterm election, is designed to 
discourage out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, even if a mother who had her baby before she was 18 applied 
for welfare years later, she and that child would not be eligible. The plan 
also would allow states to extend ineligibility to babies born to mothers 18 to 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be unduly harsh," Shaw said, expressing concern about the 
constitutionality of a proposal that would treat babies born to teen-age 
mothers differently from other infants. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw earlier had declared his intention to use the GOP contract as his 
legislative blueprint in committee deliberations over welfare reform. But 
Thursday, he said that he will not do so. 
</P>
<P>
 His reservations are shared by at least one other House Republican on the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think it's tenable to discriminate based on whether a woman 
had a baby in or out of wedlock," said Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.). "I 
don't think it's constitutional, nor do I think it's fair or reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 That constitutional concern was brought up by the Congressional Research 
Service earlier this year because of a similar provision in a welfare reform 
bill introduced by conservative Republicans. In a private memorandum obtained 
by The Times, the service cautioned that such a provision would "raise 
equal-protection-clause questions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. James M. Talent (R-Mo.), an author of the provision, said he doesn't 
"see the constitutional problem." He stressed that, while the bill would 
terminate cash benefits, other money would be available to states to enable 
them to help young mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Clinton Administration and Republican congressional leaders have 
named restructuring the welfare system as a top priority, and the debate over 
restitching this essential aspect of America's safety net is likely to emerge 
as a defining element of the coming congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, who have seen their chances of orchestrating a 
welfare overhaul disappear since the Republicans took over both the House and 
the Senate in last month's election, were relieved to hear of the Republican 
dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be a big step in the right direction," said Bruce Reed, a domestic 
policy adviser to the President. "It would be good if cooler heads prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 While they disagree with the solution offered by the contract, Administration 
officials, Shaw and Johnson concur that the current system sends the wrong 
signal to teen-agers by offering them cash assistance and enabling them to move 
out of their parents' homes if they have children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's welfare overhaul plan, which is expected to be 
reintroduced next year, would require teen-agers to live with their parents or 
guardians to receive government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bill introduced by Shaw and Johnson had a similar provision. For 
teen-agers who see having a baby and collecting welfare "as a ticket out of the 
house," the requirement that they stay home "takes away the lure of the welfare 
payment," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw and Johnson also took issue with a provision in the contract's draft 
welfare reform bill that would prevent states from using federal money intended 
to fight teen-age pregnancy and care for children born out of wedlock to 
counsel women about abortion or pay for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see where welfare reform should get involved with the abortion 
issue," Shaw said.

MAN CONVICTED OF MURDERING JEWISH STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury convicted a Lebanese immigrant Thursday of murdering a Jewish teen-ager 
in an ambush on the Brooklyn Bridge, rejecting his claim that he was suffering 
a flashback from his childhood in war-torn Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashid Baz, a livery cab driver, admitted he strafed the van with bullets on 
March 1 as it drove onto the bridge carrying 15 students.Sixteen-year-old Aaron 
Halberstam was killed and three other people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Baz's lawyer, Eric Sears, blamed his client's "catastrophic" childhood in 
Beirut, where he became a soldier at age 9. He said Baz suffers post-traumatic 
stress syndrome, which climaxed in the bridge shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Baz, 28, said he fired at the van after people in it mouthed insults and 
leveled a gun at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Nachum Sosonkin, 18, a van passenger who was shot in the head and was the most 
badly injured of the three wounded survivors, testified at the trial that he 
never heard anyone inside the van say anything to Baz or display a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated a day before convicting Baz of second-degree murder and 
14 counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Baz, who immigrated from Lebanon at age 18, faces 25 years to life in prison 
at his Jan. 18 sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred as the young men, dressed in the distinctive black garb 
worn by ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher Jews, returned from a visit to the Manhattan 
hospital where the Lubavitchers' leader, Rebbe Menachem Schneerson, was being 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution cited testimony by Baz's uncle, Jamal Akel, that Baz's 
problems predated the start of Lebanon's civil war in 1975 and that much of his 
behavior was shocking -- even in Beirut.

GINGRICH TO DELETE REFERENCE TO BUSH IN UPCOMING NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich, in line to become Speaker of the House, has asked the 
publisher of a novel he is writing to omit a draft chapter that refers to a Lt. 
George Bush as "quite a guy, goofy in a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich (R-Ga.) said in a statement Thursday that he "neither wrote, saw nor 
approved" the references for former President George Bush, who was a Navy pilot 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The forthcoming novel -- tentatively titled "1945" -- is scheduled for 
publication next August. Excerpts of the draft are to be published this Sunday 
in the New York Times Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's publisher, James Baen of New York, said that he had inserted the 
reference to Bush in Gingrich's manuscript but that Gingrich had not yet 
reviewed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel's theme is what would have happened if Adolf Hitler had never 
declared war on the United States. It opens with a steamy scene in which a 
German spy seduces the White House chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the explicit seduction, Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said: "I 
think he (Gingrich) expects the final version will be appropriate for a general 
audience. This is just the draft stage."

 A federal watchdog agency said Thursday that it has opened an inquiry into 
fund-raising activities by high-ranking career employees in the Agriculture 
Department for a political action committee that supported Bill Clinton's 1992 
presidential election bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Special Counsel, which is responsible for maintaining the 
integrity of the Civil Service system, said that it is investigating whether 
Agriculture Department employees who allegedly raised funds for the PAC had 
violated the Hatch Act, which at the time prohibited all solicitation or 
collection of campaign funds by civil servants. Violations are punishable by 
job suspension or dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-eight senior career employees then working in the Agricultural 
Stabilization and Conservation Service made contributions of $50 to $500 to the 
Farmers & Ranchers '92 PAC, which was established to raise funds from farm 
interests for Democratic candidates and heavily backed Clinton's campaign. Some 
of those approached, most of whom were Democrats, said that they were solicited 
by colleagues and gave their checks to co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry was initiated in response to allegations in a Nov. 21 article in 
The Times, said officials at the Office of Special Counsel. The Times also 
reported that many contributors to the PAC -- which was co-chaired by then-Rep. 
Mike Espy, who later was named secretary of agriculture -- later received 
promotions or more desirable jobs under the Clinton Administration. Others, 
identified as Republicans, were transfered to lower-profile posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy said through a spokesman that his position with the political action 
committee was purely honorary and that there was no connection between the 
contributions -- or any employee's partisan allegiance -- and the job changes 
at the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Hatch Act inquiry, Espy's spokesman, Tom Amontree, said: "We welcome 
the review." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), who is expected to become 
House Agriculture Committee chairman, said that he has asked Donald C. Smaltz, 
the independent counsel investigating Espy on other matters, to determine 
whether any of the allegations in The Times' story fall within his legal 
mandate. If not, Roberts said, he will urge Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to launch an 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a question of undermining the independence of USDA and the Civil 
Service and the Hatch Act," Roberts said in an interview. "It is of deep 
concern to me and to all members of the Agriculture Committee to think that any 
hard-working civil servant could have been ousted to give a promotion to others 
whose major qualification was an illicit campaign contribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz, who was appointed in September to investigate reports that Espy had 
accepted illegal gratuities from agribusinesses, said that he plans to meet 
with Roberts today in response to the lawmaker's request. Espy has announced 
his resignation, effective Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Amontree emphasized Espy's limited role with the PAC: "At the time, the 
secretary was a member of Congress and merely one of eight honorary co-chairs 
of the organization. The secretary did not participate in any fund-raising or 
solicit funds for the PAC. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Among those active with the political action committee was Grant B. Buntrock, 
a former career Agriculture Department employee who then worked for a national 
farm organization. In October, 1993, Buntrock was appointed by Espy and the 
White House as administrator of Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation 
Service, the nation's major domestic farm-aid program.

RISKY INVESTMENT TAKES $1.5-BILLION BITE OUT OF O.C.; FINANCE: OFFICIALS SEEK 
TO CALM 180 CITIES AND AGENCIES AND PREVENT A RUN ON COUNTY'S ONCE HIGH-FLYING 
PORTFOLIO. 
</P>

<P>
 In a financial tremor felt coast to coast, officials disclosed Thursday that 
Orange County's investment portfolio -- guided by a risky financial strategy -- 
has plunged in value this year by nearly $1.5 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 None of the 180 or so cities and other agencies that rely on the county to 
invest their surplus funds and some pension and other accounts have pulled out 
of the investment pool, whose complex bond holdings have been hammered by the 
year's unexpected rise in interest rates. Indeed, county officials said the 
largest investors have signaled that they will ride out the current 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 A rush by government agencies to withdraw funds from the pool -- worth $18.6 
billion after falling 7% in value since January -- could force the county to 
begin selling its holdings, which might accelerate the losses and financially 
hamstring local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "A run on the asset pool will be a death spiral," said Zane Mann, editor of 
the California Municipal Bond Advisor in Palm Springs. "It would force the 
treasurer to sell more (securities) in a bad market." 
</P>
<P>
 The losses in the giant investment portfolio came to light Thursday after 
rumors swept Wall Street that Orange County was suffering cash-flow problems. 
By the time county officials held a news conference in midafternoon to deny the 
rumors, the shock waves had jolted financial markets and raised serious 
questions about the potential fallout: 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street brokerage that has extended Orange County 
$2.5 billion in credit to purchase securities, promptly denied rumors that it 
may be exposed to losses as a result of the sharp decline in the county's 
holdings. The rumors caused Merrill's stock to drop $1.50 per share on the New 
York Stock Exchange, to $36.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials announced that they had hired a Wall Street investment 
adviser to review the portfolio, assess potential damages and make 
recommendations about how investments might be changed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials also revealed that cities, school districts and other government 
agencies -- all investors in the pool -- met this week with top county 
officials, who attempted to calm their fears about the plummeting investments. 
Administrators said it was too soon to say how government budgets would be 
affected, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * Major Wall Street credit rating agencies Moody's Investors Service and 
Standard & Poor's, both of which now give Orange County bonds nearly the 
highest possible rating for safety, plan to meet with county officials next 
week to analyze the situation. Lower bond ratings would raise the cost of 
borrowing for the county's government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) called on county Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron, the manager of the county's investment pool, to 
either resign or retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bad investment decision with the people's money," Conroy said, 
citing Citron's extensive use of borrowed money to bet on investment market 
trends. "He was shooting craps with the people's money, and the dice rolled 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The losses incurred by the county fund, one of the nation's largest, represent 
a dramatic reversal for Citron. In recent years, the fund's investment returns 
have been the envy of the industry, averaging more than 9% annually. But 
critics have objected that Citron was taking too much risk with public money. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many large institutional investors, the county essentially had borrowed 
money short-term to invest in longer-term bonds, using its clients' funds as 
collateral. That strategy worked well while interest rates were declining from 
1990 through 1993 and while the difference between short-term and long-term 
rates was wide. The fund's profit was basically the "spread" between short and 
long rates, plus the rise in value of older long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tactic has gone awry this year, as interest rates in general have 
soared with the expanding economy. That has cut the value of long-term bonds 
issued at lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, like most money managers, did not see the reversal in interest rates 
coming. In a report to the county Board of Supervisors in September, 1993, he 
wrote: "Certainly there is nothing on the horizon that would indicate that we 
will have rising interest rates for a minimum of three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county used "leverage" -- or borrowed funds -- extensively, its 
losses have been magnified, just as its gains were magnified when interest 
rates were falling. The squeeze has come in part as the securities firms that 
loaned the money have demanded that the county put aside more cash to 
"guarantee" the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the county's portfolio is leveraged two to three times its value 
through such transactions as "reverse repurchase agreements," according to 
Tanya Styblo Beder, a principal at Capital Market Risk Advisors, the firm that 
the county has hired to review its portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the fund's $1.5 billion in losses were realized, it would represent 
about 20% of the actual amount, excluding leverage, that government agencies 
have put into the investment pool -- $7.8 billion. For that reason, agencies 
have been told that if they want their money back now, beyond normal 
withdrawals, they will be paid 80 cents on the dollar.  
</P>
<P>
 Another key problem for the fund is that Citron has invested a significant 
amount of the borrowed money in securities known as "derivatives" -- hybrid 
investments that often represent a higher-risk bet on the direction of interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Those securities' losses, too, can be magnified when interest rates go against 
the investor's expectations. Moreover, because of their complexity, derivatives 
that have tumbled in value have become difficult for some investors to sell at 
any price. 
</P>
<P>
 House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who has 
crusaded for more control of derivatives, suggested the fund managers were 
"just plain gambling. They just thought they could beat the house." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials stressed Thursday that the losses in the portfolio so far are 
only on paper; most of the securities in question have not been sold, so the 
losses have not been realized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a liquidity problem," said Matthew Raabe, Orange County's assistant 
treasurer-tax collector. "It's something we need to work through, but it is not 
a crisis and it is not catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, who remained in the background, made a brief defense of his investment 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 15 years I have been managing the portfolio this way," he said. "What I 
did was not irresponsible in any manner, shape or form." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and Wall Street analysts said that as long as the county is not 
forced to sell securities prematurely at their current depressed prices, it 
conceivably could ride out the crisis and wait for the investments in question 
to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Orange County's chief administrator held two emergency meetings 
with investors -- on Tuesday and Thursday -- to request that they not draw 
higher-than-normal amounts of money from the pool. The investors include every 
Orange County city except Garden Grove and San Juan Capistrano and every county 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that immediately, everyone thought, 'I wish I could get my money out 
of here,' " said Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District, which 
has $300 million in the investment fund. "But after a while, the general 
feeling was, we all live in this county and raise our kids here and it's to 
everyone's benefit to hang in here together." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no investor has requested that its funds be withdrawn from the pool, 
county officials said. Raabe said the 11 largest investors -- including the 
Orange County Transportation Authority -- have agreed to keep their money in 
the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county officials attempted to minimize the impact of the situation, 
they acknowledged that there could be a severe financial blow to the county and 
other investors in the county investment pool if participants panic and 
withdraw their money -- or if interest rates continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not affect the county employees or the county constituency in any way 
unless people do not cooperate and we are forced to sell our securities," said 
Raabe. "At this point in time, the only danger is that people will decide not 
to work with us and we will have to sell securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe said the county's current problem is a lack of cash on hand. If 
investors decided to withdraw from the investment pool, they would have to get 
out at current market value and incur some losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very worst case scenario is that if everybody who is working with us 
chooses not to, we would have to liquidate the portfolio, and all of the 
investors would have to share in a $1.5-billion loss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is virtually no risk to the county's retirement system, Raabe added, 
because the retirement board has invested only 5% of its money in the 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said it appears that the county 
"will not make as much interest as we had previously anticipated." The county 
had planned to collect about $172 million in interest from its investments this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before people start to criticize they better look at the overall benefit that 
they've received as well," said Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth. "Citron has 
done an awful lot of good for a great deal of cities, including Anaheim. He's 
done a great job of managing that pool through some very difficult times." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's counterpart in Los Angeles, Sally Reed, said her county does not 
face similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not take these kinds of risks," she said. "The problem Orange County is 
finding is they have investments with long-term maturity. They, clearly, have 
not been as conservative as others." 
</P>
<P>
 Complex derivative investments have been the source of controversy all year, 
as rising interest rates worldwide have triggered large, unexpected losses for 
companies such as Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greeting Cards and numerous 
municipalities. In an extreme case earlier this year, a New York money manager 
lost $600 million of his clients' money within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regulators worry that the complex and risky nature of the investments 
could threaten the stability of the nation's financial system, and there have 
been calls in Congress to ban derivatives. But the investments are a 
fundamental part of many investment portfolios, serving in their most benign 
form as hedges against market fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Price, president of FGIC Capital Market Services in New York City, 
which also manages funds for municipalities, said Orange County officials 
should have disclosed to investors the day-to-day performance of their 
portfolio, particularly given the aggressive, high-risk positions it has taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Orange County pool is one of the most aggressive that's managed by public 
officials," said Price, who appeared with Raabe at a forum sponsored by a trade 
publication in Santa Monica in September. "As an accounting principle, I do 
think there's a matter of disclosure involved here," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stamenson, a fixed-income salesman for Merrill Lynch in San Francisco, is 
the broker with whom Orange County officials worked to develop their derivative 
investments. He declined to comment Thursday about the dropping value of the 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials met with Moody's and Standard & Poor's in New York two months 
ago and "received a clean bill of health," Raabe said. Orange County currently 
holds an AA rating, one notch below the highest rating possible. 
</P>
<P>
 John M.W. Moorlach, a certified public accountant who ran against Citron this 
year and was defeated, compared Orange County's financial crisis to that in 
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, where the county government shut down its investment 
fund in October under similar circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of Moorlach's campaign was his insistence that Citron was 
taking too much risk with public money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a great day," Moorlach said Thursday. "We are praying for him. 
This is the worst thing you could go through." 
</P>
<P>
 Chriss Street, a Newport Beach investment banker and well-known critic of 
Citron's, said he was dubious about the county's effort to keep its investors 
calm. "That's like saying, 'The plane is on fire and there are 20 passengers 
and there are 10 parachutes, so please don't grab a parachute and jump,' " 
Street said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Gebe Martinez, Ross Kerber and Rene Lynch in Orange County 
and Scot J. Paltrow in New York contributed to this story. A Different Kind of 
Tremor 
</P>
<P>
 A nearly $1.5-billion drop in the value of Orange County's investment fund 
forced officials to publicly discuss the losses Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aftershock 
</P>
<P>
 Brokerage firm Merrill Lynch saw its stock price fall $1.50 on rumors that it 
lost money, but officials denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 County leaders called for calm and hired an investment adviser to assess the 
damage and recommend changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Major investors in the $18.6-billion fund expressed concern, but said they 
have no plans to withdraw money. Investment Terminology 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the terms used by investors and brokers as they structure 
sophisticated financial deals: 
</P>
<P>
 * Derivatives: Complicated options or futures deals whose value is based on an 
underlying stock, bond, commodity or index. "Exchange-traded" derivatives are 
offered for sale on regulated exchanges, which theoretically guarantee that 
buyers and sellers can always be found. "Over the counter" derivatives -- those 
at issue in the Orange County controversy -- are designed by banks and 
brokerages and tailored to the needs of sophisticated customers. But because 
they may be unusual or even unique, there is no easy way to set a value on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call option: A contract allowing, but not requiring, the holder to buy a 
given commodity at a set price (the "strike price") by a certain date. If the 
strike price is higher than the cash price of the commodity at the expiration 
date, no sale takes place, and the option expires. If the strike price is lower 
than the cash price, the owner of the option exercises the right to buy the 
commodity. It can then be sold immediately at the higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put option: A contract allowing, but not requiring, the holder to sell a 
given commodity at a set price (the "strike price") by a certain date. If the 
strike price is lower than the cash price of the commodity at the expiration 
date, no sale takes place, and the option expires. If the strike price is 
higher than the cash price, the owner first buys the commodity at the lower 
market price, then immediately exercises the right to sell it at the strike 
price. The difference is the profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Futures: Contracts obligating the buyer to purchase a given commodity from 
another party on a certain date. Among other things, the underlying commodity 
can be grains, other foodstuffs, oil, bonds, stocks, or baskets of stocks that 
make up a stock index. Most futures are traded on regulated exchanges in 
Chicago and New York. In most cases, delivery of the underlying commodity never 
takes place; the deal is closed by the sale of an equivalent future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cap: A feature of a derivative that allows a user to set a ceiling on a 
risk. For example, a company may want a cap that protects it from paying 
interest on its debt above a certain level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Floor: The opposite of a cap. A user might be seeking protection from the 
effects of interest rates falling below a certain level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Structured notes: Investments designed to pay a given return if interest 
rates remain within a certain range. If rates go higher or lower than the 
range, the notes pay no interest and thus drop in value.

UNSUSPECTING STUDENTS GIVEN LSD-LACED GUM; DRUGS: SEVEN TEENS FROM MARINA HIGH 
SCHOOL IN O.C. ARE RECOVERING FROM HALLUCINATIONS, OTHER EFFECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO and DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least seven Marina High School students, including five drill team members, 
were recovering Thursday after they unknowingly chewed LSD-laced Bazooka bubble 
gum that had been given to them by other students, parents and authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several law enforcement officials said this was the first time they have heard 
of chewing gum used as a way to transmit drugs. But some students on campus 
said that lacing bubble gum with LSD, or "acid," is a new fad. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the episode began Tuesday around 10 p.m. as seven Marina 
High School girls who had just finished drill team practice were sitting with 
their coach in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Four boys who had been watching the team practice approached the group, and 
one of the boys offered the girls some wrapped Bazooka bubble gum, according to 
team members and their parents. Five of the girls, all seniors, accepted. The 
girls began to hallucinate soon after they went home. 
</P>
<P>
 One team member, Angela Salinardi, 17, said she saw visions of robotic toys 
called Transformers and "monsters from the haunted mansion at Disneyland" hours 
after chewing a slab of gum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was part of my head injury," said Salinardi, who had been in a 
coma for three days after a drunk driver struck her in April. "I was paranoid 
because I thought I would have to go to a mental institution, then I started 
crying, then I started laughing uncontrollably again." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinardi said she talked to other drill team members Wednesday and found out 
they had similar experiences. One drill team member told Salinardi that she 
imagined herself singing a duet with slain Beatle John Lennon. The girls talked 
to police Wednesday night and gave them pieces of chewed gum they had recovered 
for testing, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Charles Poe said investigators first became aware of the LSD-spiked 
gum Tuesday night after the mother of a male Marina High student called 
authorities to say her son and his friend were "acting weird." The two boys 
were taken to a hospital, where they were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests had been made as of Thursday evening, and none was expected in the 
next few days, Lt. Jeff Cope said. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said that lab tests completed Thursday indicated that the LSD had been 
inserted into slits that had been cut into the bubble gum. LSD was found in 
various pieces of unchewed gum that had been turned over to the police, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina High Principal Carol Osbrink, in her first day on the job, said 
Huntington Beach Union High School District staff members warned principals at 
the district's six other high schools to watch out for LSD-laced gum. Police 
also have asked anyone who has had similar experiences with gum or candy to 
contact their investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with New York-based Topps Co. Inc., which makes the popular, 
comics-wrapped bubble gum, said they have contacted Huntington Beach police for 
more information. 
</P>
<P>
 Topps spokesman Marty Appel said the company is not aware of anything like 
this happening to its product before. "We haven't received any other reports of 
this nature, nor have there been any in the nearly half century of manufacture 
of this product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Food and Drug Administration officials in Los Angeles said they also 
have not heard of bubble gum being laced with drugs. Orange County sheriff's 
officials agreed, but were not surprised at the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's logical that if you can get LSD in liquid form, you can put it on 
anything," said Sheriff's Sgt. Dan Jarvis, of the Special Investigations 
Division's narcotics detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis said he saw an upsurge in LSD use in the county about three months ago, 
but hasn't seen as much since. Recent Sheriff's Department undercover 
operations at local high schools turned up fairly light drug use, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students at Marina High said marijuana is the most common drug on campus, 
but tabs of LSD -- pieces of paper laced with the drug -- are available for 
about $5 a tab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acid is everywhere," one senior said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other law enforcement and health officials say use of hallucinogens in Orange 
County high schools appears to be on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting questions about it more often," said Chip Pope, a county health 
care agency program supervisor. "People are starting to hear that LSD use is 
becoming more common."

 The most recent California Department of Justice survey of high school 
students, completed in February, showed that more teen-agers are using LSD. 
About 8% of ninth-graders reported they had used LSD in the last six months, 
compared to 4% of ninth-graders in the same survey two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, is chemically manufactured and odorless, 
authorities said. People who ingest it may see bright moving colors and shapes 
before their eyes, or experience feelings of overwhelming fear, sadness or joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Amy Vermeeren, 17, co-captain of the drill team, said she chewed two 
pieces of the LSD-spiked gum. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she became giggly, her body felt tingly and lights looked 
three-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of paranoid," she said. "I didn't know what was going on. I had no 
idea I was drugged." 
</P>
<P>
 Vermeeren said she was awake until about 4 a.m. She went to a hospital 
Wednesday and a doctor's office Thursday for tests. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the incident makes her angry, but she is relieved that neither she 
nor her friends were seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can happen any time anywhere," she said. "It's very scary. One of us could 
have jumped out of a window or done something crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the two boys who had chewed the LSD-laced bubble gum apparently 
were not aware that it was laced with the drug.  
</P>
<P>
 The mother of one of the boys called police Tuesday night after she drove her 
son's friend home, Poe said. She told police that at first she thought only her 
son's friend was acting shaky, but then she noticed her own son hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>
 Security was stepped up at Marina High on Thursday. Some students worried that 
the drug incidents will tarnish the school's reputation, although it has a low 
dropout rate and above-average ratings in a recent Department of Education 
statewide report card of schools.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a public humiliation for us," said Brian Trimble, 15. "It's 
going to be bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Georganne Proulx, a Marina Aquatics Booster board member who has two children 
at Marina, said she was stunned when her 15-year-old son told her about the 
incident. "I wasn't aware that drugs were that accessible," Proulx said. "I'm 
doing all I can do to keep my kids active and to keep them out of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinardi, the drill team member, said some of her fellow students asked her 
Thursday in school if she liked the drug trip. "I told them, 'No, I was just 
scared,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela's mother, Linda Salinardi, said she was thankful her daughter and her 
friends were OK. "It could have been much, much worse," she said. "You always 
hear things happen to somebody else, and this time we were the somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old story," Linda Salinardi said. "Don't take candy from people 
you don't know."

DERIVATIVES: RISKY BUSINESS?; COUNTY HEADS LONG LIST OF LOSERS IN THE 
DERIVATIVES GAME; INVESTMENTS: DOZENS OF PUBLIC ENTITIES HAVE LOST HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AS LONG AS FUND MANAGERS SEEK BIG PAYOFFS, THERE WILL BE 
MORE, INDUSTRY INSIDERS SAY.

<P>
 Orange County leads the list of government entities that have suffered big 
losses -- real or on paper -- in the derivatives market in the past year. But 
the county certainly doesn't stand alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of cities, counties and school districts across the nation have lost 
hundreds of millions of dollars from investments in derivatives -- a little 
understood investment whose value is tied to, or derived from, the performance 
of an underlying index or asset, such as stocks, bonds, mortgages or 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 And as long as government financial managers are rewarded for finding 
investments that promise big returns, there probably will be more losses, 
investment industry sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, which manages investments for itself and more than 180 other 
government entities in California, on Thursday reported that the value of its 
bond portfolio has dropped by nearly $1.5 billion this year because of interest 
rate hikes and problems linked to derivatives trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's story is a bit different from most others because County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who was reelected last month, 
actively manages the investment pool and maps out daily investment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 In most other cases, the government entity simply bought into a professionally 
managed investment fund that put the money into derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits filed or being threatened in a number of cases often are based on a 
claim by the government agency that it was an unsophisticated participant 
harmed by an overly aggressive financial management strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, said one industry insider who requested anonymity, "they are 
saying they were too dumb to know what they were getting into." 
</P>
<P>
 In early October, the head of Odessa College, a 15,000-student school in west 
Texas, appeared before the House Banking Committee in Washington to describe 
how a derivatives investment sucked $11 million out of its coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel small political institutions, such as Odessa College, need clearer 
signposts as to what is advisable or inappropriate," said Odessa President 
Philip Speegle. While the school's managers now know about derivatives, he 
suggested they could fall victim to some new and equally risky investment 
vehicle in the future without such warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, even guidelines aren't enough. In Charles County, Md., 
there are written policies specifying appropriate investments. Derivatives are 
expressly forbidden. Yet the county's former deputy treasurer pumped almost the 
entire county investment portfolio into derivatives in 1992 and 1993 and saw 
the $30 million in principal shrink to $24 million because of trading losses. 
</P>
<P>
 And City Colleges of Chicago, a system of seven community colleges with 80,000 
students, recently sued a professional money management firm after the value of 
the college's $96-million investment fund was cut in half by losses on 
derivatives deals early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that the Texas-based investment firm arranged to put the 
college's funds in such deals though it knew that Illinois law prohibits public 
schools from investing in derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking Charles County officials for details about the county's investment 
losses, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) opined that 
"clearly, there is a huge number of supposedly sophisticated managers of public 
funds, mutual funds, corporate and pension funds, who really don't understand 
the arcane risks of derivatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Frederic E. Christiansen, financial director of Maple Grove, Minn., a suburb 
of Minneapolis, admits that he knew very little about them when he said "yes" 
to a representative of Piper Jaffray Cos. who was selling the Minneapolis-based 
brokerage's Government Institutional Portfolio fund -- a fund that invested 
heavily in derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Christiansen put $5 million of Maple Grove's money into the fund in August, 
1992. As of the end of November, he said, the value of the city's investment 
had shrunk to $3.4 million -- a $1.6-million loss if city officials decided to 
cash out. 
</P>
<P>
 That hasn't happened yet because Piper Jaffray continues paying a guaranteed 
8% annual interest rate on the money -- by the end of this year, Christiansen 
said, Maple Grove will have earned almost $1 million in interest over the two 
years. Another 18 months or so and the interest will have erased the loss if 
nothing else happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting about twice the return on that as on our other investments," 
Christiansen said in a telephone interview Thursday. Such returns are why the 
city hasn't joined other Piper Jaffray clients with big losses in a threatened 
class action suit against the nationally marketed fund, which was down an 
estimated $700 million at one point this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our only contention against Piper," he said, "is that they didn't tell us 
enough about this type of investment and about the risk. These derivatives have 
gotten a lot of publicity this year, but back in 1992 we knew very little about 
them." Derivative Downers

DERIVATIVES: RISKY BUSINESS?; DERIVATIVES COMPLEX, OFTEN RISKY; FINANCE: 
UNEXPECTED RISE IN INTEREST RATES LED TO LARGE LOSSES IN SOME OF THE 
CONTROVERSIAL CONTRACTS. MANY BIG INSTITUTIONS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE SAVVY ARE 
NOW IN OVER THEIR HEADS.

 Derivatives are investment contracts whose values are based on, or "derived" 
from, the performance of an underlying security, interest rate or market index. 
A derivative based on interest rates, for instance, might change in value in 
tandem with the difference between bond yields in New York and Germany. Or a 
derivative's value could be based on a comparison of changes in oil prices and 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thursday's disclosure of dramatic, derivatives-linked losses in Orange 
County's investment portfolio, here are some basic questions and answers about 
these complex financial deals: 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this more like Las Vegas than Wall Street? 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily. If the investor is an airline that would go bankrupt if both 
its borrowing costs and fuel costs spiraled out of control, a derivative whose 
value went up as those costs rose would protect it from losses. If, on the 
other hand, the investor is simply making a bet on the direction of those 
markets, that would amount to speculation, and the potential for losses could 
be great. 
</P>
<P>
 Why have derivatives become so controversial?  
</P>
<P>
 By their nature, derivatives are complex. And given advances in the computer 
technology needed to calculate their values, they are becoming even more so. 
Several major corporations and some municipalities discovered this year that 
derivatives contracts they thought they understood actually were far beyond 
their comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 That became an issue when interest rates soared with unexpected swiftness 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The "break" in the interest rate markets led to unexpected behavior among 
especially complex derivatives deals. When interest rates rise, the value of 
bonds and other debt securities falls. If this happens with unprecedented 
speed, derivatives based on those securities become exceptionally risky. Such 
staid corporations as Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greeting Cards lost millions 
of dollars; both have sued Bankers Trust Co., which created and sold the 
derivatives, charging that the bank misled them about the risks of the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly risky aspect of derivatives is that no standard or regulated 
market exists for them. Every derivative deal is different; when an investor 
wants to sell, it is sometimes impossible to find a buyer at a reasonable 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there other dangers? 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are also tricky because they involve "leverage" -- that is, 
borrowing money to invest. Leverage tends to improve the return of a profitable 
investment; you put up only a portion of the investment, yet reap all the gain. 
But it also exacerbates the scale of a potential loss because the investor must 
shoulder the entire loss and pay off the lender. Many derivatives transactions 
are leveraged by nature because they employ futures and options contracts, 
which require investors to put up only a portion of the money at risk. When the 
markets turn ornery, the investor can lose more than his or her initial stake. 
</P>
<P>
 What was Orange County investing in? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's derivative investments appear to have included structured 
notes. These are investments designed to pay a given return if interest rates 
remain within a certain range; if they go higher or lower than the specified 
range, the notes pay no interest, and thus their market value deteriorates 
sharply. Because interest rates have continually surprised market participants 
this year with the speed of their rise, they might well have rendered 
structured notes worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 Do derivatives have any place in a county, municipal or other public 
portfolio? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they do. Any big investor faces difficulties moving large sums of 
money around quickly; derivatives can help by simulating the performance of a 
direct investment until the investor can actually put up his capital. In other 
cases, public investment funds might want to invest in a new market but also 
might want to hedge, or insure against, certain risks in that market. 
Derivatives can perform that function, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, counties, municipalities, and other public bodies are major users of 
derivatives. Los Angeles County used a derivative when it sold bonds in 
September. To meet a requirement that the interest rate on the bonds remain 
below 8%, the county entered into a transaction called a swap, which caps the 
county's potential interest outlay at that level. In all, $7 billion in 
municipal bonds sold this year encompassed some form of the most common 
derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 What other public bodies have suffered derivatives losses? 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a few. Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said last month it will lose almost $100 
million in unwinding a series of deals involving derivatives. Charles County, 
Md., sued derivatives dealers to recover more than $5 million it lost on such 
deals, arguing that the investments were so arcane they did not qualify as 
permissible investments for the county. And a consortium of Chicago community 
colleges is suing dealers over nearly $50 million in derivatives losses.

DERIVATIVES: RISKY BUSINESS?; MEMBERS OF INVESTMENT POOL ARE OK -- FOR NOW; 
IMPACT: ALL BUT TWO CITIES IN O.C., MOST PUBLIC AGENCIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS 
SHARE IN LOSS. OFFICIALS SAY THEIR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS WON'T BE AFFECTED FOR 
NOW.

<P>
 Officials of cities, school districts and other public agencies with money in 
Orange County's investment pool said Thursday that the fund's $1.5-billion loss 
will not affect their day-to-day operations -- at least not immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 But several said that they will be rethinking their long-term financial 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking about diversifying," said Jim Keenan, finance director of 
the Orange County Transit Authority. With more than $1 billion, or 15% of its 
assets, in the pool, OCTA is the fund's biggest investor. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's news, Keenan said, OCTA will re-examine its investments and 
study "what percentage . . . is going into what investments." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Stan Oftelie, OCTA's chief executive, said they will stand by County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's investment strategy, however, and 
leave their money in the pool for now. Both blamed the fund's decline on rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan said OCTA will have no problem making payments on street and road 
projects. The agency has been "very conservative" with its other investments, 
he said, so is able to absorb a lower return from the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as our principal is secure, we are secure," Keenan said. "So we are 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Garden Grove and San Juan Capistrano, every city in Orange County 
is invested in the fund, as well as most school districts and large public 
agencies. Among those with the biggest stakes are the Sanitation District of 
Orange County, with $450 million invested; the Irvine Ranch Water District, 
$300 million; the Transportation Corridor Agencies, $306 million; and the city 
of Anaheim, $169 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Most had expected a return of 6% to 6.5% on their money this year. Now, 
officials say, they will have to wait for reviews in the next several weeks to 
find out just where their investments stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kozak, financial manager for the Sanitation District of Orange County, 
said his agency has about two-thirds of its $678.5-million portfolio in the 
pool and plans to leave it there. The fund's decline, Kozak said, is "not an 
emergency situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Treasurer Charlene Jung said investors were told by county officials 
that they would receive "market value as opposed to full face value" if they 
pull their money out immediately to seek higher yields elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand where they're coming from," Jung said of the county 
officials. "It would not be in the best interest of the participants if 
everyone drops out." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim has invested about 20% of its portfolio in the pool, Jung said, and 
"we are not panicking." Treasurer Citron, she said, "has a lot of experience 
and has done well in the past, so we are going to pretty much hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Fine, director of fiscal services for the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District, said the district invested $80 million in the pool. He now expects a 
return of $400,000 less than originally projected for the year, he said, but 
such a decline would not force the district to change its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to look to see where we'll absorb it," Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Pendleton, treasurer of San Juan Capistrano, said that her office and 
the City Council had decided that the county pool was too speculative. "It 
obviously generates a nice return, but along with that is the higher risk," she 
said. "We all understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the city put its $15 million elsewhere, including $7 million in a 
state fund. Though that investment returned only 5.1% for October, Pendleton 
said, council members chose safety over higher yields.

DANA PARSONS: PLEASANT OR PAINFUL, MEMORIES OF BIG GAME WILL LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Big Game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fixture in 20th-Century American culture, combining the dual 
attractions of spectacle and emotion. It rescues us from the humdrum and 
satisfies the craving for an answer instead of more darn questions. Yes, you'll 
get resolution -- either wondrous exhilaration or wrenching pain. The joy will 
last forever. As for the pain . . . well, it may go away eventually, assuming 
you've got a lifetime or so to devote to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the prospects tonight when prep powerhouses Los Alamitos and Mater 
Dei settle an Orange County football argument on the field at Anaheim Stadium. 
Whatever your feelings about high school sports, at least pause to celebrate 
that the players are in for an experience they'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Boyer knows all about that. Now 32, Boyer was a standout for Edison High 
School in Huntington Beach in the late 1970s, when its rivalry with Fountain 
Valley High School turned high school football players into heroic figures. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarterback as a junior and then a tight end as a senior, Boyer remembers 
the games with Fountain Valley as if they were yesterday, instead of half his 
lifetime ago. Like Los Alamitos, Edison had a long winning streak during 
Boyer's playing days. And so big was the rivalry with Fountain Valley that even 
the teams' regular-season games were played at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the game from Friday the week before was over, everyone understood 
that next week was Fountain Valley," Boyer recalled this week, "so everything 
we did in practice, from running extra wind sprints to extra bench presses, 
everything was geared to beating the Barons." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer knows what Los Al and Mater Dei kids have been thinking this week. It's 
a surreal merger of euphoria and nerves -- euphoria at being the center of 
attention and nerves perhaps so taut that sleep is difficult. "Oh, you fall 
asleep at night," Boyer said, "but when you wake up in the morning, it's the 
first thing you think about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players try to focus on the game, and the coaches tell you to focus on 
the game, but you can't help but hear other kids at school talking about it 
during the week -- the band members, cheerleaders, the kid sitting next to you 
in math class talking about who's going to the game with who -- and you're 
thinking, 'They're going to be there watching me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What about being a 17-year-old and the fear of failure? 
</P>
<P>
 "For myself, there was definitely nervousness, but once you're on the field 
and playing, it's fun being out there under the lights. It's like the lights 
are on you. You've got to remember as a player that you worked hard, that you 
started back in February working for this moment and now it's Friday night and 
you're in front of your peers, your mom and dad and people in the area are here 
to watch you, and all that work you put in behind the scenes is now going to 
come out in the next couple hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there definitely is fear there, but for me it wasn't fear of letting 
someone down; it was just nervousness, knowing everyone was watching you. It's 
a fear, but it's more of an excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Boyer what he remembered about playing at the Big A. "That is the most 
incredible deal, because here you are, you've been playing at junior college 
and high school fields, now all of a sudden you're in this place. . . . You 
enter the locker room and here you're sitting in front of your jersey and your 
equipment at your locker and you think, 'What superstar had this locker? And 
here I am at this same locker. Was it Reggie Jackson or Nolan Ryan, or what 
Ram? And now I'm in this locker room. Now, I'm the star, people are coming to 
watch me.' It's a big-time feeling. There's a long tunnel out to the stadium 
from both dugouts, and to walk out and hear the band and the roar of the crowd 
coming in, I'll always remember that, walking out under the lights and feeling, 
'This is incredible.' " 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Boyer if he remembered anything about his coach's pregame pep talk. "I 
can't give you the specific things said, but we locked ourselves into a room a 
couple hours before the game and the whole team would sit around with one of 
the coaches, and this sounds goofy, but we were bonding as a group of guys and 
everyone could share in the excitement if someone had something to say. I'll 
always remember those times. That's when we felt it was us against the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer's team won both games against Fountain Valley his last two years. He 
went on to play at USC and then eight years in the National Football League. 
He's now an investment broker. He married one of the Edison cheerleaders, has 
four daughters and lives in the school neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 His perspective on the games against Fountain Valley? "Looking back on my 
career and thinking of some of those big games I played in -- I played in the 
Rose Bowl and in front of a national audience in the pros on Monday Night 
Football -- but looking back on being a kid 16, 17, years old and playing in 
Anaheim Stadium in front of all those people, it's like the biggest thing. It's 
incredible. In relation to the age I was, I think it was as big as anything I 
ever played in." 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt if the Big Game emotions of high school players have changed since 
Boyer played for Edison. If he could talk to every Los Al and Mater Dei player 
today, he'd tell them not to worry about being nervous, that the anxiety will 
go away with the game's first contact and that their teammates will help them 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, he'd tell them to enjoy the evening. He'd tell them to drink 
in the crowd and the lights and the scoreboard and the cheering and the fans. 
He'd tell them this may be one of the most memorable nights of their lives and 
that it'd be a shame to let it slip by without appreciating it. 
</P>
<P>
 Because even at the tender age of 32, he knows something these kids don't: 
"Time just goes by fast," he said. "When I was in high school, it used to seem 
like it took forever for the season to get here. Now it flies by."

PET GREYHOUND WINS A RACE AGAINST TIME; DOGS: GROUP THAT RESCUED POOCH ONCE 
BEFORE GETS HIM BACK FROM OWNER WHO CONSIDERED HAVING HIM PUT TO SLEEP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cat may have nine lives, but Dylan the greyhound isn't doing so badly 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 An animal rescue group's race to an Orange County courtroom this week helped 
save the life of the hound, whose owner had considered having him killed. The 
same group had saved Dylan from almost-certain destruction more than two years 
ago, when he was no longer needed at an out-of-state racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual court action began Wednesday when the nonprofit Hemopet 
organization, an Irvine-based animal blood bank that rescues greyhounds and 
puts them up for adoption through its Pet Life-Line arm, sued Dylan's owner, 
Deborah Pommerening of Rancho Santa Margarita, who had adopted the dog from the 
group about four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization alleged that Pommerening violated Dylan's adoption contract 
by giving him up to the Orange County Animal Shelter without its permission. 
Pommerening said, however, that she was forced to quarantine the dog there for 
several days after she told her veterinarian that Dylan had bitten a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of filing the lawsuit, which also named the shelter as a 
defendant, the organization won a temporary court order Wednesday preventing 
any harm to the dog. In the end, however, the order wasn't necessary because 
Pommerening voluntarily returned the dog to the organization after learning 
Hemopet intended to sue her. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, Dylan was back at his former home at the organization's Irvine 
kennel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's happy. He's wagging his tail. He's a pretty wonderful dog," said 
veterinarian Jean Dodds, who founded Hemopet in 1991 and will care for the 
5-year-old greyhound. 
</P>
<P>
 Pommerening said the whole episode has been painful. She said she and her 
10-year-old son adore Dylan, but the dog has serious behavioral problems and 
tore up her home when they were not there. After consulting several 
veterinarians and trying to train him, Pommerening said she believed the dog 
could never live in a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Pommerening said she concluded it would be more humane to put Dylan to sleep, 
rather than send him to a kennel for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We totally adored him," she said. "It just about broke my heart to see him 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Pommerening said she took Dylan to a veterinarian to have him destroyed, but 
when she volunteered that the dog had bitten a child on Thanksgiving Day -- an 
incident she described as a minor "nip" -- the veterinarian was required by law 
to have Dylan quarantined. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodds said Pommerening had no right to destroy Dylan under the adoption 
contract. "We have a responsibility to them," she said. "I made a commitment to 
benefit them for the rest of their lives."  
</P>
<P>
 Dodds' organization is one of several in Southern California that rescues 
various purebred dogs such as poodles, Dobermans and collies from shelters, 
then tracks the people who adopt them to ensure the animals are well treated.  
</P>
<P>
 Hemopet's blood bank arm serves more than 600 veterinary hospitals and 
emergency centers. The greyhounds obtained by the group from out-of-state 
racetracks are used as blood donors for as long as a year, then become eligible 
for adoptions through the group's Pet Life-Line arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodds said about 40 hounds have been adopted through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "These animals made a contribution to save others," she said. "They are very 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Maitlen, director of Orange County Animal Control, said shelter workers 
always contact rescue groups whenever attempts to find an owner for a stray 
purebred fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always our goal to get the animal back into a home," she said. "The 
(rescue groups) are just fabulous. . . . We're just thrilled they are out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodds said it was chance that she learned Tuesday about Dylan's plight. When a 
woman seeking to adopt a greyhound mentioned spotting one with unusual 
blue-gray coloring at the county animal shelter, Dodds said she knew the dog 
had to be Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday morning, Dodds' husband, a patent attorney, had prepared a 
lawsuit and a Superior Court judge was able to hear the couple's request for a 
temporary restraining order.

 MOVE OVER, BILL? Alicia Cooke, who is 12, decided her message had to go 
straight to the top. So the Fountain Valley seventh-grader wrote President 
Clinton a blistering letter -- via e-mail -- about the economy: "I'm just a kid 
but I know that if the U.S. is ruined financially now, what chance will we have 
when I'm President?" . . . Clinton -- or someone in the White House for him -- 
responded: "I'm glad that young Americans like you are taking an interest." No 
mention of Alicia's plans to take his job.

WOMAN HURT, TRAPPED IN CRASH; ACCIDENT: RESCUERS WITH A HYDRAULIC DEVICE PRY 
THE CRITICALLY INJURED VICTIM FROM WRECKAGE AFTER 20 MINUTES. POLICE ARREST MAN 
THEY SAY WAS OTHER DRIVER ON HIT-RUN CHARGE.

 A badly injured woman was trapped in her car for 20 minutes Thursday after 
being hit head-on by a pickup truck driver who then fled but was later 
arrested, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident at 7:30 a.m. snarled traffic for more than two hours on Sand 
Canyon Avenue east of the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Fernando Vega, 22, of Orange, was traveling west on Sand Canyon when the 
driver in front of him suddenly stopped, causing Vega to slam on his brakes and 
careen into the eastbound lane, colliding with a car driven by Sonia Todaro, 
according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Todaro, 20, of Tustin, suffered broken legs, a broken arm, a broken jaw and 
internal injuries. A helicopter was summoned to airlift Todaro, who was rescued 
by firefighters using hydraulic equipment. She was trapped for about 20 minutes 
in her Ford Festiva, according to CHP Officer Angel Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was pushed back into her lap and the car was just molded around 
her body," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Todaro was being rescued, Vega and two passengers in the Ford pickup 
truck fled into an orange grove north of the Sand Canyon Avenue, CHP Officer K. 
Keul said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mark Sauerwein, a vehicle mechanic for the Irvine Police 
Department, made a detour toward the accident scene after hearing over the 
police scanner that three suspects were being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could provide an extra set of eyes and ears," Sauerwein said 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauerwein met Irvine Police Sgt. Jeff Love at the orange grove and the two 
circled the area in their vehicles, looking through the rows of trees. As they 
approached each other at the far west portion of the grove, Sauerwein said he 
saw a man crouching behind a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I saw him scurrying from tree to tree," he said. "So I looked to the 
officer and pointed in the direction of the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Love then several times ordered the man to surrender. After a few minutes, the 
man later identified as Vega appeared with his hands up over his head, 
according to Keul. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, Keul said. He remains in 
the Orange County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Todaro was in critical condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana after 
undergoing surgery for the removal of her spleen and part of her liver, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, whom authorities say was not speeding, was convicted of driving without 
a license twice in July, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles.

GIVEAWAYS ARE CONTROVERSIAL ON AIDS DAY 
</P>

<P>
 Five hours into their mission to spread AIDS awareness across Orange County, 
two small bands of activists marking World AIDS Day had an offer for University 
High School students returning to the campus from lunch Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want some condoms?" they asked surprised students who were driving 
into the high school parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The condom distribution was one small, but controversial, part of the seventh 
annual World AIDS Day, now commemorated in more than 180 countries. In Orange 
County, Laguna Beach decorated parking meters with red ribbons inscribed with 
the names of AIDS victims. A community center in Santa Ana unveiled an AIDS 
mural and churches held candlelight masses. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's events ended with a candlelight vigil at UC Irvine, where families 
dedicated panels stitched for the AIDS quilt. About 350 people attended the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most controversial part of the day's activities was created by 25 
volunteers from the AIDS Response Program, part of the Gay and Lesbian 
Community Services Center of Orange County, which receives state funding for 
AIDS education activities. 
</P>
<P>
 They visited about a dozen schools throughout the day in an effort to raise 
student awareness about the dangers of sex in the age of AIDS. The activists 
did not go onto school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad they don't give instructions with these," said a University High 
School student after he grabbed a handful of the prophylactics from a blue 
plastic bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the activists had received permits from the 12 cities they visited, 
some high school principals were as surprised as their students that condoms 
were being distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of underage students here and I think those are choices young 
people need to make with their parents," said University High School Principal 
Diana Schmelzer. "We have a real concern about AIDS, but I don't think much 
education can be done on street corners." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials exchanged a few heated words with the AIDS activists at 
University High, but the group was not asked to leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second consecutive year the activists have traveled to public 
schools and shopping centers on World AIDS Day. By early afternoon, their most 
heated confrontation of the day was outside a Target store in Westminster, 
where shopping center security officers asked them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want us there, even though we had permission," said Leigh 
Richards, program coordinator for Youth Education Services, a division of the 
AIDS Response Program. "We decided there were plenty of other shopping 
centers." 
</P>
<P>
 Richards and others passed out "Compassion Kits" tied to the strings of red 
balloons that included letters and artwork by children who are infected with 
the AIDS virus or have a family member with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 University High School student Mirit Shoham, 16, said most students at her 
school are sexually active but not overly concerned about AIDS. "The people who 
are sexually active aren't worried about anything," Shoham said. 
</P>
<P>
 But student Robert Bright, 17, said the students he knows at University High 
are scared they will contract AIDS. "Most of my friends who are going through a 
sexual relationship practice safe sex," Bright said. "It's mostly 
boyfriend-girlfriend type of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent national survey of 11,000 high school-age youths, 54% 
said they were sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
 About one in five reported AIDS cases is diagnosed among people in their 20s, 
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But 
because the virus often has a 10-year incubation period, researchers say most 
who have AIDS in their 20s were infected as adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ocean View High School in Huntington Beach, where activists passed out 
condoms and AIDS literature outside school grounds, acting Principal Karen 
Gilden said the classroom is the best place for AIDS education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to provide an environment at our school that allows kids to find out 
about things that go on in the world," Gilden said. "It's also appropriate for 
parents to know when their children are given information." 
</P>
<P>
 But AIDS activist Mykle Parker, who spent most of the day inflating many of 
the 3,000 red helium balloons passed out to students, said too many parents 
close their eyes to their children's sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are in denial to the fact that children are sexually active," said 
Parker, who speaks to high school students for the AIDS Response Program. "They 
don't want to acknowledge it."

 Finding a jolly, fat and white-bearded man to play the role of St. Nick is not 
easy, according to Kim Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to enjoy working with kids, and they have to be able to convince 
kids they are Santa," said Wood, coordinator for the city's Rent-A-Santa 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood is holding auditions in search of Santas to participate in the 
Rent-A-Santa program. Santa visits will be available from Dec. 9 to 23. Visits 
will be scheduled Wednesdays through Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said that those selected must not only look and act the part but also be 
punctual, be in good health and pass a security background check. 
</P>
<P>
 Those chosen to play the role of Santa Claus will make 15-minute visits to 
homes and may make special appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular program faced cancellation this Christmas season -- a casualty of 
the city's budget woes. But after an outcry by residents wanting the 
Rent-A-Santa program, the city relented. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of complaints. People were upset," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santas get paid $7.32 per 15-minute visit. Santa's elves -- people who will 
drive Santa to his visits -- are also needed. Elves get paid $7.32 an hour. The 
city will provide the costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for Santa visits is $15 for a 15-minute visit with as many as five 
children. Visits will be scheduled between 3 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in playing Santa or an elf or residents wanting to schedule a 
visit can call (714) 536-5486. The deadline to submit a Santa application is 
Wednesday.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SHARING JOY, PRIDE THROUGH HIS ART

<P>
 Simon Silva describes his childhood as short and often painful, filled with 
domestic violence and long days toiling in the strawberry fields of Holtville, 
Calif., often missing months of school. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Silva draws on those experiences to create stunning paintings, 
including portraits of life on the state's farms and ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the works contain surprisingly little of the frustration and hopelessness 
Silva says he felt growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his art celebrates tenderness, joy and pride in his Latino heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 During visits to Santa Ana and Valley high schools Thursday, the Mexicali-born 
artist spoke with hundreds of students to emphasize the importance of education 
and fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Use your experiences, negative or positive, and make them of use to you," 
Silva told a group at Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, who now lives in San Bernardino, said that through dance, music, 
painting and other fine arts, students can express themselves and gain 
self-esteem, adding that, "If you have something to say, people are going to 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva urged students to stay focused on education regardless of what peers or 
family members might say. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that his parents opposed his paying for school when he could have 
been making money working in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't bad enough that I wanted to go to school but that I wanted to go 
into art. My parents couldn't understand why I wasn't going into something more 
worthwhile, like becoming a doctor or lawyer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now an internationally known painter, Silva, 33, has artwork on display in 
Russia and other spots around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Audyra Mendez, 14, said she was impressed with Silva's message. "It pays to go 
to school. You might not like it now, but what you do comes back to you" and 
improves your life, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva's work will be on display tonight at 7 at Martinez Books and Art, 220 W.

 Polakoff Honored for Board Efforts 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Polakoff, who served as a school board member for four years, was 
recently honored for his work with the Los Alamitos Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 16 COLLEGE STUDENTS SHOW EXPOSURE TO TB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixteen Golden West College students have tested positive for exposure to the 
bacteria that causes tuberculosis, college officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were conducted this week on classmates of a former student who had 
active TB.The student left school about five weeks ago to begin in-home 
isolation treatment for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials estimate that about 100 students had attended four classes 
with the infected student since August. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Health Officer Hugh Stallworth said testing positive in a skin 
test is "not necessarily a big deal" because many people who are exposed to TB 
do not go on to develop the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in a separate case at Golden West College in 1993, 55 students 
were exposed and were given skin tests. Twenty-two of those students had 
positive skin tests, but none had the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said the next step would be for the students to get chest X-rays to 
determine if they have active TB. They might receive other follow-up 
examinations and will be offered preventive medications if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 TB is spread through the air when a person with infectious TB in the lungs 
coughs, sneezes, laughs or sings. While anyone can develop TB, those in close 
contact with the infectious person for a prolonged period of time are at 
greatest risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West College President Philip Westin said administrators are 
considering a variety of options, including requiring a TB skin test for 
first-time students. 
</P>
<P>
 For students who did not attend the screenings this week, the college will 
offer free skin tests to current Golden West students or employees on Tuesday 
and Wednesday. An appointment and student or staff identification card is 
required. GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITY MAY TOUGHEN HOME WORKPLACE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your home can be your castle, but there may be stricter controls if you work 
for a living in that castle. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the message from the City Council, which announced that it will hold a 
public hearing Dec. 20 on increasing city controls over home occupations. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes to an existing city ordinance would, if approved, do the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit home occupation activities to not more than 400 square feet of a 
person's dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forbid "any light, noise, odor, dust, vibration, fumes or smoke that is 
readily discernible at the lot boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlaw "dispatching of persons, vehicles or equipment from the premises 
pursuant to the conduct of a home occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 * Place a limit on how much daily vehicle and pedestrian traffic will be 
allowed in and out of a home workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Fred Maley told the council that city staff had researched the 
existing Villa Park ordinance on home occupations and recommended the tougher 
additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Barry Denes said that unrestricted use of homes as workplaces could 
"adversely affect" property values for the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
 Denes added, "I think we're moving in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 City residents will be able to comment on the proposed changes at the Dec. 20 
meeting, which will be held at 7:30 p.m. in City Hall, 17855 Santiago Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting also will be a regular council session, moved up a week from its 
previous schedule because of the Christmas holiday. BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-four students from Tustin High School have earned college credits for 
scoring high in the annual advanced placement tests administered by the College 
Board to high school students across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's examinations were conducted in May, and the Tustin High students 
placed among the top 12% of the 459,000 students who took the test, according 
to Principal Bob Boies. 
</P>
<P>
 The College Board recognizes three levels of achievement based on results on 
the tests: AP Scholar With Distinction, AP Scholar With Honor and AP Scholar. 
The tests, each consisting of multiple-choice answers and essays, cover 16 
disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Barnes, Yu-Jung Chen and Christina Park each scored 3.5 points out of a 
possible 5 in five or more disciplines and won AP Scholar With Distinction 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other students scored an average of 3.25 in four or more AP disciplines 
and were named AP Scholars With Honor, while 14 students had grades of 3 or 
higher in three tests and were named AP Scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the AP Scholars was Noah Margolis, a junior, who will be eligible to 
take the tests again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,300 colleges and universities award a year of credit to students who 
score a 3-point average or higher. The credit allows a student to take a 
lighter load as a college freshman or enroll in more advanced courses. BERT

 Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange County, will be named Man of the 
Year this month because of his activism as a Latino advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens will honor 
David at an awards banquet Dec. 9 at the Grand Hotel, 7 Freedman Way in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 David is a longtime member of LULAC and numerous other Latino organizations, 
in which he helps promote awareness of Latino issues. He also serves as 
chairman of the Orange County Housing Corp., which provides resources for 
low-income families to buy homes. In addition, David serves on the Disneyland 
Community Service Award Committee, in which he helps select community activists 
to honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just amazed at the number of people who come to Amin for everything and 
anything they need, whether it's help on a fund-raiser or help with problems 
with police. People are there for Amin to help and he reaches out and helps 
them," said Rose Jurado, president of the LULAC chapter. "Someone like that, 
you have to show some kind of appreciation for." 
</P>
<P>
 David said he was glad the banquet in his honor would be used to raise money 
for scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very ill-at-ease to receive this award because it's with a tremendous 
degree of fulfillment that one does what one thinks has to be done," he said 
about his work. 
</P>
<P>
 The LULAC chapter has given the honor the past four years to men for their 
dedication to the Latino community. Other LULAC chapters in the county also 
honor people for their work. Santa Ana's chapter, for example, names a Woman of 
the Year and the Irvine chapter names an Educator of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to the banquet, which will begin at 6:30 p.m. Tickets 
are $30 per person. To reserve seats, call Jurado at (714) 630-1678.MIMI KO

 Samson, the pool-hopping black bear, won't have to trespass to take a dip when 
he moves to his new home at the Orange County Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new digs, the 400-pound bear will have his run of a scratching tree, a 
waterfall and, of course, a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Fish and Game officials said Thursday that Samson, who was 
captured in Monrovia in September, will be permanently housed at the zoo. He 
will be moved in about four months, department spokesman Jeff Weir said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samson spent his summer lumbering in a rustic Monrovia neighborhood, stealing 
avocados, soaking in hot tubs, even stopping by regularly at one family's back 
patio to watch television through the glass door. 
</P>
<P>
 He was captured and was to have been killed until he won a last-minute stay of 
execution from Gov. Pete Wilson after the neighborhood in which he roamed all 
summer mobilized to save him. 
</P>
<P>
 The bear was staying at a Rancho Cordova Fish and Game facility in Northern 
California until officials could find him a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Weir said that the Orange County Zoo, which is part of Irvine Regional Park, 
had been a top contender for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past month and a half, our attitude has been: If you build it, he 
will come," Weir said, referring to the $100,000 bear pen that will be built 
for Samson. LISA O'NEILL

 The unincorporated community of North Tustin still retains a pastoral, sedate 
atmosphere that harkens back to the area's quiet history of citrus farming.

 Bordered by the cities of Tustin and Orange, North Tustin is characterized by 
winding, tree-lined streets and green rolling hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A move to incorporate was launched by residents in 1991, but their bid was 
denied in early 1992 by the Local Agency Formation Commission. LAFCO said the 
bedroom community of 25,000 people didn't have the sales tax base to support 
cityhood.

 A 25-year-old Newport Beach resident was fatally injured Thursday when his 
motorcycle crashed into a stalled car on MacArthur Boulevard at Newport Coast 
Drive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's name was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Scott Cade said the stalled car was in a traffic lane. Before 
officers arrived, three minor, rear-end collisions occurred as cars tried to 
avoid the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 As the drivers were exchanging information on the shoulder of MacArthur at 
1:15 p.m., the motorcycle struck the rear of the stalled car, which was still 
in the traffic lane, Cade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcyclist died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.

 Police said he had been wearing a helmet, but it apparently had not been

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; WRENCH FOUND MAY BE MURDER WEAPON

 A wrench believed to have been used in the killings of three family members 
was found by a homeless woman two days after the murders occurred, law 
enforcement officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tool was discovered Nov. 8 in a trash bin in the 1800 block of West 
Commonwealth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 It was marked with a distinctive symbol that police say matches the one used 
by suspect Edward Charles III, a gas station mechanic, to identify his tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The symbol looked like it was hand-done with an etching tool," Los Angeles 
Sheriff's Sgt. Curtis Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the same as the symbol on the tools we found in his toolbox at work," 
Boyer said. "If it does indeed have the victims' blood, that's a strong 
indication" that it could be the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials described the symbol as a circle with a curved line through it, with 
a dot on either side of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles was arrested Nov. 8 and charged with killing his parents, Edward 
Charles II and Dolores Charles, and his brother, Danny Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Their bodies were discovered Nov. 7 in a burning car in the parking lot of a 
La Mirada continuation school. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the father and brother were bludgeoned. Danny Charles was also 
stabbed and choked, and Dolores Charles showed signs of having been choked, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles pleaded not guilty to the charges in a hearing this week and is being 
held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrench and several other items were found by LeAnn Pollaccia in a trash 
bin, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollaccia took the wrench, two necklaces and a pair of sunglasses. After 
finding out that a mechanic had been arrested in connection with the murders, 
Pollaccia turned the items over to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollaccia told police the dumpster also contained some clothes, towels and a 
blue bucket, all of which appeared to be stained with blood, and a pair of 
prescription sunglasses. When police went to the dumpster, the other items were 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer said sheriff's deputies showed the recovered items to Dolores Charles' 
father, but he could not identify them as belonging to either the victims or 
the suspect, his grandson. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

PAROLEE CHECKED IN ATTACK ON KNOTT'S KIN; CRIME: TEEN-AGER REMAINS IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION AT ESCONDIDO HOSPITAL AFTER BEING BLUDGEONED LAST TUESDAY.

 The 17-year-old great-granddaughter of the Knott's Berry Farm founder clung to 
life Thursday in a San Diego County hospital, while investigators questioned a 
prison parolee who lives in the semi-rural neighborhood of Fallbrook where 
Desire Anderson was bludgeoned early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at every possible motive," San Diego County Sheriff's Detective 
Al Collier said at a news conference held by the girl's family. "Everything 
that looks like a possible lead, we will explore." 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Knott, the girl's grandmother, tearfully pleaded for anyone with 
information to come forward. The family on Wednesday offered a $10,000 reward, 
hoping to produce a break in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He, she, whatever, has to be found," Knott said. "Whoever did this has to be 
mentally deranged. . . . I can't think of who would hammer a girl's head like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 An assailant apparently entered the family home in the 4400 block of La Canada 
through an unlocked sliding glass door to the mother's bedroom, then walked 
into the girl's bedroom, said Sheriff's Lt. Doug Clements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the unidentified parolee was interviewed, authorities said they still 
have no suspect in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not ruled out anybody," Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother, Diane Anderson, told deputies she heard someone in her 
daughter's bedroom who then fled when she called out to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Desire, a Fallbrook High School honors student who wants to be a forensic 
doctor, underwent emergency surgery Thursday morning as physicians sought to 
reduce brain swelling caused by the attack. She remains listed in critical 
condition, said a spokeswoman at Palomar Memorial Hospital in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet neighborhood where the attack occurred sits in a small valley dotted 
with horse stables and avocado groves. 
</P>
<P>
 On a fence at the rear of the Anderson family's four-acre ranch is a sign 
warning "No Trespassing Violators Will Be Executed." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Nash, a neighbor, said the attack has prompted him to let his dog sleep 
indoors for added protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't wait until they catch whoever it is so I can relax," said Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 About five miles north at Fallbrook High, students and faculty were still 
groping to understand the incident. Desire has been described by family, 
friends and acquaintances as mature, bright and pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody I've talked to, they can't think of anything in the world that 
would have caused this," said Becky Kvikstad, a French teacher for whom Desire 
is a teaching assistant. "It doesn't make sense."

L.A. LAW SCHOOL CONSIDERS MOVE TO O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In an effort to expand classroom and library size, Whittier College Law School 
trustees are considering moving their campus from Los Angeles to Orange County, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County seems to be the best option," said John FitzRandolph, the law 
school's dean. 
</P>
<P>
 The 690-student law school, now in posh Hancock Park in Los Angeles, is 
seeking to double its space, FitzRandolph said. Its current building has about 
60,000 square feet, but the school would like to have about 120,000 to 160,000 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 If the college moved to Orange County, it would be the first school here to be 
approved by the American Bar Assn. There are currently six such approved law 
schools in Los Angeles County, including Whittier College's campus.  
</P>
<P>
 FitzRandolph said easy automobile access is important to night students, so 
college officials have examined a handful of possible sites easily accessible 
by freeway, including office space in Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and Irvine. About a 
third of the students attend night courses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whittier trustees are pondering the move less than three months after 
Chapman University officials announced they will begin their own law school in 
the county and will seek ABA accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University expects its first classes to begin with six full-time and 
four part-time professors in late August, 1995. If Whittier College's law 
school decides to move to Orange County, its classes might begin as early as 
fall, 1995, but the following fall is a more likely target date, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population is large enough to support either two or three ABA law 
schools" in Orange County, said Jeremy Miller, dean of Chapman's law school. 
"Most importantly, we have some innovations, which will attract different kinds 
of students than those at Whittier." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County already has a popular law school: Western State University 
College of Law. While Western State is approved by the state bar, it does not 
have ABA accreditation. Such accreditation is often difficult and 
time-consuming to obtain and depends on such factors as library size and the 
number of full-time professors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no concentration of 2.5 million people in this country without an 
ABA (accredited) law school," FitzRandolph said, noting that in the past Loyola 
Law School and UC Irvine both considered establishing law schools in Orange 
County but decided "it wasn't in the cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees have been examining the possibility of moving out of Los Angeles for 
about four years, FitzRandolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is by no means a done deal. At the college's October board meeting, 
trustees ordered a study to determine the cost of moving to Orange County. The 
report is due back by February. A decision on whether to move could be made at 
the next board meeting in February or possibly earlier, FitzRandolph said.

TALKS, EVENTS MARK AIDS TOLL ON ARTISTIC COMMUNITY 
</P>

 AIDS has become as familiar to ballet as sweat and sore toes. While dancers 
can't avoid the elbow grease, some teens here learned Thursday, they can avoid 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Rancho Alamitos High School saw performances by the Coast Ballet 
Theatre troupe, between which was a frank talk about AIDS. The event at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum was one of several staged locally for Day Without 
Art, an annual observance drawing attention to the many artists felled by the 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Rosenberg, who co-directs the San Clemente troupe, discussed the 
virus that has claimed ballet star Rudolf Nureyev, actor Rock Hudson and rocker 
Freddie Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really tragic about it, is that it is avoidable," Rosenberg said. 
While condoms aren't fail-safe protection against the "death sentence," he 
said, sexual abstinence can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's easy for me to stand up here and say 'Don't have sex,' " said the 
long-married father of three. "Just stay aware and stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's sixth annual Day Without Art was one of Orange County's busiest 
such commemorations. UC Irvine's School of Fine Arts mounted a half-dozen 
AIDS-related activities, and 10 major arts organizations, all volunteering 
their time, collaborated on a music, dance and theater performance at the 
Irvine Barclay Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Although organizers had hoped to fill the 750-seat Barclay theater, the event 
attracted about 400. 
</P>
<P>
 But Timothy B. Dunn, an organizer, said: "The point of the evening is a 
commemoration of our artists, our colleagues and our friends, not just 
numbers."  
</P>
<P>
 Day Without Art was launched in 1989 by Visual AIDS, a New York activist 
group, to coincide with the United Nation's annual World AIDS Day. Worldwide, 
some 6,200 arts institutions were expected to take part Thursday, either 
through special exhibits or shows or by draping sculptures or dimming gallery 
lights, gestures meant to symbolize the irrevocable void that AIDS has left. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, more than 3,500 county residents have contracted AIDS and 2,071 of 
them have died, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency. Worldwide, 
18 million people are HIV positive and every 24 hours, 6,000 more people are 
added to that list, said Jay Fournier, the Laguna Beach Community Clinic's 
social and community services coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the Orange County arts community has become more involved in Day 
Without Art," said Fournier, representing one of 10 AIDS service organizations 
collecting donations at the Barclay theater.

MAN ARRESTED IN FATAL BAR SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tustin man talking on his cellular phone to a police dispatcher ignored her 
plea Thursday night and fatally shot another man who was fighting with a woman 
outside a bar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Allan Steeps, 34, called police at 7:10 p.m. from outside the Pump Room 
Bar, in the 1500 block of West Chapman Avenue, said Lt. Timm Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that a male and female were involved in some sort of fight and he 
announced that he was going to shoot the male," Browne said. "Our dispatchers 
told him that he was not trained to do that. We told him it was not necessary 
and to relax and be a good witness." 
</P>
<P>
 As police were on their way, Steeps fired, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took it into his own hands," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the gunman, the victim and the woman had all been drinking inside 
the bar, but Steep did not know the other two. Browne said the man and woman 
had been arguing over which one was too drunk to drive, and the man had smashed 
a window of the car the woman was sitting in. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Alan Graham, 39, of Whittier, was shot in the head by a round fired 
from a large-caliber handgun, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steeps was still holding a gun when police arrived, he said. He was arrested 
on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't encourage anyone to take this kind of action on their own," Browne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always the potential that they could misjudge a situation. It would 
appear that the circumstances were not what Steeps perceived them to be. 
Alcohol impairs your judgment."

JUDGE REJECTS PROPERTY NEGLIGENCE APPEAL

<P>
 A Superior Court judge Thursday rejected the appeal of a Huntington Harbour 
woman whose neighbors had won a record $90,575 judgment, claiming the trash on 
her property created a vermin infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge C. Robert Jameson upheld the small-claims court decision and increased 
the judgment against Elena Zagustin, an engineering professor on leave from Cal 
State Long Beach, to $110,000 plus more than $6,000 in attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first such case in Orange County to be upheld on appeal and opens 
the door to other county residents who want to join forces to win large 
judgments against negligent property owners, attorneys and neighbors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It provides an avenue for homeowners in terms of abating these types of 
nuisance conditions," said attorney Nelson Cohen, who represented the 22 
neighbors who had sued Zagustin. "It empowers citizens to take action and 
recognize that a change can be affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin, who could not be reached for comment, had denied many of her 
neighbors' allegations, contending she had cleaned up her property. Her 
attorney, Dale Peroutka, labeled the suit "harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was unfair to blame her for all the ills of the neighborhood," 
Peroutka said. "It is clear her neighbors don't like her." 
</P>
<P>
 In banding together to sue a negligent property owner, residents used a novel 
tactic that was pioneered in Oakland by a group called Safe Streets Now!. In 
Oakland, the strategy was used primarily to pressure landlords into evicting 
drug-selling tenants and to crackdown on slum lords. It has only recently 
reached Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighbors testified that Zagustin, who is in her late 50s, had caused 
them emotional harm by hoarding rubbish, making noises in the night, abusing 
her cats and contributing to an odor problem and rat and possum infestation in 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents said they were afraid to let their children play in their back yards 
because of the threat of disease from the vermin. Others complained that the 
value of their homes, which averaged $450,000, was hurt by Zagustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors also presented Zagustin's Huntington Beach code enforcement file, 
the fattest in city history, including records of 21 inspections of her house, 
four criminal complaints and a lawsuit filed by the city that was settled in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 The small claims court judgment against her was the largest in the county's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana community activist Jim Walker, who has been trained in the Safe 
Streets Now! methods and helped the neighbors with this case, said the ruling 
signals residents that they now have a powerful legal tool to make changes in 
their neighborhoods.

 A federal grand jury Thursday returned an indictment against operators of an 
independent study program targeting dropouts that allegedly bilked the Los 
Angeles Unified School District out of more than $700,000 by claiming far more 
students than were actually enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-count indictment -- on charges of conspiracy, federal program fraud and 
mail fraud -- was issued against Arnese Clemon, former director of the 
Institute for Successful Living Inc., and Dewey Hughes, a consultant who helped 
hire teachers and manage the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, which operated from 1989 to 1991, had a contract with the 
school district to provide flexible tutoring and home study assignments for 
students who had been expelled, had dropped out or were at risk of dropping 
out.  
</P>
<P>
 The district paid the program a set amount per student. Program officials 
claimed to the district that their enrollment more than doubled, from 163 
students to 330 students, over two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemon and Hughes are accused of a complicated ruse under which they allegedly 
solicited students to sign up for classes, then arranged for teachers to sign 
those names to work completion reports, even though the students had never done 
the work. Those reports were allegedly forwarded to the district for funding.  
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, they are charged with advertising teaching openings, 
interviewing teachers and copying their credentials, then never hiring them but 
using those credentials to support their claims of growing student enrollment. 
Under the independent study regulations, programs must have one teacher for 
every 30 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they were doing was grossly inflating the number of students who were 
doing work at the school and . . . by doing that obviously enriching themselves 
quite a bit," said Mark D. Flanagan, the assistant U.S. attorney assigned to 
the case. "They scammed the school district out of a lot of money, but the real 
victims are the students who really wanted to do work." 
</P>
<P>
 A tip to the state attorney general's office launched the two-year 
investigation leading to Thursday's indictments. The inquiry was conducted 
jointly by a variety of agencies, including the FBI and the state attorney 
general's office, which issued the initial search warrant in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemon had previously described the investigation as the result of a vendetta 
against her and the program, but neither she nor Hughes could be reached for 
comment on Thursday. They are scheduled be arraigned Dec. 19. If convicted, 
they face maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and a $5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators declined to comment on where the money had gone, but state 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert M. Snider said he would not rule out the possibility 
that some of it could be recouped. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records filed to support the 1992 search warrant allege that Clemon 
might have skimmed more than $70,000 from the institute for her brother, U.W. 
Clemon, who was previously a member of the institute's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 U.W. Clemon, a U.S. district judge in Birmingham, Ala., said Thursday that the 
money was paid to him for rental of the institute's headquarters. He said he 
had not been contacted by investigators and had not heard from his sister 
recently. "I don't know anything about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snider and Flanagan said the investigation is continuing and could lead to 
further indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns over the investigation of the institute helped lead the Los Angeles 
school district to begin its own independent study program. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do hindsight on this, I would say that it shows that if you're going 
to have these kinds of operations, you've got to have the ability to monitor 
them," said Supt. Sid Thompson, who as deputy superintendent was responsible 
for independent study program when the investigation began.  
</P>
<P>
 "The difficulty in a big bureaucracy like this is you have trouble monitoring 
yourself, not to mention anyone else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district did its own audit of the program in 1991, which questioned 
more than $300,000 in charges. But follow-up interviews with Clemons found 
justification for all but $11,000 of that money, according to Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Thompson attributed the problems to poor record-keeping. "We 
found nothing back then that (showed) there was any deliberate attempt to 
subvert funds from the district," he said in a 1992 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, Thompson pointed out that the audit results caused the 
district to stop funding the institute. He described the indictment contents as 
"disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the victim in this thing and that's never fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a former Los Angeles Unified administrator in charge of the outside 
independent study programs said the indictments should have included Thompson 
and then-administrative consultant Barry Mostovoy for failing to act more 
quickly to shut down the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you have to do is look at the audits in '89-'90 and '90-'91 and you know 
that the district's own auditors pointed out problems," said Donald Martin, who 
has claimed he was demoted to a counselor for blowing the whistle on the 
institute. Martin sued the district, but his lawsuit was dismissed earlier this 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 "The program wasn't (discontinued) and the question is, why?" he said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the district's teachers union, Helen Bernstein, said she also 
was disappointed that Los Angeles Unified had not been held accountable in 
Thursday's indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein and several others interviewed compared the institute situation to 
that of Edutrain, a Downtown charter school for dropouts that is embroiled in 
controversy for overestimating enrollment. However, no allegations of 
intentional wrongdoing have been made against Edutrain.

MOURNERS REMEMBER RUBIN FOR HIS COURAGE AND DEDICATION; FUNERAL: MORE THAN 200 
ATTEND SERVICES FOR CO-FOUNDER OF YIPPIES. FRIENDS PRAISE HIM FOR HIS 
ENTHUSIASM FOR ANTI-WAR CAUSES AND HIS BUSINESS ACUMEN.

<P>
 More than 200 friends from a lifetime that ranged from the ragged anti-war 
street demonstrations of the 1960s to the penthouse luxury of network marketing 
in the 1990s turned out in Culver City on Thursday to honor the memory of Jerry 
Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rubin -- as described by several of the mourners -- was "always in a 
hurry," those who gathered to pay their final respects at Hillside Memorial 
cemetery were not. Their eulogies, which offered contrasts in style, lasted for 
more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 People such as Eldridge Cleaver, Stu Albert and Sally Kirkland fondly recalled 
the raucous demonstrations of the wild Yippie years while fellow health drink 
distributors from Rubin's subsequent incarnation as a businessman extolled his 
virtues as a capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
 After a former lover and his former wife talked at length about their 
relationships with him, his most recent girlfriend took the microphone to 
describe hers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were tears, and there was laughter. And when the talking was done, the 
pallbearers -- among them fellow Chicago Seven defendant Tom Hayden, now a 
Democratic state senator from Santa Monica -- carried Jerry Rubin's body from 
the chapel and laid him to rest on a grassy, sun-drenched slope. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, 56, died of cardiac arrest late Monday at UCLA Medical Center, two 
weeks after he was struck by a car while jaywalking in front of his luxury 
Brentwood home on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's funeral came 25 years after the Chicago Seven trial that riveted 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin -- who several years earlier had co-founded the rebellious Youth 
International Party, better known as the Yippies -- and four other anti-war 
protesters, among them Hayden, were convicted of crossing state lines with 
intent to foment the rioting that took place at the 1968 Democratic National 
Convention in Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
 Although their convictions were overturned, the protesters' wild activities 
came to symbolize the civil disobedience of the 1960s.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, because of the anniversary, several of Rubin's associates from 
those years -- Yippie co-founder Paul Krassner and fellow Chicago defendants 
David Dellinger and Bobby Seale -- were busy with commemorative activities in 
New York and unable to attend Thursday's services. But fellow Yippie Stu Albert 
-- whose associations with Rubin reached back to the student demonstrations at 
UC Berkeley -- was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert told how -- after being summoned to testify before the now infamous 
House Un-American Activities Committee -- an uncowed Rubin showed up in the 
uniform of a soldier in the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "They threw him out," Albert said. "He was probably the first person ever to 
be dragged out of a HUAC hearing, begging to testify." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry taught me to stand up for what I believe in," said Kirkland, an actress 
who appeared in such films as "The Sting," "Private Benjamin" and "Anna" after 
working with Rubin in the Yippie cause. "He was my lover, he was my friend, he 
was my teacher, he was my revolutionary mentor." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland said that in honor of Rubin's campaign to get a hog elected 
president, she rode a pig in the nude in one of her movie scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver, a former Black Panther party leader who served a prison term for 
attempted murder before joining the Black Muslim movement, called Rubin a 
"symbol for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciated him," Cleaver said. "I loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The years after the Chicago Seven trial did nothing to curb Rubin's enthusiasm 
and energy, but they did alter his orientation. He changed from Yippie to 
yuppie, and by 1980, the man who had once protested capitalism by dumping 
dollar bills on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange had joined the 
brokerage firm of John Muir & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "He realized that America was the greatest country on earth," said his former 
wife, Mimi Fleischman, who attended the funeral with their daughter, Juliette, 
7, and son, Adam, 5. "He realized that capitalism is the greatest system on 
earth. He helped many, many people make money and have good lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "He changed costumes, he changed rhetoric, but he never changed his heart," 
Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Rubin became an independent salesman for a Dallas-based firm -- 
Life Extension International. The firm distributes products such as "Wow!" 
"Focus" and "Be Your Best" -- beverage powders that are marketed as nutritional 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a force, a leader," said Ron Caskey, a distributor for the firm. "He 
had a lot of ideas. He brought in Jack LaLanne. Jerry was one of the top three 
money-earners in the company." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry always wanted to get there quicker," said actress Tiffany Statner, who 
said Rubin asked her to marry him shortly before his accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the love of my life," she said. "He turned out to be my hero."

SIMPSON TEAM PLANS TO CURTAIL COMMENT; TRIAL: SHAPIRO SAYS HE WILL STOP DAILY 
MEDIA BRIEFINGS IN EFFORT TO END FEUD WITH VICTIMS' FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seeking to end a bitter war of words with the families of murder victims 
Ronald Lyle Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson, a lawyer for O.J. Simpson said 
Thursday that the defense team will curtail public comments and asked others 
close to the case to join him in taking "the high road." 
</P>
<P>
 As he arrived for court Thursday morning, attorney Robert L. Shapiro said: "In 
the spirit of trying to accomplish what we all want, we will take the high 
road. We no longer will be talking to the press on a daily basis. We will 
comment when we think it's necessary. We hope everyone else will take the high 
road with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Brown, Nicole Brown Simpson's father, said his family welcomes Shapiro's 
suggestion and pledged to abide by it as long as the defense does so. He and 
Goldman's father had said Wednesday that their recent comments have been 
prompted largely by their frustration with the defense team's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome his offer, if you will, his throwing out the white flag, a truce, 
that he will refrain from some of the things that have ticked us in the past, 
and we will respect that and, hopefully, we will never see any more of it," 
Brown said. "Then if we do, all bets are off. That, of course, would include 
(comments from) any of his defense team." 
</P>
<P>
 The statements by the two men came after several days of public feuding 
between Simpson's defense team and the families of the two people slashed and 
stabbed to death June 12. Family members have become increasingly assertive in 
recent days, publicly stating that they believe Simpson is guilty despite his 
not guilty plea and his attorneys' fierce protestations of the football Hall of 
Famer's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Shapiro and Simpson attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. accused the 
district attorney's office of orchestrating the verbal attacks on Simpson, a 
claim that was denied by the victims' fathers and by prosecutors. After the 
families reacted angrily to that accusation, Shapiro sought to defuse the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Shapiro reiterated his sympathy for the Goldman and Brown 
families and said both sides had contributed to the "media madness" that has 
enveloped the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for a change," Shapiro said, adding that defense attorneys will 
only speak to reporters outside the courthouse when events demand some 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Brown, Nicole's outspoken sister, appeared on a television show 
Thursday night and reiterated many of the charges she has leveled against 
Simpson in recent days. But Lou Brown stressed that the program had been taped 
before Shapiro suggested that both sides scale back public comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't do anything about that," Brown said of his daughter's latest 
appearance. "We don't control canceling the show. That's the last one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside court, meanwhile, selection of alternate jurors continued to sputter, 
in part because of the families' recent media onslaught: Three of five 
panelists interviewed Thursday said they had seen or heard of the comments by 
the victims' families implicating Simpson in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 One, a 40-year-old mail carrier from Whittier, said he had heard a radio 
report referring to Goldman's father. Another said he had heard Denise Brown 
say that her sister's life had been threatened by Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those prospects were excused. In fact, several hours of jury selection 
Thursday yielded just one potential alternate juror, and even her status was in 
doubt. That woman, a 54-year-old South-Central resident, said she recently had 
gained custody of five young grandchildren but nevertheless insisted that she 
could serve on the Simpson jury without a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Lance A. Ito seemed skeptical of that pledge, asking the woman to think 
about whether she could afford to be sequestered if he takes that step to 
protect the Simpson panel from receiving information about the case. Ito asked 
the woman to return to court next week after having pondered the possible 
hardship that a long sequestration might impose. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge and lawyers in the case have been trying to complete their 
one-on-one questioning of prospective alternate jurors so that an anticipated 
DNA hearing can begin Dec. 12 as scheduled. As the pace of jury selection has 
slowed this week, it has raised questions about whether that hearing may be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 A tussle between Ito and a counterpart in New York has further jeopardized the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Ito ordered one of Simpson's DNA lawyers, Peter Neufeld, to be 
in Los Angeles on Dec. 12 so that the hearing can begin on time. But Neufeld is 
under a court order imposed by New York Supreme Court Judge Harold Rothwax to 
appear for a trial there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the New York case, Neufeld had been scheduled to start Thursday, but 
Rothwax instead directed the attorney to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are, as you say, in a difficult position, but it's a difficult position 
of your own making," Rothwax told Neufeld. "If I had been told early that you 
wouldn't be available, then maybe we could have done something." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothwax was unmoved by Ito's decision to order Neufeld to be in Los Angeles on 
Dec. 12, calling his colleague's order inexplicable and accusing Ito of trying 
to impede the New York case. Rothwax said his order "precedes Judge Ito's 
order, and my order has priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld's lawyer, William Kunstler -- a nationally known civil rights attorney 
who, ironically, has been highly critical of Shapiro's handling of the Simpson 
case -- said he will ask a federal judge to overturn Rothwax's decision so that 
Neufeld can appear on Simpson's behalf in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler said he will ask a federal court today to impose a temporary 
restraining order on Rothwax's demand that Neufeld appear for that trial. That 
filing will include Ito's order as an exhibit, Kunstler said, adding that 
Simpson's right to effective assistance of counsel is being impaired by 
Rothwax's insistence that Neufeld appear for the New York trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While lawyers argued that issue on two coasts, they also gathered briefly in 
Ito's courtroom to sort out a set of questions involving Simpson's confinement 
at the Men's Central Jail. Some of those issues are being argued in a set of 
sealed motions, which prompted Ito to tour the jail earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side will say what those issues involve, but Simpson's attorneys in 
the past have raised a number of concerns about the conditions of their 
client's incarceration. Ito said he will hold a hearing Thursday on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Simpson's lawyers met with Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department officials in private Thursday to discuss visitation arrangements. 
After that meeting, they informed Ito that they had resolved that issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the Simpson case resumes today. So far, 38 possible 
alternate jurors have been identified. Ito is hoping to have at least 46 by 
early next week so that at least 15 will remain after both sides exercise 
peremptory challenges.

RAPIST FAILS MENTAL TEST, WON'T BE FREED; PRISONS: REGINALD MULDREW WILL TAKE 
EXAM AGAIN IN SIX MONTHS, OFFICIALS SAY. LAW SAYS HE MUST BE RELEASED IN A 
YEAR.

 Serial rapist Reginald Donald Muldrew, whose pending parole stirred tremendous 
protests by San Gabriel Valley residents, failed his psychiatric exam and will 
not be released from state prison as scheduled, state corrections officials 
said Thursday. He will probably remain in prison for at least six more months. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew becomes the sixth sex offender since March whose parole has been 
blocked by the inability to pass a last-minute psychiatric evaluation. 
Corrections officials have begun using the tactic in what some of them admit is 
a desperate attempt to keep offenders in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state's determinate sentencing law -- originally passed to keep 
judges from issuing lenient sentences -- prisoners must be let out of prison 
after a specific number of years. Muldrew, a suspect in 200 rapes in the Los 
Angeles area during the 1970s, has been in prison for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corrections officials said Muldrew, 46, known as the "pillowcase 
rapist" because he put pillowcases and similar pieces of cloth over his 
victims' heads, suffers from a mental disorder that makes him a danger to 
others and for which treatment is not available in the community. Spokesman 
Bill Gengler said he could not comment specifically on the mental disorder 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was scheduled to be paroled Sunday in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina police and city officials launched a campaign to block Muldrew's parole 
after being told by corrections officials that Muldrew was going to live in 
Covina. State officials never confirmed a specific city of residence.  
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 signatures were collected on petitions demanding that Muldrew be 
kept in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows what citizens can do when they organize together to oppose 
something they don't believe in," Covina Mayor Thomas M. O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing will be conducted in about 30 days to determine whether Muldrew 
should have his parole revoked and be kept in prison for psychiatric treatment. 
The hearings are generally formalities that confirm the decision to revoke 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as expected, Muldrew would remain in prison for six months, then 
undergo another psychiatric exam, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There probably is not an instance where someone has failed (the psychiatric 
exam) and six months later has passed it," Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, a year from now Muldrew must be released because his prison and 
parole terms will have expired. At that point, he can move wherever he chooses 
as long as he registers with local police as a sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing that the Department of Corrections can do to retain Muldrew" 
after the year is up, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who said she was raped by Muldrew expressed relief Thursday about 
the flunked exam, but worried that she and other victims would have to go 
through the same anxiety in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the system works for criminals," she said. "I'm laughing, I guess 
because I don't want to cry to think that he could be free." 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was convicted on six counts of sexual assault and numerous other 
felonies in 1978 and is suspected by police of having committed more than 200 
rapes and 150 robberies in Los Angeles from 1975 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tactics used by Covina officials to keep Muldrew out of their 
community were protest rallies and soliciting victims of Muldrew who live 
within 35 miles of Covina. Under state law, parolees cannot be released within 
35 miles of their victims or those who testified against them in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Lucero, deputy regional parole administrator, said the state decided to 
perform the psychiatric evaluation partly because of the extreme violence 
involved in the crimes for which Muldrew was convicted. He at times beat and 
punched his victims, or put out cigarettes on their skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucero said he was not sure whether Muldrew had a history of mental illness 
before his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was transferred from Pelican Bay State Prison in Northern California 
to the state prison in Lancaster on Monday in preparation for his parole. The 
psychiatric exam was completed Wednesday. He has also served time at San 
Quentin, where he was a suspect in the 1971 murder of a prison guard but was 
not prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Since March, five other high-profile sex offenders in Southern California have 
failed eleventh-hour psychiatric exams and been returned to prison. In four 
cases, the mental health exams were administered on the day of the sex 
offender's release from prison. But in Muldrew's case and one other, rapist 
David Stanley Lee, corrections officials did not wait for the parole date. 
Instead, Muldrew and Lee underwent psychiatric exams while they were still in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1977 determinate sentencing law, sex offenders are released on a 
predetermined date without having to go before a parole board for clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials say they only recently reinterpreted the little-known 
state code that allows psychiatric testing of parolees. The code does not 
specify when the evaluations can be administered. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the state's new policy complain that the decision to release 
inmates has been taken away from the parole board and left in the hands of a 
single psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 Antelope Valley residents who had gathered Thursday afternoon at 
Lancaster City Park to protest Muldrew's release applauded loudly when 
organizers announced that the rapist would remain in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally was organized after Antelope Valley residents learned Muldrew had 
been transferred to the Lancaster prison and feared that he might be paroled in 
their neighborhood.

 Under the state's determinate sentencing law -- originally passed to keep 
judges from issuing lenient sentences -- prisoners must be let out of prison 
after a specific number of years. Muldrew, a suspect in 200 rapes in the Los 
Angeles area during the 1970s, has been in prison for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corrections officials said Muldrew, 46, known as the "pillowcase 
rapist" because he put pillowcases and similar pieces of cloth over his 
victims' heads, suffers from a mental disorder that makes him a danger to 
others and for which treatment is not available in the community. Spokesman 
Bill Gengler said he could not comment specifically on the mental disorder 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was scheduled to be paroled Sunday in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina police and city officials launched a campaign to block Muldrew's parole 
after being told by corrections officials that Muldrew was going to live in 
Covina. State officials never confirmed a specific city of residence.  
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 signatures were collected on petitions demanding that Muldrew be 
kept in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows what citizens can do when they organize together to oppose 
something they don't believe in," Covina Mayor Thomas M. O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing will be conducted in about 30 days to determine whether Muldrew 
should have his parole revoked and be kept in prison for psychiatric treatment. 
The hearings are generally formalities that confirm the decision to revoke 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as expected, Muldrew would remain in prison for six months, then 
undergo another psychiatric exam, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There probably is not an instance where someone has failed (the psychiatric 
exam) and six months later has passed it," Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, a year from now Muldrew must be released because his prison and 
parole terms will have expired. At that point, he can move wherever he chooses 
as long as he registers with local police as a sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing that the Department of Corrections can do to retain Muldrew" 
after the year is up, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who said she was raped by Muldrew expressed relief Thursday about 
the flunked exam, but worried that she and other victims would have to go 
through the same anxiety in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the system works for criminals," she said. "I'm laughing, I guess 
because I don't want to cry to think that he could be free." 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was convicted on six counts of sexual assault and numerous other 
felonies in 1978 and is suspected by police of having committed more than 200 
rapes and 150 robberies in Los Angeles from 1975 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tactics used by Covina officials to keep Muldrew out of their 
community were protest rallies and soliciting victims of Muldrew who live 
within 35 miles of Covina. Under state law, parolees cannot be released within 
35 miles of his victims or those who testified against them in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, about 40 residents who had gathered Thursday afternoon 
at Lancaster City Park to protest Muldrew's release applauded loudly when 
organizers announced that he would remain in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally was organized after Muldrew was transferred to the state prison in 
Lancaster for his pre-parole psychiatric evaluation, and a television news 
report suggested that if he passed, Muldrew could be released in one of the 
surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Alma Hasse, a Palmdale resident who has two daughters, ages 12 and 14, joined 
a local radio station, KLKX-FM, in organizing Thursday's rally. Participants 
signed petitions and form letters urging Gov. Pete Wilson to press for laws 
requiring wider community notification when a violent criminal is released in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short term, I am ecstatic," Hasse said upon learning that Muldrew will 
remain behind bars, at least temporarily. "In the long run, I hope the laws 
regarding parole notification will be changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster City Councilman George Runner said some might regard the rally as an 
overreaction because state officials never said publicly that they were 
considering releasing Muldrew in the Antelope Valley. But he said residents 
were angry because corrections officials never ruled out the Antelope Valley, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Lucero, deputy regional parole administrator, said the state decided to 
perform the psychiatric evaluation partly because of the extreme violence 
involved in the crimes for which Muldrew was convicted. He at times beat and 
punched his victims, or put out cigarettes on their skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucero said he was not sure whether Muldrew had a history of mental illness 
before his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was transferred from Pelican Bay State Prison in Northern California 
to the state prison in Lancaster on Monday in preparation for his parole. The 
psychiatric exam was completed Wednesday. He has also served time at San 
Quentin, where he was a suspect in the 1971 murder of a prison guard, but was 
not prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Since March, five other high-profile sex offenders in Southern California have 
failed eleventh-hour psychiatric exams and been returned to prison. In four 
cases, the mental health exams were administered on the day of the sex 
offender's release from prison. But in Muldrew's case and one other, rapist 
David Stanley Lee, corrections officials did not wait for the parole date. 
Instead, Muldrew and Lee underwent psychiatric exams while they were still in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1977 determinate sentencing law, sex offenders are released on a 
predetermined date without having to go before a parole board for clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials say they only recently reinterpreted the little-known 
state code that allows psychiatric testing of parolees. The code does not 
specify when the evaluations can be administered. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the state's new policy complain that the decision to release 
inmates has been taken away from the parole board and left in the hands of a 
single psychiatrist.

RANCH FIGHTS PACK OF KILLER DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High up in the Antelope Valley, a mile from the Kern County line, 
shotgun-wielding ranchers and county officers armed with infrared sensors are 
out on a mission: stop the grisly massacres at the Nebeker ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The marauders strike quickly -- a sudden shriek is sometimes the only warning 
an attack is in progress. The aftermath is a horrifying sight, rancher Eugene 
Nebeker says, reminding him of pictures of village massacres in the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheep and goat pens are covered with blood, injured animals twitching in 
the dirt as the killers flee the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 They flee on four legs. 
</P>
<P>
 For a week, a rogue dog pack has been on the Antelope Valley's most-wanted 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs have reportedly terrorized neighboring ranches as well, but seem to 
have developed a fondness for the 680-acre Nebeker ranch, which holds about 
2,000 sheep and goats. About three dozen animals have been killed by the 
raiding dogs, and dozens more have been injured, costing the ranch an estimated 
$30,000, Nebeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions are running high as ranch hands see the hounds tear apart their 
livelihood. County animal control officers have been unable to catch the 
killers, despite using high-tech surveillance equipment. The dogs are described 
as two animals that appear to be part German shepherd, one of which is "real 
big," accompanied by a smaller black terrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebeker isn't intimidated. "I think we're all so mad that, even the big one, 
if we can get our hands on it, we would do it in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the livestock on the Nebeker ranch are innocent victims that were 
never destined for the slaughterhouse. The sheep and goats provide blood and 
serum products, and they are not killed in the process, Nebeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They live very happy and very privileged lives," Nebeker said. "They don't 
have to go out and forage for their food, we bring it in. They get nice, clean 
water, they have a lot of pen space. . . . The only problem we've had with them 
is that some are getting fat." 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs have hit the ranch on at least three occasions, all at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks began Saturday and two more occurred Tuesday. In the second 
attack, a rancher shot one of the dogs in the leg, but the wound didn't seem to 
hamper the hound, which loped away as swiftly as its companions, fading into 
the darkness of the desert night. 
</P>
<P>
 All-night stakeouts by ranchers have been supplemented the past three nights 
by Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control officers equipped 
with infrared devices that can detect the heat from the dog's bodies at a 
distance. The dogs stayed away Wednesday night, possibly scared off by all the 
new scents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the dogs are wary," said Gail Miley, manager of the animal control 
department's Lancaster shelter. An animal control officer spotted them about 7 
a.m. Thursday about half a mile from the ranch, but the dogs ducked out of 
sight into a riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chasing down the killers presents a serious challenge to the animal control 
officers, who spent much of Thursday bleary-eyed after their two nightlong 
stakeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're whipped," Miley said, battling to keep her eyelids open. "I'll tell 
you, animal control, no day is the same. I have to say this is one of the most 
tiring days." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has gotten so grim that Miley has had to borrow officers from 
the office in Downey to supplement her sleep-deprived force. 
</P>
<P>
 Miley believes the dogs are familiar with the crazy quilt of gullies and 
riverbeds that chop up the sagebrush-filled terrain of the north desert. They 
attack during the night, she said, when "the only light is from the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen ranchers and officers sit in their pickup trucks around the 
pens those nights, huddled in parkas and under blankets to fight the desert 
cold, sipping from insulated containers of coffee and munching M&Ms to keep 
them going through the night. In the daytime, they cruise the desert, looking 
for the killers. The animal control officers carry tranquilizer guns; some 
ranchers carry shotguns or other firearms, arguing they have to protect their 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 Miley said that although the dogs seem to relish terrorizing livestock, they 
may not attack humans. Sheep killing "is more for the sport than for anything 
else. It starts out as more of a chase kind of thing, and then the pack 
instinct sets in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The severity and frequency of these attacks make this pack unusual, said 
Miley, adding that she did not know if the dogs were wild or belong to an owner 
who doesn't bother keeping them home. 
</P>
<P>
 But dogs attacking livestock is nothing new in remote desert areas. Nebeker 
said the frequency of dog attacks on his ranch, which he's had for 23 years, 
has soared recently. He blames that on lax enforcement of leash laws, saying 
that the animal control station is woefully understaffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real health and safety problem up in the high desert" due to dogs 
running around unleashed. "It's a threat to livestock, pets and children," 
Nebeker said.  
</P>
<P>
 Nebeker and Miley both said dog owners need to take more responsibility for 
leashing dogs that might harm other animals or children. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 20, dogs got through the wire around Nebeker's goat pen and killed 
eight goats, injuring 12 others, Nebeker said. A rancher shot and killed one 
dog and wounded two others. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs were found to belong to an Antelope Valley man who has been charged 
with maintaining a public nuisance and other misdemeanors, Miley said.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the hounds at large, "we'll keep going until we get 'em," Nebeker 
vowed.

THROWN A CURVE; LITTLE LEAGUE: AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO USES THE EARTHQUAKE KIDS' 
NOTORIETY -- BUT ONLY FIVE TEAM MEMBERS. PARENTS OF THE OTHERS SAY THEY WERE 
KEPT IN THE DARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON and JON D. MARKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine members of the national champion Northridge Little League team are 
playing a new position: left out. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five of the team's 14 players are included in an instructional video that 
trades on the notoriety earned by the Earthquake Kids' unlikely climb from the 
sandlots of Northridge to the green hills of Williamsport, Pa.  
</P>
<P>
 And many of those excluded say they learned of the video only through recent 
print advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can it be 'The Earthquake Kids' if only a few were involved?," said Eric 
Gordon, father of the team's right fielder, Spencer. "It's been really weird. 
The people who did this have gone out of their way to be hush-hush. They've 
made it very secretive." 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-minute video -- officially released Thursday during a news conference 
at the Northridge Little League fields -- was financed by five families and the 
assistant coach. Each invested from $5,000 to $10,000 to produce the video, 
which is being marketed nationwide through cable television and print ads. 
</P>
<P>
 And they admit they wanted to keep the project -- and any profits -- to 
themselves even though the entire team made history together. The Northridge 
boys earned the U.S. title before losing to Maracaibo, Venezuela, in the World 
Series final last August. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with Northridge Little League or Little League 
baseball," said team manager Larry Baca, an investor who is featured on the 
video packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Those excluded are more saddened than outraged. For many, there is nothing 
left of the innocence and unity that made the team America's darlings of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It leaves me with a little emptiness," said Lynn Wallis, mother of third 
baseman Gregg Wallis. "The people who did the video I adore and love. But we 
won as a team and I would have hoped the activities would have included the 
whole team." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Gentile, father of pitcher Justin Gentile, co-produced the video after the 
idea was pitched to him by an independent film director. Gentile said the 
director, William Sachs, insisted that only a few players be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have loved to use all 14, but cost-wise it would not have been 
effective," Gentile said. "The director wanted to stick to a theme of coaches 
teaching their sons." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile and his son, Justin, explain the effective off-speed pitch they called 
"the agony." Tim Cunningham teaches hitting, Jack Fisher teaches infield play, 
and Scott Randall, Nathaniel Dunlap's father, teaches pitching technique. Coach 
George Saul teaches catching fundamentals and Baca narrates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of what we know as coaches has been passed on to us from people in 
Northridge Little League. It is a great program," said Cunningham, who promised 
to donate profits from future video ventures to the league if this one is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the venture hits a sour note with Rick Tuber, father of pitcher Peter 
Tuber and a film editor at Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am, quite frankly, surprised and hurt," he said. "We learned of this by 
seeing a newspaper ad. I would have edited the video for free. We're certainly 
not going to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the video is made for Little Leaguers, the term "Little League" is 
not mentioned in the video, investors said, because the organization would have 
demanded a licensing fee and monitored the content. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little League insists on reviewing and approving all teaching methods 
espoused in a video," said Dennis Sullivan, a spokesman for Little League 
Baseball Inc. in Williamsport. "It has to conform to Little League 
philosophies." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile said the parents involved in the project deserve some reward because 
they are taking a financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've stuck our necks out a little," said Baca. 
</P>
<P>
 Before launching the video project, Baca said, he made special efforts to 
include the entire team in a variety of activities. Atlantic Richfield Co. 
asked that only seven players ride on its float during the Rose Parade, but 
Baca insisted that all the players take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca also secured roles for all the players on the feature film "Three 
Wishes," starring Patrick Swayze. Baca is technical adviser for several 
baseball scenes to be shot in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Northridge team will convene Sunday to appear in the Granada Hills 
Holiday Parade. The video is not expected to cause much of a stir among the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is pretty much oblivious to it," Tuber said. "He doesn't care about 
that kind of stuff. As parents, we are more into it."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
PIPE BOMB THREATS FORCE EVACUATIONS IN 2 CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Discoveries of devices that appeared to be pipe bombs forced evacuations in 
Carson and Long Beach on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay Pavilion in Carson was evacuated for several hours after one 
device was found in a restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department bomb squad detonated the device at a nearby field, said 
Sgt. Ron Spear. He said that tests will be performed to determine if it 
contained explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 A janitor discovered the device about 2:50 p.m. when he was cleaning the 
restroom, Spear said. The shopping center, at Del Amo and Avalon boulevards, 
was evacuated along with nearby businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, about 150 patients and employees were evacuated from the 
Long Beach Veterans Administration Hospital. Two objects that appeared to be 
pipe bombs were discovered, but a Sheriff's Department bomb squad determined 
that the devices did not contain explosives, said Cpl. Josef Levy of the Long 
Beach Police Department.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; VARIETY SHOWS TO AID SCHOOL ARTS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operator of a private acting school in Calabasas has organized a variety 
show to benefit arts education programs for schools in the Las Virgenes Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The two shows, on Dec. 16 and 17 at 8 p.m. at Calabasas High School, will 
feature community residents in a variety of acts, said Howard Schwartz, 
director of the Calabasas Acting School and Theater, which opened six months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted my first production to have a community appeal and to get the 
community involved," he said. "The cabaret format enabled everybody in the 
community to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the Calabasas Community Cabaret and Arts Festival is $10 in 
advance and $12 at the door, he said. Tickets may be purchased in advance by 
calling (818) 224-3627. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will go to various community arts programs, including the district's 
high school drama programs, and Volunteers for the Blind and Visually Impaired, 
a Calabasas-based nonprofit organization, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of the show include Lon Bove's jazz band, a barbershop quartet, a 
75-year-old comedienne and a team of tap dancing 12-year-olds, according to 
Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors include the city of Calabasas, Lockheed Corp. and Calabasas 
Promenade, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Marley, superintendent of the Las Virgenes Unified School District, 
said the schools can use donations because arts programs have been scaled back 
significantly due to fiscal constraints. He praised Schwartz.  
</P>
<P>
 "Howard is such an enthusiastic young man," said Marley. "He's a real live 
wire. He's got endless energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said his acting school grew from 12 students when it opened to about 
125 now. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz is a classically and Shakespearean trained actor, who has studied in 
London. He will star in his first feature film, "Slaves of Hollywood," an 
independently made, dark comedy about the inner workings of Hollywood. It is 
scheduled to be released in January. FRANK MANNING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jewish temple that former Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus has 
attended for 32 years will hold a formal celebration for her Dec. 10 to 
recognize her service to thousands of west San Fernando Valley residents and to 
the Jewish faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Picus was a founding member of Temple Aliyah in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year member of the City Council when she was voted out of office in 1993, 
she had worked on behalf of such causes as "family-friendly" workplaces, 
women's rights and recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 During her years in public life, "I was honored by different people for 
different things," said Picus, 63. "But this is kind of like the biggie. This 
is special." 
</P>
<P>
 The gala will begin with hors d'oeuvres at 6:30 p.m. at the temple, 6025 
Valley Circle Blvd. Dinner, dancing and entertainment and speakers will follow, 
with actor and activist Ed Begley Jr. the master of ceremonies.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted immigration swindler from Alhambra will be sentenced Dec. 12 for 
violating probation by resuming illegal business activities upon her release 
from jail, a prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo-Li V. Gregor, 48, of Alhambra, who targeted holders of Republic of China 
and Hong Kong passports, was found to be in violation of her parole late 
Wednesday by Los Angeles Municipal Judge Thomas L. Willhite. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled after a hearing at which two of Gregor's most recent victims 
testified, said Deputy City Atty. P. Greg Parham.  
</P>
<P>
 They told the judge that in October they had paid Gregor $1,000 and $500, 
respectively, for what turned out to be bogus work permits, the prosecutor 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Willhite set bail for Gregor at $50,000 and remanded her into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous case, Gregor was sentenced Jan. 28 to a year in jail and 
ordered to pay $39,985 in restitution to 14 victims. Gregor was released after 
serving about four months of her sentence and in October became the subject of 
the INS investigation that led to the latest conviction after she began 
advertising work permits for sale, Parham said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VALLEY, WESTSIDE POLICE 
REPORT RASH OF ROLEX ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rash of thefts similar to those that plagued the Westside several years 
ago, about two dozen Rolex watches have been stolen -- often at gunpoint -- in 
the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside this fall, apparently after bandits 
spotted the expensive watches on motorists' wrists, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said more than half the robberies, which began in September, were 
committed in the Valley, where most victims apparently were chosen because they 
drove expensive cars.No victims have been injured and no suspect has been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rolexes are really easy to spot when you're driving down the street because 
they're on your left wrist, so when you're driving, your watch is exposed," 
said Detective Roland L'Heureux of the Los Angeles Police Department's West 
Valley division. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Robert Johansen said it appears that the thief or thieves seek out 
mostly middle-aged men and women in luxury cars during the day, maneuvering in 
a car close enough to determine whether they are wearing a Rolex. The robber 
then follows them to their next stop, confronts them at gunpoint and demands 
the watches, Johansen said.  
</P>
<P>
 In all but one of the eight Rolex thefts committed in the West Valley over the 
last couple of months, the victims apparently drew the robber's attention by 
driving along Ventura Boulevard in a Mercedes-Benz, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 In one robbery, a thief confronted a couple, both wearing Rolexes, who had 
just parked a Mercedes on Ventura in Encino. The robber took both Rolexes and 
an expensive ring the woman was wearing, Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got away with over $100,000" in jewelry, Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westside robberies -- 10 this year -- have been similar in execution, 
police say. JULIE TAMAKI

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ROAMING DAYS OVER FOR 
SAMSON THE BEAR -- HE HAS A NEW HOME 
</P>

<P>
 Samson, the pool-hopping black bear who was captured in Monrovia in September, 
will be permanently housed at the Orange County Zoo in Orange, state wildlife 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Samson -- who spent his summer lumbering in a rustic neighborhood, stealing 
avocados, soaking in hot tubs and stopping by regularly at one family's back 
patio to watch television through the glass door -- won't have to trespass to 
take a dip this time. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new digs -- a $100,000 bear pen constructed especially for him -- the 
400-pound bear will have his run of a scratching tree, a waterfall and a pool.  
</P>
<P>
 He will be moved in about four months, said Jeff Weir, a Department of Fish 
and Game spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 The bear was captured and was to have been killed until he won a last-minute 
stay of execution from Gov. Pete Wilson after the neighborhood in which the 
bear roamed mobilized to save him.  
</P>
<P>
 The bear has been staying temporarily at a Rancho Cordova fish and game 
facility in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Weir said the Orange County Zoo, part of Irvine Regional Park, had been a top 
contender for some time.  
</P>
<P>
 "For the past month and a half, our attitude has been if you build (the bear 
pen), he will come," Weir said. LISA O'NEILL

THROWN A CURVE; LITTLE LEAGUE: INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO TRADES ON CHAMPIONSHIP 
TEAM'S FAME -- BUT ONLY USES FIVE PLAYERS. PARENTS OF SOME OF THE OTHERS SAY 
THEY WERE KEPT IN THE DARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine members of the national champion Northridge Little League team are 
playing a new position: Left out. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five of the team's 14 players are included in an instructional video that 
trades on the fame earned by the "Earthquake Kids' " unlikely climb from the 
sandlots of Northridge to the green hills of Williamsport, Pa.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of those excluded say they only learned of the video through recent 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can it be 'The Earthquake Kids' if only a few were involved?" asked Eric 
Gordon, father of the team's right fielder, Spencer. "It's been really weird. 
The people who did this have gone out of their way to be hush-hush." 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-minute video -- released Thursday at a news conference at the 
Northridge Little League fields -- was financed by five families and the 
assistant coach. Each invested from $5,000 to $10,000 to produce the video, 
marketed nationwide through cable television and print ads. 
</P>
<P>
 And they admit that they wanted to keep the project -- and any potential 
profits -- to themselves, even though the entire team made history. The 
Northridge boys earned the U.S. title before losing to Maracaibo, Venezuela, in 
the World Series final in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with Northridge Little League or Little League 
baseball," said team manager Larry Baca, an investor featured on the cover of 
the video box. 
</P>
<P>
 Those excluded are more saddened than outraged. For many, the innocence and 
unity that made the team America's darlings of summer has ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It leaves me with a little emptiness," said Lynn Wallis, mother of third 
baseman Gregg Wallis. "The people who did the video I adore and love. But we 
won as a team, and I would have hoped the activities would have included the 
whole team." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Gentile, father of pitcher Justin Gentile, co-produced the video after the 
idea was pitched to him by an independent film director. Gentile said that 
director William Sachs insisted that only a few players be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have loved to use all 14, but cost-wise it would not have been 
effective," Gentile said. "The director wanted to stick to a theme of coaches 
teaching their sons." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile and his son, Justin, explain the off-speed pitch they call "the 
agony." Tim Cunningham teaches hitting, Jack Fisher teaches infield play, and 
Scott Randall, Nathaniel Dunlap's father, teaches pitching. Coach George Saul 
teaches catching fundamentals and Baca narrates the video. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham promised to donate profits from future video ventures to the league 
if this one is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the video is made for Little Leaguers, the term "Little League" is 
not mentioned, investors said, because the organization would have demanded a 
licensing fee and monitored the content.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: REMODELED DRUG CENTER SHOWS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drug treatment center for teen-agers in Lake View Terrace welcomed the 
public for the first time Thursday at an open house that featured tours 
conducted by student-residents, a lunch buffet and a visit from Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Academy at Lake View Terrace, bitterly opposed by some community 
groups when it was proposed eight years ago, showed off its gleaming, 
landscaped facility on 15 acres at the former Lake View Terrace Medical Center 
on Eldridge Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors said they were impressed with both the program and the condition of 
the building, abandoned years ago when the medical center declared bankruptcy. 
The Phoenix House Foundation, a New York-based drug treatment program, 
purchased the property with the goal of establishing its California operations 
headquarters there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea of the scope of this," said Harry Hughes, a member of the 
Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce, after he received a tour from Phoenix 
House residents Tara Milich, 17, and Tom Stephenson, 17, two of the academy's 
50 live-in students. 
</P>
<P>
 Visibly moved by the presentation of the articulate, congenial guides, Hughes 
remarked: "I'm glad this is here. I'm glad the kids have this -- it seems to 
have given them such an opportunity. It gives you insight into how valuable the 
life of a human being is." 
</P>
<P>
 Tara is one of Phoenix Academy's success stories. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, Tara said, she was popping amphetamines, smoking pot, drinking and 
hanging out with a heavy-metal band in Hollywood. After a drug test, school 
officials and Tara's mother decided to enter her in the Phoenix Academy 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara recalled how she first felt about going there: "I was very arrogant to 
the lady interviewing me. She said 'You can't smoke here or wear makeup or 
jewelry.' I'm like, 'Yeah right -- I don't listen to my mom, much less you.' My 
friends threw me a big going-away party the night before I left. We all got 
high. My mom couldn't stop me. No one could really stop me." 
</P>
<P>
 Once she entered the academy, the positive message, the structured daily 
assignments and regular therapy sessions with her family helped her deal with 
her feelings. She became interested in academics and now attends a public high 
school, but still lives at the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara took reporters and others on a tour of the first floor of the building, 
showing neat, dormitory-style rooms, a small cafeteria where residents eat 
every meal together, a common area with television and fitness equipment and 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent of one of the academy's new residents, who asked that her name not be 
used, said her daughter is struggling with the dramatic change in her 
environment: "She's telling me it's dangerous for her to be here," the parent 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not buying it. A lot of programs say a lot of things, but this one 
here -- it seems to be able to deliver." TIM MAY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WILLOWBROOK; BOY, 3, 
WOUNDS HIS MOTHER WITH FATHER'S ASSAULT RIFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old Willowbrook boy grabbed the assault rifle in the back seat of his 
father's car Thursday and fired the gun, seriously wounding his mother.  
</P>
<P>
 Elizar Arzate "has a toy assault rifle he plays with that is very similar to 
his father's real one," said Angie McLaughlin, a Sheriff's Department 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 10:40 a.m. in the 2100 block of East Shauer 
Street, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizar Reyes, 29, had loaded his gun and put it in the back seat of his car. 
He put his son and daughter in the back of the car and was talking with his 
wife when the boy fired the weapon. The bullet went through the car door and 
hit Elvira Arzate, 30, in the arm. She was in serious condition at Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, booked on suspicion of storing a weapon accessible to children, was 
held on $15,000 bail.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; PROSTITUTE 
GETS 30 DAYS IN JAIL FOR DEATH THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted prostitute was sentenced to 30 days in jail after pleading no 
contest to charges that she threatened to kill a woman who objected to her 
attire, City Atty. Jim Hahn said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Halloween night, Marcia Latrice Wilson, 19, of Van Nuys was standing at 
Sunset Boulevard and Stanley Avenue wearing an outfit consisting of a black 
bathing suit, a string bikini thong and see-through net panties.  
</P>
<P>
 A 29-year-old woman who lives nearby approached Wilson and expressed an 
objection to her outfit because children were out trick-or-treating. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson threatened to stab the woman to death, according to Hahn. Two 
plainclothes officers saw the confrontation, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office charged Wilson with making a terrorist threat.  
</P>
<P>
 She pleaded no contest to the charge Tuesday before Hollywood Municipal Judge 
Anita Dymant, who imposed the 30-day jail sentence. Wilson also was placed on 
summary probation and ordered to stay away from the victim.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HOMEOWNER GROUPS OPPOSE MALL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowner associations in Encino and Sherman Oaks have banded together to 
oppose a proposed major renovation of the Sherman Oaks Galleria and an adjacent 
building that would replace retail and office space with new restaurants, movie 
theaters and entertainment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents liken the proposed multimillion-dollar project to Universal 
CityWalk, and predict that the Galleria project could foster the same type of 
youthful hooliganism. They say the proposed complex, with its new movie 
theaters and entertainment facilities, is incompatible with their community, 
and predict that traffic generated by the project will clog local streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern is . . . that they are changing what was office and retail 
-- chopping it down by over a third -- and replacing it with a 
congestion-causing and crime-prone entertainment center, which appears to be a 
video game arcade," said Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a traffic study commissioned by the mall's owner, Galleria Joint 
Venture, the proposal calls for a one-third reduction in office space, or 
134,000 square feet, and a one-third decrease in retail space, or 192,000 
square feet. Galleria Joint Venture would like to add 78,000 square feet of 
entertainment facilities, 70,000 square feet of restaurants and 3,400 
additional movie seats. These changes, combined with others, would mean an 
overall 7% reduction in the mall's size, which is now 999,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall General Manager Joy De Backer said mall representatives have met with 
homeowner groups and that the project has received an overall positive 
response. According to De Backer, the community needs more movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the entertainment center may include arcade games, but that it may 
also include such attractions as an IMAX theater, a "ride" that combines film 
and moving seats to simulate motion and virtual-reality games. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason why we can't offer an entertainment complex that offers 
family entertainment and entertainment for adults, and can be a safe 
environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to De Backer, Galleria Joint Venture has not yet applied for a 
project permit from the city.  
</P>
<P>
 Gary Holme, chairman of the Galleria Review Committee of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn., disputed De Backer's claim that the proposed project had 
received support from the community. "They've done it sort of backward," he 
said. "They need to come to the community and see what the community needs 
rather than shove it down the community's throats." KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; FOOD 4 LESS TO MOVE INTO SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viva Market in Pacoima Plaza is, well, muerto.  
</P>
<P>
 But shoppers need not mourn the dead market: Food 4 Less will soon replace the 
closed Viva store at the same location. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacoima Plaza, one of only a handful of strip malls in the community, is 
getting a $1-million make-over care of the Piken Co., a Studio City-based 
developer that created the mall 10 years ago using federal Urban Development 
Action grant funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A major part of the upgrade includes conversion of the former Viva Market to a 
Food 4 Less supermarket, where shoppers will be asked to bag their own 
groceries. Other planned improvements at the 132,000-square-foot center at 
Glenoaks and Van Nuys boulevards include repaving and striping the parking lot, 
painting storefronts and additional landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the project began recently, said Herbert Piken, president of the Piken 
Co. "When it's done, we plan to have it looking like a new shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
 Other tenants of Pacoima Plaza include Thrifty Drug, Burger King, Little 
Caesar and Trak Auto. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion of the existing Viva Market to Food 4 Less is part of a regional 
expansion of the Food 4 Less chain, Piken said. TIM MAY

MISSING BOY'S BODY FOUND IN HOME OF BABY-SITTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Detectives investigating the disappearance of a 2-year-old Rialto boy found 
the toddler's body Thursday stuffed inside an ottoman at his baby-sitter's 
house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Marcus Anthony Jackson, who had been missing since Monday morning, 
was discovered a day after investigators said they believed the child had been 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby-sitter, Betty Ann Mills, 28, was booked Wednesday for investigation 
of murder, and her roommate, Kimberly Gay Cole, 35, was booked as a possible 
accessory. The women already had been arrested for investigation of felony 
child endangerment in the child's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rialto police said earlier this week that Mills had admitted hitting the boy. 
Forensic investigators said they found blood and other evidence at Mills' home, 
leading them to suspect foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until detectives searched Mills' home a second time that the 
boy's body was found. Police said the killers apparently stuffed the body into 
a tear in the underside of an ottoman and resealed the opening with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's mother, Marcella Jackson, said she had left her son with Mills and 
Cole while she moved to a new apartment. The women had two other children 
besides Marcus in their care at the time.

37 PROTESTERS ARRESTED IN HOTEL LABOR DISPUTE; UNION: DOWNTOWN HILTON WORKERS 
STAGE PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST NEW OWNER'S PLAN TO DISMISS THEM.

 Police arrested 37 demonstrators Thursday during a union-organized act of 
civil disobedience designed to dramatize the plight of about 550 hotel workers 
facing loss of their jobs because of an impending management change at the Los 
Angeles Hilton and Towers complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would we do without our work?" asked Guadalupe Garcia, a widowed, 
41-year-old mother of three and longtime housekeeper who was among those taken 
into custody in Downtown Los Angeles. "There's no one else to take care of my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the well-choreographed spectacle, Garcia and another maid, Rosa 
Rivera, made up a bed placed in the middle of Figueroa Street in front of the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the sidewalk, a multicultural crowd shouted pro-union chants to the 
rhythm of Korean drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "These jobs belong to us, and we're not going to give them up!" vowed Maria 
Elena Durazo, president of Local 11 of the Hotel Employees & Restaurant 
Employees Union, which represents most workers at the Hilton and organized the 
demonstration. She was among those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were alerted to the planned event days in advance and were ready in 
force. Officers quickly sealed off a one-block stretch of Figueroa, rerouting 
heavy rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounted units and police in riot helmets kept a close eye on the 
demonstrators. According to plan, 37 refused to move even after officers 
informed them that they were illegally obstructing a public street. There was 
no violence as, one by one, the activists were picked up in the middle of 
Figueroa by officers, handcuffed with plastic bonds and placed on a blue Los 
Angeles Police Department bus headed for Parker Center. 
</P>
<P>
 All were expected to be released on their own recognizance. Lt. Mike Hillmann, 
who oversaw the operation, said those arrested were charged with "unlawful 
assembly and failure to disperse," a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the protest is the management change slated to go into effect 
Jan. 31 at the 900-room Hilton, owned by Hanjin International Corp., a 
subsidiary of the Hanjin Group, a South Korean conglomerate whose many holdings 
also include Korean Air. Hanjin International is expected to take over direct 
management, replacing Hilton at one of Los Angeles' premier hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 With new management, all workers will lose their jobs -- the point emphasized 
by demonstrators, who characterized the management shift as a union-busting 
tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials, now engaged in an organizing campaign in the tourist industry 
regionwide, said it is critical that the Hilton -- one of only about a dozen 
major Los Angeles-area hotels with unionized work forces -- remain a union 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a line-in-the-sand battle," said Madeline Janis Aparicio, a 
spokeswoman for Local 11. "The Hilton cannot become non-union." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanjin officials have rejected the union-busting allegation and stated the 
owners' desire to discuss new union contracts and rehire all or most employees, 
subject to an application and interview process. All would have to go through a 
probationary period. Rehired employees kept on would receive the same wages and 
benefits as now, Hanjin officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep the union, and we want to keep as many people as economically 
expedient -- and that may be all of them," said Keith D. Grossman, a Hanjin 
spokesman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Local 11 leaders are imposing unrealistic demands -- guarantees of a union 
contract and full employment, full seniority and full benefits for all current 
workers -- even before the owner has been able to evaluate what is needed, 
according to Hanjin. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman characterized Thursday's demonstration as "premature, excessive and 
not justifiable." 
</P>
<P>
 But union officials said the public display was needed to pressure Hanjin to 
rehire current employees, mostly Latino immigrants, some of whom have worked at 
the hotel for 10 years.

IT'S YULE BY THE POOL AS SANTAS SOAK UP SUN AND JOB TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RESPERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a scene so rife with cliches that its description seems almost 
apocryphal: 10 Santas lounging around the pool Thursday at the Four Seasons 
Hotel, dressed for a balmy December day in T-shirts and shorts, getting 
last-minute instructions on how to handle those tiny tots with their eyes all 
aglow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing to remember is that Santa never goes to the bathroom," said 
Joel Reyes, who will perform Santa duties at the Beverly Center. "You have to 
say, 'Santa's going to feed the reindeer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes and nine others were taking part in Western Temporary Services' "Santa 
School," a crash course for those who wish to transform themselves into that 
jolly old soul for a season. The group sat stroking their white beards and 
learned the do's and don'ts from Santa School Headmistress Jenny Zink. 
</P>
<P>
 Zink, who works with the temporary agency, said she has been teaching men and 
women how to portray Santa at malls, hospitals and special events for 25 years. 
It's a job she takes seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to stay in character," she said. "They can't let their guard down 
for a minute because they can't disappoint the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Zink led the group through their routines with tips on keeping their beards in 
place and speaking softly and soothingly to a child. Santas are cautioned not 
to be too energetic with the "Ho, ho, ho's" lest they frighten a young child. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the weather in Los Angeles is a tad warmer than at the North Pole, 
Santas were reminded to bathe well and use deodorant. Garlic is a no-no, and 
Mr. Claus should keep mints handy to avoid having breath that could light up 
Rudolph's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa hygiene is important," said Terri Francis, branch manager of Western 
Temporary's office in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraying Santa in the '90s involves new rules and regulations. Santas are 
advised to always refer to a child's "folks" instead of "mommy" and "daddy" in 
an effort to be politically correct in the age of alternative households. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important to avoid any actions that might lead to accusations of 
child abuse. The guidelines are a small price to pay, many said, for the 
opportunity to play a man who is loved by millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids look at Santa like he's God," said Todd Schwartz, a writer/actor who 
lives in Hollywood. "Playing him has been a lifelong dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, it's the only job I can get where I can gain a little weight and get 
chubby and it's OK," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he saw no conflict in the fact that he is a Jewish Santa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Claus has always been Jewish," he said with a twinkle in his eye. "We 
just don't talk about it much." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency attracts a variety of people from different professions who get a 
kick out of being Santa for a season, Zink said. Participants are paid hourly 
wages based on their assignments, but many have other reasons for donning the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kids," said Joe Purnell, a program director for an organization that 
works with mentally handicapped people. "They are so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Purnell said he has dressed up as Santa for the past 17 years. His white beard 
is real. 
</P>
<P>
 Class ended with the men stuffing their ample frames (pillows helped some 
Santas maintain the proper girth) into their red suits and striding through the 
hotel -- to the delight of guests -- to attend Santa graduation in the hotel 
dining room. The tassels on Santa caps were flipped from one side to the other 
and the men received diplomas before dining on Santa's favorite meal -- cookies 
and milk.

L.A. MAY BE BARRED FROM FIGHT OVER PROP. 187; COURTS: STATE ATTORNEYS FILE 
PAPERS SAYING CITY'S ENTRY WOULD OPEN DOOR TO OTHERS. COUNTY FILES FIRST 
CHARGES UNDER PORTION OF MEASURE STILL IN FORCE. 
</P>

<P>
 State attorneys representing Gov. Pete Wilson and Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren filed 
legal papers this week opposing the entry of the city of Los Angeles into the 
court battle against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "To allow the city to intervene now would be to invite every city, every 
county, every special district and every school district to intervene, which 
would make an already complex set of consolidated (court) actions 
overwhelmingly cumbersome," Deputy Atty. Gen. James F. Ahern said in a six-page 
legal brief. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced 
Thursday that it had filed its first two cases under the single portion of 
Proposition 187 that has not been temporarily blocked by a federal court 
restraining order -- new state sanctions against the manufacture, sale or use 
of fraudulent citizenship papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Huntington Park-area men have been arraigned this week on charges of 
manufacturing fake identity cards and face sentences of five years in state 
prison or a $75,000 fine, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants -- Jose Hernandez Sanchez, 24; Hugo Cezar Lopez, 18; Pablo 
Barrera, 20; Antonio Serrano, 21, and Gerardo Espinoza, 26 -- were held on bail 
ranging from $20,000 and $80,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Proposition 187, the five men face much stiffer fines than if they had 
been convicted in the past on forgery charges. But the potential prison 
sentence is about the same as they would have faced before the November state 
election, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick Sequeira said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ongoing federal court challenge concerning the anti-illegal immigrant 
initiative, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn filed papers last month asking 
permission to intervene in the case. A hearing on the city's motion is 
tentatively set for Dec. 12 before U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer, who 
recently extended a temporary restraining order against implementation of the 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council, which had initially asked Hahn to try to 
overturn the initiative, recently softened its stand, asking the city attorney 
to instead seek clarification of the measure's potential impact on the city. 
The move came amid a voter backlash against government officials using tax 
money to challenge the initiative, which was approved by a 59%-41% margin Nov. 
8.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; PARENTS LEARN TO AID THEIR KIDS' EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERROL A. COCKFIELD JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlos and Rosalia Garcia of Sylmar said their parents didn't push them to get 
good grades when they were in school. So nine weeks ago, they decided to go 
back to school to learn how to better encourage their three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night they graduated -- and enthusiastically accepted their diplomas 
-- as they walked to the stage of San Fernando Middle School's auditorium, 
embracing their instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcias, both 37, along with 278 other, mostly Latino parents of students 
at Morningside Elementary School, graduated from a nine-week training course 
offered by the Parent Institute for Quality Education. The course teaches 
parents how to get more involved in their children's education, in a community 
where many Latino parents have a hands-off attitude because of the language 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that as a parent, I have a voice and a vote," Concepcion Vasquez, 
37, said in Spanish. She has one child at Morningside and two in other public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Parent Institute for Quality Education was created in San Diego 
in 1987 by Vahac Mardirosian, a Baptist minister and community activist for 
Latino educational issues. He designed the institute to lower Latino student 
dropout rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the institute began teaching parents of students in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District and has since increased parent involvement in 205 
schools. Twenty thousand parents in San Diego and Los Angeles have graduated 
from the institute since it started, said Rene Maldonado, one of the 
instructors of the course, who is also a translator for the Los Angeles 
district's parent community services unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's helped me a lot to understand the school system," said Patsy Rivera, 
whose 5-year-old son Rogelio is in kindergarten at Morningside. She said the 
classes -- held once a week for 90 minutes -- also informed her about the drug, 
alcohol and gang involvement she wants her son to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera received a letter in the mail from Morningside about the course. She 
said she thought that taking it would better help her understand her son's 
educational needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big change for these parents to become involved in their children's 
education," said Christina Bradley, spokeswoman for Southern California Edison 
Co., which sponsored this round of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 As family members applauded and a mariachi band played during the 
commencement-like ceremony, held at San Fernando Middle School because there 
was not enough room at Morningside, some parents took their children to the 
stage with them. Others gave their instructors gifts and thanked them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, this is the culmination, but for the parents, it is the beginning of 
(increased) participation in the school system," said Luis Ituarte, another 
instructor. ERROL A. COCKFIELD JR.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; STUDY PRAISES PLAN FOR THEATER DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for a live theater district in the heart of downtown Glendale inched 
forward this week with the release of a planning study concluding that the city 
will benefit not only culturally, but economically if it gives the arts a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 AMS Planning and Research of Petaluma interviewed local businesses and 
theater-goers and recommended that the district be established on Brand 
Boulevard, where the Alex Theatre, Glendale Centre Theatre and A Noise Within 
are already located.A fourth live theater group, The Colony Studio Theater of 
Silver Lake, has announced plans to move to downtown Glendale and would also 
become part of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The report includes studies of several other cities that have established 
their own public theater agencies and recommendations on how Glendale can do 
the same. Among the possibilities is the creation of a theater district 
partnership that would manage the local live theater scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But Derrill Quaschnick, the city's assistant redevelopment director, said many 
questions have yet to be resolved as to how the city would pay the subsidies 
that are often required to bolster the local arts scene. According to the 
report, the district would cost up to $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the ideas suggested for covering the costs are utility taxes, sales 
taxes, federal grants, developer fees and fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quaschnick said the city would like to help foster a self-sustained 
theater district, with an internal funding mechanism such as a ticket 
surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we create a theater district driven by the Redevelopment Agency or the 
city, we are setting it up as a project we would always have to direct and 
force its inspiration and motivation," Quaschnick said. "What we want is 
something we will be able to participate in, but not necessarily be the driving 
force." STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; TREATMENT CENTER OPENS NEW BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new $10-million, 120-bed drug treatment facility has opened in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Cri-Help Inc. began 23 years ago in a cramped Sun Valley building and moved to 
its North Hollywood building in 1975.During the last year, the old building, a 
former orphanage for Jewish boys, was torn down and replaced with a modern 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 On hand for the ribbon-cutting ceremony Wednesday were singer Natalie Cole and 
Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 Named the George T. Pfleger Center, for a Newport Beach benefactor whose son 
was a client of the facility, the new building will allow Cri-Help to better 
offer 24-hour drug treatment, counseling and education. 
</P>
<P>
 When the group started in 1971, as one of the first to provide long-term 
recovery programs for drug addiction, they survived from month to month. 
Sometimes program leaders were not able to pay the rent because of other bills, 
said Executive Director Jack Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cri-Help has always offered at least half of its bed space to those who 
cannot afford to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Their financial situation has improved over the years as fund-raising efforts 
improved and as the group won contracts from the California Youth Authority to 
serve as a treatment facility for inmates shortly before their release, or for 
those on probation after serving sentences in Los Angeles County Jail. But 
donations are always being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Cri-Help's clients are those who have completed detoxification programs and 
are trying to learn to stay off drugs and return to society. Bernstein said 
that all the organization's clients find jobs if they complete the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Cri-Help also offers a literacy program, family groups, AIDS education and 
support groups, and help in finding jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility is located at 11027 Burbank Blvd. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HOLIDAY TOUR SET IN DISTINCTIVE HOMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale will relive what is reportedly its longest-running holiday season 
tradition this weekend, but it's not a parade, party or show. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, on Saturday more than 100 people are expected to walk and wander 
through three stately northwest Glendale homes that have been decked out in 
full holiday regalia, designed by their owners and local florists.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Hoover Tour of Homes, which is entering its 37th year, said 
the leisurely event is a respite from the hectic holiday shopping pace and can 
inspire participants to do something seasonal for their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a fun event," said Patricia Zung, tour chairwoman. "The homes 
are interesting, and you get some great decorating ideas,"  
</P>
<P>
 Each year, a committee of Hoover High School parents selects three houses in 
the area to be featured in the tour. Some homeowners offer their houses to the 
event, while others are approached by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the tour will visit a 1929 Mediterranean villa at 551 Cumberland 
Road owned by the O'Connor family, a 1948 Colonial-style home at 601 W. Kenneth 
Road owned by the Lewis family, and a 1935 Spanish-style home at 335 W. Kenneth 
Road owned by the Ainge family. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Russell, a spokeswoman for the tour, said each of the houses was picked 
for its distinctive characteristics. The O'Connor house, she said, has 
hand-painted ceilings, while the Lewis home has an English pub-like bar with 
stained glass windows. The Ainge home has Moorish archways and wrought 
ironwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour is 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. Tickets are $10 for adults and $8 for 
students and seniors. Tickets can be bought at the high school or the homes to 
be toured. 
</P>
<P>
 Zung said proceeds from the tour pay for student scholarships at Hoover High 
and for educational materials. STEVE RYFLE

 A 27-year-old woman was killed Thursday afternoon when she lost control of her 
car on a winding road while driving under the influence of alcohol, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman sped into a curve on Bouquet Canyon Road, south of Vasquez Canyon 
near Santa Clarita at 2:30 p.m., and the car flipped eight times, hurling her 
90 feet from the auto, said Officer Richard Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said the woman, who was not identified pending notification of her 
relatives, was not wearing a seat belt. She died a short time later at Henry 
Mayo Hospital, he said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

BICYCLIST DIES IN DRIVE-BY ATTACK

<P>
 A bicyclist was shot from a passing car Thursday, then collapsed as he tried 
to flee his attacker on foot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who was not identified, died at a local hospital an hour later, Los 
Angeles Police Detective Mike Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at 4:30 p.m. in the 10600 block of Crockett Street near 
Wheatland Avenue in Sun Valley, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicyclist, believed to be in his early 30s, was riding west on Crockett 
when a white car drove by and a gunman fired several shots, striking him in the 
chest and neck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran half a block and then collapsed in front of a house," Coffey said. 
"Neighbors called 911 and brought out towels for his bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no suspects but believe that a pistol was used, he said. JEANNETTE

 Targeting lawyers and chiropractors who allegedly "buy" patients and bilk the 
insurance industry, 150 law officers swarmed across Ventura County in 26 
simultaneous raids Thursday morning to end a yearlong insurance fraud sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Just minutes after 9 a.m., officers flashed badges and search warrants at 
suspects' homes and offices from Ojai to Agoura Hills and began seizing 
hundreds of pages of allegedly bogus workers' compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon they had arrested 12 people, including one Oxnard Police 
Department reserve officer who also worked as a chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids capped a yearlong undercover inquiry by Ventura County investigators 
and state and national insurance officials that was dubbed "Operation What's Up 
Doc" by Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Two investigators ensconced themselves in a Thousand Oaks office for most of a 
year, posing as Oak Tree Medical Marketing -- a referral service that offered 
to steer workers' compensation claimants to doctors and lawyers for a fee, 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Tree mailed out flyers offering a "resource capable of generating a new 
patient or client base" to doctors and lawyers. Many met with investigators, 
but once they learned that the service would "sell" clients, they refused to 
take the bait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of them said, 'Oh, yes, but you know that what you're doing is 
against the law,' " Bradbury said. However, others took the offer and counseled 
the investigators on how to cover their tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them the opportunity without crossing any entrapment lines," Bradbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chiropractors and physicians offered money and were prepared to pay money 
for patients," said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. John Geb, who runs his office's 
fraud unit. "That's called capping, and it's against the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Some suspects paid fees of $300 per patient, while others agreed to kick back 
30% of the insurance payments to Oak Tree in exchange for patients, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover detectives and investigators posing as patients then showed up at 
chiropractors' offices and received treatment that was double- and 
triple-billed to insurance companies, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have developed a significant number of leads regarding other 
professionals" involved in capping and fake billing, Bradbury said. He offered 
them amnesty from prosecution if they step forward in the next 30 days and 
agree to testify about the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping and workers' compensation fraud cost the insurance industry millions 
every year. Some of the offices raided Thursday were billing hundreds of 
thousands of dollars annually in fake workers' compensation claims, said 
Michael L. Powell of the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit 
investigative group funded by the insurance and rental car industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and attorneys involved in it "are prostituting their professions," 
said Jerry Treadway of the California Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 people arrested will be charged with fraud and capping under the 
insurance and business and professions codes, and more charges may follow, 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office identified those arrested as Martin Harary, 50, 
an Oxnard attorney; David Clemens, 48, an Oxnard chiropractor, and Dr. Gary 
Rick, 49, a Ventura psychologist. The three are accused of paying for patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they plan to charge Tom Fontenot, 43, an Oxnard police 
reserve officer who worked as a chiropractor in Camarillo and who allegedly 
billed insurers for services he did not render; chiropractor Steven Spunt, 34, 
Fontenot's office partner, who allegedly agreed to pay for patient referrals; 
Simi Valley chiropractor John Clark, 47, who allegedly discussed ways of 
defrauding an insurer with an undercover investigator, and Debra Martyn, 30, 
Clark's office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they also expect to charge Moorpark chiropractor Michael 
Hemphill, 47, and his wife, Julie Hemphill, 45, for allegedly agreeing to pay 
for patient referrals; Westlake Village law partners Steven Gross, 50, and Rand 
E. Pinsky, 45, for allegedly agreeing to pay for client referrals, and Agoura 
Hills attorney Donald Wylie, 46, for allegedly filing false claims with the 
Workers' Compensation Appeals Board.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HORSE SANCTUARY FACES EVICTION OVER 
COMPLAINTS, CASH SHORTAGE 
</P>

 A Newhall horse sanctuary that provides care for animals that would otherwise 
be slaughtered is being evicted because of complaints from neighbors and 
failure to make rent payments, officials who manage the property said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Equus Rescue and Sanctuary, one of the few facilities of its kind in the 
country, moved from Shadow Hills to its present 25-acre location in June, lured 
by the $2,500 monthly rent. But additional costs ultimately raised the charge 
to $4,500 a month for the sanctuary, which depends solely upon donations, 
co-director Linda Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have found out the cost of the facility, we have to move on," she 
said. "We will pay him up, but we want to get out of the deal too." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the property has ordered the sanctuary to pay $5,000 of a $15,000 
bill by today or face immediate eviction proceedings. Moss said she does not 
know if she can make the payment. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if the payment is made, the sanctuary has received a notice to vacate 
the property within 60 days, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The rental agreement calls for the sanctuary to pay the monthly rental fee 
plus half of the property taxes on the land, said Graham Boswell, manager of 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the contract requires the shelter to carry liability insurance 
for property owner Sam Smiser and for the volunteers who work with the horses. 
Boswell said the sanctuary violated those terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have also received written complaints from the county supervisor's office 
regarding flies and odor from the ranch," he said. "We also received complaints 
from property owners in the mobile-home park next door about dust caused by the 
horses running around." 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctuary feeds and provides medical care for about 120 horses, many from 
stockyards that sell them to slaughterhouses. Moss said she knows of only two 
other sanctuaries in the country, but believes that others have opened 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 She dismissed the complaints from residents, noting that the same comments 
were made when Smiser operated a mule ranch on the property. Boswell said 
Smiser may move his mules back to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse sanctuary, which has operated under different names at various 
locations for more than four years, will open at a new location, Moss said. 
However, she does not know if it will remain in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that the area is home to more than 10,000 horses, and 
many local horse enthusiasts welcomed the sanctuary as a natural addition. But 
Ann Irvine, a member of the Newhall Trail Riders, said it wasn't visible enough 
when it came to raising funds from local residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community needed to be more a part of it," she said. "They tend to forget 
if they're not constantly reminded." 
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the sanctuary come from all over the country, usually in small 
donations, said Sandy Waldrop, the shelter's other director. The center's small 
group of volunteers work full time at other jobs and don't have the time needed 
for major fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need a big sponsor like Budweiser or Pepsi," she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TEACHERS WARY OF CRIME-TIP REWARD PROGRAM; 
SCHOOLS: SOME IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY DISTRICT SAY OFFERING CASH TO STUDENTS WHO 
TURN IN THEIR PEERS FOR GUNS AND DRUGS SENDS THE WRONG ETHICAL MESSAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks after the Antelope Valley Union High School District began rewarding 
students with cash for turning in peers who carry guns and drugs, some teachers 
in the district are expressing discomfort with the program, calling it morally 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Kennedy, president of the Antelope Valley Teachers Assn. and a teacher at 
Quartz Hill High School, said instructors fear that the program -- which 
rewards students with $25 for their crime tips -- may send teen-agers the wrong 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be teaching students to do this because it is the right thing to 
do," said Kennedy, whose union represents 470 teachers in the five-high school 
district. "By interjecting money into it, we destroy the ethical nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy also criticized the Antelope Valley school board for instituting the 
program without consulting teachers. The first time he heard of the program, he 
said, was when it appeared on the school board's agenda two days before the 
panel met. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board member Sue Stokka said the program was unanimously approved 
at "a public board meeting. . . . It should not have been a surprise to 
anyone." She added that Kennedy attended the meeting and could have voiced 
disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's concern in implementing the reward program was for the children, 
Stokka said. "Reality is that this money would encourage someone that would not 
otherwise report it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Parks, a teacher at Quartz Hill High who is secretary of the teachers 
union, said: "This whole policy caught us all by surprise. . . . I don't 
believe there was any teacher discussion of this before it was done." 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of the program, she said, she found posters and bumper 
stickers in her campus mailbox that warned, "Get arrested and get expelled." 
Parks said she fears the program is "turning the school into a model that looks 
like law enforcement rather than education." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trivial amount of money and it's ineffective," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, principals at district schools said the program is widely backed 
on their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have unilateral support for the program. No teacher has come to me and 
expressed displeasure," said Jeffrey E. Foster, principal of Littlerock High 
School, where six student tips have led to five arrests under the new program. 
</P>
<P>
 At Palmdale High School, Principal Darrell Havens said, "As far as I know, 
everyone is very supportive of it." He added that many students had given 
campus security crime tips before the cash bonus program. Now the only 
difference is the money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the financial incentive is partly what has bothered district teachers in 
the brief time the program has been in place. Teachers said their students were 
comfortable when they informed authorities before, and that should remain the 
case now. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression over the last few years has been that (campus) security had 
real good success to get students to tip them off without any rewards program," 
said Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Students have expressed opposing views about the cash-for-crime-tips program. 
Some have supported it, saying guns and drugs are too much of a problem in 
their schools. But others say $25 is too little to put their lives in jeopardy 
and face the possible retaliation of their peers and gangs, even though school 
officials promise confidentiality.

SANTAS IN THE SUN; GROUP OF WOULD-BE ST. NICKS GET SOME TIPS WHILE LOUNGING 
AROUND THE POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RESPERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a scene so rife with cliches that its description seems almost 
apocryphal: 10 Santas lounging around the pool Thursday at the Four Seasons 
Hotel, dressed for a balmy December day in T-shirts and shorts, getting 
last-minute instructions on how to handle those tiny tots with their eyes all 
aglow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing to remember is that Santa never goes to the bathroom," said 
Joel Reyes, who will perform Santa duties at the Beverly Center. "You have to 
say, 'Santa's going to feed the reindeer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes and nine others were taking part in Western Temporary Services' "Santa 
School," a crash course for those who wish to transform themselves into that 
jolly old soul for a season. The group sat stroking their white beards and 
learned the do's and don'ts from Santa School Headmistress Jenny Zink. 
</P>
<P>
 Zink, who works with the temporary agency, said she has been teaching men and 
women how to portray Santa at malls, hospitals and special events for 25 years. 
It's a job she takes seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to stay in character," she said. "They can't let their guard down 
for a minute because they can't disappoint the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Zink led the group through their routines with tips on keeping their beards in 
place and speaking softly and soothingly to a child. Santas are cautioned not 
to be too energetic with the "Ho, ho, ho's" lest they frighten a young child. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the weather in Los Angeles is a tad warmer than at the North Pole, 
Santas were reminded to bathe well and use deodorant. Garlic is a no-no, and 
Mr. Claus should keep mints handy to avoid having breath that could light up 
Rudolph's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa hygiene is important," said Terri Francis, branch manager of Western 
Temporary's office in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraying Santa in the '90s involves new rules and regulations. Santas are 
advised to always refer to a child's "folks" instead of "mommy" and "daddy" in 
an effort to be politically correct in the age of alternative households. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important to avoid any actions that might lead to accusations of 
child abuse. The guidelines are a small price to pay, many said, for the 
opportunity to play a man who is loved by millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids look at Santa like he's God," said Todd Schwartz, a writer/actor who 
lives in Hollywood. "Playing him has been a lifelong dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, it's the only job I can get where I can gain a little weight and get 
chubby and it's OK," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he saw no conflict in the fact that he is a Jewish Santa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Claus has always been Jewish," he said with a twinkle in his eye. "We 
just don't talk about it much." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency attracts a variety of people from different professions who get a 
kick out of being Santa for a season, Zink said. Participants are paid hourly 
wages based on their assignments, but many have other reasons for donning the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kids," said Joe Purnell, a program director for an organization that 
works with mentally handicapped people. "They are so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Purnell said he has dressed up as Santa for the past 17 years. His white beard 
is real. 
</P>
<P>
 Class ended with the men stuffing their ample frames (pillows helped some 
Santas maintain the proper girth) into their red suits and striding through the 
hotel -- to the delight of guests -- to attend Santa graduation in the hotel 
dining room. The tassels on Santa caps were flipped from one side to the other 
and the men received diplomas before dining on Santa's favorite meal -- cookies 
and milk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been great having them here," said Four Seasons General Manager Paul V. 
Pusateri. "The fall is such a busy time in L.A., and it's wonderful to take a 
little bit of time to just enjoy the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Santas in one location is a dream for any child, and Randy Jackson Jr. was 
no exception. The 2-year-old son of Randy Jackson of Jackson Five fame was 
mesmerized when he happened upon the convention of Clauses as they ho-ho-hoed 
outside of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time he's seen Santa," his mother, Alexandra Loaiza, cq 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the jolly fat fellows were dispatched to spread Christmas cheer and 
fulfill Yuletide wishes of the young and old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my divorce," Helen Leverton of Santa Clarita requested of Reyes as he 
stepped off the elevator in full Santa regalia at the Beverly Center. "I've 
been waiting for 18 months, and I go to court on the 19th." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ho ho ho," Reyes replied. "Santa will work on it."

RARE HEARING TO DECIDE THE FATE OF 2 DOGS; ANIMALS: WITNESSES ACCUSE THE 
ROTTWEILERS, WHO FACE A DEATH SENTENCE, OF TRIPPING AND FRIGHTENING THEM. THE 
OWNER AND HIS FAMILY SAY THE PETS ARE GOOD-NATURED.

<P>
 The fate of their family pets hanging in the balance, Rocky Hale called his 
teen-age daughter to the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you love your dogs?" the father asked, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said Tami Hale, a Newbury Park eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want your dogs to be killed?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do your dogs deserve to be killed?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue were two Rottweilers, Heidi and Rommel, who have repeatedly escaped 
to chase, trip and, it is said, sometimes bite neighbors. In an unusual 
proceeding known as a dangerous-dog hearing that stretched more than four hours 
Thursday, the Hale family fought to save Rommel from a death sentence and Heidi 
from a spaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, an inspector for the Camarillo public works department, vowed to leave 
no stone unturned in the defense of his dogs. Sam Morris, the hearing officer 
from Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control, said the hearing was by far 
the longest he has seen in almost three years of conducting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there were only three or four dangerous-dog hearings a year in 
all of Los Angeles County. A verdict will be announced within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers and fearful neighborhood residents said the dogs were 
dangerous and their owners had proved themselves unable to control them. 
</P>
<P>
 John Andersen said one of the dogs tripped him and bit his running partner at 
6 a.m. on Nov. 16. "I'm still scared," said the 137-pound Andersen, who said he 
runs 70 to 80 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rommel, the male dog and the older of the two, weighs 130 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen suffered scrapes and cuts from his fall, but returned to the 
neighborhood after the attack to assist animal control officers in capturing 
the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Virginia Suggs, said her husband had been attacked by the 
dogs while riding his bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to get off his bike and use his bike as a shield, because the dog was 
still coming on," Suggs said. "He was very scared." 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor, a dog owner herself, described stalking the dogs in a car with a 
camera, trying to get pictures to prove they were running loose. Another dog 
owner accused the Hales of a "lack of concern," because the dogs were out "a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 "I could feel the fear coming up my legs," said one neighbor. "I was afraid 
because they were coming at me and one of them was growling." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said his neighbors disliked him because he played loud music, had a 
broken-down truck in his front yard and owned the large dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, who said he has always wanted to be a lawyer, raised a series of 
questions about the testimony of his neighbors and about the propriety of the 
proceeding itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said Andersen "could have tripped over a pothole. He could have tripped 
over anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the dog did trip Anderson, why didn't it finish off its prey? Hale 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the bodies? Where are the victims?," he asked. "They're 
Rottweilers. They intimidate people, but they are not vicious. People are 
afraid of the breed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said he recently built a dog-proof enclosure in his back yard, believing 
that doing so could avert a dangerous-dog hearing and guarantee the return of 
his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said Animal Control Sgt. Frank Bongiorno had derailed the compromise. 
Bongiorno greeted Hale with a handshake at the start of the hearing, but Hale 
showed nothing but contempt for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd have known it was you I wouldn't have shaken your hand," Hale said to 
Bongiorno. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad blood between the two goes back to June, when, according to testimony, 
Bongiorno threatened the Hales with hefty fines and jail time for failing to 
control their dogs. But Bongiorno said the fines and risk of jail would 
disappear if the Hales would only sign their dog over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have taken his intimidation, our dogs would be dead right now," 
Hale said Thursday. "The man has been vindictive. He's been out to get our 
Rottweilers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bongiorno said Rommel was "aggressive" and a danger to public safety. Heidi, 
when with Rommel, has a "pack mentality," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said he was notified only Tuesday that the hearing was going to take 
place Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not enough time to prepare a case," said Ventura County Humane Society 
President Joyce George, who faxed a statement to Hale Thursday. The statement, 
which Hale read in the board room at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, called 
for the hearing to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to calling his daughter Tami as a witness, Hale also called his 
wife, Peggy, his 17-year old son, Shane, and his 6-year old daughter, Tanya. 
They all testified that the dogs were good-natured. Tanya said Rommel slept on 
the floor next to her bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths said they had taken the dogs to school and to the beach without any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs were being held at the Agoura Animal Shelter and not present at the 
hearing. "They can't testify," said Bob Ballenger of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said he was not optimistic about the dogs' chances. "We'll lose Rommel. 
There's not a doubt in my mind about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, the hearing officer, will recommend a decision to the director of 
animal care and control, who will make a decision on the case. The decision is 
subject to appeal, but Hale said he probably lacks the funds to pursue the case 
further.

a 2-year-old contract.

FULLERTON FREE SAFETY SHOUP EARNS FREQUENT FLYER POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy talks about his team's defense, his favorite 
phrase is, "We're not very big, but we sure fly to the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's description most aptly fits Kevin Shoup, a sophomore free safety from 
Esperanza High. Shoup is 5 feet 11, listed at 178 pounds, but it's doubtful he 
weighs that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he is one of the hardest-hitting defensive backs in the Mission 
Conference. And his play has made him a favorite target of damage-minded 
offensive linemen looking for a smaller target. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wear No. 6 but the coaches always kid me that it looks like No. 9 when I 
get knocked to the ground," Shoup said. "But I really don't know why linemen 
come after me." 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious reason: Shoup is often around the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He leads Fullerton defensive backs with 32 solo tackles. He also has a 
team-high three interceptions and is second with nine pass deflections. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an All-Central Division pick this year after making the 
honorable-mention team last season. Shoup and his teammates travel to Santa 
Maria, where Fullerton (6-3-1) plays Allan Hancock (7-3) in the K-Swiss Bowl at 
1 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy can't pass on the chance to make fun of Shoup's size and looks, calling 
him "Pasty, pale and anemic," but he also praises him like few others. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great kid," Murphy added. "But to look at him, you would think he's 
been through the wrath of God . . . He's a sneaky assassin. He's just a very 
talented football player." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoup has given out and absorbed many punishing hits in two seasons at 
Fullerton but has only once been knocked out of a game. That happened three 
weeks ago against Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of the first half, Shoup was closing in on running back Ace 
Riggins to make an open-field tackle. Fullerton linebacker Juan Esquivel was 
charging from behind and hit Riggins at the same time Shoup did. 
</P>
<P>
 Esquivel's forearm hit Shoup in the helmet and Shoup fell down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I blacked out for a second," he said. "I got up and tried to run off the 
field, but I was out of it. They asked me where I was and I knew the answer, it 
was on the tip of my tongue, it just took awhile to say it. But we caused a 
fumble on the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoup didn't start out as the kind of defender Murphy raves about. 
</P>
<P>
 He mostly played soccer growing up and credits that sport with developing his 
quickness. He didn't play organized football until he was a freshman. He 
started at running back but rarely played. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoup played more as a sophomore and made varsity as a junior. But not as a 
running back.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he excelled at defensive back despite being 5-9 and about 145 pounds. 
It matched his way of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offense is about execution," he said. "On defense you have a lot more freedom 
to move to the ball and knock somebody's head off." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoup had four interceptions as a senior and earned All-Orange County honors, 
but because of his size, he wasn't recruited by four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 He had run track as a junior but took his senior spring off to have minor knee 
surgery and decide what community college he would attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had gone 1-9 the year before and didn't have a coach, so he figured 
he'd go to Orange Coast with high school teammate and friend Travis McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murphy was hired in the spring of 1993 and Shoup considered Fullerton 
again. But the person who changed his mind was Hornet defensive back Coach Al 
Feloa.  
</P>
<P>
 "He called me up all the time and told me he loved the way I played," Shoup 
said. "In the end I couldn't pass that up." Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton quarterback Marc O'Brien has completed 66% of his attempts for 2,192 
yards and 14 touchdowns. He has also rushed for four touchdowns. Steve Correa 
leads Fullerton with 45 catches for 697 yards. James Hartford, a running back, 
leads with four touchdown passes. Mike Jacot is the rushing leader with 560 
yards in 85 attempts.

HOLMES SEEKS TO RULE SUNSET LEAGUE AGAIN; BASKETBALL: FORMER FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
STAR COMES BACK TO COACH MARINA, WHICH IS TRYING TO RECAPTURE ITS GLORY DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Holmes once ruled the basketball courts of the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3 forward from Fountain Valley was a two-time all-county selection 
by The Times and was named Sunset League most valuable player in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 In his junior and senior years at Fountain Valley, Holmes led the Barons to 
league titles. Fountain Valley also was undefeated in league both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league was very balanced at that time," said Laguna Hills Coach Dave 
Brown, then the coach at Fountain Valley. "Back-to-back titles was unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
 After averaging 23 points his senior season, Holmes was recruited by Wyoming, 
Oklahoma State and other universities but chose Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "He was the best all-around player I've ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
 That's all ancient history. "It's so long ago, I don't think any of these kids 
knew about it," Holmes said, "until my athletic director clued them in." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes has returned to the Sunset League to coach Marina. He coached at Santa 
Margarita from 1990-92 after spending nine seasons as an assistant under Jim 
Harris at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an assistant to Bill Reynolds at Southern California College the last 
two seasons, but now Holmes is back at the high school level, and he hopes to 
bring back some stability to Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the fourth coach they've had in four years," Holmes said. "They built a 
pretty good tradition until recently." 
</P>
<P>
 During Marina's most recent basketball heyday, Steve Popovich was busy 
shouting instructions to future Duke center Cherokee Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 With Parks, the 1991 Southern Section Division I player of the year, leading 
the way, Marina reached the Division I-A final with a stunning upset of Mater 
Dei in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Barbara defeated Marina, 50-49, in the championship game, and the 
revolving door began to spin. 
</P>
<P>
 Popovich stayed at Marina for one more season before resigning in 1992 after 
his 16th year. Marina brought in fiery Greg Hoffman, who had built the program 
at Western, but Hoffman lasted only one season.  
</P>
<P>
 Popovich returned to coach the Vikings last season, but now he has returned to 
being an assistant coach to Bill Brummel at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Holmes, who inherits a team that finished 10-16 last season and placed 
sixth in the old eight-team Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of my coaching friends are saying it will take three to four years to 
turn this thing around," Holmes said. "But for me, I don't want to wait. I want 
to get that success now. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I expect our guys to give it their best shot, every time out, they deserve 
the same from me. I don't want to sell this team short. I think I know what it 
takes to have a good program." 
</P>
<P>
 Few would argue about Holmes' basketball knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 His high school teammates called him "coach." Although opposing coaches 
couldn't find ways to stop him, all respected him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great player and person," former Edison Coach Dave Mohs said. "He 
was always kicking our butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "You tend to forget how good he was. He was a winner in every 
sense of the word; a rare gem that doesn't come along too often." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a knee injury cut short his collegiate career, Holmes hopes his 
players will show the same fire he had. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a yeller or screamer," Holmes said, "but I'm demanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Clayton Olivier, who played at Los Amigos and USC, is there beside 
Holmes making the same demands of the Marina players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told the kids that we can't get out there and help them do it," Holmes 
said. "We can only give them our experience and they have to go with it."

 Edison needed to defeat Ocean View in a fourth-place playoff game to receive 
an automatic bid to the Division I-A playoffs, then the Chargers made a 
memorable run under first-year Coach Larry Hirst. Micah Kroeger and Ben Beard 
were among the players who stepped up their performance in the playoffs, and 
Edison raced all the way to the final. There, the Chargers challenged 
highly-touted Mater Dei but lost, 65-59, before 13,395 at the Pond of Anaheim. 
. . . Servite, behind all-league players David Downs, Kristian Vallas, and Mark 
Seaton, finished third in league. But the Friars advanced to the Division 
III-AA final before losing to Santa Margarita. . . . Fountain Valley won the 
league for the first time in five years under Gordon Billingsley, the Times 
Orange County Coach of the Year. League MVP Brandon Leimbach, Danny Hoppie, and 
Phil Domingo led a balanced unit that reached the Division I-AA quarterfinals 
before losing to Long Beach Poly. . . . Huntington Beach's Tony Gonzalez, a 
two-time all-county selection by The Times, earned a scholarship to play 
football and basketball at California. Gonzalez and all-league guard Matt 
Malmquist helped the Oilers advance to the Division II-AA quarterfinals, where 
they lost to Inglewood.

O.C.'S KOLL CO. TRIES HOSTILE BID FOR TEXAS REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE and DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Koll Co. is making a $13.2-million hostile bid for units of two Texas-based 
real estate limited partnerships -- a bottom-fishing move that could pay off 
for the company if it can win over enough of the two funds' 27,000 individual 
investors, most of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll has made a tender offer to buy 51% of the units in two Consolidated 
Capital Properties limited partnerships, which would give the Newport Beach 
developer control. Koll's offers -- $43.75 a unit for one partnership and 
$52.50 for the other -- are 25% and 50% more, respectively, than offers made by 
ConCap Equities, the general partner of the two partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The units in the two partnerships were originally sold at $500 each in the 
early 1980s for a stake in about two dozen apartment buildings across the South 
and Southwest. But their values have plunged because of the real estate bust, 
and investors have not had a cash distribution in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll, in trying to cash in as real estate values are lifting, has put pressure 
on ConCap to raise its offer or face the risk of being booted out, which Koll 
says it may do if its tender offer is successful. That sort of pressure, though 
frequently felt in corporate boardrooms, has rarely been borne on general 
partners, who manage limited partnerships for a fee but generally have strong 
independence and control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a watershed event. It's going to pave the way" for further competitive 
pressures on real estate limited partnerships, said Tom Frame of Paradigm 
Investment Corp., a Bay Area firm that manages partnerships, including the two 
ConCap funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Frame said Koll's move may benefit the limited partners, but only if it spurs 
ConCap or another player to make higher offers. Frame and others who represent 
investors say that Koll's bids are too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think the Koll offer is adequate," said C.E. Patterson, president of 
MacKenzie Patterson Inc., a Moraga, Calif., firm that owns between 1.5% and 
2.5% of the units in each of the two limited partnerships on behalf of 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest of the limited partners (is) being blown by the wayside because 
of the stampede to gobble up real estate at low prices," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll officials did not return telephone calls Thursday seeking comment. In its 
offering papers, the company said it had no plans to liquidate the properties. 
According to the documents, Koll's offers will expire Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at ConCap also did not return calls. However, ConCap, in response to 
Koll's bids, has extended its buyout offer, which was originally set to expire 
today.

COLDWELL BANKER TO HIRE 47 FOR O.C. CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 In a further sign that Orange County's economy is improving, Coldwell Banker 
said Thursday that it is planning to hire 47 full-time workers at its corporate 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to need a whole new slew of people," company spokesman Hugh Siler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the company is looking for computer programmers, database 
administrators, analysts and others. The company plans to buy newspaper 
advertisements and hold a job fair in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it expects to hire the new employees by February. They would 
bring the Mission Viejo-based company's corporate employment to 501. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the next six weeks, we will be adding employees at a rate of nearly 
one per day," said Chandler Barton, president of Coldwell Banker Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new employees will work in an international relocation services 
unit that was formed in conjunction with Integrated Systems Solutions Corp., an 
IBM subsidiary. Coldwell's other two major divisions manage its 300 
corporate-owned real estate offices and about 2,000 affiliates in the United 
States, Canada and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the usual benefits, Coldwell is touting its on-staff physical 
therapist, fitness center, self-defense and aerobics classes, and health 
screening and testing.

O.C. POP BEAT: GAINES: NOT PLAIN FOLK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beset by career uncertainty, mulling over his life's fundamental 
contradictions, Jeffrey Gaines is in much the same position as many others in 
this age of anxiety, except this rock troubadour from Pennsylvania sounds as if 
he's handling it a lot more cheerfully than most. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines first won notice with an album of deeply felt, self-revealing, 
psychologically insightful songs. To go with his stance as a sensitive, 
intelligent, socially aware singer-songwriter, he cooked up a tasteful montage 
of folk, pop, rock and soul influences, with Elvis Costello, John Lennon and 
David Bowie among his most obvious reference points. Gaines' self-titled debut 
got good reviews, kept him on the road for more than 200 solo gigs and sold 
well enough to give him a promising commercial outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Gaines wishes he could stop laying his inner life bare and come out of the 
closet -- bringing with him the flashy stage garb he has stashed there, a 
wardrobe befitting a rowdy, rockin' son of Jumpin' Jack Flash, or maybe even 
Gene Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a bunch of amazing leather pants in my closet in my apartment," 
Gaines said with a mixture of wistfulness and enthusiasm as he spoke recently 
from Denver, a stop on a solo-acoustic tour that brings the Philadelphia-based 
singer to the Coach House tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, 28, didn't have to add that solo folk-rockers tend to look a little 
silly in leather and other rock-star stage garb. But that doesn't stop him from 
entertaining some fantasies that are at odds with his present career reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get up there on stage, it's a contradiction," Gaines said of life as a 
serious-minded troubadour expected to give emotional, highly personal 
performances that can touch people deeply.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be getting women backstage and driving around in a tour bus, 
having Kiss rock 'n' roll fantasies. But that's not the deal. The deal is 
people are looking at you like you know something, and they need something. You 
don't know exactly what that is, so you just give them stuff. And afterward, 
they might say, 'Can I hug you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines says he will give them a hearty hug back, even though he isn't sure he 
wants to be the kind of artist people look to for emotional support. Given his 
druthers, he would rather be up there with a full band, pumping out 
less-than-sensitive walls of sound and being worshiped for it. And who 
wouldn't? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather incite more excitement than reflection," Gaines said. "You grow up 
thinking a concert's supposed to be an exciting event."  
</P>
<P>
 Gaines wants to play for crowds who dance and shout as he struts his stuff. 
Instead, he gets the kind of polite applause reserved for golf galleries.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who won't breathe because they think they might bother the 
deep singer-songwriter who's baring his soul right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines got that reputation with songs that dredged deeply into his own 
experience, including such painful ones as the strained father-son relationship 
recounted in "Sorry the Very Next Day" and, in "Didn't Wanna Be a Daddy," his 
own unwillingness to shoulder the responsibilities of fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On his recent sophomore release, "Somewhat Slightly Dazed," Gaines 
deliberately changed his approach as he came out rocking with an almost 
willfully inarticulate anthem called "I Like You." It sounded like Cheap Trick 
doing one of its lighthearted Beatles knock-offs, and signaled his 
determination not to be pegged as a profound, brooding soul.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides making a bigger noise, Gaines said, he wrote the song because he 
wanted to show that not all life should be analyzed and probed; one should also 
be able to turn off the brain and simply celebrate a moment of joy. Gaines's 
serious-minded side, though, is still well-represented on the 
Beatles-influenced record. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he says that the audience that bought about 100,000 copies of his 
folkish debut -- a solid start -- has dwindled to about 30,000 buyers for 
"Somewhat Slightly Dazed." After fronting a four-piece band in dates following 
the new album's release, Gaines is back in touring's economy class, playing 
solo to cut expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines is part of the wave of black American pop figures who have managed over 
the past few years to knock down some of the narrow racial compartments created 
by the segmented radio programming of the '70s and '80s. Blacks were assumed to 
be funk and R & B performers, playing for predominantly black audiences, while 
whites played rock and folk for other whites. Prince, Terrence Trent D'Arby, 
Tracy Chapman, Living Colour, Lenny Kravitz and others have been able to 
challenge some of those assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines said he was surrounded by "black" music -- '60s soul and '70s funk -- 
while growing up in Harrisburg, Pa. Wanting something of his own in a family 
where everybody was pretty good at singing soul songs around the house, he 
began cultivating an interest in rock music, from Kiss to the Beatles and Elvis 
Presley. As a teen-ager, he fell for the brooding-Brit style of Ian McCulloch 
of Echo and the Bunnymen. 
</P>
<P>
 But he almost wound up a funk singer anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 22, singing with a funk band in Pennsylvania to get experience and earn 
some money, when he was discovered by a New York City R & B band, Maggie's 
Dream. They enlisted Gaines and were about to record an album for Capitol with 
him when he bailed out. Gaines decided to pursue his own career as a 
singer-songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Gaines said, he sometimes gets accused of not sounding black 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get into disputes here and there, 'What's your roots? What's your culture?' 
" His answer is that blacks should be free to make whatever music is true to 
their own tastes and interests. "I tell them, 'I'm what Martin Luther King got 
shot for. Deal with that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now Gaines is trying to figure out how to deal with his latest batch of 
still-unrecorded songs, which have been coming out sounding like the early Who. 
Not, he acknowledges, the sort of thing that's been ruling the charts lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, 'Oh man, are you digging your grave, are you insane?' What I'm 
thinking of doing is not something that makes a (commercial) difference any 
more. Why am I still questing at it? So, basically, I have a lot to think about 
on my next record." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines sees some absurdity in his position. Wondering how popular he can be, 
preoccupied with what styles he should adopt, what kind of career he should 
aspire to have, he gets a sense of deja vu: "My adolescent life continues on in 
what's supposed to be my adult life. It's so odd. When will this not be high 
school? It still is." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even as he debates whether to be confessionally folkish or rocking in 
leather, he is certain that he likes the basic enterprise of playing music.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing torturing me. People let me get up and sing my thing. So I 
say, thank you for letting me be myself for another night." 
</P>
<P>

MOVIE REVIEW; HOLIDAY COMEDY GETS CAUGHT IN THAT 'TRAPPED' FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Trapped in Paradise" may well be the worst Christmas movie since 1964's 
"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" -- that's the one in which Pia Zadora 
played a Martian child. It holds its audience hostage for an unconscionable 111 
minutes with a rambling, unfunny, thickly sentimental comedy that plays like 
third-rate Frank Capra. 
</P>
<P>
 As bad as it is, it's understandable that players of the caliber of Nicolas 
Cage, Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey became involved because by and large their 
parts are well-written and because at the film's core is a viable idea: a trio 
of inept bank robbers find themselves stuck on a snowy Christmas Eve in a 
Norman Rockwell/Grandma Moses village called Paradise, Pa., where most 
everybody is so darn nice that these bad guys find themselves swamped by sheer 
goodness. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, writer-director George Gallo allows his essentially simple 
story to wander quite literally all over the countryside, piling it on with 
needless digressions and failing to make any of them more than faintly amusing. 
As it is, it takes him an interminable 45 minutes for his premise to kick in, 
and that's when the three brothers Firpo find themselves inadvertently sitting 
down to Christmas dinner with the family of the saintly president (Donald 
Moffat) of the local bank they've just knocked over.  
</P>
<P>
 Typically, just as this sequence starts building amusingly, Gallo yanks the 
Firpos away from the table and sends them on their wanderings.  
</P>
<P>
 The taut structure and crisp writing and direction needed to get away with 
such old-fashioned holiday uplift is precisely what's lacking. Robert Folk's 
heart-tugging score also detracts, giving the film the glazed quality of a 
candied apple. 
</P>
<P>
 The stars themselves are fine -- Cage as the smartest, most-conflicted of the 
brothers, a classic good-bad guy; Lovitz as a crass, cynical compulsive liar, 
and Carvey as a goofy, high-voiced kleptomaniac -- but the movie is too much a 
mess for their considerable presence to redeem it. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY CALENDAR; 71 YEARS LATER, IT STILL ADDS UP; THEATER: ELMER RICE'S 
RADICAL 'MACHINE,' REVIVED AT CAL STATE FULLERTON, IS LIKE A MORALITY PLAY 
WHOSE ISSUES REMAIN RELEVANT TODAY, SAYS ITS DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elmer Rice's active career in the theater lasted longer than any other 
American playwright's, including that of his famous contemporary Eugene 
O'Neill. During a span of half a century, Rice turned out roughly 50 plays. At 
his peak in the '20s and '30s, he seemed to dominate Broadway, not only as a 
prolific writer but as a firebrand voice for the disenfranchised. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Rice is not a name to conjure with these days. Most ordinary theatergoers 
probably haven't heard of him. If people know of him at all, it is perhaps for 
his 1929 Pulitzer Prize-winning "Street Scene," a naturalistic depiction of 
tenement life in New York, later remade as an opera with music by Kurt Weill 
and lyrics by Langston Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Meredith Wright has chosen to stage an earlier, more radical play: "The 
Adding Machine," opening tonight at Cal State Fullerton's Performing Arts 
Center. The revival comes 71 years after the original production burst like a 
thunderclap on the Broadway scene, earning Rice huge acclaim as the great 
American avatar of Expressionist drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a 32-year-old graduate director completing her Master of Fine Arts 
degree, likens the rarely seen work to a morality play. It tells the cautionary 
tale of Mr. Zero, a lecherous white-collar drone unhappily married to a shrew. 
He is fired by his boss after 25 years on the job and replaced in the name of 
efficiency by an automatic adding machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something in the nature of what we're now going through as a country -- a 
kind of spiritual, economic and philosophic crisis -- makes it fitting to do a 
revival," Wright proposed in a recent interview. "I think it's a very clever 
play with a lot of timely things to say. I don't think it's Shakespeare. It has 
its flaws. But there's a lot of humor and a lot of meaning in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice thought of "The Adding Machine" as an amalgam of "comedy, melodrama, 
fantasy, satire and polemics." He described it as "the case history of one of 
those enslaved souls who are both the raw material and the product of a 
mechanized society." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said she wants to make her production "as new and remarkable as (the 
play) must have been when it was first done in 1923." A tall order to be sure, 
but she seems to specialize in uncommon revivals at Cal State. Last season she 
directed "The Kingdom of Earth," a neglected work by Tennessee Williams; she 
followed it with Euripides's little known "Helen." 
</P>
<P>
 The characters in "The Adding Machine" are symbolic abstractions -- Mr. and 
Mrs. Zero's social circle consists of the Ones, Two, Threes and so on -- but 
"they make a strong personal statement," Wright contended. "Somehow the whole 
idea relates to living in Los Angeles and feeling like a zero, which I think 
many people are struggling with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to achieve success, and yet they can't help wondering whether 
they're looking for the right thing or barking up the wrong tree. They're 
working to achieve all those goodies they want in life. At the same time 
they're worried that they've misplaced their souls along the way. The way we 
live seems so full of greed and meaninglessness."' 
</P>
<P>
 A relative newcomer to Southern California, Wright seems determined to climb 
the ladder of success herself. That is why she came here to enroll in graduate 
school, after professional experience in technical and administrative jobs at 
the Arena Stage and the Shakespeare Theatre, both in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that if you want a lifetime career as a director in this country, 
you have to have an MFA," she said. "I kept noticing that people who did the 
hiring were interested in my background, but they usually offered the better 
jobs that took you up the directing ladder to somebody with an MFA." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Pascagoula, Miss., where her father was a civil-rights lawyer during 
the early '60s, Wright grew up in Washington and received her bachelor's degree 
in theater from Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. For two years she 
also trained in acting and directing at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and 
the Drama Studio, both in London. 
</P>
<P>
 She has managed to keep her foot in the professional door even as a grad 
student. She spent a year on staff at the now-defunct Los Angeles Theatre 
Center, assisting producing director Diane White. Wright also served as company 
manager for two LATC tours of Reza Abdo's avant-garde epic "The Hip-Hop Waltz 
of Eurydice" to Canada and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, taking a break from rehearsals for "The Adding Machine," she 
returned to Europe to work as the assistant director of the first "Star Trek" 
stage production: "The Lost Voyage of the Enterprise." It closed Nov. 26 after 
a successful limited run at the 800-seat Churchill Theatre in Bromley, a suburb 
of London. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought all the 'Star Trek' episodes that I watched as a teen-ager 
would come in so handy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Adding Machine" by Elmer Rice opens tonight at 8 and will continue 
through Dec. 11 at the Cal State Fullerton Performing Arts Center, State 
College Boulevard at Nutwood Avenue, Fullerton. Performances are in the Recital 
Hall. $6 to $8. (714) 773-3371.

 League coaches pick the Griffins as the favorite although they suffered two 
big losses. Forward Ryan Staniec, now at UC Santa Barbara, and Tim Lin, now at 
Claremont, combined to average 35 points last season. "And Tim made 105 
three-pointers last season," Brooks said. "Those are some big shoes to fill." 
If he can find people to put the ball in the basket, Brooks has one of the 
county's best point guards to distribute the ball. Ton averaged 10 assists in 
the regular season. Vandervoet also started last season and averaged nine 
points and seven rebounds. "He is so much improved," Brooks said. Johnson led 
the team in scoring during the summer and he will also pick up some of the 
scoring slack. Brooks is also excited about Glass, the JV's MVP last season. 
"By the end of the season, he'll be one of the better sophomores in Orange 
County," Brooks said. Corbin, a top-notch defensive player, Komer and Lamoureux 
will also contribute. SCHEDULE

 Borchert returns after a one-year sabbatical. Larry Hirst, who is now one of 
Borchert's assistants, led the Chargers to within one victory of a Southern 
Section championship. Borchert was on hand at The Pond of Anaheim to watch 
Mater Dei narrowly defeat Edison by six points in the Division I-A championship 
game. Borchert is excited about this season's squad, a group that "works harder 
than any I've ever had," Borchert said. "It could be a little rocky early, but 
if we hang together, I think we'll really start to jell by mid-January." Four 
of the Chargers' top seven players--including projected starters Lisotto, Ogas 
and Kurz--just finished football season, so it will take time for them to get 
adjusted. Langdon is one of the team's best outside shooters and Lightman is a 
good penetrator. "Scoring won't be a problem," Borchert said. "If we can defend 
big people and hold our own on the boards, we'll be able to compete." SCHEDULE

 Billingsley isn't bashful about saying how last season's team was one of his 
favorites. "Everyone knew their roles," he said. "They'd dive on the floor, 
always hustle and play tough." But the gritty leaders from the defending Sunset 
League champions--forward Brandon Leimbach and point guard Danny Hoppie--have 
graduated. "This year, we're trying to fit some square pegs in round holes," 
Billingsley said. The Barons aren't as hard-nosed as last year's group, but 
there are some big positives, including the return of all-league forward 
Domingo. "He's our prime-time player and we're depending on him," Billingsley 
said. Domingo averaged 16 points and eight rebounds in the regular season. 
Tayyar, a transfer from Newport Harbor who averaged 13 points and four assists 
in the regular season, will take over at the point. "He's a fine point guard 
who can give us some scoring punch," Billingsley said. "Talent-wise, Paul is 
probably a better basketball player than Hoppie was." Providing more balance 
for the Barons are Arvesen and Keller. Billingsley hopes they will provide some 
three-point shooting to help open up the middle for Domingo. SCHEDULE

 Holmes, a first-year coach, takes over a team that has struggled. The Vikings 
graduated their two best players--Eric Endsley and Andres Nieto--and three 
other standouts decided not to play this season. But Holmes is undaunted and 
refuses to sell his team short. "Our goal is to make the playoffs," Holmes 
said. "I think Los Alamitos is the best team in the league and Fountain Valley 
is right behind them. Then I think it's a scramble." Worthy is Marina's only 
returner who saw significant playing time last season, averaging six points. 
Bolton averaged three points as a reserve last season and will play small 
forward; Boyd will start at center. "Boyd is inexperienced but he hustles," 
Holmes said. Onishi moves up from a JV team that was 4-10 in league last 
season, but Holmes said his steadiness helped him earn the starting point guard 
spot. Perna, who hasn't played since his freshman year at Ocean View, will 
start at power forward. He is 6-1, 205 pounds, and Holmes likes his toughness 
under the boards. Meyer, who helped the sophomore team tie for the league 
title, will provide some outside shooting. SCHEDULE

 The Aztecs would like to challenge for the their third league championship in 
four seasons, but they will be without sharpshooting guard Mike Thimgan. "He 
helped us win two league titles and finish second one year," Hill said. "He's 
tough to replace. But we do have a dominating player." Hill said Greer will be 
among the county's best. The 6-7, 230-pound junior is a force in the post, and 
Hill said his perimeter game has also improved. Omer is back to start at the 
point, and his play will be also be key to Esperanza's success. Lim provides 
good shooting from three-point range, but more importantly he is the team's 
best defensive player. "This team has great chemistry," Hill said. "The kids 
all get along with each other. We also have depth. A number of guys will push 
for starting spots." Tape and Butler are among those players, and four 
underclassmen will also push to play more, including Gaulden, a 6-4 freshman. 
Gaulden's brother, Sean, is a 6-7 sophomore who could also make an impact.
