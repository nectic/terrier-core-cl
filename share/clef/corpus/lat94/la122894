 BALLS O' FIRE: No, that wasn't a UFO flying across the Ventura County sky. Or 
a plane crash. It was a meteor, complete with green tail, streaking by about 
8:15 Monday night, confirmed Patrick So, astronomy lecturer at Griffith 
Observatory. . . . He said the meteor was about the size of a tennis ball and 
appeared for about 10 seconds. But it drew a lot of attention. Ten pilots in 
planes from Las Vegas to Los Angeles called the FAA to report seeing the 
fireball. Ventura County fire crews were dispatched after reports that the 
meteor landed in Thousand Oaks. They found nothing, and scientists say any 
landing would come with a sonic boom. 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE REBOUND: After a promising start at Buena High, Lance Fay's basketball 
career hit the skids when his Oxnard College team fell apart from internal 
strife. Not to worry. The 6-foot-2 guard transferred to Ventura College, sat 
out a year and is now co-captain of a team ranked No. 1 in the junior college 
state poll (C6). . . . "We have 10 guys that could start at any other JC," Fay 
says. "We have so many offensive weapons. (Opponents) never know who is going 
to be hot or cold." 
</P>
<P>
 BUNDLE OF JOY: Christmas was always extra special for David Sisemore of 
Ventura: It was his birthday. Now it's his son's birthday too. . . . Baby Grant 
wasn't due until Jan. 4, but his parents had barely finished exchanging gifts 
when they rushed to the hospital for the 3:19 p.m. birth. For mother Terry, 
this means consolidating all her shopping for one big day. "I'll just have to 
be creative on how to make their birthday special now," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 CADAVER CLUB: High school students are always busy raising money -- for proms, 
field trips, even band uniforms. But for cadavers? . . . That's right, cadavers 
(B4). With no funding from the school system, Westlake High School's advanced 
anatomy class has formed the Cadaver Club to come up with one-fifth of the 
$6,000 needed to run the program. Hospitals and mortuaries contribute money, 
body bags and plastic gloves too.

STABILIZING WELFARE ROLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerning the Dec. 16 article on the stabilization of the welfare rolls, the 
writer stated that the welfare levels may never decrease because of (among 
other reasons) the increasing number of adult and teen-age women who give birth 
out of wedlock then become dependent on government assistance. The statistics 
stated were of the rise in births out of wedlock this year relative to 1970, 
which may or may not have anything to do with an increase in welfare recipients 
since no statistics relating the two were cited. The information given and the 
way it was presented is fodder for those religious right politicians who 
demonize unwed mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to make a few points in defense of those unwed mothers who are on 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fathers, who are half responsible for the mother's situation, paid for 
50% of the costs of the child, a lot fewer of these women would be on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Let those who have never had sex out of marriage cast the first stone and pass 
judgment on these women for having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 No birth control is 100% effective or without side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 And, aren't these women doing exactly what the religious right would want them 
to do, that is, keeping their babies instead of having abortions? Now that 
these mothers have made this decision, the religious right wishes to punish 
them by taking away the help they need. How is a young woman, alone, able to 
pay for herself, a child and day care on minimum wage? 
</P>
<P>
 Let us not forget that for every unwed mother there is an unwed father who, 
more times than not, has shirked his responsibilities.

 * I offer a simple solution to a major disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time a woman delivers a baby out of wedlock, she pays a fine of $10,000. 
If she can't pay it, she serves 10 years in prison, sans baby. If she can point 
out the baby's father, the father shall be compelled to pay half the fine, or 
serve half of the 10-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 If the unwed mother can demonstrate convincingly that the baby was the result 
of rape or incest, the father shall pay the $10,000 fine, serve the 10-year 
prison term and submit to a surgical procedure that will guarantee he will 
never father another baby. 
</P>
<P>
 In family breakup situations, such as divorce, when children are involved, the 
spouse that initiates the proceedings shall be compelled to take the children 
and provide for their upbringing. Failure to perform adequately shall result in 
the penalties described above. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the states shall offer mothers and fathers a cash bonus, or 
a tax cut, for every baby delivered within the sanctuary of marriage. If it is 
a tax cut, it shall continue until the child reaches maturity as long as the 
parents stay together and raise the child together. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach is radical, but the magnitude of the problem has reached crisis 
proportions. When a natural disaster occurs, the government applies emergency 
procedures. This is such an emergency, and it calls for appropriate measure to 
stem the flood and rebuild society.

 * Your article on the GOP contract (Dec. 18) explores myriad angles of what 
could happen if the basic welfare-state philosophy of the past 60 years (that 
of the government's role as income redistributor), is to be diminished, and 
finds the prospect "chilling." 
</P>
<P>
 The article states "more Americans are now living below the poverty line, 
including more children since 1965." How should a working family feel after 
several generations of sacrifices into a system that swallows everything down 
the drain?

SACRAMENTO DELTA WATER ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Landmark Accord Reached on Use of Bay-Delta Water," Dec. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 The historic agreement reached by Gov. Pete Wilson and senior members of the 
Clinton Administration brings to an end the interminable squabbling that has 
stalemated reasonable water supply planning, development and use. The 
uncertainty of our water future, which has threatened California's economic 
recovery, is resolved -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Water Committee applauds this pact to protect the 
delta and provide reliable water supplies to cities, farms and the environment; 
however, we must not lose sight of the need to extend the agreement and to 
construct badly needed water supply facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has called for a delta "fix." The stage is now set for Californians to 
take command, make the bold stroke, and complete the State Water Project.

 * In "Saving the State's Lifeblood: That Historic Water Accord" (editorial, 
Dec. 20), The Times was on target in explaining the flexibility and beneficial 
aspects of the Endangered Species Act. The act's only drawback is that it 
usually takes effect too late in the game -- when a species has literally 
reached the brink of extinction. By that time, the decisions that have to be 
made concerning a particular activity that is harming a species can be 
far-reaching. As you noted, the act needs sharp teeth to force those tough 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong Endangered Species Act will be necessary until we as a people, and as 
a species, come to grips with the reality that there are limits to what we can 
build, dam, cut down or dig up. All people, and in particular, those who 
condemn the act as an affront to private property rights and progress, must 
learn to accept a sense of responsibility to the children of today, and to the 
children of future generations.

 * The agreement returns decisions about California water to the state, where 
they belong. However, it does not eliminate the need for fundamental reform of 
the Endangered Species Act. The inflexibility of the act has taken a 
significant human toll in terms of lost jobs and businesses in the state. We 
need to ask ourselves what is the true purpose of the law? If a species is 
considered endangered, is this true at a national, state, county, city or back 
yard level? How far do we go?

<P>
 Re "A Spark That Might Ignite," by Chalmers Johnson (Commentary, Dec. 20), I 
can only say "bravo," and why isn't our government listening to this man and 
the American people who believe, unlike our political leaders, that American 
blood and money are not cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 The war was won with North Korea at a terrible cost when the Chinese decided 
to become involved and destroy the Paper Tiger, the United States.The Chinese 
bolstered North Koreans, started the war up again and the United Nations forced 
a political settlement after three more years of supposed negotiations with 
North Korea. During this time more Americans were killed in treacherous acts by 
North Koreans than during the actual war. All this time, the hands of our 
military were tied behind their backs by the U.N. and no-win attitude of the 
U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea has twice the population of North Korea and is a very progressive 
nation with an $8 billion imbalance of trade with the United States. There is 
no reason in the world for American troops to be sacrificing themselves for 
this strong South Korea, no reason for any American troops to be in South Korea 
suffering, no reason for the U.S. to waste $3 billion a year of our needed 
money and no reason for any more American deaths.

A BATTLE ENDS, A WAR GOES ON; TERRORIST TAKEOVER OF AIRLINER WAS BUT ONE FACET 
OF ALGERIA'S CIVIL CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 French officials did what was required at Marseilles' airport on Monday to end 
the hostage drama that had begun in Algiers two days earlier. Thanks to the 
skill with which police commandos carried out their rescue mission, many 
innocent lives were spared. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Algerian Muslim militants who seized the Air France airliner on 
Christmas Eve and soon afterward murdered three of its passengers were 
themselves killed by the commandos. While others aboard the airliner and some 
of their rescuers were injured, none died. Explosives found aboard the plane 
and comments by the terrorists indicated a plan to blow it up in flight, 
possibly above Paris, in a suicide-mass murder spectacle presumably intended to 
dramatize their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of this particular act of terrorism will not, of course, deter 
Algeria's Muslim extremists from continuing their war against a regime that 
seized power almost three years ago. Indeed, within hours after the Marseilles 
rescue, four Catholic priests -- three of them French, one a Belgian -- were 
murdered in northern Algeria. Their "offense" was they were foreigners, a group 
specifically targeted by the militants. More than a year ago one of the radical 
organizations, the Islamic Armed Group, ordered all foreigners out of the 
country on pain of death. Thousands left. Of those who remained, 76 have been 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Algeria's civil war, as was the war for independence against France that began 
40 years ago, is a merciless struggle, one that has already claimed up to 
20,000 lives. The independence that Algeria finally won from a demoralized 
France in 1962 brought it a succession of largely inefficient, corrupt and 
authoritarian governments. Three years ago almost to the day -- the timing of 
the Christmas Eve hijacking was no coincidence -- the Islamic Salvation Front 
won the first round in the country's first free parliamentary elections. The 
scheduled second round of voting was promptly canceled and a state of emergency 
was soon proclaimed. A civil war has been fought ferociously ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a war in which sides can easily be chosen. Algeria's rulers hold 
power against the democratically expressed will of Algeria's voters. But the 
Muslim militants, whose goal is to impose a strict Islamic regime, are no 
friends of democracy or exponents of tolerance. Besides killing foreigners 
because they supposedly represent corrupting outside influences, they also 
attack Algeria's intellectuals and secular members of its middle class. Should 
they win, hundreds of thousands of Algerians will be forced to seek refuge 
abroad. Should they win, their militancy almost certainly will be exported to 
neighboring states. The Air France hijacking was but a skirmish in a vicious 
war, one whose end is tragically nowhere in sight.

MAKING A SHORT INTO AN EPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every day Los Angeles loses valuable film and television production jobs, and 
dollars, to competitors in other states and abroad because of over-regulation 
of the entertainment industry. But you would never know it by watching the Los 
Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 For the better part of a year Mayor Richard Riordan has pressed council 
members to create a friendlier regulatory environment by consolidating 
duplicative city and county film permit offices into a nonprofit agency that 
the city and county would jointly oversee. However, unlike the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors, which quickly approved the merger proposal in May, 
the City Council has been intolerably slow. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 film commissions elsewhere in California and outside the state 
eagerly pick off as many film projects as they can. These so-called "runaway" 
productions cost Southern California as much as $2 billion annually. Red tape 
is a big reason for the exodus, and two different film approval offices in Los 
Angeles is a prescription for red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a report issued last month by the city's chief legislative analyst 
conspicuously gave short shrift to the mayor's consolidation plan, instead 
recommending temporarily housing the city's film permit activities in the Los 
Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau.  
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's merger proposal strikes us as quite reasonable and the council's 
apparent reluctance to discuss it perplexing. Consolidation of film and 
television permitting works to the best interest of both the county and the 
city. Let's move forward on this project . . . quickly. Roll 'em.

 Re "Cuomo Blasts GOP for Worst Kind of Politics," Dec. 17: 
</P>
<P>
 So, New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo recently griped that "Politicians used to 
think of themselves as shepherds. That's all over now.Now the politicians are 
following the sheep: Read the polls! They'll tell you where to go to pasture." 
</P>
<P>
 What? Politicians are actually doing the will of the people. An outrage! Next 
thing you know, we will have a government of the people, by the people, and for 
the people. Heck, we might even end up with a President who actually represents 
the average American. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only marvel at the sheer arrogance and insolent audacity of Cuomo's 
suggestion that the American people are "sheep" who must be herded and pushed 
around by "shepherd" politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess this "most articulate and stalwart" of liberal Democrats still doesn't 
get it. The days of the self-righteous, all-knowing and elitist politicians 
dictating the lives of all the little people from on high are over. President 
Clinton, are you paying attention?

OFF-ROAD ENTHUSIASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "A Desert Dowry" (Dec. 16), you group off-road vehicle enthusiasts like 
myself along with illegal dumpers and land developers as those who are 
contributing to the decimation of Joshua trees in Lancaster. This is unfair to 
off-roaders, who are by and large law-abiding taxpayers who love the desert but 
who happen to actually go out and enjoy it.By comparison, illegal dumpers are 
slovens breaking the law, while powerful developers manipulate the law to their 
own ends, destroy whole areas and call it legal. Moreover, I fail to see how an 
off-roader can do any significant damage to a Joshua tree -- some of them are 
kind of big. 
</P>
<P>
 The preservation of the desert is a very important effort, and many 
off-roaders are more than willing to be a constructive part of the process. 
Unsubstantiated, off-the-cuff and prejudiced allegations are counterproductive.

IT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR HER, ISN'T IT?; EUTHANASIA: NO ONE IS FIT TO JUDGE THE 
QUALITY OF ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ALICE ALTORFER, Mary Alice Altorfer is a mother of five and a college 
student in Santa Maria. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was told that her name was Mary; our only common thread. Other than casting 
quick glances toward her room, this Mary avoided that Mary. I convinced myself 
that I had come only to visit my great aunt who, at the time, was living in a 
nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a regular visitor, I started taking interest in other patients, 
stopping often at different bedsides and wheelchairs to chat or share a 
pleasantry. I avoided the room where Mary lay curled in the fetal position, her 
face resting on her hands, which were clasped together as if in prayer. I 
noticed the nurses go into her room to turn, bathe, feed or change her; all the 
necessary things to maintain a human being in reasonable comfort, except one. 
That is not why I finally went in to see Mary. Curiosity compelled me to go in; 
not kindness, duty or love. The basest of reasons pushed me to do something 
that would forever change my feelings about dying, aging and our treatment of 
the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Just inside Mary's door, I stood staring. She wasn't pretty; I wondered if she 
ever had been. I noticed that there were no pictures of her as a young woman, 
none of the favorite quilts, wedding or baby pictures that families put in 
rooms. It was the starkness of the room that wouldn't let my eyes wander from 
Mary. Her face was almost continuous with her scalp, a few wisps of hair over 
translucent and wrinkled skin. I knew she was blind and possibly deaf. The 
nurses said that she never spoke.  
</P>
<P>
 Mary appeared to be sleeping, so I pulled up a chair and moved closer until I 
was positioned next to her bed. My eyes never tired of her. Sitting there, I 
began to ask myself, "What is her quality of life?" Then, answers came in. My 
thoughts were so ugly that I was embarrassed. She stirred and touched me, 
grasped me, pulling me forward as if to hug me. She raised herself, forcing me 
to reciprocate the intimacy. Then Mary relaxed and found my hands. She brought 
them to her face, alternately turning her cheeks so as to kiss and touch my 
fingers. Her mouth felt dry but her face was wet. My hands were damp with 
tears, hers and mine. Then she dropped my hands, turned on her side and resumed 
her fetal position. 
</P>
<P>
 For some among us, the Marys of the world are vegetables, leaving cost 
effectiveness as the criterion for their treatment, life's intrinsic value 
translated into dollars and cents. The all-too-common phrases of expediency -- 
"It's what's best for him; It's what she would have wanted" -- are death knells 
that eventually haunt all those involved. Mary was not a vegetable. Vegetables 
don't cry. I would like to think of her as an angel. Angels are messengers and 
Mary carried a message. Sometimes it takes more courage to live than it does to 
die.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently passed legislation in Oregon improved the prospects for euthanasia. 
Coupled with abortion's daily assault on unborn life, this makes it an ugly 
time in America to be sick, poor, elderly, handicapped or a child in his 
mother's womb. 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe in angels (and according to cash-register receipts, you must; 
they are the hot-ticket item this year, the dominant theme on calendars, books 
and cards) here is a gentle reminder: Spiritual fulfillment or trendy religion, 
across this land there is a serious soul-searching and a craving for winged 
guardians. But Lucifer also was an angel.

PERSPECTIVE ON ALGERIA; A VOTE NULLIFIED BECOMES TERRORISM; THE ISLAMISTS ARE 
COMING TO POWER; THE WEST CAN INFLUENCE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS BY A VOTE OR IN A 
SPASM OF VIOLENCE.

<P>
 The hijacking of a French airliner by Islamic extremists represents a new 
phase of escalation in a struggle for power in Algeria between the 
quasi-military government and Islamist forces, both radical and moderate. The 
United States would be well-advised to avoid being caught between France and 
the Algerians.  
</P>
<P>
 Algeria has been lumbering toward its moment of truth for the past two years 
as a brutal civil war between a dying authoritarian regime and increasingly 
violent Islamist forces lurches to denouement. The West almost certainly will 
have to face the reality of an Islamic fundamentalist regime coming to power in 
Algiers in the next year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications are major. Algeria is the dominant force in North Africa. 
Algiers is closer to Paris by air -- or missile -- than to Tamanrasset, 
Algeria's southernmost city. Algeria's oil and gas supplies are of growing 
importance to Europe; Spain will soon derive most of its natural gas from 
Algeria. The victory of an Islamist regime in Algeria will stimulate other 
Islamist movements in the region, especially Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 The West thus has plenty of reason to worry. Iran and Sudan, the only two 
Islamist regimes in power, hardly provide edifying models of enlightened or 
successful rule.  
</P>
<P>
 It did not have to have be this way. To some, the Algerian government's 
decision to annul the December, 1991, elections, in which the Islamists won a 
plurality, was a serious mistake. Washington is to be faulted for acquiescing 
out of concern for Islamists coming to power. In the end, the repressive 
tactics pursued by the Algerian military regime -- banning the Islamic 
Salvation Front (FIS), arresting its leaders and conducting a campaign of 
violence -- have failed. Its only accomplishment has been to strengthen the 
radicals within FIS and push them to greater violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that the FIS is almost certain to come to power as existing 
authority collapses in Algeria. The question is no longer whether, but how. Do 
we want an FIS that comes to power in a spasm of violence, civil collapse, 
anarchy and vengeance? That was how Ayatollah Khomeini seized absolute power in 
1979. Or do we want power achieved by military coup, this time by officers 
sympathetic to FIS who want to end the civil war? That was how the Sudanese 
regime -- one that violates most precepts of Islam in its governance -- came to 
power in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The last best hope for preserving any shred of moderation is for the FIS to 
come to power by renewed elections, which it would surely win. Such an 
environment would preserve a framework of constitutionality. It would preserve 
the presidency, Parliament, the military and other institutions. It would at 
least suggest that an FIS that came in by the ballot box should be required to 
eventually depart by the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the FIS be trusted to abide by democratic means once in power? Not at all. 
Indeed, the present government cannot be trusted to rule democratically either. 
But isn't it better to have pro-Western authoritarians in power than 
potentially anti-Western ones? The issue is not that simple. The status quo is 
not tenable; a non-representative, failing, Western-supported (read France) 
regime hated by the public offers nothing positive for the future.  
</P>
<P>
 We can be sure that Islamists in power in Algeria will institute some laws and 
social regulations that are not congenial to the West. Neither are those in 
Saudi Arabia, China or other places we do business with. 
</P>
<P>
 One might prefer that Islamists not come to power. But they are a significant 
force in the Muslim world. They are organized at the grass roots, outspoken 
against corruption and strong on social programs. These are among the reasons 
why they are popular. And they stand against unpopular and ineffective regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the most radical elements in these movements can be contained only 
by more moderate Islamist elements. These elements are gaining political 
experience, facing the realities of the modern world. The future struggles lie 
between more moderate and more radical Islamist forces; everyone demands better 
governance. Once Islamists are part of the political process, much of the 
"magic" they are popularly thought to wield will be revealed for what it is: 
another political party that may or may not have better answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamists are coming in Algeria. It is hoped that this time Washington can 
influence Algiers to make the process a controlled, legal and constitutional 
one. Time is short. There are no guarantees along any path. But surely, 
extension of the present murderous environment in Algeria does not suggest a 
better course.

ISRAEL'S ALBATROSS BECOMES A VULTURE; MIDDLE EAST: WILL THE JEWISH STATE BE 
DESTROYED WHILE WAITING TO BE RESCUED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS RENE BERES, Louis Rene Beres is a professor of political science and 
international law at Purdue University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even by the standards of Kafka's uncannily prophetic insights, the parable of 
the vulture is remarkable. Examined as a lesson for Israel in its protracted 
struggle for survival in the Middle East, the tale is right on the mark. 
Indeed, it reads as if it were written originally with no other struggle in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the scenario. A man is being destroyed, slowly and painfully, by a 
fierce and predatory bird. Repeatedly, the bird hacks at its victim, 
immobilizing him systematically and purposefully, piece by piece. The man, of 
course, has not allowed this process of sequential dismemberment to proceed 
without defensive reaction. Fearing, above all, for his face -- for his very 
being -- he has preferred to sacrifice his feet. Rather than confront his enemy 
head on, frontally, with some hope of emerging victorious, he has calculated 
instead the cost-effectiveness of appeasement. In the end, his rational 
calculations prove altogether erroneous. It is true that our victim does draw 
ironic satisfaction from the final mutuality of death -- the vulture drowns in 
the dying man's own blood. But it is a satisfaction that is necessarily 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more. Before the dreadful demise of both victim and victimizer, a 
gentleman promises aid; he needs only to return with his gun; the man needs 
only to wait. All the while, the vulture, not merely a beast animated by 
instinct, understands the plan against it and decides to launch the decisive 
thrust. So what if it turns out to be a suicide attack? It is now too late to 
stop the hacking. Events have achieved an unstoppable momentum of their own. 
What must be done must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 The gentleman, of course, never returns. Like the American statesman who urges 
Israel onward with the peace process, he has other, more urgent, 
preoccupations. The problem with his promises is not that he is deceitful or 
mean-spirited -- he is, after all, a gentleman -- but that he is blind. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 50 years, the vulture has been hacking away at Israel. For nearly 
50 years, Israel has been heeding the gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States has hardly urged Jerusalem to deal with its 
painfully progressive decomposition by explicitly recognizing the advantages of 
firing one shot, the implicit promise is always present: "Negotiate, 
compromise, yield; there is really no risk involved, there is always the last 
resort of overwhelming military power." 
</P>
<P>
 This promise, whether it refers to American forces or Israeli or both, is of 
little or no value. Taken too seriously, it will likely lead Israel toward a 
nuclear last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 While enemies of the Jewish state will "drown irretrievably" in the full fury 
of Israel's most terrible weapons -- in the unspeakable lifeblood of a victim 
that has waited for too long to ensure its survival -- this fact will occasion 
no celebrations in Jerusalem. Faced with the catastrophic demise of the Jewish 
state, Israel's leaders will curse their enemies and their gentleman, but it 
will be an indecipherable curse, a curse heard by no one. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the peace process is an oxymoron, a paradoxical conjunction of terms 
that would seal the fate of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israel, a long-suffering and increasingly willing victim, the process is 
leading, day after day, to complete and irreversible helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacrificing more essential territory in the hope that predators will be 
satisfied, it will learn too late -- unless Kafka's revealing parable is 
understood by the endangered people of Israel -- that the lure of carrion only 
inflames the vulture. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) A Fable 
</P>
<P>
 A vulture was hacking at my feet. It had already torn my boots and stockings 
to shreds, now it was hacking at the feet themselves. Again and again it struck 
at them, then circled several times restless round me, then returned to 
continue its work. A gentleman passed by, looked on for a while, then asked me 
why I suffered the vulture. "I'm helpless," I said. "When it came and began to 
attack me, I, of course, tried to drive it away, even to strangle it, but these 
animals are very strong. It was about to spring at my face, but I preferred to 
sacrifice my feet. Now they are almost torn to bits."  
</P>
<P>
 "Fancy letting yourself be tortured like this!" said the gentleman. "One shot 
and that's the end of the vulture."  
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" I said. "And would you do that?"  
</P>
<P>
 "With pleasure," said the gentleman, "I've only got to go home and get my gun. 
Could you wait another half hour?"  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure about that," said I, and stood for a moment rigid with pain. 
Then I said: "Do try it in any case, please."  
</P>
<P>
 "Very well," said the gentleman. "I'll be as quick as I can."  
</P>
<P>
 During this conversation the vulture had been calmly listening, letting its 
eye rove between me and the gentleman. Now I realized that it had understood 
everything; it took wing, leaned far back to gain impetus, and then, like a 
javelin thrower, thrust its beak through my mouth, deep into me. Falling back, 
I was relieved to feel him drowning irretrievably in my blood, which was 
filling every depth, flooding every shore.

UNESCO IS WORTH THE TROUBLE; BY REJOINING, THE UNITED STATES WOULD AFFIRM TO 
THE WORLD ITS BELIEFS IN DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND A FREE PRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE O'NEILL, Catherine O'Neill of Los Angeles does refugee and 
humanitarian work with U.N. organizations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations is on the ropes. Its "peacekeeping" in Bosnia never kept 
the peace and U.N. "protective forces" were not able to stop attacks on relief 
convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 But assessing the value of the United Nations in military terms misses much of 
where the United Nations' value lies. Caring for immunization of the world's 
children, getting relief to refugees and working to protect the oceans signal 
the way nations come together in the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one United Nations banner under which the United States does not 
participate: the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization. UNESCO is the agency working to bring together networks of 
scientists so that whole nations are not trapped in new forms of illiteracy -- 
scientific, technological and computer illiteracy. It is the agency that 
identifies the world's most precious historical, cultural and environmental 
sites and tries to educate people living near them to respect what they have 
and to encourage economic incentives to preserve them.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the world's nations, 182 are UNESCO members. When the United States 
withdrew in 1984, UNESCO, like much of the Cold War world, had a polarized 
membership, talked of licensing journalists and trampling with the free flow of 
information. Its leadership was charged with financial cronyism. Since then, 
the world has changed and so has UNESCO. The U.S. General Accounting Office 
reports that the problems that caused our departure have been resolved. Editors 
and publishers, leading educators and distinguished American scientists and 
Nobel laureates have called for the United States to rejoin. But we have not.  
</P>
<P>
 Why? The United Nations gets you very few political points in the United 
States. Office-holders don't get re-elected for supporting it; some lose 
because they do. Yet in this complex world, how would we function without U.N. 
institutions in place that bring us together to talk about common problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Does it cost us not to be a part of UNESCO? I think it does. This is another 
missed opportunity to demonstrate with actions that we mean what our words say. 
When officials at the State Department or in the White House speak of U.S. 
foreign-policy goals, they talk of supporting democracy and human rights around 
the world, of working for a free press internationally and of giving women a 
chance to develop themselves. Those are the goals expressed around the UNESCO 
board table. In another era, we would have fought to join with those who were 
working to shape young minds across the globe to confront the issues of the 
21st Century. Not now. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason given for the U.S. failure to re-enter UNESCO has been that "we 
don't have the money." Yet, we recently announced that we can find $25 billion 
more for defense. UNESCO members get irritated when they hear the United 
States, the world's richest superpower, plead poverty. They know that if there 
was a will, the money -- which could amount to $100 million a year -- could be 
found. Americans have spent hundreds of millions this past year responding to 
world tragedy. Some of that money might be better spent by educating people 
about democracy, human rights and tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 As a U.S. government-appointed observer to the recent UNESCO board meeting, I 
was struck by how much of UNESCO's mandate meshed with the work being 
undertaken by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Some of those AID 
programs could be performed under the U.N. insignia.  
</P>
<P>
 Many U.N. agencies, including UNESCO, have serious management problems. The 
U.S. goal should be to make them perform better, and this is more easily done 
from the inside. We in the United States have to learn to work with countries 
in new partnerships and see international humanitarian and development work 
through new prisms. The failure of the United Nations militarily in Bosnia 
should not cause us to abandon other aspects of U.N. work. Despite the 
substantive and international political reasons to rejoin UNESCO, the United 
States probably won't. Some new money might be found to support favored 
programs that UNESCO is undertaking, but in the polarized Washington of today, 
a skittish Administration wanting to pick its struggles carefully will likely 
decide, as I was told at the National Security Council, "UNESCO's not worth the 
trouble." Too bad.

LAKERS HIT OAKLAND AND MISS AGAIN 
</P>

<P>
 Oh, the humanity! 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers' can't-miss plan of beating struggling Golden State Tuesday night 
to build on their momentum heading into games later in the week with Phoenix 
and Seattle missed, which was only fitting. They missed almost everything else 
inside Oakland Coliseum Arena, shooting 25.5% in the first half and 40.6% in 
the game to fall behind by 37 points and eventually lose, 129-105, before 
15,025. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were horrible tonight," guard Eddie Jones said. "We fell right off 
in the first quarter (shooting 20.7%) and were in trouble. We were history from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been bigger deficits, but this is the worst we've played all 
season. Mainly, we forced a lot of shots and didn't play defense. Those are the 
things we do." 
</P>
<P>
 That such a showing would happen here is no surprise -- the Lakers had lost in 
their previous three visits by 22, 27 and 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
 That it would happen now is. The Lakers had won five of their previous six 
games and 12 of 15; the Warriors had lost 10 of 11. Then misery got company. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones went three of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlade Divac missed all seven shots before intermission, said it might have 
been the worst half of his career, and finished making two of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Smith was three of nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedale Threatt, 31 of 52 (for 59.6%) in the previous six games and a team-best 
51.9% overall coming in, made only three of seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had poor selection," Laker Coach Del Harris said. "We also had 
some missed (good) shots. The problem is, when you miss bad shots, it puts 
pressure on making the good shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were totally out of sync all night. We're just not the kind of team that 
can shoot anybody out of it. We're not that style of team. We need to get good 
fastbreaks, cutting, slashing. We're not a team that can stand out on the 
perimeter and trade jump shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially against a team like the Warriors, loaded with offensive weapons 
despite their 10-15 record. That much was on display while they were earning 
their first two-game winning streak in six weeks -- Tim Hardaway had 20 points 
and 15 assists, Tom Gugliotta and Latrell Sprewell also contributed 20 points, 
and Rony Seikaly added 17 rebounds. In all, they finished shooting 51.5% while 
tying a franchise record with 12 three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played well against the pressure they put on us, the traps, and we were 
able to beat them and go and score and take a lot of three-pointers," Gugliotta 
said. "We were hitting a good percentage of them (42.9%), which always helps." 
</P>
<P>
 The next week or so for the Warriors is about clinging to whatever positive 
feelings remain from their 5-0 start, if any. After that, Chris Mullin, Ricky 
Pierce and Carlos Rogers are expected to be back, or very close to returning, 
from injuries and Coach Don Nelson should be on the sidelines again after his 
bout with viral pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the questions have to be answered: Has Nelson lost the team after trading 
popular players Chris Webber and Billy Owens? Will Mullin show anything close 
to his old form so Gugliotta can move from small forward to his natural 
position, power forward? And most of all, will attempts at resuscitation fail, 
forever reducing a team that Nelson once called his best ever on paper to 
what-could-have-been? 
</P>
<P>
 This much is certain: Nelson has missed five games -- the Warriors are 2-3 in 
that time -- but has been out of the hospital since Dec. 18, and returned to 
the office Tuesday for the first time, spending about 90 minutes answering 
mail. He plans to be back at work in earnest for the Jan. 2 practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gaining strength every day," said son Donnie Nelson, the interim coach. 
"I think (Jan. 1) is a pretty realistic day for him coming back. It's pretty 
solid." 
</P>
<P>
 For a day, at least, the Warriors know the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos was named the NBA player of the week Tuesday, the first Laker 
so honored since Magic Johnson in April 1991. "I kind of got off the easy way 
since we only played two games," Ceballos said. "But it's the same with scoring 
50 points -- there's a lot of players in this league, but only a few get those 
kinds of accomplishments." Ceballos averaged 35.5 points and 8.5 rebounds and 
shot 56.9% in the two outings. . . . Reserve forward Anthony (Pig) Miller did 
not make the trip because of the flu. The bug also kept assistant coach Larry 
Drew at the team hotel. . . . The eight blocked shots by Vlade Divac in 
Friday's victory over Sacramento were the most by a Laker in more than 10 
years, since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had eight on Dec. 2, 1984. . . . The Lakers' 
biggest loss of the season so far was by 38 points on Nov. 30 at Cleveland.

BULLS LET CLIPPERS SCRATCH 16-YEAR ITCH; STREAK: THE LAST CHICAGO LOSS TO THE 
L.A. FRANCHISE IN THE WINDY CITY WAS EARLY 1979, WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY THE SAN 
DIEGO FRANCHISE.

 Exhaling the breath they had gasped when Toni Kukoc's three-point attempt with 
two seconds to play somehow went astray, the Clippers whooped and hollered and 
pumped their fists in a celebration more fitting for a playoff party than a 
December Tuesday night in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a season of so many dreary moments and so many defeats, their 95-92 
victory over the Bulls at the United Center was the Clippers' equivalent of a 
seventh-game squeaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't win that much, every victory feels like a championship game," 
said forward Lamond Murray, who had 19 points in a team-high 46 minutes. "We 
worked hard. It felt good, and we had no problem showing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Their delight was unmistakable and deserved. Their first victory in Chicago 
since Jan. 26, 1979, when they were based in San Diego, was the product of 
tenacious defense, clutch shooting down the stretch and steely nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is on them because they're the (former) champs," Murray said, 
"but they felt the pressure and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 All they felt was joy when Pooh Richardson's jumper from the left side of the 
key sailed through the net with with 7.9 seconds to play to climax a strong 
finish for the Clippers (4-23) and end a 10-game losing streak against the 
Bulls (13-13). 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get a nice, clean look," Richardson said. "If you miss it, 
cool. I didn't want to take the shot too early." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it helped that Scottie Pippen, the Bulls' top scorer, rebounder and 
shot-blocker, was ejected with 2:13 left in the second quarter for earning his 
second technical foul, this for disputing a foul called on him by referee Terry 
Durham. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen had gotten off to a sensational start, making eight of 11 shots, 
grabbing five rebounds and dishing off three assists in 17 minutes. But his 
displeasure over being called for an offensive foul was audible to many in the 
sellout crowd of 22,231 and he was ushered out with the game tied at 48. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stole the ball and he was going to post me up and he pushed me in the back 
and started a shoving match," Clipper forward Harold Ellis said of Pippen, who 
had picked up his first technical for taunting Charles Outlaw after a 
first-quarter dunk. "I didn't think he was going to retaliate like that. I 
didn't expect it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Pippen, there was no reason to expect that the Bulls -- who had 
beaten the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks in their two previous games -- 
would unravel so dramatically in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But after taking a 90-89 lead on a 21-foot jumper by Steve Kerr with 5:40 to 
play, the Bulls failed to score for 4:01, until Will Perdue made a layup to cut 
the Clippers' lead to 93-92. In that span, the Bulls had two 24-second 
violations and one other turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had any rhythm to our offense and we had too many guys trying to go 
one-on-one," said B.J. Armstrong, who was four for 20 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 They still trailed by a point with 1:14 to play but couldn't get the ball in 
play and were called for a five-second violation, their 27th and final 
turnover. Richardson then made his jump shot, giving him a team-high 21 points, 
and Kukoc missed his desperation fling, sending the Clippers leaping off their 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going down the stretch, the pressure is on us because we're supposed to win," 
Perdue said. "We had time after we lost Scottie to make the proper adjustments, 
and we didn't. That's a situation where we've got to step up our game and we 
did that to a point, but not enough. No doubt about it, we're an angry team. 
This is a game, even though it was a close game, that we should have an 
advantage because of the team we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bill Fitch, who joked that when the team last won in Chicago, "I 
was just a baby coach," considered the victory a reward for his club's 
diligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talented from the standpoint of superstars, but we're getting 
better," he said. "I think we all see the light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Loy Vaught, racked by a fever and the flu, played only 18 minutes. He 
never got off the bench after the first two minutes of the third quarter. "I 
got dizzy and I almost had to put one knee down after I lost my balance out 
there," he said. . . . Tuesday's game was the first in 21 the Clippers won 
after trailing going into the fourth quarter.

NBA ROUNDUP; JOHNSON IS STAR AT END OF SUNS' SEQUEL IN DALLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after defeating the Dallas Mavericks by 26 points, the 
Phoenix Suns needed some last-second heroics from Kevin Johnson to escape with 
a 119-118 decision over the Mavericks on Tuesday night at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson scored 28 points, including a 16-foot baseline jumper with 3.7 seconds 
to play for the go-ahead points as the Suns rallied from a five-point deficit 
with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks attempted to double-team Johnson in the corner, but both Jason 
Kidd and Roy Tarpley backed away momentarily, giving Johnson an open look at 
the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd been double-teaming in that situation all night and for a second they 
had to regroup," said Johnson, who added 11 assists to raise his career total 
to 5,000. "That's when I shot the shot. I got a great look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas' Jim Jackson had a shot at the victory but his runner in the lane at 
the buzzer rimmed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson scored 31 points and Jamal Mashburn added 30 as the Mavericks showed 
considerable improvement from their performance at Phoenix on Monday night, 
when they lost, 139-113. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to beat a team back-to-back," said Charles Barkley of the Suns, 
who had 22 points and 16 rebounds. "We're a better team than they are but it's 
tough to pull it off on consecutive nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 103, Miami 83 -- Shaquille O'Neal had 28 points and 11 rebounds at 
Orlando as the Magic remained unbeaten at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic improved to 12-0 at Orlando Arena after their third consecutive 
blowout victory over the Heat this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Anfernee Hardaway scored 19 points and had seven assists for the Magic, which 
blew the game open by making five three-point shots during a 20-2 run in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 119, Charlotte 108 -- David Robinson scored 16 of his 30 points in 
the third quarter and Chuck Person made five three-point shots at San Antonio 
to help the Spurs to their seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing on two sore ankles, Robinson made 10 of 17 shots, benefiting from the 
absence of Hornet center Alonzo Mourning, who suffered a foot injury in the 
second quarter and didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 99, New Jersey 91 -- The worst losing streak of Pat Riley's coaching 
career ended at five games as John Starks scored 22 points to lead the Knicks 
at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks, who has averaged only 10.6 points in his last 17 games and made only 
32% of his shots, enjoyed his best game since scoring 35 points on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 98, Detroit 88 -- Marty Conlon scored 11 of his 13 points in the 
final 14 minutes to help the Bucks hold off the Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich., 
and end a 10-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons have lost eight of their last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dumars, who failed to score in the first half, scored 11 points to lead a 
14-2 Piston surge that pulled them to 68-59 late in the third quarter. Detroit 
got within nine points twice in the last eight minutes, but never any closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Vin Baker led the Bucks with 22 points and Glenn Robinson had 15. Terry Mills 
paced the Pistons with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Dumars had 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 95, Denver 91 -- Rik Smits scored a season-high 33 points and took 14 
rebounds to lead the Pacers at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers, winners of nine of their last 11 games against the Nuggets, scored 
only five points in the final three minutes. It was enough, though, as Denver 
managed only six free throws and a three-point basket by Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, 
who scored 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 102, Portland 101 -- Spud Webb's short jump shot with 2.3 seconds 
to play gave the Kings the victory at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 King guard Mitch Richmond scored 30 points before fouling out with 48.5 
seconds left. Olden Polynice added 21 points and nine rebounds and Lionel 
Simmons had 18 points and 19 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Robinson, who missed a baseline jumper at the buzzer, had given Portland 
a 101-100 lead with 12.1 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 105, Atlanta 93 -- Hakeem Olajuwon had 35 points and 16 rebounds to 
lead the Rockets at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss kept Lenny Wilkens one victory shy of tying Red Auerbach's NBA 
all-time coaching record of 938 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 New York Knick forward Charles Oakley had a dislocated toe on his right foot 
surgically repaired in a procedure used mainly on older people, doctors said. 
Norman Scott, the Knicks' team physician, said the operation was successful and 
that Oakley should be able to play in eight weeks.

MORNING BRIEFING: JUNIOR HAPPY: HIS TWIN STAYS IN THE FAMILY

 Think Ken Griffey Jr., was happy the Seattle Mariners bucked their recent 
tradition and signed outfielder Jay Buhner? 
</P>
<P>
 After Griffey said he was frustrated that the team couldn't surround him with 
talent and was about to let Buhner go to the Baltimore Orioles, the Mariners 
stepped up with a $15.5-million offer that landed Buhner. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing Buhner, Griffey said, would be like, well, losing a sibling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been together for five years, going through the ups and downs, and 
we're family," Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay is like a brother to me. Not like a big brother but more like twins, you 
know, like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Arnold, and he's Danny."

 The final days: Washington Post columnist Michael Wilbon, who, given his 
locale, is understandably politically sensitive, is not rushing to bury the 
Buffalo Bills.

 "Hopefully, enough of the people writing history will remember how absolutely 
difficult it was to do what the Bills did, under the kind of scrutiny that 
exists only in two NFL cities, Buffalo and Green Bay," Wilbon wrote.

 Boring Bears: Last time the Chicago Bears were any good, the town went crazy 
over their colorful cast of characters. So with the current edition 
surprisingly successful, Chicago Tribune columnist Bernie Lincicome explains 
why it hasn't quite caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sideline antics and a single Super Bowl set up one ex-Bear coach for life," 
Lincicome writes. "Being fat was enough to make a folk hero out of a defensive 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is, you almost have to work at being drab to avoid attention here. 
And so the Bears have. . . .  
</P>

 "The Bears are too dull to dare. Other than the occasional wacky special teams 
antic, the Bears offer the exhilaration of rust. This does not travel well."

PATRIOTS IN POSITIVE MODE FOR THE BROWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRICE, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New England Patriots are in the playoffs and almost all is right in their 
world. Not even a trip to Cleveland can bring them down. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a downside. It's just not that apparent to the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in good position because we're in the tournament," coach Bill Parcells 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots (10-6) will play the Browns (11-5) Sunday at 12:30 p.m. EST at 
Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight years of not qualifying for the playoffs, what are the Patriots 
going to complain about? Almost every negative can be turned into a positive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negative: It's on the road. Positive: The Patriots are 5-3 on the road this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negative: It's against a team that beat them 13-6 Nov. 6. Positive: The 
Patriots have won seven consecutive games since then and the Browns have gone 
4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negative: The Patriots do not have much playoff experience. Positive: 
They've been in a win-or-else position for almost two months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negative: Browns running back Leroy Hoard ran for 123 yards against the 
Patriots. Positive: In seven games since, no opposing running back has rushed 
for more than 77. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots ended up second in the AFC East when the Miami Dolphins won the 
title with a victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night. The Patriots are 
the fifth playoff seed. Cleveland, which finished second in the Central behind 
Pittsburgh, is the fourth seed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns, in the playoffs for the first time since 1989, lost three of their 
final five games. But they beat the Cowboys 19-14 in Dallas on Dec. 11 and 
finished the season by defeating Seattle, 35-9, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've played pretty well," Parcells said. "Beating Dallas was a pretty good 
indicator. And they finished strongly this past weekend. Cleveland is a good 
solid club and has been all year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots, meanwhile, came on strong at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Patriots') record speaks for itself," Browns coach Bill Belichick said. 
"They're as hot as any team in the league right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Belichick was defensive coordinator under Parcells with the Giants, helping 
win Super Bowls in 1986 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill is a good friend of mine and a good coach," Belichick said. "I have a 
lot of respect for him. But he's got a job to do and I've got a job to do. It's 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells gave the players Sunday and Monday off. They get back to practice 
this afternoon. It will be somewhat easier preparing for the Browns because of 
the earlier game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little less in terms of the mental preparation from the coaching staff 
standpoint," Parcells said. "Had we played Kansas City (the Chiefs play at 
Miami Saturday because of the Dolphins' victory), who we're pretty unfamiliar 
with, in terms of a recent opponent, it would have been a little more difficult 
to prepare. At least we have a basis of a background on Cleveland. And, of 
course, the corollary to that is they have that on us, also." 
</P>
<P>
 (Optional add end) 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots clinched a playoff berth by beating the Bears, 13-3, in Chicago 
Saturday. That, plus a 41-17 victory in Buffalo Dec. 18, makes a trip to 
Cleveland somewhat less daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning on the road is the thing in pro football," Parcells said. "That's the 
thing you've got to learn how to do -- prove you can win on the road. Until you 
do that in this league you're usually just an average team. When you do it, you 
usually start to be pretty good. We were 5-3 on the road. That's at least 
progress. You'd like to think you can be .500 or a little better on the road 
and play a little better than that at home. Then you've usually got a pretty 
good team." 
</P>
<P>
 The positives for the Patriots are momentum and that they may not have peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our team is improving," Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells also pointed out that the Los Angeles Raiders and the Buffalo Bills, 
preseason picks to reach the Super Bowl, are out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this AFC, there's no one that knows what's going to happen," Parcells 
said. "The teams that play best are going to win." Who's up next season 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots' opponents for the 1995 season are set. The home opponents will 
be Cleveland, Denver, New Orleans and Carolina, in addition to AFC East teams 
Indianapolis, Miami, Buffalo and the Jets. The away games will be Kansas City, 
Pittsburgh, Atlanta and San Francisco, plus the division opponents.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hate to disagree with you, but I don't think a San Francisco-Dallas rematch in 
the NFC title game is going to be the real Super Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That's because I don't think there will be such a rematch. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys won't make it that far. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Troy Aikman still hasn't regained his form, Emmitt Smith is coming off an 
injury, and Jimmy Johnson's leadership is missed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This is our scenario for the playoffs: 
</P>
<P>
 NFC first-round games -- Green Bay defeats Detroit, Minnesota defeats Chicago. 
AFC -- Miami defeats Kansas City, Cleveland defeats New England. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 NFC second-round games -- San Francisco defeats Green Bay, Minnesota defeats 
Dallas. AFC -- Pittsburgh defeats Cleveland, Miami defeats San Diego. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 NFC championship game -- San Francisco defeats Minnesota. AFC -- Pittsburgh 
defeats Miami. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Super Bowl -- San Francisco defeats Pittsburgh. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'll be surprised if any opponent comes within 10 points of the 49ers during 
the playoffs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Can Joe Paterno's team, which should be considered among the greatest 
offensive machines in college football history, threaten the Rose Bowl scoring 
record against Oregon? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan scored 49 in the first Rose Bowl game in 1902 against Stanford, a 
figure matched by the Wolverines in 1948 against USC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those Michigan teams also share the record for fewest points allowed, zero. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The track should be fast Monday. It hasn't rained for a Rose Bowl since Ohio 
State beat USC, 20-7, in 1955. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Barry Sanders deserved to be a unanimous selection on the 
Associated Press all-pro team, but quarterback Steve Young and wide receiver 
Jerry Rice also should have swept the balloting at their positions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Rich Kotite's 37-29 record as Philadelphia Eagles' coach compares favorably 
with Buddy Ryan's 43-38-1. Kotite's winning percentage is also higher than that 
of Dick Vermeil, whose teams were 57-51 in regular-season games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is no more gorgeous venue in sports than Santa Anita Park on clear, 
sparkling days like opening day Monday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The spill involving three jockeys in the first race was an illustration of why 
riders, who are threatening to walk out Jan. 1, feel so strongly about the 
insurance issue. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron was fortunate to escape serious injury and was able to 
articulate the Jockey Guild's view of the contract dispute a couple of hours 
later during a session with sportswriters in the press box. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Later the same day, Marco Castenada, who used to ride locally, suffered head 
injuries in a three-horse spill during a race at Bay Meadows that was simulcast 
to Santa Anita. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Laffit Pincay, who will be 48 Wednesday, is 624 winners shy of Bill 
Shoemaker's record 8,833. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On his XTRA radio show, Roger Stein has been asking listeners if Pincay should 
attempt to quicken the pace of his record bid by racing on the lesser Northern 
California circuit for a couple of years. I say no. Pincay is strictly a major 
leaguer who should break the record competing against the very best. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A unique Arabian vs. standardbred match race has been proposed for the harness 
racing meet that begins a 38-night stand at Los Alamitos Thursday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Few pitchers could start or relieve as well as Allie Reynolds, the former New 
York Yankee star who died Tuesday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds was involved in an important trade on Oct. 19, 1946, when he was sent 
from the Cleveland Indians to the New York Yankees for second baseman Joe 
Gordon and throw-in third baseman Eddie Bockman. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds pitched on six World Series championship teams for the Yankees during 
the next eight years. Gordon played only four more years, helping to lead the 
Indians to the 1948 World Series title. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of the top 16 teams in the Associated Press basketball poll are 
Pacific 10 Conference members, the most from any conference. . .  
</P>
<P>
 I doubt that Kevin Loughery is going to threaten Don Shula's record for 
longevity as a Miami coach. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Without Michael Jordan and Horace Grant, the Bulls are nothing more than a 
.500 team that got outhustled badly by the Clippers on Tuesday night at 
Chicago.

to the parents of a boy who died of heart failure after collapsing at a 
strenuous baseball practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mito District Court ruled that the coach and Tsuchiura Nihon University 
High shared responsibility in the 1988 death of Hiroyuki Saito, who was 16 at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Saito collapsed on the field after running a series of 200-meter dashes 
without rest, along with about 20 teammates. He was taken to a hospital, where 
he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, gave more than $500,000 to the 
national soccer team that was eliminated by Italy in the second round of the 
World Cup tournament last summer.

TEACHING A TEAM TO VALUE FAMILY TIES; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: USC'S NEW DEFENSIVE 
COORDINATOR, KEITH BURNS, OFFERS PLAYERS LIFE LESSONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long ago, Keith Burns, the USC football team's new defensive coordinator, 
was asked to speak at a high school football awards banquet.  
</P>
<P>
 He didn't talk about USC's Cotton Bowl date with Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Or about standout wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who was also there to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Or on how he planned to retool USC's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And he didn't use the occasion as a recruiting opportunity -- not even with 
two dozen high school prospects sitting before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Burns, 34, talked about mothers and fathers, pegging his message to 
his own father, who died 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just finished my senior football season at Arkansas when my dad died," 
Burns told the players, then expanded on his talk to a reporter afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 "And I still feel good today about the fact that when he died, I felt like 
there wasn't anything more I could have done to have made my relationship with 
him any better. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was my best friend as well as my father. I remember sitting on the 
front porch with him and sometimes talking until 2 a.m., about sports, girls, 
cars . . . we talked about anything.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and dad never missed a game I played at Arkansas, despite the fact 
they lived in Dallas. They traveled to the road games too.  
</P>
<P>
 "He worked for Bell Helicopters in Dallas for 35 years, and was a foreman in 
his last years. One time he got a cough that didn't go away. The doctors found 
titanium dust in his lungs.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big, strong healthy guy, never sick in his life. And when he was 
bedridden the last couple of months, it was hard on him.  
</P>
<P>
 "One day my brother and I were playing a very competitive game of checkers in 
his hospital room and dad suggested a move to me he felt I should make. I 
didn't, and I lost.  
</P>
<P>
 "He whispered to me, 'Never get to the point in your life where you can't take 
advice.' He died four hours later." 
</P>
<P>
 Talking directly to the high school players, Burns said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do yourself a favor sometime today and ask yourself if you've done everything 
you possibly can to make things as good as they can be between you and your mom 
and dad, because they can be gone from your life very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 That's Keith Burns, Mr. Family, who, days after receiving the biggest 
promotion of his coaching career, had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, what a day tomorrow is going to be. I've got several recruits coming in 
. . . and Little League basketball tryouts start in Monrovia." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns and his wife, Yvonne, live in Arcadia, with their sons, K.C., 7, and 
Tanner, 5.  
</P>
<P>
 For Burns, the difficulty of balancing football coaches' hours with home life 
just got more difficult. His family, he said, is his "home team." 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaches work such long hours, we're away from home so much, the little time 
I'm with my family becomes very important to me," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Little things a lot of parents might take for granted, like decorating a 
Christmas tree, is a big deal at our house.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is assigned a limb to decorate. Even picking out the tree is a big 
deal, it's a team operation. So are our outdoor cookouts, when my two boys both 
have their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems like the best conversations I have with my boys are during those 
cookouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns is among the most vocal of USC's 13-member coaching staff, possibly 
ranking just behind offensive line coach Mike Barry and new defensive line 
coach Rod Marinelli.  
</P>
<P>
 He was finishing his second season as coach of the Trojans' safeties when John 
Robinson promoted him earlier this month to replace Don Lindsey, who had been 
dismissed Nov. 30.  
</P>
<P>
 In a coincidental twist, Lindsey was the defensive coordinator at Arkansas 
when Burns was a starter in his junior and senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keith will do a great job, he's an awesome coach," said Lindsey, days after 
his firing. Burns' orders from Robinson are to field a more aggressive defense 
next year, somewhere between the high-risk defense used by Washington State and 
Lindsey's low-risk, bend-but-don't-break system.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Robinson and Lindsey were unhappy at the ease with which some opponents, 
particularly UCLA, ran against USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that disturbs me most was the way they could run the ball on us," 
said Robinson, moments after UCLA's surprising 31-19 victory on Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns says no major changes will be made for Monday's Cotton Bowl game against 
Texas Tech, but that the 1995 Trojans will have a new look.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense next year will take more risks than we did this year, but not to 
the extent Washington State did," he said. "Washington State goes over the 
edge. We won't.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our toughest job will be replacing our senior linebackers (Brian Williams, 
Jeff Kopp, Donn Cunnigan and Errol Small). But guys like Errick Herrin and 
Scott Fields will be back, and I'm excited about that."  
</P>
<P>
 Burns has assigned himself to a special project next year -- Stu Gage, a 
310-pound returning nose tackle.  
</P>
<P>
 "Stu has done some great things for us on the goal line, and I don't see any 
reason why he can't do them on the 50-yard line too," he said. "He's going to 
be my special project." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Kelly, a the freshman cornerback from Denver, is headed for stardom, 
Burns predicts.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be a great player," Burns said. "He could be an all-conference 
cornerback as soon as next season." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, who played high school football in Dallas, became a three-season 
Arkansas starter. He later was a graduate assistant coach with the Razorbacks 
Arkansas for two years, then coached at UOP Pacific for four years and four 
more at Rice before joining Robinson's staff in early 1993.

UTAH CONTROLS PETERSON, FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK KINAHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it wasn't already, the word is definitely out on how to defend Cal State 
Fullerton center Winston Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's strategy of double teaming the Titans' leading scorer worked perfectly, 
as Utah's basketball team cruised to an 84-63 non-conference victory Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three games, the 6-foot-6 center has not scored more than 17 
points after scoring at least 23 points in the previous four contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every time he touched the ball Tuesday, Utah swarmed him with at least 
two 6-9 players. The result was five points on one-of-seven shooting. He 
entered the game averaging 20.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job on Peterson," said Coach Bob Hawking, whose team dropped 
to 3-5. "If you stop the leading scorer, it's kind of a good way to plan your 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's strategy was simple: first, Keep Peterson away from the baseline, and 
then double team him once he gets the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 With his game taken away, Peterson began forcing the issue in the second half, 
when he missed all five of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was frustrated," Hawking said. "We'll try to make some adjustments. We'll 
have some things to work on offensively to free him up." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a difficult night all around for Peterson, whose five rebounds were 
half his season average. Giving away several inches across the frontline, the 
Titans were outrebounded, 42-26. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was the key," Hawking said. "They physically dominated us on 
the boards, which upped their field-goal percentage because they had a bunch of 
second efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah (8-2) shot 53% from the field, Fullerton 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's two Southern California stars, Keith Van Horn of Diamond Bar and 
Brandon Jessie of Huntington Beach, combined for 43 points and 16 rebounds. Van 
Horn had 24 points, Jessie 19. Each had eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horn and Jessie scored 14 of Utah's last 17 points in the first half to 
help the Utes take a 50-32 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horn scored on a three-point shot, two dunks and two free throws. Jessie 
added a dunk and a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both outstanding players," Hawking said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; STANFORD UPSETS NO. 19 WISCONSIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brevin Knight scored 26 points and Dion Cross had 19 as unranked Stanford 
remained unbeaten by defeating 19th-ranked Wisconsin, 95-78, Tuesday night at 
Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (8-0) made 33 of 42 shots; Wisconsin made 14 of 21. The Cardinal also 
outshot Wisconsin (6-2) from the field, 52% to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal backcourt of Knight and Cross did most of the damage. They were 
constantly on the move, often penetrating Wisconsin's defense for layups. 
Knight also had nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Young added a career-high 16 points and Andy Poppink had 15 points and 
nine rebounds for Stanford, which registered its second consecutive upset of a 
top-25 team. Last week, the Cardinal defeated then-No. 22 Virginia, 64-60. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa 81, No. 7 Duke 71 -- Jess Settles returned from a three-game absence 
because of a back injury to score 28 points in leading the Hawkeyes (9-1) over 
the Blue Devils (6-2) in the first round of the Rainbow Classic at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Settles, a sophomore forward, scored seven points and had an assist in a 13-5 
run that gave Iowa a 76-65 lead with 2:53 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke got back within 76-71 on consecutive three-point baskets by freshman 
Trajan Langdon, but Iowa made five of six free throws in the final 43 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Kentucky 116, Marshall 75 -- Jeff Sheppard scored 19 of his career-high 
21 points and made five three-point shots in the first half to lead the 
Wildcats (6-1) over the Thundering Herd (6-2) at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Connecticut 71, Illinois 56 -- Doron Sheffer scored 17 points, all in 
the second half, and Brian Fair scored 16 to lead the Huskies (6-0) over the 
Illini (8-3) at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Maryland 96, La Salle 80 -- Reserve Mario Lucas scored a career-high 18 
points and sparked a second-half surge that carried the Terrapins (9-2) over 
the Explorers (5-2) at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 Iowa State 96, Chicago State 47 -- Fred Hoiberg and Loren Meyer each 
scored 18 points as the Cyclones (9-1) romped over the Cougars (1-6) at Ames, 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 St. John's 81, Manhattan 70 -- Charles Minlend scored 22 points to lead 
the Red Storm (7-0) over the Jaspers (8-1) in the first round of the ECAC

BOYS' BASKETBALL / HART TOURNAMENT; CANYON'S LAST-SECOND SHOT SINKS ANTELOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BRESNAHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first question was laughed off, brushed aside by Canyon High's Greg Minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he said with a smile, he was going to be the one to put up the 
last-second shot in a tie game against Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second question -- how did he hit an off-balance three-pointer through 
a double team as time ran out to defeat the previously unbeaten Antelopes, 
69-66, in the first round of the Hart tournament -- was a stumper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't know," Minor said. "Help of God, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 What was clear was that Minor finished with 38 points and, at times, loaded 
the entire Canyon team on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Antelopes (8-1) leading, 35-23, and looking at another victory 
against another over-matched opponent, Canyon (5-4) went on a 27-3 run. Minor 
was responsible for 21 of the points, with 17 of his own and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help Antelope Valley that three starters were benched because of 
foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't get in rhythm, couldn't get into the flow," said Coach Tom 
Mahan, whose Antelopes scored a season-low five points in the third period. 
"Tough to play with three starters out." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale 75, Littlerock 71 -- Joe Kurdoglanyan scored 23 points and James 
Fuller added 20 and 19 rebounds for Glendale (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
 John George had 26 points and 14 rebounds for Littlerock (6-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley 58, Canoga Park 56 -- Junior forward Scott Schnetzler scored a 
game-high 22 points and had nine rebounds and five steals to pace the Pioneers 
(8-1).  
</P>
<P>
 Hart 59, San Fernando 52 -- Mike Posey scored 20 points to lead the Indians 
(6-5) to a first-round victory. Dwayne Lucas led San Fernando (3-6) with 20 
points.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rafer Alston made two free throws with 15 seconds left to help the Ventura 
College men's basketball team hold on to a 70-67 victory over Sequoias in a 
first-round game of the Hancock tournament Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, the No. 1-ranked team in the state, had a 43-25 lead over 
fifth-ranked Sequoias at halftime, but saw its advantage cut to a point on 
three occasions in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (16-0) took a 66-63 lead on Gerald Zimmerman's put-back of a missed 
shot, but Sequoias countered with a basket before Hakeen Ward made a shot to 
put Ventura ahead, 68-65. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sequoias cut the Pirates' lead to 68-67, Alston was fouled with 15 
seconds left, setting the stage for his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequoias (10-3) missed two three-point shots before time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman and Ward led Ventura with 16 points each and Alston had 11. Curtis 
Ganes added 10 points and seven rebounds for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura plays third-ranked Cerritos (18-0) in a semifinal tonight.

SUPREME COURT RULING SOUGHT ON REBATES; INSURANCE: PETITIONS SEEK FEDERAL 
REVIEW ON THE PROP. 103 REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance companies have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a California 
Supreme Court ruling that upheld rebate regulations imposed by the state 
insurance commissioner under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 If accepted for review, it would be the first case resulting from the 1988 
insurance reform initiative to reach the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurers want the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether the state court 
erred in finding that a regulated entity is not entitled under the 5th and 14th 
amendments to try to recover its cost of capital in rates it may charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurers filed their petitions with the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday, the 
Los Angeles Daily Journal reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One petition was filed by 20th Century Insurance Co. The other was filed by 
numerous other insurers, including Century-National Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't come as a surprise," Elena Stern, press secretary for state 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, said Tuesday. "We very seriously doubt 
that the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case." 
</P>
<P>
 California voters approved Proposition 103 in 1988. Its attempt at sweeping 
reform of the industry included a one-time rollback of auto, home and business 
insurance rates 20% below 1987 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court upheld the overall constitutionality of Proposition 
103 in 1989, but it found that to be eligible for exemption from the 20% 
rebate, insurers were entitled to fair rate of return rather than having to 
meet a standard described as being a substantial threat to their solvency. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi issued regulations establishing fair profit at 10%. The state 
Supreme Court upheld Garamendi's authority to use the 10% level, but insurers 
continue to challenge it. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's petition to the U.S. Supreme Court claims that the state 
Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional standard in finding that rate 
regulation does not need to permit a regulated company an opportunity to 
recover its costs of capital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The question is important to all regulated industries, the petition said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The constitutional standard governing confiscation claims does not vary from 
industry to industry, and the uncertainty generated by the growing conflict 
among the lower courts on the appropriate standard spans increased litigation 
over complex rate-setting issues," the petition said. 
</P>
<P>
 A confiscatory level of profit refers to a regulated level so low it is 
considered unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's petition also claims the state court erred in ruling that a 
finding of confiscation required a showing of "deep financial hardship." 
</P>
<P>
 "The interests of consumers may indeed be balanced against those of investors 
in setting rates, and investors have no constitutional claim so long as they 
are afforded an opportunity to recover their reasonable expenses and cost of 
capital," the petition says. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's attorneys also assert that the California Supreme Court's 
reasoning ran counter to decisions by other state courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century-National petition argues that the state court was wrong in finding 
that confiscation analysis must focus on the "condition of the insurer as a 
whole," rather than on separately regulated lines of insurance.

ADVIL MAKERS LOSE FIGHT OVER ADS FOR ALEVE; COURTS: HOWEVER YOU SPELL RELIEF, 
THE WHOLE THING GAVE NEW JERSEY JUDGE 'A MONUMENTAL HEADACHE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Tuesday rebuffed the makers of Advil, who had sought to quash 
advertising claims for Aleve, a fast-rising competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge complained that the mountains of conflicting claims he had to read 
about the two painkillers had left him with a "monumental headache." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan rejected the contention that Aleve's 
distributor, Procter & Gamble Co., deliberately intended to mislead consumers. 
He also said there was no reliable proof that the ads conveyed a message that 
Aleve worked better than Advil or was effective for longer periods. Procter & 
Gamble claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home, based in Madison, N.J., filed the suit Aug. 8, asking that the 
Aleve ads be halted. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads proclaimed Aleve to be "All day strong -- all day long" because its 
recommended dosage is one or two pills every eight to 12 hours instead of every 
four to six hours. The ads stopped short of claiming one dose of Aleve would be 
effective for eight to 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Products surveys found that consumers got the message that Aleve 
lasts longer, but the judge said the studies were flawed. On the other hand, he 
said, three studies of Aleve's active ingredient done for its maker, Syntex 
Corp. -- though not definitive -- suggest that Aleve relieves pain for a longer 
period of time than Advil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the mass of evidence and exhibits, however, Politan wrote, "it is 
thus not surprising that the court presently finds itself in possession of a 
monumental headache, the alleviation of which is beyond the durational powers 
of any of the analgesics discussed herein." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ordered one minor adjustment, to which the companies had already 
agreed. It makes small changes to ads aimed at medical professionals regarding 
the testing of Aleve and the people involved in those tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Advil's active ingredient is ibuprofen. It is the No. 2 brand in the nation, 
with 13.6% of the $2.5-billion market for over-the-counter pain pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol, essentially acetaminophen, is No. 1 with 29.4% of 
the market, according to November figures from the research firm Information 
Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleve, the brand name for naproxen sodium, captured third place within three 
months of its introduction, with about 6.8%. By November its market share had 
fallen to 4.9%, but it was still in third place. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Products is not the only competitor that has bristled at claims 
for Aleve. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble agreed in November to modify some Aleve ads 
after the maker of Bayer Aspirin complained to the Council of Better Business 
Bureaus.

 A Valentine's Day Wedding to Break Your Heart: It was a fine February day for 
a wedding, and one that was overdue for Robert Molina, 31, and Crystal Orozco, 
27, since they already had three children. But it was hard to get past what 
awaited them. Molina was suffering from AIDS, and the wedding had been made 
possible by the generosity of staffers and volunteers at Bethesda House, the 
Salvation Army's Downtown shelter for families with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The honeymoon was short for Robert and Crystal. He suffered a stroke three 
months after the wedding and died on May 29, leaving Crystal to care for 
Phillip, 6, Desirae, 4, and Joshua, 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal is living in a Whittier apartment, waiting to get Joshua into day care 
so she can attend school to get her GED. After that, she hopes to become an 
emergency medical technician. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas wasn't very grand this year. Crystal lent the money she was planning 
to spend on the children to a relative, who has refused to repay her. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if Crystal remembers this, but on her wedding day, Robert told me 
about a conversation he'd had with a friend: "She said, 'Why get married, then 
die?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Robert's reply: "Why give up?"

 A Mother and Child Reunion: It was an irresistible twist to the classic 
immigration tale. Carmen, a 34-year-old Salvadoran legal immigrant, had become 
so fearful of her 15-year-old daughter's flirtation with street gangs in the 
Valley that she decided to send her somewhere safe: back to El Salvador.  
</P>
<P>
 The child, Maria, had been conceived during a rape in Carmen's native land, 
and Carmen had fled the country after that, leaving the 7-month-old Maria with 
a sister until Maria was 4. Maria had never been told the circumstances of her 
conception, nor had she understood why her mother had left. But her adolescent 
rebellion seemed centered on the feeling that her mother had resented and 
abandoned her. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carmen showed the column to Maria, it sparked first an emotional 
upheaval, then a rapprochement. Maria stayed. She told the "crew" she'd been 
hanging with that she had head lice, which, according to Carmen, "was the 
beginning of her being put aside. They said, 'Oh, my God, you are so filthy.' 
After that, they didn't want anything to do with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen says Maria got a fresh start when she began high school in September. 
The girl, Carmen says, "is still angry and upset, but she is more calm than she 
was. She is doing pretty well in school. She has even found a boyfriend who is 
nice and clean. I am very optimistic."

 A Rebirth of Optimism: Last summer, Shari Davis and Wendy Read were grappling 
with wrenching family tragedies. Both had recently experienced stillbirths. 
They had met through a nurse who had attended them both and had thrown 
themselves into a pregnancy loss support group. They wanted people to know that 
stillbirth is not uncommon; that it can happen to anyone; that it remains, for 
the most part, a medical mystery, and that support groups are a critical way of 
addressing the feelings of loneliness and isolation that follow. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, Davis, Read and three of the other four women in their support 
group are well into pregnancies now, and feeling optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Davis: "I am convinced that my son's death was caused by some extremely 
out-of-the-ordinary thing that does not have a pattern to it. It's like a bolt 
of lightning striking and I don't think lightning would strike twice. But I do 
feel more vulnerable in general, just knowing how many things can go wrong with 
a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flip side is you so much appreciate the miracle of bringing life into the 
world."

 The Never-Ending Story, Civil Division: Sheila Styron, who described herself 
as "Super Blind Woman" before she was hit by a Santa Monica City bus as she 
stood on a sidewalk nearly three years ago, finally got her day in court. After 
many postponements, her civil case went to trial in Santa Monica Superior Court 
in October, three months after I wrote about the toll the accident had taken on 
her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Santa Monica argued that Styron was at fault, that her 
injuries were minor and that she had suffered no lasting psychological damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But a unanimous jury found otherwise -- Styron had been standing on the 
sidewalk, after all, when the bus sharply angled across the curb and struck her 
-- and awarded her $235,000 -- $150,000 for her pain and suffering and $85,000 
in actual economic loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The case isn't closed yet. Styron and her attorney were back in court last 
week, arguing against a motion filed by the opposing attorney asking the judge 
to order a new trial or to reduce the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just trying really hard to learn the art of . . . patience and 
acceptance," says Styron, a professional singer and composer. "You think it's 
over and then you get another set of these papers in the mail."

 In the Wake of a Brentwood Blood Bath: This was a busy and in some ways 
exhilarating season for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women 
(LACAAW), which operates a 24-hour rape and battering hot line. After the June 
13 murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman, and the release of Nicole 
Simpson's 911 tapes, calls increased dramatically, with many women talking 
about not wanting to "end up like Nicole." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the gratifying parts of this year's work is that our agency was able 
to be part of a national teach-in on domestic violence," says LACAAW Executive 
Director Patti Giggans. "The hard part is we are still struggling to provide 
more and better services. There are still so many holes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming year, LACAAW will rededicate itself to prevention, to reaching 
adolescents and teen-agers with its dating violence curriculum presented in 
schools. Research shows that about a third of teen dating relationships involve 
some sort of abusive behavior, from controlling and intimidation to physical 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep working on stopping this stuff," Giggans says, "and we are 
now focusing on kids." 
</P>
<P>
 When O.J. Simpson's murder trial begins next year, Giggans and her colleagues 
anticipate another window of opportunity to educate the public about domestic 
violence, should the defense attempt to portray Nicole Simpson as an abusive 
wife.

 Why I Love This Job: Last January, Miki Jackson was struggling to raise money 
to buy some commercial-sized washing machines and dryers for Aunt Bee's, the 
laundry and thrift store she runs on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. The 
business is one of the less glamorous AIDS charities; its volunteers do laundry 
for the sick and dying. The thrift store helps support the costs of the laundry 
and allows Aunt Bee's to donate merchandise such as used clothes and household 
goods to needy people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after I wrote about Aunt Bee's, I received a call from the 
secretary of a wealthy businessman, who was interested in donating money for 
the machines.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just find out how much they need," she instructed me. 
</P>
<P>
 I called her back and cringed as I told her the price: $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine," she said crisply. "I'll have a check on your desk tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Aunt Bee's was able to purchase three washing machines and three dryers. A 
year ago the laundry served 40 people with AIDS. The new equipment has made it 
possible to serve 200. 
</P>
<P>
 The businessman insisted on anonymity. All I know is this was not the first 
time he was moved to such an act of kindness by a newspaper story. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, sir. Whoever you are.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; A POIGNANT CELEBRATION OF A RICH VEIN OF JEWISH HISTORY;

 "Fiddler on the Roof" and its setting in a poor but picturesque shtetl in a 
Russian backwater defines the Jewish tradition for many Americans -- and, for 
that matter, many American Jews. But there is another tradition in Judaism, a 
grand and glorious one, and Howard M. Sachar celebrates it in "Farewell 
Espana," a history of the Jews who trace their ancestry to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sephard" is a Hebrew term for the Iberian Peninsula, and the Sephardim were 
Jews whose dispersion from the Holy Land in antiquity brought them to what is 
now Spain and Portugal. Sachar describes how the Sephardic Jews achieved a 
unique degree of affluence and independence under the 8th-Century Moorish 
conquerors who saw the Jews as an especially useful kind of infidel because of 
their skills at commerce, medicine and statecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sephardic Jewry by the tenth century had become primus inter pares within the 
vast dispersion of their people," Sachar writes. "Numbering perhaps eighty 
thousand, they (shared) a collective security of existence all but unimaginable 
to their harried fellow Jews in Christian Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sachar, the Golden Age of the Sephardic Jews coincided with what 
he calls the Islamic Renaissance, a period in which the Sephardim achieved not 
only economic prosperity but distinguished themselves in the more exalted 
enterprises of poetry, philosophy, science and medicine. To this day, according 
to Sachar, the Sephardic world is celebrated for "its own characteristic joie 
de vivre, its brilliance of plumage, its genial, accommodating, tolerant 
affection for life's pleasures and excesses, even its frailties." 
</P>
<P>
 By the 13th Century, however, the reconquest of Spain by the Christian 
monarchy put an end to the golden days of both Islam and the Sephardim, and a 
new Diaspora sent the Sephardic Jews across Europe, into North Africa, and 
throughout the Middle East. The verse of the Sephardic poet Moses ibn Ezra 
embodied a familiar if heartbreaking aspect of the Jewish experience: 
</P>
<P>
 'My feet run about like lightning to the far ends of the earth,/and I move 
from sea to sea./Journey follows journey, but I find no resting place, no calm 
repose."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sachar devotes the bulk of his book to the fate of the Sephardim after 
their final expulsion from Spain in 1492, and he follows the strands of 
Sephardic culture to every place where these proud and accomplished people 
sought refuge: the Balkans, Asia Minor, the Holy Land, Western Europe, North 
Africa, the New World, and finally the modern state of Israel, where the 
Sephardim have come to play a decisive role in the religious and political life 
of the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Sachar scrutinizes the leading figures of Sephardic history in 
all of their complexity and diversity. For example, he celebrates Moses ben 
Maimon, a 12th-Century Jew from Cordoba who became court physician to Saladin 
and authored several monumental works of law and philosophy that are still 
authoritative in Jewish religious life. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sachar gives us, too, the remarkable figure of Shabbatai Zvi, a Jew from 
Ismalia who raised and then crushed the hopes of his fellow Jews throughout 
Europe by declaring himself to be the messiah and then converting to Islam in 
the 17th Century, an event that shattered the conventions of Jewish religious 
observance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sachar is a distinguished Jewish historian -- and the son of another renowned 
scholar, the late Abram L. Sachar -- whose work has focused on the sometimes 
bitter realities of Jewish experience in recent history. Even when he is 
documenting the tragedies that have befallen the Jewish people, however, Sachar 
achieves a kind of grandeur, a certain scale and sweep, and a fugue-like 
juxtaposition of old and new, exotic and familiar, that transcends the mere 
chronicling of facts and figures. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while recounting the "Great Betrayal" of the false messiah 
Shabbatai Zvi in 17th Century Constantinople, Sachar flashes forward to 
another, more recent betrayal -- a rabbi in Salonika who collaborated with the 
Nazi occupiers of Greece in consigning 50,000 of his fellow Jews to death at 
Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, mindful of the rich heritage of Sephardic poetry that dates back 
more than a millennium, he brings the narrative abruptly into the here and now 
by quoting a contemporary Israeli poet of Sephardic descent who recalls the 
fate of the Salonikan Jews in the antique Sephardic dialect called Ladino. 
</P>
<P>
 The words of the Ladino poet, as it turns out, epitomize what Sachar has 
accomplished in "Farewell Espana," a poignant celebration of a rich vein of 
Jewish history: "And their terrifying laments mix with the wind,/The wind that 
is powerless to drown out the groans."

MOVIE REVIEW; 'KING GEORGE' A REAL ROYAL TREAT; NIGEL HAWTHORNE'S POTENT 
PORTRAYAL GIVES HUMANITY TO MONARCH'S FALL INTO DEMENTIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Late in 1788, in the 28th year of the reign of England's King George III, 
something extraordinary happened: As one modern historian's tactfully puts it, 
"The king's mind broke down." A bizarre kind of dementia overtook the monarch 
who had already lost the American Colonies, and everyone who was anyone in the 
country's ruling circles was faced with a crisis beyond all imagining. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to prove that the unlikeliest material can make for the best films, "The 
Madness of King George," directed by Nicholas Hytner from Alan Bennett's 
prize-winning play, has taken this footnote to history and transformed it into 
one of the triumphs of the year -- potent, engrossing and even thrilling to 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 This is due in great measure to Nigel Hawthorne's work as the deranged 
monarch, a heroic performance that enlarges our understanding of what acting 
can accomplish. A recent arrival at celebrity, the 65-year-old Hawthorne swept 
his country's major theatrical awards when he played the part on the London 
stage. And Hytner, who directed that version as well, has ensured that his 
interpretation was transferred to the screen with its intensity intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not as celebrated here as he is back home, writer Bennett (who has a 
brief cameo as a mild member of Parliament) is one of Britain's most respected 
men of letters. Discerning folk will remember him as the screenwriter for the 
Joe Orton biography, "Prick Up Your Ears," and the Alan Bates-starring "An 
Englishman Abroad," as well as for being one of the nonpareil quartet (along 
with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller) that made the Beyond the 
Fringe satirical troupe so brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 What Bennett has done in "Madness" is to powerfully re-imagine the atmosphere 
of George's royal court, giving the dialogue a modern twist while keeping it 
from sounding anachronistic. The pleasure he takes in the spoken word, his 
ability to etch characters in both acid and compassion, to write such lines of 
dialogue as "the state of monarchy and the state of lunacy share a frontier" 
set this film thankfully apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Confessing, in the play's introduction, that he has "always had a soft spot 
for George III," Bennett introduces the monarch at the height of his powers. A 
genially choleric man, bluff, gruff and plain-spoken, he is proud of his 
popularity with the common folk but is a trial to his 15 children, especially 
his bored-to-death heir, the Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett). 
</P>
<P>
 Setting a hectic pace and ending most sentences with a speedy "What, what?" 
the king's energy looks even greater than it is because he is surrounded by 
effete whiners and smooth careerists. Except for Greville (Rupert Graves), his 
loyal equerry, everyone, including ice-cold Prime Minister William Pitt (Julian 
Wadham), is both irritated and comforted by the knowledge that they are more 
sophisticated than their ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 George's most heartening and moving relationship is with his Queen Charlotte, 
beautifully played -- albeit with welcome dramatic license (the real queen was 
said to be "as dull as she was ugly") -- by Helen Mirren. Never apart for so 
much as a day in their 28 years of marriage, they call each other "Mr. King" 
and "Mrs. King" in private and still seem very much in love. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with almost no warning, the madness begins, difficult to detect at first 
because, as one character asks, "Who can say what is normal to a king?" But 
after bouts of waking everyone up at 4 a.m., screaming fits about nonexistent 
floods and zealous sexual attacks on the attractive Lady Pembroke (Amanda 
Donohoe), one of the queen's attendants, there can no longer be any doubt that 
the monarch is not himself. 
</P>
<P>
 When the king's condition becomes known, the political maneuvering begins in 
earnest. For if Parliament declares George unfit to rule and the noxious Prince 
of Wales is installed as regent, Pitt will be out and the hungry opposition, 
led by the troublesome Charles James Fox (Jim Carter), will take power. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, George's condition is made worse by the barbaric treatments, 
verging on medieval torture, that his crackpot Three Stooges medical team 
inflict on him. Finally, as a last resort, he is put in the hands of Willis 
(Ian Holm), a former clergyman with unusual ideas about the treatment of the 
mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a measure of Hawthorne's performance in the title role that, like King 
Lear (who is pointedly referred to), the worse his condition becomes, the more 
he inspires our sorrow and pity. His madness adds to his moral stature by 
making him increasingly human, and we root for him with a surprising passion to 
recover his wits. Meanwhile, the looks of confused horror and self-loathing 
that flit across his ravaged face express torment as heartbreakingly as acting 
is able to. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Hytner, known for his stage work on "Miss Saigon" and "Carousel," is 
so at home with film that it is difficult to believe this is his feature debut. 
Working with cinematographer Andrew Dunn and Oscar-winning production designer 
Ken Adam ("Barry Lyndon"), he has faultlessly opened up the play and made a 
distant world seem physically real. Down to its final footnote on modern 
theories about the cause of the royal illness, every aspect of "The Madness of 
King George" keeps us amused, surprised and delighted. Who wouldn't wish long 
life to a film as worthy as this?

POP MUSIC REVIEW; DARIUS RUCKER POWERS STRONG SET BY HOOTIE & THE BLOWFISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hootie & the Blowfish landed at the House of Blues on Monday with a 
high-energy mix of rock, gospel, folk, country and the usual pop formulas. 
Keyboardist John Nau joined the Columbia, S.C., quartet for the concert, 
re-creating his soulful Hammond organ parts from the band's "Cracked Rear View" 
album, but what held the show together at a consistently uplifting level was 
singer Darius Rucker. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was a sameness to much of the night's material, Rucker's raspy, 
bluesy tenor gave a passionate focus to the band's straight-ahead groove rock. 
That mix reached explosive proportions on a funked-up take on Bill Withers' 
"Use Me," which had the singer crying out and guitarist Mark Bryan bounding 
into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway into the set (which was videotaped for an upcoming House of Blues 
in-concert TV program), Rucker said he that he was suffering from strep throat, 
which he was treating with "antibiotics and beer." But there were no obvious 
flaws in his voice, even during a puzzling, a cappella version of Barry 
Manilow's "Even Now" -- an impressive enough vocal turn, but still not a very 
interesting song. STEVE APPLEFORD

 Sexual Harassment Findings: Lewd remarks, suggestive touching and other forms 
of sexual harassment are routine on network television, say University of 
Dayton researchers who studied sitcoms from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. The study, 
which examined 26 sitcoms that aired on the networks in October and November of 
1990 (prior to the confirmation hearings for then-Supreme Court nominee 
Clarence Thomas), classified 40% of the 307 incidents of sexual behavior shown 
on the programs as sexual harassment. The researchers based their findings on a 
legal definition of sexual harassment: unwelcome sexual behavior, which was 
manifested as sexual remarks, looks and gestures; kissing, touching or grabbing 
in a sexual manner; date requests and violations of personal space. "We were 
very surprised to discover there is a good deal" of sexual harassment on 
television, said Thomas Skill, an associate professor of communications. "More 
importantly, it is presented in such a way to make it seem acceptable." All 
four networks declined to comment on the study.

 Going On Hiatus: ABC is taking its Sunday night comedy "On Our Own" off the 
schedule until March, at which time the show will return with a new cast 
member. Former "In Living Color" regular T'Keyah Crystal Keymah will play a 
"spirited contractor" who agrees to make repairs to the Jerrico family home in 
lieu of rent. The series, which has struggled in the ratings but nonetheless 
been picked up for a full 22-episode season, will have a special airing tonight 
at 8:30, then will return to its regular Sunday 7:30 p.m. spot in March. In the 
interim, ABC will air "classic episodes" of "America's Funniest Home Videos" in 
that time slot.

 Station Switch: The hit weekday syndicated program "A Current Affair" and its 
companion weekend edition "A Current Affair: Extra" will move from KTTV/Fox 
Channel 11 to KNBC Channel 4 starting on Monday. Channel 4 will air "A Current 
Affair" (hosted by Penny Daniels) at 7:30 p.m., replacing the syndicated 
version of "The Price Is Right." Meanwhile, Channel 11, which aired "A Current 
Affair" at 11:30 p.m., will fill the void with episodes of the 1970s series 
"MASH," creating a two-episode block of the award-winning comedy on weeknights 
from 11:30 p.m.-12:30 a.m.

 Schedule Changes: KCAL Channel 9 is switching around several of its daytime 
talk programs. Starting Monday "The Marilyn Kagan Show" will move to 2 p.m.-3 
p.m. weekdays, a change that is being previewed this week, when the show airs 
in both the old 9 a.m. and the new 2 p.m. time slots. Meanwhile, "Judge for 
Yourself," which previously aired at 2 p.m., moved this week to the 11 
a.m.-noon slot previously occupied by "Susan Powter" and the canceled "Jones 
and Jury." Starting Monday Powter's show will air at 9 a.m., followed by the 
comedy "227."

 Miller Time: To Leslie Uggams, former TV star Mitch Miller is much more than 
the maestro of the sing-along. Miller discovered Uggams and stuck by her when 
times could have gotten tough. That's why she'll present him with the Congress 
of Racial Equality's lifetime achievement award at a dinner in New York Jan. 
16. A year after Miller saw Uggams as a game-show contestant, his "Sing Along 
With Mitch" went on the air, and he asked her to make a guest appearance. She 
became a regular on the show, which ran on NBC from January, 1961, to 
September, 1966, even though some stations in the South refused to air the 
programs with Uggams, who is black. "Mitch was told either I go or the show 
goes," Uggams told the New York Times. "He said, 'Either she stays or there's 
no show.' . . . To do that was heroic." POP/ROCK

 Singing for Hunger Relief: Stevie Wonder will spend New Year's Eve kicking off 
his national "Charge Against Hunger/Natural Wonder Tour" at Detroit's Fox 
Theatre. The benefit concert tour, featuring Wonder backed by a 33-piece 
orchestra, includes a Jan. 14 performance at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
Wonder's upcoming album, "Conversation Peace," due in stores March 21, includes 
the song "Take the Time Out," which is the anthem of Charge Against Hunger, a 
hunger-relief partnership formed in 1993 by American Express and Share Our 
Strength. Last year, Wonder's efforts helped Charge Against Hunger raise $5.3 
million.

 L.A. slaw: Attorneys in California are required to take 12 hours of continuing 
education each year. You might therefore assume that they'd want to catch up on 
changes in the civil code, recent Supreme Court decisions, etc.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they can complete half of their requirement by taking six hours of a 
locally offered seminar called, "Mood, Mind and Appetite: Enhanced Performance 
Through Diet." Its courses include:  
</P>
<P>
 * "Compulsive Overeating: A 'Sweet Tooth or Fat Tooth' " 
</P>
<P>
 * "Feeding the Brain: For Appetite, Energy and Mood Control" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Carbohydrate Cravings and Sugar Addictions: Physiological vs. 
Psychological" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Endorphins, Exercise and Chocolate as Natural Tranquilizers" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Appetite Theories: Biochemical, Hormonal and Seasonal" 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, attorneys aren't only hungry for justice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate List of the Day: We may ask the State Bar to certify Only in L.A.'s 
rival Enhanced Performance Through Diet seminar. It would require an attorney 
to pause before setting out for that favorite Westside restaurant after he or 
she has collected a fat fee from a client. The barrister would then recite 
these two phrases: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't overeat! 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't over-drink! 
</P>
<P>
 Time of seminar: five seconds.

 Municipal bathtub: Liberal as it is, Santa Monica prohibits pets, as well as 
humans, from frolicking in the fountains on the Third Street Promenade. But

taking a dip on a sunny day. A real Polaroid moment.

 Deja view: We've mentioned how a dim bloke in Nathanael West's "The Day of the 
Locust" (1933) resembles a current cartoon character of the same name -- Homer 
Simpson. A colleague points out that there's a similar link between the 1946 
Jimmy Stewart movie, "It's a Wonderful Life," and the kids' TV show, "Sesame 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, there's a scene where a guardian angel shows a dejected George 
Bailey (Stewart) what would have happened had he never been born. On a tour of 
his hometown, Bailey sees two friends, the local cop and the local cabbie, and 
shouts, "Bert! Ernie!"  
</P>
<P>
 When they don't recognize him, Bailey momentarily turns into a sort of Oscar 
the Grouch. miscelLAny Don Fawcett of Brentwood points out that Pavilions is 
running specials on "New Year's Sandwiches," "New Year's Champagne Cake," "New 
Year's Decorated Cakes," and "Cinco de Mayo Party Trays." Fawcett wonders 
whether the tray is dated Cinco de Mayo, 1995, or 1994?

 The practice facilities provided for teams are marked in their contrast. There 
is the one used by Ohio State that is completely enveloped by a green screen 
and guarded by two friendly but stern members of the Orlando Police Dept. 
</P>
<P>
 The other, down the street at a high school, is part of a complex of football 
and baseball fields open to anyone who wants to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Coach Gene Stallings is not thrilled with his practice facility but 
doesn't want to make a big deal of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just a little uncomfortable with all the wide-open spaces, but it's just 
me," Stallings said. "I'm not paranoid about anybody watching; it just breaks 
my concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings did check into erecting a shaded fence but said it was too 
expensive. He wouldn't say how much, but $5,000 to $6,000 is the estimated cost 
of a fence around one of two fields he was using. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also thought of putting security people around the fields and 
halting all other activity at the complex. But he didn't like that idea, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are baseball camps going on," Stallings said. "A kid has probably been 
looking forward to a baseball camp for a long time and I'm not going to stop a 
baseball camp." 
</P>
<P>
 That makes Stallings about the only one who hasn't stopped baseball this year.

 It'll be a two-horse Cotton Bowl Monday.

 Texas Tech and USC have hoofed mascots, although Texas Tech's Two Bar Boy is 
the Red Raiders' interim mascot.Their previous steed, Double-T, hit his head 
during a game and died.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' Traveler IV will be trucked to Dallas this week, and rider Tom 
Nolan will have the white Arabian dash about the Cotton Bowl every time USC 
scores.  
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech followers went into shock at what happened during the Sept. 3 New 
Mexico game at Lubbock. Double-T's rider, Amy Smart, fell off the coal-black 
horse when her saddle cinch broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Double-T bolted, ran riderless across the end zone, then made a sudden turn to 
gallop up the stadium ramp. He ran head-first into a concrete abutment and died 
instantly.  
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech will shop for a black quarter horse in the off-season, and will 
probably name the successor Double-T II. EARL GUSTKEY

 Penn State tailback Ki-Jana Carter praised the university's move to the Big 
Ten because "if you win the championship, you go to Disneyland free." That's 
what players from this year's Rose Bowl teams, Penn State and Oregon, did 
Tuesday, although some chose to remain on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a rides man and I'm especially not too crazy about those roller 
coasters," Oregon cornerback Herman O'Berry said. "I'd rather stay on the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who finished second in Heisman voting, said he would have voted for a 
teammate, quarterback Kerry Collins, who was fourth. "We wouldn't have been 
11-0 without him," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Collins has that Central Casting quarterback look, someone mentioned to 
Penn State Coach Joe Paterno that Oregon's quarterback, Danny O'Neil, might be 
confused with a punter. 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno said: "Danny Marino looks like a lover until he throws the football. 
Don't let looks confuse you. I've watched O'Neil play. He's a tough son of a 
gun. I know that much about him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Collins didn't look like a Heisman candidate in Tuesday morning's practice at 
UC Irvine, throwing two interceptions and drawing Paterno's wrath. Nor did Penn 
State look like an 11-0 team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't very good today," Paterno said. "We've got to get better than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The only Penn State player questionable for Monday's game is defensive tackle 
Eric Clair, who broke his right foot in a Nov. 1 workout and hasn't played 
since. Questionable Ducks are two reserves, offensive tackle Mike Klews (knee) 
and safety Jaiya Figueras (ankle), a freshman from Glendale. SHAV GLICK and

 Miami Coach Dennis Erickson, rumored to be a leading candidate for the Seattle 
Seahawks' job if Tom Flores is fired, said Tuesday he has "no interest" in 
going to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "College football is what I want to do," Erickson said."I'd like to win a few 
more national championships here." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Erickson walked out of an interview after practice when asked about 
the Seattle situation.

 Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne plans to announce Thursday whether Brook Berringer 
or Tommie Frazier will be his starting quarterback Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both practiced pretty well (Tuesday)," Osborne said. "After tomorrow's 
practice, I'll talk to them. . . . and we'll probably say something the next 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier started Nebraska's first four games before being sidelined because of 
blood clots in his right leg. Berringer then took over and led the top-ranked 
Cornhuskers to eight victories in a row.

GIRLS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; RICHARD'S GOAL GETS IRVINE PAST EL MODENA, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BILAU 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After setting up her teammates for shot after shot with centering passes from 
the left wing, Irvine's Rise Richard found her Vaqueros still locked in a tie 
with El Modena Tuesday. So she took it upon herself to score the game winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's goal, a high-arching lob shot from 25 yards out that was too high 
for goalkeeper Marie Dillon, gave No. 9 Irvine a 2-1 victory and moved the 
Vaqueros into the quarterfinals of the Excalibur Tournament at Foothill High. 
Irvine (10-1-1) plays No. 1 Marina in a quarterfinal game at noon today. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine controlled the ball throughout the game with aggressive play at 
midfield. Vaquero Coach Hamid Sedehi credited forwards Richard and Shannon 
Milovich with setting the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shannon and Rise came on strong," he said. "They are very talented players 
with good touch on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine scored first, early in the first half when Sarah Denson intercepted a 
pass in front of the El Modena goal and fed Katie Roda for an easy tap-in. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena had few scoring chances in the game, but converted late in the first 
half when Kaylee Whitfield controlled a corner kick and drilled a shot into the 
upper left corner to tie the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard chipped in her unlikely game-winner midway through the second half 
and Irvine held on the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always take shots from right there, but I guess this one was kind of 
lucky," Richard said. GEOFF BILAU

BOYS' BASKETBALL / ABOVE THE RIM TOURNAMENT; COTTON AND JACKSON HAVE THEIR WAY 
IN 86-61 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes an enthused crowd can fire up a team. And sometimes a listless crowd 
can bring a team down. Wednesday night at Del Mar Torrey Pines High, the latter 
happened to an already tired Mater Dei team. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was an uninspired 86-61 victory over an outclassed Anchorage 
Service team in the second round of the Reebok/Above The Rim Prep Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not practiced since two weeks ago Thursday," Mater Dei Coach Gary 
McKnight said. "When you don't practice, you break down, not only physically, 
but mentally too." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite never being challenged by a much smaller Service team, Mater Dei 
center Shaun Jackson said his team, now ranked fourth in the country by USA 
Today, is still not totally in sync. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still not playing up to our capabilities," said Jackson, who tied 
teammate Schea Cotton for game-high scoring honors with 28 points. "The loss in 
Vegas brought everybody down. By the start of the (league season), we'll be OK. 
We've still got three more games here to get it together." 
</P>
<P>
 Service Coach Greg Fullmer said he wouldn't want to see a team get it much 
more together than Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't in awe of them," he said. "We had nothing to lose and we knew who 
we were playing. But we just couldn't match up with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Service (6-7), like everyone else, couldn't come close to matching up with 
Cotton or Jackson, who did whatever they wanted inside. Cotton (13 of 15 from 
the floor) had seven dunks and each one seemed to wake up the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's awesome," Fullmer said. "I wish every coach could have a sophomore like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, a 6-8 senior, was just as impressive, but in a less sensational 
manner. His nifty moves and silky smooth jumper didn't draw the same reaction 
as Cotton's high-flying slams, but he made 12 of 17 shots, grabbed eight 
rebounds and had five steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really small, so we just tried to push it inside," Jackson said. "I 
don't think they had a player over 6-4." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (13-1) led, 25-10, after a quarter and were ahead, 51-32, at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs figure to get a tougher test when they play Merced (8-4) tonight 
at 5:55 in the quarterfinals. They might need a better shooting game from Clay 
McKnight, who made just two of nine shots from the floor, all three-pointers, 
and finished with six points. 
</P>
<P>
 In another game: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 79, West Anchorage 58 -- Dan McDonald had 34 points and six 
rebounds and Erik Petersen had 16 points and eight rebounds for Ocean View 
(8-5), which outscored West Anchorage, 37-23, in the second half of a 
third-round victory.

 Less than two weeks before a playoff game, San Diego receiver Shawn Jefferson 
was jailed briefly after being arrested for investigation of drunk driving and 
gun violations, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson was pulled over Monday night by a San Diego County Sheriff's deputy 
responding to a report that shots had been fired in Alpine, a rural community 
about 30 miles east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson's passenger, backup offensive lineman Curtis Whitley, was not 
charged. Whitley and Jefferson breed horses in Alpine.

another physician could examine him after he suffered a second neck injury in

Saturday's playoff game against the Detroit Lions.

ended the season with the NFL's worst defense and amid speculation Coach Wade 
Phillips might be next to leave. Phillips, in the second year of a three-year 
contract, led the Broncos to a 7-9 record after an 0-4 start this season. 
Denver was 9-7 in 1993. . . . Tim Bowens, a defensive tackle from Mississippi 
whom the Miami Dolphins picked with the 20th choice in the first round of the 
draft, was named Associated Press defensive rookie of the year. . . . . A 
Tampa, Fla., group made an offer to buy the Buccaneers that is valid until Jan. 
9, a trustee for the team said. No details were revealed. . . . The Cincinnati 
Bengals named Tim Krumrie a defensive line coach. Krumrie, 34, retired 
Saturday. . . . Cardinal Coach Buddy Ryan said wide receiver Randal Hill, 
linebacker Wilber Marshall and safety Andre Waters will not be back with the 
team next season and quarterback Steve Beuerlein and wide receivers Ricky 
Proehl and Gary Clark will be offered in the expansion draft.

OUTDOOR NOTES / RICH ROBERTS: FAULTY MEXICAN PLAN FOILS SAN DIEGO FLEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A misguided plan to protect the threatened giant manta rays might be why 
Mexico has ignored applications from San Diego's long-range fleet for permits 
to fish the Revillagigedo Islands this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of seeking a response, Bob Fletcher, president of the 
Sportfishing Assn. of California, said he was finally made aware of the manta 
ray concerns while meeting before Christmas with government officials in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have created a special protected area six miles out from each island for 
species that are listed as threatened or endangered, including near-shore 
tropical reef fishes -- one example is the Clarion angel fish -- and also the 
giant manta ray," Fletcher said Tuesday. "We said we couldn't live with staying 
six miles outside those islands." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-island group is 220 miles south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas and holds 
the world's best population of yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said the problem might have started in 1993, when videos of Mexican 
gill-netters taking manta rays were shown on TV in Mexico. Outraged 
environmentalists apparently persuaded the government to impose the six-mile 
limit -- but nobody was inclined to tell the American sportfishermen until new 
President Ernesto Zedillo took office Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said Mexico is continuing a process started by previous President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari to develop a new sportfishing plan. A representative 
of the sportfishing association -- probably long-time consultant Barney 
Thompson, who is bilingual -- will be allowed to sit in. The deadline is June 
5, which worries Fletcher that nothing will happen before this season dissolves 
in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he hopes to return to Mexico City next month to appeal the six-mile 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could make a very solid argument that we in no way impact giant manta 
rays," Fletcher said. "Our hook-and-line fishing gear is not like nets. In this 
appeal, we also will suggest as an alternative a quarter-mile closure, or that 
we could stay outside 25 fathoms, which is deeper than any of those tropical 
fish live. Our target species are yellowfin tuna and wahoo, and both species 
are in excellent health." 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said that, with customers bailing out, the long-range fleet already 
has lost 15 of its 43 scheduled trips to the Revillagigedos, "and every day 
that goes by is the potential for losing another." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Starting Sunday, a California angler can use two rods at once on lakes and 
reservoirs -- if he has a special $7.90 stamp on the back of the regular 
fishing license. The purpose is to enhance catching opportunities and 
Department of Fish and Game revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trout are often near the surface during these cold months in pursuit of shad, 
and anglers owning a two-rod stamp will be able to put bait on one rod and work 
a lure with the other to see what brings the most action," said Neil Manji, a 
Department of Fish and Game fishery biologist in Redding. 
</P>
<P>
 As before, only one rod will be allowed on rivers and streams, and the daily 
trout limit remains at five per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Oudin was catching fish almost before he could walk or talk, and now he 
really has something to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 Oudin, the 13-year-old son of Doug Oudin, the harbor master at Two Harbors on 
Santa Catalina Island, was on his first fishing trip to Cabo San Lucas this 
month when he hooked into a 383-pound blue marlin. Oudin, who weighs 95 pounds, 
fought the fish for 2 1/2 hours as it came to leader three times before the 
line snagged on either the propeller or rudder. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the line continued to run, so it was retrieved with a gaff hook, cut 
and retied onto the reel as Trevor's father and uncle, Dave Oudin, took over 
for the next two hours until the fish came alongside for the last time and 
rolled belly up. Past the point of being released, it was donated to the Ponga 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes after docking, Trevor, ignoring blisters and aching muscles, was 
catching and releasing small jack and permit fish from the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SLED-DOG RACING -- Snow conditions appear good for the second annual Mammoth 
Mushing Classic at Sierra Meadows Ranch near Mammoth Lakes Saturday and Sunday. 
Races start at 9:30 a.m., weight-pulling contests at 12:30 both days. Admission 
is free. 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- California's black bear season, initially scheduled to run until 
Christmas Day, was closed Dec. 21, when the limit of 1,500 was reported. The 
total was expected to reach about 1,700 before word reached hunters in the 
field, the Department of Fish and Game said. 
</P>
<P>
 BOATING -- BOAT/U.S. warns boaters to be careful in January, the most 
dangerous month. While accidents are down because of less boating activity, 
statistics from 1993 show that 32% of the accidents in January resulted in one 
or more fatalities, compared to 6-7% in June, July and August. The critical 
factor is cold water that induces hypothermia.

 Two limits by the same person on the same day?

<P>
 Don't call the Fish and Game warden.Because Corona Lake is privately operated 
by Outdoor Safaris International, it was perfectly legal when Fred Vecht of 
Fontana caught one five-fish limit of rainbow trout, then bought another gate 
pass and went back out to his hot spot to catch another limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Vecht used green Power Bait along the west shore. Anglers are advised not to 
exceed the one-day limit on public waters.

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: POST-DIVORCE, NOT ALL TIES THAT BIND ARE 
FAMILIAL; MANY FORMER SPOUSES KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR IN-LAWS AFTER A BREAKUP, 
EVEN WHEN NO CHILDREN ARE INVOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even though he's been divorced for eight years, Lee Terry visits his former 
mother-in-law, Diane Geisler, on a regular basis and often sits down for a 
friendly chat. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ex-mother-in-law and I have always liked and respected each other," says 
Terry, 46, an environmental manager in Irvine. "Just because you get divorced 
doesn't mean you should stop seeing your in-laws, especially if there are 
children involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry's two teen-age daughters have been going to their grandparents' before 
and after school since their parents divorced in 1986. He sees his former 
in-laws when he drops the kids off and picks them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ex-mother-in-law and I have a very comfortable relationship," Terry says. 
"We'll talk about what the girls are doing in school, how my work is going and 
even discuss politics. We have similar viewpoints on many subjects. Even when 
the kids are grown, I'm sure I will maintain some sort of relationship with 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship with her ex-son-in-law is friendly, agrees Geisler, 58, who 
lives in Huntington Beach. "If I ever needed anything, I know Terry would be 
right here to help," she says. "He's a good father, and I respect him for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Many former spouses maintain relationships with their in-laws, says David 
Mann, a clinical psychologist in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are often involved, but some people even continue relationships when 
there is no offspring," he says. "If they get along and enjoy each other, they 
see no reason to stop talking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there are children, he says, "grandparents have an investment in keeping a 
relationship going, so they can maintain a positive relationship with their 
grandchildren. Many parents also want to ensure that their children know their 
grandparents, despite a breakup." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry says he's lucky to have a former mother-in-law who considers the 
children first. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has thought more about the children's benefits than taking sides and 
holding grudges," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents died, so they are the only grandparents the girls have," he says. 
"I would be hurting myself and them if I prevented them from seeing one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 Geisler says she feels similarly. "Lee will always be a part of the family. As 
grandparents, you need to love your grandchildren more than your anger and 
remember who their father or mother is. The girls are related to him, and we 
can't ignore that. The best thing is to try and maintain a relationship for the 
kids' sake. The family unit is important, whatever way you can get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan, 60, who asked that her last name not be used, says she feels the same 
way about her daughter's ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it, once a son-in-law, always a son-in-law," says Joan, who 
lives in South Orange County. "There was never any abuse in the marriage, and 
he has always been a good father to our two grandchildren. We still consider 
him part of the family. If he remarries, we'll be delighted to have him come 
over with his new wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, when there was a death in the family, Joan's son-in-law quickly 
showed up with a gift and condolences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk regularly about the grandchildren, his job and everyday things," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 When the divorce occurred, Joan says she made it clear to her daughter and 
son-in-law that she would not take sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I have had many friends who divorced over the years; we have 
never taken sides, and it has worked out for the best," she says. "So I decided 
to do the same with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining a relationship with her grandchildren is also an important reason 
for Joan to stay on good terms with her son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once children are involved, the whole picture changes," she says. "If they 
hadn't had kids, we might have told my son-in-law to stop by but may not have 
encouraged him so much. Our grandchildren are very precious to us, though, and 
you never know what life is going to deal you. If anything happened to our 
daughter, and we had alienated him from the family, we might be going to court 
in order to see our grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Sonia Gonzalez, 47, has been divorced from her husband for almost a 
decade, she has remained close with her mother-in-law, whom she has known for 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it doesn't happen very often when people get divorced, but my 
mother-in-law and I are very close," says Gonzalez, a child services worker who 
lives in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother-in-law and I spend time together often, and she's always there when 
I need her," she says. "Last year I had back trouble, and she was there in a 
minute to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's mother died before her children, now 24 and 20, were born. "My 
mother-in-law really taught me how to be a mother to my children, and she is 
like a second mother to me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez spends many holidays with her former mother-in-law and her four 
former sisters-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "They often come over for Thanksgiving and Christmas," she says. "I guess they 
don't want me to be alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan, 34, an activities director and medical secretary at a convalescent 
hospital in Santa Ana, has continued a relationship with her in-laws, despite 
being separated from her husband for eight years. She also takes exception to 
the term "ex-in-laws." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've remained close with my mother-in-law and one sister-in-law," she says. 
"Despite the divorce, they are still related to my three children. We'll always 
be connected, so saying 'ex' isn't appropriate in my view. They're with me for 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan says she looks up to her mother-in-law, who has qualities she admires. 
"In some cases, I would go to her for advice. I value her input." 
</P>
<P>
 But, despite being on good terms with her mother-in-law, Susan finds that she 
can't get too close to her. "Unlike how I am with my family, my guard is always 
up" with her, she says. "The most innocent things I say may be misconstrued, so 
I have to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 She has found that when problems arise with her ex-husband, there is also 
tension with her in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a few years, my ex-husband was out of the country. During that time, my 
relationship with my in-laws went very smoothly," she says. "Now he is back in 
town, and they seem to have pulled in the reins. I guess they think their 
loyalty is being tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she and the kids usually spend the holiday season with her in-laws, 
she says, this year was different. Her ex-husband is living at his mother's 
home with a new girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been acting strange since this new woman arrived," she says. "I don't 
know if they know what to do with me."

TV REVIEW; TWO TENORS, TWO OPERAS AT THE ONE AND ONLY MET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't just another op'nin', another show when the Metropolitan Opera began 
its current season on Sept. 26. Nothin' of the kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The stellar bill, which was taped for presentation on PBS tonight, offered two 
verismo thrillers in an unusual pairing. First came Puccini's gritty "Il 
Tabarro," a relative rarity that normally turns up in tandem with the same 
composer's "Suor Angelica" and "Gianni Schicchi." This was followed, after 
intermission, by Leoncavallo's tear-stained "Pagliacci," which customarily 
accompanies Mascagni's complementary slice of lyrical life, "Cavalleria 
Rusticana." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cav" and "Pag" will indeed return to normal cohabitation later in the Met 
season, with everyday casts. After two introductory performances in September, 
"Il Tabarro" again disappeared from the Met repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the temporary creation of these strange billfellows wasn't 
difficult to isolate. The mighty Met likes to show off its two tenorissimos on 
festive occasions, and there doesn't seem to be a single opera big enough for 
both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ergo, Placido Domingo was drafted for a single "Tabarro" (Luis Lima took over 
the second), and Luciano Pavarotti agreed to put on the clown costume for the 
first time on any stage in "Pagliacci." (In case anyone is wondering, the other 
tenorissimo of our times, Jose Carreras, doesn't seem to be working at the Met 
these days.) 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural event served as a grateful celebratory indulgence for the rival 
pirates of the high Cs (neither of whom had to sing one). Both artists made 
their house debuts in 1968 (though Domingo had appeared with the company at an 
outdoor concert two years earlier). Moreover, Teresa Stratas, the prima donna 
for all seasons, turned out to be enjoying a milestone of her own, having made 
her Met debut 35 years ago at the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Given all the extra-operatic hoopla, no realist would have been surprised if 
the actual performances had been dutiful rather than beautiful. As a kind fate 
would have it, however, the performances turned out to be beautiful, much of 
the time, and passionate too. 
</P>
<P>
 The binding credit belongs to James Levine, who sustains rare urgency in the 
pit without slighting any passing opportunities for grandeur or grace. Many 
companies relegate these challenges to tired hacks. Levine, who wields top 
baton at the Met, approaches Puccini and Leoncavallo as if they ranked with 
Wagner and Mozart, and he directs the proceedings as if lives were at stake. 
Important lives. It's a good way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Il Tabarro" may be a tawdry little exercise in Grand Guignol banality, but 
its easy effects are treated with respect and re-created with vivid authority 
here. Domingo at 53 may look a little jowly and beefy -- some artful corseting 
notwithstanding -- as the dashing stevedore in love with the young wife of the 
old boss on the Parisian barge. Luckily, he sings with constant ardor and with 
enough plangent force to compensate for any illusion problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The cameras are even less kind to Stratas as his beloved Giorgetta. Close-ups 
make the frequent references to her insomnia seem all too credible, and, 
complicating matters further, her soprano betrays signs of wear under pressure. 
Nevertheless, her dramatic intensity, her concern for textual detail and her 
refusal to accept traditional solutions to traditional problems enhance her 
appeal significantly. She may no longer be a perfect singer, but she remains a 
fascinating singing-actress. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Pons -- ironically, the most youthful of the principals -- holds his own 
sturdily, even sympathetically as old Michele, the betrayed husband driven to 
well-timed murder. Florence Quivar makes much of the hearty cameo allotted 
Frugola. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabrizio Melano's quasi-realistic production, first seen in 1975, still seems 
eminently functional. David Reppa's spare decors accommodate the inaction 
neatly, and Brian Large directs the TV cameras with flexible aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pagliacci" finds Pavarotti at his most restrained. He sings with ringing 
bel-canto fervor, keeps the sobs to a minimum and tries desperately (in this 
context, needlessly) to look younger than his 59 years. In the process, he 
articulates the text with utmost clarity and moves as little as possible. This 
is a conscientious effort to make the heroic Canio effective on his own 
less-than-heroic terms. The results are often convincing, occasionally 
illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratas partners him as an irresistibly flighty, unabashedly erotic, 
essentially ageless and uninhibited Nedda (and who cares about those fudged 
trills?). Pons returns as a big, burly, dangerous Tonio who commands all the 
right equipment except really ringing top tones. 
</P>
<P>
 The effective supporting cast includes Dwayne Croft as a suave and credible 
Silvio, Kenn Chester as a sweet and elegant Beppe. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco Zeffirelli's 1970 production looks properly picturesque, even when it 
is cluttered with too many extra bodies. Fabrizio Melano serves as traffic cop 
on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Metropolitan Opera presents "Il Tabarro" and "Pagliacci," sponsored by 
Texaco, tonight at 7 p.m. on KVCR (Channel 24) and 8 p.m. on KCET (Channel 28)

3 KILLED, 4 INJURED IN DRAG-RACING CRASHES; TRAFFIC: THE TWO ACCIDENTS OCCUR 15 
MINUTES APART IN INGLEWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Three men died and four others were injured, three critically, in two 
apparently unrelated incidents of illegal racing in Inglewood, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Anderson, 23, Timothy T. Morris, 24, and Mirales Bernall, 23, died in 
crashes that occurred half a mile and 15 minutes apart Monday night, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Anderson and Morris were racing with one or two 
other cars on Crenshaw Boulevard near 108th Street at 10:27 p.m. when the Mazda 
RX-7 in which they were traveling spun out of control and hit a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car seemed to flip about five times, and then it hit the tree and broke 
into pieces," said Kenny Davis, who saw the accident after leaving a friend's 
house a block from the crash. Both men were thrown from the car and pronounced 
dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 minutes later, police were called to Imperial Highway where Bernall 
and his passenger, Sandy Rodriquez, 22, were thrown from a Chevrolet Camaro 
Z-28 after crossing into the opposite traffic lane and hitting a Cadillac sedan 
head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Camaro appeared to be drag-racing with another vehicle when 
the driver saw a taxicab that was turning left and veered into the opposite 
lane. Lt. Harold Moret said beer containers were found in the Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriquez and two other passengers, Marco Bernall, 21, and Ismael Ramirez, 21, 
were critically injured and taken to area hospitals. The driver of the sedan, 
George Davlantis, also was hurt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Area residents say motorists regularly drive fast on Crenshaw and Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't do a lot of drag-racing here, but people are always speeding," 
said Kim Benjamin, who lives on Crenshaw about 100 feet from where the Mazda 
crashed. "I've lived here eight years and I have seen all kinds of accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Keisha Martin, who lives in the same apartment complex as Benjamin, said she 
has seen people traveling the wrong way down one-way streets as well as 
speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The speed limit is 40 and you tell people to do 40 and they do 50, tell them 
55 and they do 65," she said. "Something needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Moret said Crenshaw is a popular spot for speeding because it is a wide, 
smooth road. 
</P>
<P>
 An Inglewood resident who asked to be identified as "Little D" said speeding 
to outrun another motorist "happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody rolls up on you and guns their engine and it's on," he said. 
"Everybody does it."

LIGHTLY ON THE LAND; TRAIL BUILDER'S GOAL IS A HIKING PATH THAT'S BARELY 
NOTICEABLE 
</P>

<P>
 Ron Webster figures that if he does his job right, no one will notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster, you see, is a master trail builder -- one of a small fraternity of 
backcountry enthusiasts who hack walkways out of the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to build them so that people don't think they're walking on a trail," 
Webster said. "I want them to think they're just walking in the woods." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who walks in the woods of Los Angeles County has probably traveled some 
of the hundreds of miles of mountain trail designed, built or maintained by 
Webster over two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 10 years, Webster, 61, has been employed full time as a 
professional trail builder, spending much of his time on the nearly complete 
65-mile Backbone Trail that winds its way across the twisted spine of the Santa 
Monica Mountains from Will Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades to Point 
Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster's vocation is an arcane pursuit, one in which an instinctive feel for 
the flow of a mountainside is as important as a working knowledge of 
hydrodynamics, and the ability to work in solitude for days at a time is as 
critical as skill with an ax. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster, with salt-and-pepper hair and tanned, leathery hands that come from a 
lifetime of hard work, is considered a master of the trade, though the 
distinction embarrasses him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joke is, they won't pay someone who sort of knows what he is doing. They 
want to pay an expert -- 'a trail master.' It makes me cringe," said Webster 
while huffing along the Solstice Canyon Trail above Malibu one recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
 His is an expertise that comes largely from years of just walking in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of trail manuals and schools," Webster said. "I didn't go to 
any of them. But I remember something that lots of trail builders forget: The 
trail should lay lightly on the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster drifted into the job in a roundabout way. He wasn't particularly 
outdoorsy, but as the father of three in the 1970s he wanted his children to be 
exposed to the outdoors, so he began attending Sierra Club hikes. He soon 
became a volunteer hike leader and in the late 1970s he was instrumental in 
volunteer efforts to build the one-mile Musch Ranch Trail on newly acquired 
public land and to maintain existing trails. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, at the age of 51, Webster lost his job as a machinist. At 
the same time, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and its related 
organizations were launching an aggressive trail construction campaign. "I 
needed a job and they wanted trails," Webster said. "So it all sort of fit 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster's $24,000 salary is paid under a grant awarded to the Trails Council, 
which is affiliated with the mountains conservancy and the Conservancy 
Foundation. These organizations, along with the Sierra Club, work in 
conjunction with a patchwork of federal, state and local park agencies that 
acquire and maintain public lands in the local mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Most trails in Southern California are man-made and of recent origin. The old 
Indian, Spanish and pioneer corridors have long since been paved over. The 
pockets of wilderness that still exist in the Los Angeles Basin are generally 
the toughest, most severe landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the places where Webster now plies his trade. But while the terrain 
is tough, Webster applies a gentle touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good when you can't see my trail," said Webster, looking across a 
canyon at the seamless face of the opposite slope where the missing brush is 
hard to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some of the nation's celebrated trail builders, Webster does not use 
bulldozers or other heavy equipment. Alone, or with a crew of six or eight, 
Webster relies on a simple collection of broad-bladed McCleod hoes, sharp 
Pulaski axes and Forest Service-style picks to pare back the thick chaparral 
and chip away at the notoriously hard, dry turf of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster starts the process of building a new trail by studying topographic 
maps and bushwhacking around the area. Once he has settled on a general course, 
he takes off across the mountain, leaving a series of flags to mark the 
proposed path. A work crew, usually including Webster, chops down and clears 
out brush, removes rock and cuts into the slope of the hill to create a flat 
footpath. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Webster's simple but overriding principles in these ventures is: "Never 
build trail people won't use." 
</P>
<P>
 That means keeping the severity of the incline to an easy average of 10 
degrees and designing as many loop-trails -- ones that begin and end at the 
same place -- as possible. "That's what people want," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wilderness purists are more interested in lengthy, destination trail 
projects such as the Backbone Trail, but Webster says that despite the inviting 
prospect of spending a week to traverse that trail, most hikers will do it in 
small sections, a day hike at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Kilday, executive director of the Mountains Conservancy Foundation, says 
Webster's trails are distinctive because of his knack for winding them past the 
prettiest or most unusual features of a mountain -- a rock formation, a creek 
or striking tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "He designs to the fullest advantage" of the terrain, Kilday said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the digging and cutting has been done by Sierra Club volunteers. "The 
best volunteers aren't the guys who come out talking about how they love 
nature," Webster said. "It's the guys who just like to get dirty and see 
something get done." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the volunteer efforts have been buttressed with paid crews from 
the Los Angeles Conservation Corps under a grant that also pays Webster's 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster is clearly at home in his surroundings. He moves easily along the 
trail, with the steady sure-footedness of a veteran woodsman. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a friendly, talkative man, who maintains a constant patter of rambling 
explanations, anecdotes and notes on points of interest as he escorts a visitor 
along a Malibu area trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some questions, Webster responds with uncharacteristically direct and 
succinct answers. 
</P>
<P>
 You like your work, don't you? "Yes," says Webster plainly. Have you ever 
considered giving it up and getting a real job? "No," he says simply. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while he adds: "I've got a job that I hear dozens of people say, 'God, 
I'd like to have a job like yours.' But you know what, probably not." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster ticks off the occupational hazards: poison oak, mountain lions, valley 
fever and the generally dirty, backbreaking nature of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 And the isolation. "A lot of people can't handle the hours and hours of being 
alone, but I look forward to it," Webster says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there's the Mountain Tax. "Everyone who works in the mountains pays the 
Mountain Tax," Webster says. "That means you don't make any money." 
</P>
<P>
 While grants and other outdoors funding sources are never secure for long, 
there's little question of how much work there is to be done. Just maintaining 
existing trail is an enormous job, Webster notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you stop maintaining trail, it's incredible how fast Mother Nature can 
chew it up and spit it down the mountain," Webster said. Even new trail doesn't 
stay put long, Webster says. "By the time you get to the end, the beginning has 
already changed."

ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS ON THE ANTI-GANG BEAT; LAPD: OFFICERS USE PERSISTENT 
FIELD INTERVIEWS TO PROBE THE STRATA OF GANGLAND, SEPARATING MEMBERS FROM 
'ASSOCIATES.' BUT YOUTHS AND ACTIVISTS COMPLAIN THAT THE PROCEDURES OFTEN 
VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS.

<P>
 It did not matter that Omar Valdez was not a gang member. His gangster looks 
-- shaved head and baggy clothes -- were enough to attract the attention of two 
carloads of authentic gang members looking to avenge an earlier attack, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the high school senior stood alone at a pay phone on Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard last month, he was shot several times in the chest and back, and died 
a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division called in its 
gang experts. They quickly surmised that Valdez was, in police parlance, a 
"gang associate" -- someone who hung around with gang members but was not a 
formally initiated participant. 
</P>
<P>
 How do police know that? Gang members, after all, don't have to register with 
anybody. When officers unhesitatingly identify suspects or bullet-riddled 
bodies in the street as gang members or associates, what database are they 
using to justify such fine distinctions? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers lie in an effort to track gang membership down to the wanna-be 
level by the LAPD's Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The longstanding practice, based on persistent "field interviews" with 
suspected gang members who may simply be hanging out, is a controversial one. 
</P>
<P>
 Some youths complain they are constantly rousted by CRASH officers based 
simply on their ethnicity and clothing. Civil liberties activists complain that 
the criteria officers use to pick subjects for questioning are arbitrary, and 
that the classification process borders on being unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Police insist that the CRASH teams' aggressive methods are the only way to 
gather intelligence on the city's 400 gangs and more than 50,000 gang members, 
who make up more than half the estimated gang members in Los Angeles County.  
</P>
<P>
 Before he was killed, Omar Valdez had been interviewed four times on the 
street since March by officers who were able to establish that he had 
connections to a local gang, said CRASH Detective Mark Aragon. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez described to officers a relationship that is common in virtually all 
gang neighborhoods. He said he hung around with members of the area's gang 
because he grew up with them, but never took part in gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a dangerous game, Aragon said. "They draw attention to themselves," he 
said. "If Omar was wearing a polyester suit, this probably wouldn't have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they are 18 years old, about 90% of gang members in the LAPD's 
files have been arrested, and 75% have been arrested at least twice, police 
say. By the time they reach age 20, more than half of those in the file are 
dead or in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To gather information for those files, CRASH officers stop and interview 
people, usually boys or men between the ages of 14 and 25. In a Latino 
neighborhood like Valdez's, their targets have shaved heads or slicked-back 
hair, wear large pants, white T-shirts, baseball caps with gang insignias and 
big jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews can take place "at a traffic stop, or for any legitimate 
reason," said Aragon, adding that popular gathering spots for gang members are 
parks, alleys or in front of apartment houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Police fill out a field interview card on each person they stop. A name, 
address, description and any gang affiliation is required. A brief description 
of who the person was with and what they were doing at the time of the stop is 
compiled by the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sometimes check for tattoos, drugs and weapons in such field 
interviews, but only after asking the subject's permission, Aragon said. If 
someone claims to be a gang member, a picture is taken and filed with the 
information card in the station's gang-membership files. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not like the police just pick out any Hispanic kid and give him an 
affiliation to a gang," Aragon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say stopping youngsters -- and often conducting searches without 
warrants -- is legally questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has never been clear what the guidelines are" for stopping and identifying 
gang members, said Manny Velasquez of Community Youth Gang Services, a 
government-funded agency that works with gang members. "I think the police are 
walking a really thin line there." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said officers stop and photograph even youths who don't claim gang 
membership, harass other youths and search them without permission. Often 
police consider youths guilty simply by association, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is right that they are labeling a lot of kids who don't need 
to be labeled," said Velasquez. "If you do, you are empowering the kid to 
become a homeboy when he wasn't going to before." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry, 19, an admitted North Hollywood gang member, said he is constantly 
being harassed by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens because the police see four or five Mexicans standing around and 
see the way we are dressed," he said. "They stop us because we are gang 
members. It doesn't matter if we are doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But police say it is just such aggressive questioning, constantly tracking 
gang membership, that pays off in investigations of serious crimes -- like the 
slaying of Omar Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 It was through gang files, Aragon said, that CRASH officers came up with 
Valdez's suspected killer, a 17-year-old member of a Sun Valley gang who was 
arrested Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon, a 12-year LAPD veteran, freely uses gang lingo gleaned from the street 
and the routine training seminars mandatory for all CRASH investigators in Los 
Angeles. But he also knows the culture on a more intimate level: At 12, he was 
initiated into a gang. By 16, he was a father and husband. Not until he was 20 
did he leave. Gang tattoos cover his arms and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest lure to gang life is the sense of power you get," he says. "Not 
everyone can get 100 people behind them with a single phone call" for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Price, a professor of constitutional law in the Cal State Northridge 
political science department, said the LAPD's field interviewing practices -- 
questioning and photographing suspected gang members on the street -- have yet 
to be challenged in courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts have held that "warrantless searches" are valid only if a police 
officer "acted in good faith" and no irrevocable harm was done, Price said. 
Even here, however, the officer must have "probable cause": the belief that a 
crime is about to take place, that someone's safety is in jeopardy, or that the 
evidence might disappear unless a search is conducted immediately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If police engage in an informal conversation with suspected gang members, "and 
then find something on them when they decide to search them, the case could be 
thrown out because there is no probable cause," Price said. "When police stop a 
group of gang members, they could just be patrolling. But if a search takes 
place, they need probable cause or (the youths') permission." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon acknowledged that gang members' style of dress does attract attention 
from police, but said suspected gang members are usually stopped because they 
are in a neighborhood where gangs are prominent or for drinking in a public 
place. Simply striking up a conversation with a suspected gang member, asking 
him about life in the gang world -- about new members, animosities or 
relationships -- does not qualify as a field interview, and thus requires no 
probable cause, he said. Price agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang membership information takes on added importance when arrests lead to 
trial. If police can establish that a defendant is a gang member, it is easier 
to obtain a conviction, according to both prosecutors and defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average citizen sees gang members as violent and they are prejudicial 
against them because of that," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels, who 
specializes in prosecuting gang-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 For defense lawyers, a gang label can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to try to prevent the jury from hearing that they are a member of a 
gang," said Marty Mizel, a deputy county public defender. "Just because a 
person is in a gang, it doesn't mean he runs around every moment of the day 
raping and pillaging. But the juries' general reaction to gang members is 
highly prejudicial." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez of Community Youth Gang Services said youths need to protect 
themselves when being questioned on the street by police.  
</P>
<P>
 "When they have the spotlight in their face, the kids know they have to come 
up with the correct answer. They might say something that they didn't really 
want to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A correct address and prompt answers are the most effective way to deal with 
the police, he said. "They empower police when they give answers like 'I don't 
know,' " Velasquez said. "If (police) ask them why they are wearing a Raiders 
jacket, you either say you are cold or you are a hard-core Raiders fan."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CHP 
UNVEILS 'FIX IT' TICKETS FOR MECHANICAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol will begin issuing a new type of ticket to 
drivers stopped for mechanical problems, a Los Angeles spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fix It" tickets will require drivers to correct simple problems, such as a 
broken taillight or headlight, within 30 days, and to present proof to the CHP 
area office nearest to where the violation occurred, said Officer Dwight 
McDonald of the West San Fernando Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 If a driver proves that he or she has fixed the problem, no further action 
will be taken. But if no proof is shown, a complaint will be forwarded to the 
courts for misdemeanor prosecution, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure is designed to ease the burden on courts and make it easier for 
motorists to correct simple mechanical problems.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; CLERGY GROUP 
VOWS EFFORT TO TEACH ABOUT HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The more than 500 clergy members who make up the Committee of Concerned 
Christians will spend part of 1995 trying to re-educate people about the 
Holocaust, the group's co-founder said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll by the organization showed that 41% of the respondents between 
ages 18 and 55 do not believe the Holocaust will ever be repeated, Ben Friedman 
said, compared to 44% who do. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing instances of anti-Semitism in the United States and Europe show 
that an event similar to the Holocaust could occur again, he said, adding that 
it is the responsibility of Christians and Jews to see that it doesn't.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee, whose members agreed to preach at least one sermon a year on 
the Holocaust, is the first group "organized solely to be concerned for the 
Jews in Europe," Friedman said. At a news conference in Hollywood, the Rev. 
Ignacio Castuera said the poll reflects a growing apathy in the United States 
about the persecution of Jews, especially European Jews. Holocaust survivor Ebi 
Gabor said many things she sees today remind her of what she saw 50 years ago 
in Hungary as the anti-Semitic tenets of the Third Reich took root. She said 
the desecration of graves last week at a Los Angeles Jewish cemetery reminded 
her of events that led up to the Holocaust.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BLOOD 
SUPPLY CRITICALLY INADEQUATE, RED CROSS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blood donations throughout the Los Angeles area have been extremely low during 
the holiday season, leaving supplies critically inadequate, an American Red 
Cross spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People haven't signed up to give blood over the holidays," said Manuel Rivas 
of the Los Angeles chapter of the Red Cross."A lot of people have illnesses, 
colds and flu, and so didn't give blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, only about 160,000 of the area's about 13 million residents give 
blood each year to the Red Cross, which supplies blood to all local hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to increase the number of people who donate blood," Rivas said. 
"The Southern California area has not been self-sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate the shortage, Rives said the Red Cross likes to have on hand 
1,189 units of O positive blood, the most common type. Currently, only 289 
units, or 24% of the desired amount, are in stock, he said.

MURDER CASE DEFENDANT FREED AFTER HUNG JURIES; COURTS: MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR 
WAS TRIED TWICE IN A CO-WORKER'S DEATH. 'HE'S PROBABLY GUILTY,' THE JUDGE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A martial arts instructor tried twice for allegedly killing a female co-worker 
was set free Tuesday by a judge who said the man is "probably guilty" but 
expressed doubt that a verdict could ever be reached in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Both trials of Stuart Edward Milburn, who has been in custody without bail 
since his arrest in March, ended in hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles Horan, who presided over the trials, 
granted a defense motion requesting that a third trial not be held on the 
current evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inescapable fact is we could try the case five times and we would have 
five hung juries unless something new happens," Horan said in making his 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said that the evidence presented during the trials strongly 
implicates Milburn in the slaying of a Canyon Country woman who was a rising 
star in the martial arts world, but that it is not enough to eliminate all 
reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably guilty," the judge commented from the bench. "I'm not going to 
try to comfort him or his family by suggesting otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution claimed that Milburn, 27, killed Veronica Estrada, 29, because 
he was jealous of her professional achievements, including being named 
instructor of the year instead of him at the martial arts studio where they 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecution's efforts were hampered by eyewitnesses who gave uncertain 
identifications of Milburn at the murder scene and by tests showing that none 
of the blood found there matched the defendant's. In addition, a defense 
witness testified that she saw Milburn at the studio at the time of the murder, 
which was committed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn's attorney, Darryl Mounger, declined to make his client available for 
interviews after the ruling. The defendant's father, Stuart H. Milburn, 
appeared angry with the judge's comments but relieved that his son was set 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree entirely with the judge," the elder Milburn said. "I'm just 
disappointed it's taken so long for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn was accused of murdering Estrada last December as she walked along a 
dark road toward her home. Jurors voted 8-4 to convict Milburn during his first 
trial, which ended in September. His second trial ended Dec. 7 with jurors 
voting 7-5 for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against him remains open and he could still be retried. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn showed no emotion during the ruling. Estrada's family and friends also 
listened silently, but many were in tears afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was my friend and I think he did it and in my heart I hate him for it," 
said Renee Flapper, who was also a friend of Milburn. "I don't know what to 
think. I wasn't expecting this." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz, said he was not surprised at 
the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the court, with what they had to deal with, acted very appropriately," 
Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's statement about the guilt of the accused was highly unusual for a 
criminal trial, said Robert Pugsley, a professor of criminal law at 
Southwestern University Law School in Los Angeles. Pugsley said that the judge 
may have been venting "humanly understandable frustrations" about the case, but 
that the comments could prejudice further proceedings against Milburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, it's putting the D.A. on notice in a very public way that if he 
doesn't come up with more . . . he should not bring (the case) against 
(Milburn) next time," Pugsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were a third trial, Pugsley added, Horan almost certainly would not 
be able to preside over it because of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 On "every evidentiary ruling where he ruled favorable to the prosecution, the 
defense would make an objection of bias," Pugsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor in the 
second-degree black-belt division. She was strangled about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 15, 
1993, and her partially clothed body was found the next morning in bushes along 
Soledad Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Foltz said he is not giving up yet, however. "There's someone out 
there who knows something," he said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in the first trial said that at one point they voted 10-2 to convict 
Milburn, but eventually deadlocked 8-4 for conviction after four weeks of 
deliberation because of the uncertain evidence against him. The second trial 
ended in a mistrial after five days of deliberation, with jurors declining to 
comment on the reasons for their deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Horan said the defense made a mistake by putting Milburn on the stand during 
the first trial. Milburn came off as "arrogant," the judge said, and unable to 
answer key prosecution questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury didn't like him very much," Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's family has criticized the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's 
handling of the case, stating that delays were caused when the original 
detectives were replaced several days after the murder. In addition, some of 
Estrada's clothing from the murder scene was destroyed by the coroner's office 
on orders mistakenly given by a sheriff's lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was one of the biggest mistakes ever made by the Sheriff's 
Department," said Estrada's father, Robert, after Tuesday's court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foltz said he doesn't know if the destroyed clothing would have had a 
significant impact on the case because a coroner's official testified that 
there was no blood or other incriminating evidence on the items. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's sister, Theresa, said she would never be at peace if her sister's 
murder remained unsolved. But she was not hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they going to come up with that they haven't already?" she asked.

PRIVATE JET DELAYED AS WHEEL PIERCES TAXIWAY IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That old sinking feeling returned to Van Nuys Airport on Tuesday morning when 
the pilot of a Boeing 727 jet owned by the manufacturer of Guess clothes 
apparently missed a turn and steered the craft onto a patch of non-reinforced 
asphalt, stranding the craft for nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a similar jet chartered by University of Wisconsin football fans 
-- already angry over a Rose Bowl ticket snafu -- sank through thin asphalt on 
the same taxiway.Charter officials blamed poor directions from the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials this time blamed the pilot of the 727. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently he missed his turn and tried to turn around," airport spokeswoman 
Stacy Geere said. "It entered into an area that was not stressed for that kind 
of aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
 The jet was mired for more than two hours after the 9:37 a.m. incident, but 
did not disrupt air traffic, Geere said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport workers chipped away sections of asphalt around the wheel that 
punctured the asphalt, and wedged a metal plank under the tires so a tow truck 
could pull it out, Geere said. By afternoon, the plane was aloft and en route 
to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 In the January incident, the owner of the jet blamed the Federal Aviation 
Administration controllers for directing the plane onto a weak segment of 
taxiway in preparation for takeoff. Controllers hoped to avoid such an incident 
Tuesday by guiding the craft from the east taxiway to one better equipped for 
heavy aircraft, according to Geere. The pilot, however, missed the taxiway 
entrance, and then got stuck trying to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Guess and the Van Nuys company that handles the aircraft would 
not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a non-event and the plane now is en route to Miami," said a company 
spokeswoman in New York.

POLICE INVESTIGATING CAUSE OF CAR CRASH THAT INJURED 9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police Tuesday were investigating whether the drivers of two 
vehicles involved in an accident at a Van Nuys intersection were under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol when their cars collided, injuring nine people. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood tests scheduled to be completed next week will determine whether Jose 
Fernandez, 31, and Richard Condap, 41, both of Van Nuys, were intoxicated at 
the time of the Monday night crash, Detective Rick Talkington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was the driver of a Chevy Blazer carrying six passengers, four of 
them children, when it collided with a station wagon driven by Condap, who was 
traveling with passenger Donna Truex, Talkington said. The crash occurred about 
7:45 p.m. Monday at Sherman Way and Louise Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody ran a red light. We just don't know who," Talkington said. "We have 
no witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 All nine people inside the vehicles were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was listed in good condition and Susalia Navarro, 29, of Van Nuys, 
was listed in serious condition Tuesday. Three children who also were 
passengers in the Blazer were listed in critical condition and a fourth was 
listed in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe Navarro is the mother of the four children. The 
condition of a seventh passenger, Armando Sierra, 24, of Van Nuys, could not be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Condap was listed in good condition Tuesday, and Truex, a 
32-year-old Fresno woman, was listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared that only one passenger riding inside the Chevy Blazer was wearing 
a seat belt, Talkington said. He speculated that the other passengers might 
have suffered fewer injuries had they been wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents said the intersection has been the site of many collisions 
and that police have stepped up enforcement efforts to catch speeding 
motorists.

MONEY RAISED FOR SLAIN OFFICER'S FAMILY STOLEN FROM CAR; CRIME: ABOUT $6,500 
FROM A DINNER-DANCE IS TAKEN DURING A BRIEF STOP AT A COUNTY PARKING GARAGE 
DOWNTOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A car thief made off with about $6,500 that had just been donated to the 
family of slain Los Angeles County Safety Police Officer Thomas B. Worley, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, raised at a dinner-dance on Friday, was in a briefcase belonging to 
Clifton Williams, president of the 400-member Safety Police Assn., who had 
stopped at the Downtown county Hall of Administration on Saturday to run an 
errand. Although the building was closed, authorized personnel were permitted 
to park there. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later, Williams came back to his car in the lot under the 
building to find a window shattered and the briefcase gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of sets us back, and it hurts," Williams said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, 33, was shot Dec. 21 in a gunfight in the crowded parking lot of a 
Canoga Park strip mall after confronting Jesus Valenzuela, 44, who witnesses 
said had just held up a discount shoe store in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 After Worley identified himself as a police officer, investigators said, 
Valenzuela shot at him. Worley returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, who was off-duty and not wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the 
chest and groin and died about 90 minutes later. Valenzuela, an ex-convict with 
three prior robbery convictions, was hit in the liver and died within an hour 
from internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family held the dinner-dance to raise funds for Worley's wife, 
Pam, 29, and two children, Christina, 6, and Matthew, 2, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event netted $3,600 in savings bonds, about $2,000 in checks and at least 
$900 cash, Williams said. The cash estimate, he said, was low because "a lot of 
those envelopes hadn't even been opened yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers have no leads in the theft, LAPD Detective Connie Gordon said. Police 
know only that the thief -- or thieves -- used the porcelain chip from a spark 
plug to shatter the window because the chip was found inside the car, Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spark plug chip is an increasingly popular tool for car thieves because it 
will fracture a window but make little noise and often not even disturb a car 
alarm, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Services for Worley will be held Thursday morning at First United Methodist 
Church of Santa Monica. Burial will follow at Oakwood Memorial Park in 
Chatsworth.

UTES SHUT DOWN PETERSON, CAL STATE FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT KINAHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it wasn't already, the word is definitely out on how to defend against Cal 
State Fullerton center Winston Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's strategy of double teaming the Titans' leading scorer worked perfectly 
as the Utes cruised to an 84-63 nonconference victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three games, the 6-foot-6 center has not scored more than 17 
points after getting at least 23 points in four contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every time he touched the ball Tuesday, Utah had at least two 6-foot-9 
players around him. The result was ugly: five points on one of seven shooting. 
He entered the game averaging 20.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job on Peterson," said Coach Bob Hawking, whose team dropped 
to 3-5. "If you stop the leading scorer, it's kind of a good way to plan your 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's strategy was simple: don't let Peterson go to the baseline, and then 
double team him once he has the ball. "He was going to go baseline all the 
time," Utah starting center Ben Melmeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 With his game neutralized, Peterson began forcing the issue in the second 
half, but he missed all five field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was frustrated," Hawking said. "We'll try to make some adjustments. We'll 
have some things to work on offensively to free him up." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough night all around for Peterson, whose five rebounds were half 
his season's average. Giving away several inches across the front line, the 
Titans were clobbered on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 To compound the problem, Utah (8-2) shot 54% from the field. The Titans shot 
36% (20 of 55). 
</P>
<P>
 "They outrebounded us, 42-26. I thought that was the key," Hawking said. "They 
physically dominated us on the boards, which upped their field goal percentage 
because they had a bunch of second efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Van Horn of Diamond Bar and Brandon Jessie of Huntington Beach did the 
most damage for Utah. They combined for 43 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horn and Jessie scored 14 of Utah's last 17 points in the first half to 
help the Utes take a 50-32 halftime lead. Van Horn displayed it all during the 
spree, scoring on three-point shot, two dunks and two free throws. Jessie added 
a dunk and a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both outstanding players," Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horn, the Western Athletic Conference's top freshman last season, has led 
Utah in scoring in seven of its 10 games. He averages 20.1 points and 7.8 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an outstanding all-around player," said Hawking, who saw him play 
several times in high school. "He's going to treat Utah fans to a lot of good 
basketball before his career is over, and he already has." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, a community college transfer from Ventura, has led the Utes in scoring 
in their other three games. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a homecoming of sorts for Fullerton swingman Chuck Overton. The 
junior from Tucson starred at nearby Salt Lake Community College. He scored 
nine points in 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton was interested in playing for Utah out of junior college, but Coach 
Rick Majerus didn't want him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My staff wanted me to take Overton," Majerus said. "I didn't like Overton. I 
like him as a kid, but I didn't like him for what we needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Titans, Utah didn't need much. After scoring the game's first 
eight points, the Utes led by as many as 27 points in the second half. The Utes 
have beaten Fullerton two consecutive seasons, including 76-73 last year in 
Titan Gym.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: DADE QUICKLY MAKING UP FOR HIS LOST 
BASKETBALL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Dade's basketball career at Cal State Fullerton was on hold for a year, 
but now that it's finally off the launching pad, Dade is enjoying every minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating not being able to play last season," Dade said. "My dream 
was to play Division I basketball, and when I had to sit out last year, it 
really bothered me. My grades went down and I had to go to summer school to get 
them back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery for a recurring wrist injury kept Dade on the sideline. He hurt the 
wrist again at the start of fall practice and spent the next six months with a 
cast from his wrist to his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found out there were some bones shattered in my wrist, and they took 
some bone out of my hip and put it in my wrist," Dade said. "What made it bad 
was that I couldn't even run to try to stay in shape. I couldn't work out at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Dade said he spent the summer working out at home in San Diego, trying to make 
up for the lost practice time. "They had an open gym at UC San Diego during the 
summer, and I'd go there just about every day and work out," he said. "The only 
thing I did all summer was work on my school work and try to get back into 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Dade, a 6-2 guard, quickly made up for lost time. And when the Titans opened 
their season, Dade was in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 He already has established himself as one of the team's most versatile 
players. A former star at San Diego El Camino High, Dade is averaging 11 
points, second on the team behind senior center Winston Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 While his scoring has been solid, he has been equally impressive on defense, 
and is second to guard Chris St. Clair in steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "These early games have been a learning experience for me since I didn't play 
last year," Dade said. "I'm also feeling the effects of having to get up and 
down the floor quickly in a fast-paced game. And it's taken awhile for me to 
get used to playing with the other players." 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, Dade is just happy to be back playing and he's confident 
he will continue to improve. 
</P>

<P>
 The Fullerton women's basketball team continues to struggle with injuries, 
leaving it with nine healthy players for Thursday's game at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Autumn Hollyfield, the team's top outside shooting threat, is at least two 
weeks away from returning to the team from arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup center Beth Taylor underwent foot surgery last Friday and is out for 
the season. Two other post players, freshmen Kari Kron and Michele Leitner, 
also are slowed by injuries. Coach Deborah Ayres doubts either will be back 
before the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real burden on us from a depth standpoint right now," Ayres said. 
"We're starting people who were coming off the bench for us earlier. We really 
need to get Autumn back. But even when we do, she'll need to go slow for a 
while to make sure she's recovered." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans continue to rely heavily on senior center Koko Lahanas. Lahanas had 
38 points and 14 rebounds in a loss to Northern Arizona, then 29 points and 11 
rebounds in a victory over Sacramento State last week.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our players are doing a good job of getting the ball in to her," Ayres said, 
"but she had a tremendous effort for the entire tournament. I guess we can 
expect to start seeing some zone with her scoring that well. She had four 
steals against Sac State and three against Northern Arizona in addition to 
those other numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Titan baseball star Dante Powell spent four weeks in the Arizona 
Instructional League and came away with good feelings about his future with the 
San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I'd definitely be invited to work out with the big club in 
spring training, so I'm happy about that," Powell said. "It was a good 
experience for me. They worked with just about every aspect of my game, and I 
thought it definitely was worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said the coaches worked with him on hitting to the opposite field and 
on his defense in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the Giant organization who talked with me seemed to be 
impressed," Powell said. "They all said I had a good first season." 
</P>

NOTEBOOK; ANDERSEN NOT READY TO PULL PLUG

 Don Andersen, Freedom Bowl executive director, said he was unhappy with the 
turnout for Tuesday's Freedom Bowl. But he stopped short of saying this was the 
end of the line for the 11-year-old bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 27,477 came out to Anaheim Stadium to see Utah beat Arizona, 16-13. It 
was the smallest crowd since 1984, when 24,093 came to see the inaugural game 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're in trouble individually, but I think the small bowl games 
have problems," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Freedom Bowl, one of the smallest bowls, is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 It has only $700,00 per team payoffs, the same as the Alamo Bowl. Only the Las 
Vegas Bowl, which has no guaranteed payoff, is smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis is on the national championship," Andersen said. "So everyone 
wants to be in the three or four elite bowl games." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Freedom is far from joining that group, nor does it want to, according 
to Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be a regional bowl game," Andersen said. "But we're locked 
into certain teams, so we can't be a little more selective." 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl pits the second place team from the WAC against the third-place team 
from the Pac-10. Even when the match up is good, the draw hasn't always been 
equal to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona was ranked 15th and Utah 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to one analysis we had the fifth best matchup of the 19 bowl 
games," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was poorly attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen said Utah sold more than 10,000 of the 12,500 tickets it was 
allotted. He said Arizona sold a little more than 3,000 of the 9,000 it was 
allotted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a basketball school and they hosted a tournament this weekend," Andersen 
said. "So you had 12,000 basketball season ticket holders with a chance to see 
two games and you had people disappointed that they did not make the Rose 
Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 A bad combination. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it the end for the Freedom Bowl? Andersen said no. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 College and professional football appear to be a tougher sell than high school 
football in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 The last two games at Anaheim Stadium, Saturday's Ram season finale and the 
Freedom Bowl, drew 53,182 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section semifinal and championship games, both of which featured 
Mater Dei, drew 56,359 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Beck, whose 72-yard kickoff return set up Utah's winning touchdown, 
watched last year's Freedom Bowl from the stands; he was a senior at Cottonwood 
High in Salt Lake City last December. 
</P>
<P>
 A true freshman this season, Beck averaged 25.6 yards per kickoff this season 
and his 67-yard return against Brigham Young Nov. 19 set up Mike McCoy's 
game-winning 20-yard scoring pass to Charlie Brown late in the game. Utah 
rallied for a 34-31 victory, earning a berth in the Freedom Bowl for the second 
consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I'm here now is because Coach (Ron McBride) took a chance on 
me," Beck said. "I'm just glad I could come through today." 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, who returned three kickoffs for 140 yards, was named Utah's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Dick Tomey refused to dwell on what might have been, either 
Tuesday or at any time during a season filled with so much expectation and so 
much disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I told the team," he said. "Rejoice in the fact that we had a chance to 
be together and to be around our seniors for four or five years. 
</P>

 Weekend box-office standings are relative since four-day totals are, in some 
cases, being compared with two-day figures. "Jungle Book" and "I.Q." opened on 
Christmas Day; "Little Women" went into wide release on Sunday after a limited 
opening last Wednesday.Its cumulative figure, as with "Richie Rich," reflects 
the total six-day take; "Nell" played on only two screens until this weekend. 
Sometimes the per-screen averages do not compute because the number of screens 
changed mid-run. 04,25,18,10,10 Weekend Gross/ Screens/ Weeks in Movie (Studio)

 NO SNEEZING: The county investment debacle is hitting at low levels. In 
Municipal Court in Fullerton, one set of employees was told: No more 
county-issued Kleenex to blow your nose. Plus, employees have been ordered to 
turn in their little yellow Post-it stickers -- only management gets them now. 
Also: Just two pencils per week per employee. . . . Says one employee: "What 
next? Are we going to have to start bringing our own toilet paper?" 
</P>
<P>
 RECALL-PROOF: If you're hot to recall county supervisors over the bonds 
crisis, don't look toward William G. Steiner -- at least for now. Steiner, 
named by the governor last year to fill Don Roth's term, falls through a crack 
in the state's recall law. No one can be recalled whose term ends within six 
months. . . . Steiner, who handily won in the June primary, doesn't start his 
new term until Jan. 4. . . . The same law also keeps him safe from a recall the 
first 90 days of his new term. 
</P>
<P>
 BACK TOGETHER: Stan Oftelie was once Bill Hodge's college journalism 
instructor. Later they were friendly rivals working for different county 
supervisors. . . . Now Oftelie, who heads the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, has coaxed Hodge, above, into leaving his post as executive director 
of the local League of Cities to join him at OCTA. Hodge will be external 
affairs director, in charge of state and federal legislation. . . . He agreed 
to the job before the county's bankruptcy. But now, says Hodge: "The 
significance of the job has gone up about three octaves." 
</P>
<P>
 YOU DON'T SAY: This could rank among the year's top understatements. . . In 
the January issue of Money, the magazine says of the county's municipal bonds 
problems: "The Orange County fiasco is a reminder that munis do carry some 
risk." . . . It adds this advice: "Putting all your eggs in one basket is not a 
prudent investment." Also: "Keep in mind that high credit ratings do not 
guarantee safety." The Orange County bond issues had high credit ratings.

 CHRISTMAS MONEY: The Holbrook family of Lancaster got an extra gift after 
wrapping up their Christmas Eve celebration: $21 million. . . . Dad Donald, 58, 
learned the news that he had picked all six Super Lotto numbers. The Rockwell 
engineer spent $5 on a quick-pick at Smith's Food and Drugs, earning him 
$756,000 tax-free for the next 20 years. Among the beneficiaries: Holbrook's 
wife, Ruth, and their many children. 
</P>
<P>
 TASTE TEST: For about a day's wages you can have one of 31-derful flavors . . 
. in Vietnam. Glendale-based Baskin-Robbins International Inc. has launched its 
first franchise in Ho Chi Minh City, where a scoop runs $1.60 and the average 
worker makes $50 a month. But locals are lining up for jamocha almond fudge, 
anyway. Explains company executive Grant Miller: "In Vietnam, it's always hot." 
</P>
<P>
 MORE RUBBLE: It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it . . . some more. The 
city will extend its free curbside quake-debris cleanup program through July 
17, benefiting Valley residents like Mark Eddingfield, above. Set to expire 
Jan. 17, the service prompted 105,644 calls for debris removal through 
mid-December (B3). 
</P>
<P>
 TAX BREAK: Tax help may soon be on the way. Brad Sherman, who was sworn in 
Tuesday for a second term on the State Board of Equalization, wants to move his 
district office from Santa Monica to Van Nuys. . . . Because many calls to his 
office come from the Valley, Sherman feels the move could help residents "focus 
on the property-tax aspects of the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 WITH HONORS: Sim Farar is looking for a few good Valley entertainers. 
Appointed to the Advisory Committee on the Arts of the John F. Kennedy Center 
in Washington, the Woodland Hills financier will be among those suggesting 
future honorees. . . . "We're trying to recognize more people from the San 
Fernando Valley," he said. Past Valley honoree: Bob Hope. Jeff Schnaufer

 Drug gangs with automatic weapons repelled 300 soldiers trying to take control 
of a hillside slum in the first armed resistance to the military's anti-crime 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops were summoned to stop a gunfight between rival gangs Monday in the 
Cruzeiro Hill shantytown on Rio's north side, the Jornal do Brasil reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers blockaded entrances to the slum and were climbing up its twisting 
alleyways when traffickers atop the hill fired on them with automatic rifles. 
Soldiers returned fire but were pinned down by gunfire for nearly half an hour 
before withdrawing, residents said.

ROBERT LOWRY; NOVELIST FOCUSED ON WWII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Lowry, 75, a post-World War II author whom Ernest Hemingway once called 
"one of America's best" but whose frail health forced interruptions in a 
sporadic writing career. His battlefield experiences during the war formed the 
basis for many of his novels and short stories, as did his life as an artist in 
Greenwich Village.His best-known works included "Casualty" in 1946, "Find Me in 
Fire" and "The Big Cage" in 1949, "The Violent Wedding," in 1953 and three 
collections of short stories. "That Kind of Woman," a 1959 film starring Sophia 
Loren and Tab Hunter, was based on one of his stories. In 1950 he won the O. 
Henry Award for "Be Nice to Mr. Campbell." In Cincinnati on Dec. 5 of the 
complications of pneumonia.

CYRIL A. PONNAMPERUMA; STUDIED CHEMICAL BASIS OF LIFE

<TEXT>

 Cyril A. Ponnamperuma, 71, an India-born chemist widely known for research 
that he said showed life could be created from chemical sources.Ponnamperuma, 
who for many years was director of the Laboratory of Chemical Evolution at the 
University of Maryland, maintained that the basic building blocks of life could 
be created outside a living cell, although he refused to predict how soon that 
might happen. In 1984 he reported that his laboratory had produced the five 
components necessary for life -- adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine and 
uracil, from which nucleic acids are formed. His laboratory also created the 
energy-transporting molecule adenosine triphosphate, another necessary 
component of life. In Washington on Dec. 20 after a heart attack.

ROSS ECKERT; WROTE ABOUT RISK OF AIDS IN TRANSFUSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross Doud Eckert, an educator and one of the earliest to raise his voice about 
the risks of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions, died Friday at a 
Pomona hospital of the complications of AIDS. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert, a Claremont McKenna College professor, received transfusions his 
entire life to treat hemophilia, and his interest in the safety of the blood 
supply began long before he was found to be HIV-positive as a result of 
receiving tainted blood, said friend and colleague Rodney T. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always had the suspicion (he could contract AIDS)," said Smith, also a 
Claremont McKenna economics professor. "As he studied the material, as he 
looked at the facts and the risks, he just got convinced of the inevitability." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, early in the AIDS crisis, Eckert spoke of those suspicions in an 
editorial piece in The Times, leading his piece with this warning: "Evidence is 
growing that acquired immune deficiency syndrome may pose a serious threat to 
our blood supply." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote that blood banks were reluctant to subject donor samples to the 
then-new T-cell test and urged banks "to be more selective in who we let donate 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert also wrote of potential dangers in blood in his 1985 book, "Securing a 
Safer Blood Supply," as well as several articles. He addressed Congress in 1990 
on the threat of hepatitis in the supply, saying that the nation is losing 
about 4,000 people a year to tainted blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in economics from UCLA 
and extensively studied the economics of the law and liability. 
</P>
<P>
 He served on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Blood Products Advisory 
Committee from 1987-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert is survived by his wife, Enid, and his mother, Lillian Noblett of Long 
Beach. A memorial service will be held Jan. 15 at Claremont McKenna College.

PIERRE DREYFUS; FORMER HEAD OF RENAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierre Dreyfus, 87, a former civil servant who built state-owned Renault into 
one of Europe's leading auto makers. Dreyfus, who retired as Renault's 
president in 1975, also served as minister of industry for a year in 1981 under 
President Francois Mitterrand, and was later an adviser to the 
president.Dreyfus trained as a lawyer and held a number of civil service 
positions before becoming head of a state-owned coal mine in eastern France in 
1947. He moved to Renault in 1955. Over the next 20 years, he expanded its 
output of 175,000 cars a year to 1.3 million, turning it into France's main 
industrial exporter. Dreyfus made Renault a model state company, improving 
working conditions and wages. He advocated working with unions whenever 
possible and earned Renault a reputation for enlightened labor practices. As

A. PHILIP CORVO; LED GROUP OF TV EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A. Philip Corvo, president of the National Assn. of Television Program 
Executives during a period in the 1980s when it experienced soaring growth, has 
died in Los Angeles after a long illness. He was 67 and most recently had been 
the group's executive vice president, resigning as president last year because 
of respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Saturday, said a spokeswoman for the organization of TV executives 
around the world that provides a marketplace for 12,000 buyers. The group is 
primarily involved with syndicated shows that are shown on hundreds of 
independent stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization was formed on the East Coast but under Corvo moved to 
Southern California; he had decreed "that if we're going to service the 
membership of this organization, we're going to have to be next to the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Corvo the group took on more of an international flavor and began 
servicing cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Although station executives in the membership are scattered through the more 
than 200 local TV markets in the United States, nearly all the largest 
syndicators are headquartered in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's annual program conference, where station executives talk business 
with Hollywood's leading figures, is the association's primary mechanism for 
exchanging information about TV products, but on-line service has evolved into 
an increasing part of the operation, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for Corvo has been scheduled Thursday at 7 p.m. at St. 
Monica's Church in Santa Monica. He is survived by his wife, Doris, nine 
children, four grandchildren, a brother and a sister.

 Mild weather, the fifth warmest in a century in November and continuing into 
December, is proving a boon for golfers, roller-bladers and hikers.And 
operators of ski resorts outfitted with snow-making machines say their trails 
are probably as full as ever. Santa Claus brought fewer ice skates and sleds, 
but more roller-blades and bicycles. November's temperatures in the region 
averaged 3.6 degrees above normal, officials reported.

A CELEBRATION OF PRIDE AND ROOTS; AS AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY GATHERSTO 
OBSERVE KWANZAA,IT'S A TIME TO LOOKAHEAD -- AND TO REFLECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pam Coffey hasn't been able to keep kinara sets, used by African Americans who 
celebrate the holiday of Kwanzaa, on the shelves this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa is a seven-day observance, rooted in African tradition, at year's end 
when families reflect on the past year and focus on nguzo saba , seven 
principles that will help them lead prosperous lives in the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Coffey had 40 kinara sets in her Images shop. Tuesday, she had 
"one on display and not even a whole set behind the counter," she said. "You 
get a few families celebrating, and they'll tell someone and they'll tell 
someone else. Last year, I ordered 15 and couldn't sell all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa, which means "first fruits" in Swahili, is celebrated in homes and 
community centers from Dec. 26 through Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kwanzaa is also a deep respect for our ancestors," said Willia Edmonds, the 
organizer of a celebration from 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday at the Bowers Museum of 
Cultural Art in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ancestors were the models of ethical life, service and social achievement 
to the community," Edmonds said. "For us to honor our ancestors is for us to 
honor our roots and lineage." 
</P>
<P>
 A candle-lighting ceremony is a large part of the festivities. Kinara sets 
include a candleholder, seven candles, a unity cup, a flag, a mat and a booklet 
on Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
 The candleholder is the set's centerpiece, symbolizing African ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 The candles -- one black, three red and three green -- represent the 
principles of umoja (unity), kujichagulia (self-determination), ujima 
(collective work and responsibility), ujama (cooperative economics), nia 
(purpose), kuumba (creativity) and imani (faith). 
</P>
<P>
 Each day of Kwanzaa, a different candle is lit, starting with the black, and 
alternating from red to green. Black symbolizes the people, red, the continuing 
struggle, and green, the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The cup symbolizes unity and is passed around to each celebrant to drink from. 
</P>
<P>
 The flag was created for people of African descent by Pan-African leader 
Marcus Garvey. The red bar stands for the struggle for freedom, the black for 
unity and the green for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikeka , the name for the mat that the kinara rests on, represents the 
foundations that community and family are built on. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa was created in 1966 by Maulana (Ron) Karenga, the black studies chair 
at Cal State Long Beach. It is a non-religious holiday in which traditional 
African clothing is typically worn to gatherings during the week. African 
music, dance and food are also plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Though too late to order more ceremonial sets, Coffey urges people who want 
them for next year to start looking for them early in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just starting to learn more about it," said Renee Mitchell, 36, who 
bought a set from Images in 1993. "I think the unity of the black family, the 
pride and the structure it teaches helps us identify who we are as black 
people."

BIKE HELMET LAW DEEMED A SUCCESSIN ITS 1ST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HSU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lia Rousset, 17, was bicycling to school last month when she hit "some kind of 
little pole" and was knocked unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 "That day, I was thinking, 'I don't want to wear my helmet,' " recalled the 
Newport Harbor High School junior. "I had a ski hat on, and the helmet was 
getting in the way, but I decided to wear it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 She's glad she did. As she convincingly found out, a helmet "could make or 
break your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Lia's escape from serious head injury is just what doctors, law enforcement 
officials and state legislators say the state's bicycle helmet law was designed 
to do. Now, at the end of the law's first year, physicians say they're seeing 
more youths who wear helmets and sustain fewer head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicycle helmet law, which took effect last January, prohibits a person 
younger than 18 from operating a bicycle, or riding as a passenger, on public 
streets, bikeways and trails without the protective device. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sunday, violators could face a maximum $25 fine that parents or 
guardians would be liable for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a substantial increase in the number of children admitted for 
bicycle-related injuries who were wearing a helmet," said Dr. Gary Goodman, 
co-director of pediatric intensive care at Children's Hospital at Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. "We would like to think it's 
due to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Records at Children's Hospital show in 1993, one out of 19 children admitted 
for bicycle injuries wore helmets. From January to September this year, five 
out of 14 children admitted for bicycle injuries wore helmets; seven did not, 
and it was unclear in two cases.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's certainly been a significant increase in awareness," Goodman 
said. "From our own anecdotal evidence, the vast majority of kids who get 
admitted to the hospital not wearing helmets have sustained more serious 
injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol reports that more children wore helmets this 
year than last and that the number of deaths and injuries has declined. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, from January, 1993, to July, 1993, all nine local youths 
killed in bicycle accidents were not wearing helmets. Out of 772 injured, only 
74 were wearing helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 From January to July this year, five children were killed and only one was 
wearing a helmet. Of 722 injured, 114 were wearing helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hesitate to make a connection between the decrease in deaths and 
injuries to increased use of helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether or not those are normal fluctuations or whether they're due to usage 
is really tough" to determine, said Steve Kohler, CHP spokesman in Sacramento. 
"We need to have a couple more years to see if there's any correlation." 
</P>
<P>
 However, doctors say they have seen children who wore helmets come into 
emergency rooms with less serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the kids who we're seeing with bike injuries are helmeted," said Dr. 
Patrick Romano, a pediatrician at UC Davis Medical Center, where many children 
are treated for bicycle injuries. "They're still coming in with extremity 
injuries, but they're not as bad as they would be without a helmet." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Children's Advocacy Institute, a helmet can reduce severe 
head injury by 85%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been well documented that a helmet is protective," said Dr. Phyllis 
Agran, a UC Irvine pediatrics professor. "Once a serious head injury occurs, a 
person may not recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say much of the increase in helmet usage can be attributed to a 
massive push by schools to educate students about the importance of bicycle 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with local law enforcement agencies, Children's Hospital of 
Orange County presents "Sprocket Woman," a 20-minute program free to all Orange 
County schoolchildren in kindergarten through second grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprocket Woman, played by Julie Wagener, the hospital's childhood injury 
prevention program manager, dresses in a black and white spandex bike shirt, 
shorts and cape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing over 11,000 children a month, teaching the little ones to follow 
the rules of the road, put helmets on properly and ride on the right side of 
the road," Wagener said. "The kids all put their hands on their pretend 
handlebars and they look right, left, right." 
</P>
<P>
 Another 45-minute program targets third- to sixth-grade students. It is more 
detailed and focuses on night riding, the danger of having friends ride on 
handlebars and helmet safety standards, Wagener said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmet costs have also dropped in 1994, said Steve Barrow, legislative 
director for the Children's Advocacy Institute, but parents unable to afford 
$30 to $100 helmets can get them for much less. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, school principals identify children who may not be able to 
afford helmets and give them purchase orders filled by Children's Hospital of 
Orange County. So far, more than 3,000 helmets have been distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Moves, based in Marina del Rey, is the largest educational bicycle safety 
program in the country. The group sells helmets for as low as $10, said 
director Pat Hines. They also have the only helmet with a blinking red light on 
the back that can be seen 800 to 1,000 feet away, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's campaign to save lives will take a different approach in 1995, 
when there will be added penalties for failing to wear a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police will be able to issue fines, it'll be up to an officer's 
discretion to dole out a suitable punishment. Officers can either keep giving 
verbal warnings or issue more severe punishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Citations where the child must appear in Juvenile Court with parents and a 
maximum fine of $25 can also be levied, said John De Haan of the La Palma 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the law is in effect, we know there are times when the child 
cannot afford a helmet or is not aware of the law," De Haan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first violation will result in a verbal warning; the second offense -- a 
written warning in the form of a Juvenile Referral Notice -- may require the 
child to attend bicycle safety classes with his or her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 A third offense, a citation, will require the child to appear in Juvenile 
Court with his or her parents and a maximum fine of $25 will be levied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a substantial increase in children wearing helmets, but there 
are still enough out there that do not," Newport Beach police Sgt. Andy Gonis. 
"If a situation warrants a citation, we'll issue one. A follow-up letter will 
also be sent to the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents whose children bike to school are aware of the law, since 
individual schools in Newport Beach, Fullerton, La Habra and South County have 
imposed their own helmet rules. But some parents don't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Rousset, Lia's mother, is "happy that she wore her helmet, but I feel 
like it's up to the person to decide whether or not they're going to wear it." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 In the five-year period between 1989 and 1993, 92% of the deaths and 93% of 
the injuries suffered by bicyclists in Orange County were to those not wearing 
helmets. During the first seven months of this year, there have been five 
fatalities; there were nine in the comparable period last year.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Helmet Tips 
</P>
<P>
 California law requires any bicyclist younger than 18 to wear a helmet. How to 
find the right one:  
</P>
<P>
 * Fit: Place helmet squarely on head so front sits right above eyebrows. It 
should be snug, not tight. It should never be worn too loose or tipped back on 
the head.  
</P>
<P>
 * Straps: Prior to each ride, helmet straps should be checked to ensure proper 
fit. Side plastic piece should fit just under ears on both sides, with one 
strap in front of ear and one behind. Buckle should be positioned right under 
chin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Final check: Helmet should not move more than half an inch in any direction. 
With the helmet on and tightly fastened, attempt to remove it by rolling 
backward and forward. 
</P>
<P>
 * Care: Do not use solvents or paints on a helmet because they contain 
chemicals that could cause damage. Use only mild soap and water to clean. 
</P>
<P>
 * Standard: Helmets must meet the Snell Memorial Foundation B-90 (SNELL) or 
American National Standard Institute (ANSI Z90.4) performance standards for 
bicycle use. The standards will be identified by a sticker on the inside of the 
helmet.

DANA PARSONS: FOUNDERING COUNTY NEEDS THE HUFFINGTONS AT THE HELM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a dreariness hanging over the Orange County landscape these days. 
Don't be fooled by those who say things aren't so bad. The Good Ship Lollipop 
that used to be Orange County is taking on water. The Ducks are in hiding, the 
Rams are leaving, the Angels may show up in drag and, by the way, the county is 
bankrupt. County employees fear for their jobs, and city and school officials 
are hearing footsteps. As a starting five, only the Clippers had a worse 
December than the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, the public is torn between confusion and anger, wondering if 
anyone in charge knows what they're doing. In fact, who is in charge? 
Discovering that it isn't very good at supervising, the board seems to abdicate 
more authority every week (thank heaven for small favors), but that has left a 
void. To whom does the average citizen turn for hope? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County needs a First Family. We need a Mommy and a Daddy who remind us 
of what we're all about. Someone of whom, when we look in the mirror, we can 
say, "Yeah, that's me." 
</P>
<P>
 America had Roosevelt in the '40s; England had Thatcher in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County in the '90s needs . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Huffingtons! 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, those Huffingtons -- Mike and Arianna. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, they live up in Santa Barbara, but they're like fish out of water up 
there. Orange County is where they belong. Besides, Santa Barbara County can 
lay partial claim to the Reagans; how many First Families does it need? If the 
Huffingtons stay there, they'll always be in the Reagans' shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Down here, they've got the field all to themselves. Not to be indelicate about 
it, but Orange County has been much more hospitable to the Huffingtons than 
Santa Barbara County. In his U.S. Senate race against Dianne Feinstein, 
Huffington got 45% of the vote statewide but only 43% in his own county. 
Forty-three percent? Good grief, has the man no sense of pride? That's like 
having the neighbors come over and TP your house, for Pete's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, on the other hand, gave him 59% of its vote. That's right, 
Bunky, 14 percentage points higher than the rest of California and 16 points 
above his home county. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, you tell me, who deserves Mike Huffington more than Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 He is Orange County. Who better to speak for us than a man who denounced 
illegal immigration as a drain on society, only to reveal that he entrusted his 
children to an illegal immigrant for five years? This from a man whose father 
was one of the richest men in the country and whose own net worth was put in 
the $70-million range. Yes, he could have afforded day care, but you don't stay 
rich paying the going rate. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about his never-say-die attitude? Nothing could be more valuable now 
in this troubled county. After all, this is a man who, when $5 million wasn't 
enough for his Senate race, upped it to $10 million, then $20 million, then $25 
million. That's real spunk. And let's not forget that he hasn't even conceded 
defeat yet to Feinstein, contending that voter fraud cost him the election. 
There's no quit in the man! 
</P>
<P>
 And given the local citizenry's disenchantment at the moment with the 
supervisors, who better to speak for us than the non-politician? In his only 
term in Congress, Huffington sponsored three bills and spoke for a total of 
eight minutes on the House floor. Can government get any leaner and meaner than 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 But remember, we're talking First Family. The Huffingtons are a package deal. 
Mike without Arianna is nothing, but maybe you already read about that during 
the campaign. No, what I mean is she's got First Family appeal all by herself. 
By all accounts a charmer, Arianna is just airy enough with her "Is she a New 
Ager or isn't she?" mystique to appeal to our sense of novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 But what we really like about them, and what would make them Orange County's 
ideal First Family, is their money. Not just their money, but Huffington's 
professed belief that voluntarism is the answer to society's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what those Huffington millions could do in Orange County, especially 
now. And since it plays directly into his personal philosophy, everybody comes 
out a winner. What better place to display his voluntaristic bent than a 
bankrupt county? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm surprised that Arianna hasn't seen the karma in all this. Seldom have a 
couple and a county been better suited. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while opponents carp at Huffington as being nothing but a lucky rich kid 
guided only by unbridled ambition and the ability to spout homilies, all I can 
say is . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Arianna, come on down!

 In the suit filed in Superior Court here, Chandis Securities Co. and M.H. 
Sherman Co., owners of the 115-acre property near Dana Point Harbor, contend 
that Measures C and D passed by voters in November are "invalid because they 
are arbitrary and discriminatory, and are in excess of the police power of the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 The measures halted a development plan that had been approved by the City 
Council in April. The plan would have allowed a 400-room hotel and at least 370 
homes at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also asks for at least $3 million in damages from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels, president of the Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Company, 
said Tuesday that the suit was filed reluctantly to protect the owners' 
"constitutional rights" to use their property. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something we are excited about doing," Daniels said. "But we have 
been pushed into a corner and this is our only alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Toni Gallagher, a vocal opponent of the plan, said the 
landowner should have come back to the city with a smaller plan, rather than a 
lawsuit. "The developer is trying to get its way at the expense of the 
townspeople by circumventing our democratic process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 'Here we go again," said Geoffrey Lachner, a local attorney and member of Save 
The Headlands, a nonprofit group that launched the referendum. "There is 
absolutely no basis for this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The companies have owned the property since the 1940s and have proposed 
various development plans through the years. More than $2.6 million has been 
spent since 1991 on the most recent plan, according to the suit. Chandis 
Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family, 
is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, talk of developing the environmentally sensitive property, home to 
such endangered species as the California gnatcatcher and the Pacific pocket 
mouse, has sparked furious debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the City Council approved the plan, opponents organized the 
petition campaign that placed Measures C and D on the November ballot. Plan 
opponents argued that the development was too large and that more open space 
needed to be set aside, and voters seemed to agree, rejecting the plan by a 10% 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the plan argued that the development would bring much-needed 
revenue to the tourist-oriented city, which gathers about a third of its annual 
$11 million in revenues in taxes from hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said the companies had worked hard to cooperate with the city and had 
compromised whenever asked by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through a process that involved many years and lots of money," he 
said. "Now it is our contention that we have been discriminated against by not 
allowing a development to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the lawsuit in a private session during a special 
meeting Jan. 3.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: REVISITING THE NOTABLE VALLEY EVENTS OF 1994.; A YEAR OF 
BOMBSHELLS, FIRSTS IN VALLEY POLITICS; REVIEW: ROBERTI AND NOLAN STEPPED DOWN 
FROM POWER, LATINO STUDENTS TOOK TO THE STREETS, AND YAROSLAVSKY GOT A 
PROMOTION. 
</P>

 Van Nuys Democrat David Roberti and Glendale Republican Pat Nolan began 1994 
as members of the state's political elite. Now, Roberti is holding down a job 
as an appointee to an obscure state panel and Nolan is in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 1994 saw San Fernando Valley voters help elect the state 
Legislature's first openly gay member to a local Assembly seat, give Zev 
Yaroslavsky a long-delayed political promotion and defy the GOP juggernaut to 
hand Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) a 10th term in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The year also witnessed a political awakening among Latino students, many of 
whom took to the streets prior to the November statewide election to protest 
Proposition 187, the measure to bar illegal immigrants from benefiting from a 
wide range of government services. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, 1994 was a big year for politics in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The year began with a bombshell when it was revealed that a ragtag band of 
dissidents had gathered enough signatures to force Roberti, then president pro 
tempore of the state Senate and one of the state's most powerful elected 
officials, into a history-making recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in decades that a recall challenge against a California 
state legislator had qualified for the ballot. This political feat was fueled 
largely by money and volunteers from gun-rights groups incensed by Roberti's 
support for gun control laws, including a 1989 ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of gun-control advocates nationwide, including the family of 
James Brady, the former White House press secretary badly injured in the 1981 
assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan, Roberti eventually defeated his 
recall challengers -- who even raffled off a collection of guns to finance 
their campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the victory was costly. The exhausting April recall election has been 
largely blamed for Roberti's defeat in June for the Democratic nomination for 
state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although term limits prevented Roberti from seeking reelection to his 20th 
District seat, the Sacramento old-boy network came to the veteran legislator's 
aid. On Dec. 7 -- two days after he left office -- Roberti's former Senate 
colleagues announced they had appointed him to four-year post on the state 
Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board at a salary of $97,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen Ninety-Four was also a topsy-turvy year for Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Nolan, the former GOP minority leader in the Assembly, stunned 
his supporters by pleading guilty to one count of political corruption and 
resigning. Within days, Nolan was sent packing to state prison to serve a 
33-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The political passing of Roberti and Nolan triggered succession fights. The 
winners here were veteran state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, 76, who dropped his 
retirement plans to run for -- and easily win -- Roberti's seat, and former 
Municipal Judge James E. Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, a former Democrat who by 1994 had become a right-wing Republican 
supportive of school prayer and teaching creationism in public schools, was 
elected twice to Nolan's seat in 1994 -- first in a May special election to 
fill out the remainder of Nolan's term and then again in November, when he won 
a regular two-year term in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan's twin victories embarrassed Democrats, who had entertained hopes that 
1994 would be their year to crack the GOP's grip on the 43rd Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on the other side of the Valley, it was the Republican Party that 
was getting its comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen Ninety-Four was the year the GOP expected to oust incumbent Beilenson 
from his 24th Congressional District seat that included the western San 
Fernando Valley, Malibu and the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Wilson Administration aide Rich Sybert, the GOP hopeful in the race, 
appeared to have the horsepower needed to defeat Beilenson, including a large 
and heavily self-financed war chest and the support of the GOP's national 
leadership, including Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and U. S. Sen. Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson won reelection by a razor-thin margin after portraying Sybert as 
a creature of special interests, while holding himself up as an independent who 
refused to take campaign contributions from political action committees, as he 
has for years. Beilenson's victory was especially surprising because the 
Democrat was a rare survivor in national elections that saw Republicans seize 
control of both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 political season also witnessed several other highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these was the election of Sheila Kuehl, a lesbian attorney who played 
the role of Zelda in the TV sitcom "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," to the 
41st Assembly District seat, succeeding the retiring Terry Friedman. Kuehl, who 
took office this month, is the first openly homosexual member of the California 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Los Angeles City Councilman Yaroslavsky, who for years had found his 
plans for political advancement stymied, got a break when County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman retired, giving Yaroslavsky an unobstructed shot at promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's ascension to the Board of Supervisors has triggered a pell-mell 
race for his council seat, in which his wife, Barbara, could be found among the 
contestants in the April primary. Also competing in this spirited contest are 
Michael Feuer, the former head of a Jewish legal aid group, and former Los 
Angeles school board member Roberta Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
 By year's end, the Los Angeles City Council had nixed a plan -- advanced by a 
coalition of neighborhood and business groups -- to appoint an interim council 
member to fill Yaroslavsky's 5th District seat until a successor was elected. 
The defeat of this proposal means the 5th District council duties will be 
handled by an obscure City Hall bureaucrat, Avak Keotahian, who has no power to 
vote on the City Council and must make do with a skeleton staff, for at least 
the next several months.

JUDGE FREES MAN AFTER 2 MISTRIALS; COURTS: JURIST SAYS HE BELIEVES INSTRUCTOR 
ACCUSED OF MURDER IS 'PROBABLY GUILTY,' BUT RELEASES HIM FROM CUSTODY.

 A martial arts instructor tried twice for allegedly killing a female co-worker 
was set free Tuesday by a judge who said he believes the man is guilty but 
doubts a verdict can ever be reached in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Both trials of Stuart Edward Milburn, who has been in custody without bail 
since his arrest in March, ended in hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles Horan, who presided over the trials, 
granted a defense motion that requested a third trial not be held on the 
current evidence. "The inescapable fact is we could try the case five times and 
we would have five hung juries unless something new happens," Horan said in 
making his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Horan said the evidence presented during the trials strongly implicates 
Milburn in the murder of a Canyon Country woman who was a rising star in the 
martial arts world, but it was not enough to eliminate all reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably guilty," the judge commented from the bench. "I'm not going to 
try to comfort him or his family by suggesting otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn's attorney, Darryl Mounger, declined to make his client available for 
interviews after the ruling. Milburn's father, Stuart H. Milburn, appeared 
angry with the judge's comments, but relieved that his son was set free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree entirely with the judge," the elder Milburn said. "I'm just 
disappointed it's taken so long for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn, 27, was accused of murdering Veronica Estrada, 29, last December as 
she walked along a dark road toward her home. Jurors voted 8 to 4 to convict 
Milburn during his first trial, which ended in September. His second trial 
ended Dec. 7 with jurors voting 7 to 5 for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against him remains open and he could still be retried. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn showed no emotion during the ruling. Estrada's family and friends also 
listened silently, but many were in tears afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was my friend, and I think he did it and in my heart I hate him for it," 
said Renee Flapper, who was a friend of both Milburn and Estrada. "I don't know 
what to think. I wasn't expecting this." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz, said he was not surprised at 
the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the court, with what they had to deal with, acted very appropriately," 
Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's statement about the guilt of the accused was highly unusual for a 
criminal trial, said Robert Pugsley, a professor of criminal law at 
Southwestern University Law School in Los Angeles. Pugsley said the judge may 
have been venting "humanly understandable frustrations" about the case, but the 
comments could prejudice further proceedings against Milburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, it's putting the D. A. on notice in a very public way that if he 
doesn't come up with more . . . he should not bring (the case) against 
(Milburn) next time," Pugsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a third trial, Pugsley added, Horan almost certainly would not be 
able to preside over it because of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every evidentiary ruling where he ruled favorable to the prosecution, the 
defense would make an objection of bias," Pugsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor in the 
second-degree black-belt division. She was strangled about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 15, 
1993, and her partially clothed body was found the next morning in bushes along 
Soledad Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution claimed Milburn killed her because he was jealous of her 
professional achievements, including being named instructor of the year instead 
of him at the martial arts studio where they worked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foltz's efforts were hampered by eyewitnesses who gave uncertain 
identifications of Milburn at the murder scene and by tests showing that none 
of the blood found there matched the defendant's. In addition, a defense 
witness testified she saw Milburn at the studio at the time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz said he is not giving up yet, however. "There's someone out there who 
knows something," he said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in the first trial said at one point they voted 10 to 2 in favor of 
convicting Milburn, but eventually deadlocked after four weeks of deliberation 
because of the uncertain evidence against him. The second trial ended in a 
mistrial after five days of deliberation, with jurors declining to comment on 
the reasons for their deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said that the defense made a mistake by putting Milburn on the stand 
during the first trial. Horan said Milburn came off as arrogant and unable to 
answer key prosecution questions during the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury didn't like him very much," Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's family has criticized the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's 
handling of the case, stating delays were caused when the original detectives 
were replaced several days after the murder. In addition, some of Estrada's 
clothing from the death scene was destroyed by the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office on orders given by mistake by a sheriff's lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was one of the biggest mistakes ever made by the Sheriff's 
Department," said Estrada's father, Robert, after Tuesday's court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foltz said he doesn't know if the destroyed clothing would have had a 
significant impact on the case, because a coroner's official testified there 
was no blood or other incriminating evidence on the items. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's sister, Theresa, said she would never be at peace if her sister's 
slaying remained unsolved. But she was not hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they going to come up with that they haven't already?" she asked.

MISHAP ON TAXIWAY PUTS PLANE IN HOLE; VAN NUYS: PILOT OF A JET OWNED BY A JEANS 
MAKER APPARENTLY MISSES HIS TURN AND TRIES TO TURN AROUND, SINKING A WHEEL 
NEARLY TWO FEET INTO SOFT ASPHALT.

<P>
 That old sinking feeling returned to Van Nuys Airport Tuesday morning when the 
pilot of a Boeing 727 jet owned by the manufacturer of Guess jeans apparently 
missed a turn and drove the craft onto a patch of soft asphalt, sinking a wheel 
nearly two feet into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, at least, there was no planeload of disgruntled football fans to 
make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a similar jet chartered by University of Wisconsin football fans 
-- already peeved over a Rose Bowl ticket snafu -- sunk through thin asphalt on 
the same taxiway. Charter officials blamed poor directions from the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials this time blamed the pilot of the 727, which is owned by 
clothing-maker Guess Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, he missed his turn and tried to turn around," airport spokeswoman 
Stacy Geere said. "It entered into an area that was not stressed for that kind 
of aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
 The jet remained mired for more than two hours after the 9:37 a.m. incident, 
but did not disrupt air traffic, Geere said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport workers chipped away sections of asphalt around the two wheels that 
punctured the asphalt, and wedged a metal plank under the tires so a tow truck 
could pull it out, Geere said. By afternoon, the plane was aloft and en route 
to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 In January's incident, the owner of the jet blamed the Federal Aviation 
Administration controllers for directing the plane onto a weak segment of 
taxiway in preparation for takeoff. Controllers hoped to avoid such an incident 
Tuesday by guiding the craft from the east taxiway to one better equipped for 
heavy aircraft, according to Geere. The pilot, however, missed the taxiway 
entrance, and then got stuck trying to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 Official at Guess Inc. and the Van Nuys company that handles the aircraft 
would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a non-event and the plane now is en route to Miami," said a company 
spokeswoman, who refused to be named, from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials did not know how many passengers, if any, were aboard the 
jet.

MARCH AGAINST MALATHION; RESIDENTS PROTEST PESTICIDE SPRAYING IN CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 30 adults and children gathered outside Ventura County's public health 
office Tuesday to protest continuing applications of the pesticide malathion in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even as helicopters were being readied for a sixth aerial spraying Tuesday 
night, the protesters carried signs and sang songs voicing concerns over the 
safety of the aerial applications that began nearly three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal agricultural and health officials have ignored significant 
medical research showing that malathion can have detrimental effects on humans, 
protest organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Gaishin, a Camarillo mother who helped organize the protest, suggested 
that the pesticide may cause further harm to youngsters in the spray zone who 
have leukemia or other cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to a Yale University study, malathion has been shown to cause 
leukemia," said Gaishin, gesturing toward stacks of literature about malathion 
that protesters brought to the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 She said residents should be warned of any possible health danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is not adequately warning people about the risks of malathion," 
Gaishin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, who belong to a loose-knit organization called Group Against 
Spraying People, said they targeted Dr. Gary Feldman, Ventura County public 
health officer, because he is charged with warning residents about possible 
health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman met with seven of the protesters at 1:30 p.m., about 2 1/2 hours after 
the demonstration began outside his office on Loma Vista Road in Ventura. The 
meeting lasted two hours, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the GASP members failed to convince Feldman that aerial applications 
of malathion are dangerous, he did agree to review additional information about 
possible toxic effects of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the risks are quite minimal," Feldman said. "But there is a lot that 
is not known about malathion, particularly its long-term effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Several protesters brought their children, who carried signs with such slogans 
as "Gov. Wilson, why are you spraying poison on children?" 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Fraley, who moved her family from the spray zone shortly after aerial 
applications began, said she decided to bring her 9-year-old daughter and 
2-year-old son to the protest as a civics lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter is learning about her civil rights right now," Fraley said as she 
planted more posters in a grassy area outside the public health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters said their goal is to broaden public awareness about the 
dangers of malathion and stop aerial spraying of the pesticide over Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Five applications of malathion have been sprayed over a 16-square-mile Medfly 
eradication zone in east Camarillo since the first fruit fly was found there 
Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth aerial spraying was scheduled to begin at 10 p.m. Tuesday, said 
Larry Hawkins, spokesman for the state Cooperative Medfly Project. Residents in 
the spray zone can expect up to six more applications before the program is 
completed, he said.

DOLE SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER HIRING BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Oxnard women who sued a Saticoy lemon packinghouse for sexual 
discrimination will share $265,000 with dozens of other current and former 
employees under a settlement worked out by both sides, lawyers for the women 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 To settle the class-action lawsuit, Dole Food Co., which owns Buenaventura 
Lemon Co., also agreed to revise hiring practices at the packinghouse, the 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the announced settlement, still to be approved by a federal judge, women 
would make up at least 20% of those employed for general labor jobs. Promotions 
would be offered on a seniority basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers who announced the settlement estimated that more than 100 Ventura 
County women will ultimately share the $265,000 compensation. Dole officials 
were unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to work whatever jobs we could, but we did not get the same 
opportunities," said Beatriz Quezada, one of two named plaintiffs from Ventura 
County. "I think the settlement we reached is good. I think a lot is going to 
get better for us women." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that Quezada, 34, and Imelda Serrato applied on two occasions 
to Buenaventura Lemon and were never called for an interview -- only to learn 
later from friends that men had been hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applied for general work, but they did not even talk to us for being 
women," said Serrato, 40. "Meanwhile, they were hiring men." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Serrato and Quezada filed a complaint with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, their lawyers said, the packinghouse called them back 
and offered them both a job. They accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Serrato and Quezada were laid off 12 days later for unspecified reasons, 
the lawyers said. They then decided to join a sexual discrimination lawsuit 
against Dole Food and its subsidiaries filed by California Rural Legal 
Assistance and Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a Chicago law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups successfully teamed up for a similar sex discrimination lawsuit 
against the Oxnard Lemon Co. that was settled in 1993 for $575,000 to the 
plaintiffs and $675,000 to the attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit against Dole also involved another packinghouse, Central Valley 
Citrus in Terra Bella, near Porterville in Central California. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, Dole would also pay $265,000 to women who work 
or have applied to the Terra Bella packinghouse. And CRLA would receive $25,000 
to fund any possible legal action needed to enforce terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial compensation for CRLA's work in the lawsuit and that of the Chicago 
firm has yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is still pending before U. S. District Judge Lourdes Baird in Los 
Angeles. Final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in the spring, 
the attorneys said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful victory for the women packinghouse workers," said 
attorney Eileen McCarthy, of CRLA's Oxnard bureau. "They need to be commended 
for standing up to (Dole). Their challenging of traditional roles will affect 
more than their life in the workplace. I think it's about their place in 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 After looking into Buenaventura Lemon, attorney Valeriano Saucedo of the 
Chicago firm said he found that the discriminatory practices at the 
packinghouse were more widespread than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out that most women who applied were not hired," Saucedo said. "The 
higher-level jobs, such as mechanic and forklift driver, were always being 
filled by men. And there was a lot of talk by the men that the women could not 
do those jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Saucedo expects that most of those from Ventura County who would be 
compensated as a result of the suit will be women who applied to Buenaventura 
Lemon and were not hired because of their sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada and Serrato will have the opportunity to go back to work for 
Buenaventura Lemon as soon as an opening occurs, but the two women are not sure 
if they are interested anymore, Saucedo said.

JUDGE LETS MAJORITY OF HOSPITAL'S SUIT STAND; COURTS: HE REJECTS PORTION OF 
COMMUNITY MEMORIAL'S ACTION AGAINST COUNTY FACILITY, BUT REFUSES COMPLETE 
DISMISSAL.

 A Ventura County judge Tuesday refused to dismiss most of a lawsuit Community 
Memorial Hospital has filed accusing the nearby county medical center of 
illegally competing for privately insured patients. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bitter legal dispute between the private Ventura hospital and Ventura 
County Medical Center could still be a long way from trial, lawyers said, 
because the judge gave Community Memorial nearly three weeks to refile the part 
of the lawsuit he threw out. 
</P>
<P>
 The county hospital had asked Superior Court Judge Frederick A. Jones to 
dismiss all of Community Memorial's July complaint, which evolved from a 
yearlong battle between the two facilities over the treatment of privately 
insured and indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Jones ruled that the county hospital must defend itself at trial 
against charges that it accepts privately insured patients who could be served 
at other hospitals. He also said the county facility must answer to charges 
that it does not treat enough of the county's patients who are uninsured or 
unable to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge dismissed the final part of the lawsuit -- the part charging the 
county with unfair business practices. A primary concern is a new policy 
allowing county government employees to go to county facilities for 
hospitalization and basic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said that about 1,000 of the 6,000 employees have chosen that 
lower-cost option, and that Community Memorial has lost patients as a direct 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant County Counsel Noel Klebaum said Jones did not allow the final 
portion of the lawsuit to stand because it involved allegations of unfair 
business practices and unfair competition. Under state law, state entities 
cannot be sued on such grounds. The medical center is considered a state entity 
because it is run by the county, which is defined as a subdivision of the 
state, Klebaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones did not rule out the possibility of Community Memorial pursuing the 
same claims under a theory other than unfair business practices, lawyers 
agreed. By giving the private hospital 20 days to amend its lawsuit, the judge 
left open the possibility that it might find other grounds to make the same 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 John E. McDermott, the Los Angeles attorney representing Community Memorial, 
said the private hospital has already begun researching a new way to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is another legal theory under which we can attack those same 
activities," he said. That theory, he said, is to allege that the county 
hospital is interfering with Community Memorial's business relationship with 
private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Klebaum said that if Community Memorial indeed amends its lawsuit, it would 
only further delay the start of any trial because the county hospital would 
again ask Jones to dismiss that portion of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott said Community Memorial is just trying to make sure that it is not 
faced with unfair competition. He said Jones' ruling Tuesday clearly favored 
Community Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county was basically saying, 'Throw out the (whole) complaint,' and the 
court refused to do so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klebaum said he was pleased that the judge dismissed part of the lawsuit, but 
added that "we had been hoping to get most of the case thrown out."

PLANNED CAMPUS NOT VIEWED AS THREAT TO LOCAL COLLEGES

 Ventura County's three community colleges could experience initial drops in 
enrollment when a Cal State campus opens near Camarillo, but the long-term 
benefits would far outweigh any loss of students, a college district official 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-planned public university, scheduled to be built on 260 acres the 
state agreed to buy last week, would keep students in school longer, said 
Timothy D. Hirschberg, president of the Ventura County Community College 
District board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average community college student is 25," said Hirschberg, whose district 
oversees community colleges in Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura. "They are older 
and more rooted in the community, so it's harder for them to move to continue 
with their higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a Cal State four-year university right here in our own neighborhood 
will help every community college student realize their educational dream," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials announced last week that they settled a long-simmering 
dispute with Mohseni Ranch, owners of about 200 acres of lemon groves outside 
Camarillo that state planners had targeted for a public university. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohseni Ranch's 200 acres and another 60 acres of vegetable crops will be sold 
to the state university system this spring to house the campus, which will 
serve more than 15,000 full-time students when it is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest in a series of locations for a proposed campus that state 
officials have targeted since the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State leaders have said that although there is enough money saved to 
purchase the 260 acres, funds to build the university must come from a bond 
proposal that will be placed on the 1996 California primary ballot. If the 
money is approved, the first students could attend classes there by 1999, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An educator at UC Santa Barbara said there would be little competition between 
a Cal State campus in Ventura County and his university's local facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our program in Ventura has always been designed to serve the upper division 
and graduate population, not to become a full-service undergraduate and 
graduate program," said John Maxwell, a dean at UCSB, which operates a Ventura 
off-campus center. "We're not in any way in the same kind of business that Cal 
State is in." 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 degree-bound students are enrolled at UCSB's Ventura campus, down 
slightly in recent years, Maxwell said. But thousands of working professionals 
take courses offered by the center to enhance their careers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very clearly a sub-unit of UCSB and intend to remain so," Maxwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators of Ventura County's private colleges also said a local Cal 
State campus would offer more opportunities to students. The private school 
officials said they fill a different community need than do public 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really see ourselves in competition with CSU, but rather as 
colleagues who are committed to providing higher education services to the 
county," said Pamela Jolicoeur, vice president of academic affairs at Cal 
Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students that come here are seeking the small-college, residential atmosphere 
that distinguishes us from the state university," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,800 students attend classes at Cal Lutheran, which opened its 
first classrooms in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy John, director of the Oxnard campus of the private University of La 
Verne, predicted that any new public university would benefit other 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more information and publicity there is in this county (about a public 
university) is good for all of us," said John, who oversees almost 400 students 
at three off-campus centers in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here since 1951," John said. "I've watched and waited for this 
thing to come for years and years. It's a really positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Escrow is scheduled to close on the Cal State land deal before April 1.

NUMBER ON WELFARE CONTINUES TO INCREASE; ECONOMY: EXPERTS POINT TO LOSS OF 
JOBS, NORTHRIDGE QUAKE AS FACTORS. SLOWDOWN IN MEDI-CAL CASES PROVIDES A MORE 
UPBEAT SIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The number of Ventura County residents on welfare, which has more than tripled 
since 1988, continued to rise in 1994 despite indications that the economy is 
slowly beginning to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hearing that the economy is picking up, but generally the welfare 
caseloads are the last place that any improvement hits," said Helen Reburn, the 
county's welfare director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about people who have even a more difficult time finding jobs 
due to a lack of skills," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 92,619 people in Ventura County received some form of welfare or 
other government assistance, compared with 88,344 in the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, some encouraging signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the largest welfare program -- Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children -- has grown steadily, the rate of increase in Medi-Cal cases appears 
to be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1993 to 1994, there were 2,766 new Medi-Cal cases, a considerable drop 
from the 13,118 new cases of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the overall increase in the county's rolls, the number of single 
adults collecting welfare declined for the second year in a row, falling from 
461 in January, 1992, to 252 in November. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials credit that drop to a program started in 1992 that provides 
the poor with job training, drug treatment and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Reburn said a loss of jobs is the primary reason that Ventura County's welfare 
cases have continued to climb, even as those in Los Angeles County have 
stabilized in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is a change in state law allowing one parent to work part-time while 
still receiving reduced benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That keeps the family together," she said. "Previously, a lot of fathers 
chose to leave the home so the rest of the family could get aid." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Santa Paula experienced the sharpest increase in welfare 
cases this year. County figures show that 9,482 residents -- more than 
one-third of the city's population -- were collecting welfare, food stamps or 
Medi-Cal last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Elenes, manager of the welfare office in Santa Paula, said the 
Northridge earthquake may have contributed to the 10% increase by displacing 
some Fillmore and Piru residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was more housing available in Santa Paula," she said. "The transition 
from Fillmore to Santa Paula would be a lot easier for people who like this 
kind of environment versus moving to Oxnard or Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 In Piru, the number of people collecting welfare dropped slightly from 276 to 
248 during the past year, while in Fillmore, the figure increased from 4,323 to 
4,393. 
</P>
<P>
 Elenes said waiting periods have grown longer in the Santa Paula office 
because there are not enough interview rooms where families can speak privately 
with caseworkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bottlenecks because we have to have a private area to see people," she 
said. "We can handle the cases with the number of people we have here; we just 
don't have any space." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, the small waiting room with 30 chairs was about half 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 Consuelo Ceta, 49, cradled her young grandson as her husband, Alfonso, 
reapplied for Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso had worked at a manufacturing job earlier this year until he was 
injured in an accident with the company's truck, his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no work," Consuelo Ceta said of Santa Paula. "We have no money and 
we're asking my relatives for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it doesn't get better, we'll have to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen-year-old Barbara Marquez stood near the door waiting to reapply for a 
Medi-Cal card. Marquez, who receives AFDC, said she needs medicine to treat 
depression caused by a thyroid problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately, I've been real depressed," she said. "Plus, I need to take the kids 
to the doctor for their checkups." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at nonprofit agencies in Ventura County say they've seen no drop in 
the number of people asking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Williams of Food Share said the Medfly quarantine imposed this fall has 
meant a loss of some agricultural jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those individuals who would have been picking crops or working on the 
packinghouses, they're out of work," he said. "The quarantine has really 
negatively affected this Ventura County area." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Food Share distributed 12 million pounds of food that reached about 
127,000 people a month. Much of that went to families on food stamps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, the food stamp program is not enough to cover them for a 
month," he said.

RIDING TO THE RESCUE; SAFETY: AREA LIFEGUARDS LEARN HOW TO MANEUVER NEW 
'PERSONAL WATERCRAFT' TO MORE RAPIDLY REACH VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are a familiar sight on Orange County's beaches: lifeguards in their 
trademark red shorts watching the shoreline from their towers, rolling by in 
Jeeps or patrolling the waves in shallow boats, warning errant swimmers not to 
stray too far from land. 
</P>
<P>
 But county lifeguards are adding a new tool to their rescue repertoire: 
"personal watercraft." 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-day training program that ends today, 23 lifeguards from Seal 
Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach and Lake Mission Viejo -- 
plus a visiting crew from Kill Devil Hills, N.C. -- braved the chilly water to 
learn the fine points of operating Yamaha WaveRunners as rescue vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The craft, which can carry two rescuers but can be operated by a solo rescuer 
if necessary, are a recent addition to the equipment that lifeguards use to 
mount rescues, Newport Beach Marine Safety Lt. Eric Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifeguards praise the speed and mobility of the personal craft. 
</P>
<P>
 They are especially enthusiastic about the sled that trails behind, giving 
rescuers a platform on which to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation or begin 
other lifesaving measures almost as soon as they reach a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an easy, one-person launch; they're fast and can operate in very shallow 
water," Bauer said. "And since they have no propeller, it reduces the danger to 
the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we get some of these soon," said James Griffin, a former U.S. Navy 
rescue swimmer who now works in Kill Devil Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The watershed event that prompted use of the device was the tragic death of 
15-year-old Adam Bischoff, who drowned in the Los Angeles River after 
torrential rains in February, 1992, flooded the river in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers tried every technique they knew but were unable to save Bischoff, who 
had ridden his bicycle near the edge of a channel and fallen in. 
</P>
<P>
 If Adam had been able to catch any of the ropes that rescuers threw to him as 
30-m.p.h. currents swept him downstream, the drag on the line would have been 
3,200 pounds or more -- enough to easily sweep the person throwing the rope 
into the water with him, watercraft rescue instructor Kerry Smith told his 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are no guarantees in emergencies, lifeguards believe that having 
the watercraft could prevent such deaths. Los Angeles County emergency service 
agencies began using the craft about a year after Adam's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal watercraft are a boon to swift-water rescues on rivers and in the 
ocean, Bauer said, because their 40- to 50-m.p.h. top end lets them keep up 
with the current. Rescuers can speed alongside victims, pull them onto the 
"rescue sled" -- a boogie board-type platform towed behind the watercraft -- 
and carry them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In coastal Orange County, the watercraft will be primarily used on the rivers 
and creeks that feed into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach is training its eight permanent lifeguards to use the devices to 
back up fire department rescue crews for storm season rescues in the Santa Ana 
River and San Diego Creek Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said that during the rainy season, one designated lifeguard is on call 
and, under severe storm alerts, may take the craft home overnight to make 
getting to a rescue site faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach lifeguards will also be trained to use the craft for multiple 
rescues in case of an air crash into the ocean or Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to incorporate them into air crash scenarios," Bauer said. "We will 
be developing a plan for (John Wayne) airport over the next six months." 
</P>
<P>
 But Newport Beach's two WaveRunners, which look like snowmobiles for the 
water, made their debut in the water last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach and Huntington Beach each have two of the watercraft, donated to 
both cities by local dealers. Other cities hope to work out similar 
arrangements through a grant program that Yamaha has for public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had one of the primary rescue boats break down late last summer, and we 
incorporated (the personal craft) into our rescue operations for the last two 
weeks of summer," Bauer said. "We don't anticipate it being a primary rescue 
craft, but we may find out different." 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting lifeguards from Kill Devil Hills said they have no rivers or streams 
to contend with but do confront severe rip currents in the Atlantic Ocean -- 
which has a steeper shoreline than West Coast beaches -- that suck swimmers 
under the water, sometimes in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a problem a year ago, what we called Black Sunday. We had 70 or 80 
swimmers caught in the rips," Kill Devil Hills lifeguard Mike Hurd said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said lifeguards can rescue the victims much faster and more efficiently 
with watercraft than by swimming into the waves with a hand-held buoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach got its Wave-Runners last summer as a donation from Champion 
Motorcycles and the manufacturer. This week's training classes were funded by 
the Personal Watercraft Industry Assn. and the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joint training opportunities like this have been very important," Bauer said. 
"Contrary to popular belief, we are trying to do more with less money."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; POLICE INVESTIGATE SHERMAN WAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police were investigating Tuesday whether the drivers of two 
vehicles involved in an accident at a Van Nuys intersection were under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol when their cars collided, injuring nine people, 
including four children. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood tests due back next week will determine whether Jose Fernandez, 31, and 
Richard Condap, 41, both of Van Nuys, were intoxicated at the time of the 
Monday night crash, Los Angeles Police Detective Rick Talkington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was the driver of a Chevy Blazer carrying six passengers -- four of 
them children -- when it collided with a station wagon driven by Condap, who 
was traveling with passenger Donna Truex, Talkington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash, described by authorities as one of the area's worst traffic 
accidents in years, occurred about 7:45 p.m. Monday at Sherman Way and Louise 
Avenue. Police had yet to determine the cause of the crash Tuesday. The Blazer 
appeared to have struck a utility pole head-on and flipped over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody ran a red light; we just don't know who," Talkington said. "We have 
no witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 All nine people were injured in the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was listed in good condition and Susalia Navarro, 29, of Van Nuys, 
was listed in serious condition Tuesday. Three children who were also 
passengers in the Blazer were listed in critical condition, while a fourth was 
in satisfactory condition.

 Navarro was believed to be the mother of all four children, police said. The 
condition of a seventh passenger, Armando Sierra, 24, of Van Nuys, was 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Condap was listed in good condition Tuesday and Truex, a 
32-year-old Fresno woman, was listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared that only one passenger riding inside the Chevy Blazer was wearing 
a seat belt at the time of the crash, Talkington said. He speculated that other 
passengers may have suffered fewer injuries had they been wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually in a rollover situation, seat-belts make a heck of a big difference," 
Talkington said. With the exception of the restraint worn by Navarro, 
"apparently (no seat belts) were even in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents said the intersection has been the site of countless 
collisions and that police had stepped up enforcement efforts to catch speeding 
motorists. Authorities previously stated that the extensive damage to both 
vehicles indicated at least one of them was traveling at a high rate of speed.

<P>
 Several witnesses reported hearing no screeching of brakes before the 
accident. JULIE TAMAKI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; LIBRARY SUPPORTERS TO HOLD BOOK SALE

<P>
 The Friends of the Sylmar Library will hold their first used-book sale of the 
new year Jan. 10 in the parking lot behind the library, 13059 Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 About five times a year, the friends put on a sale to raise money to buy new 
books and sponsor reading programs for the library, said event coordinator Pat 
Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been cutting from the budget for the last five years," Lee said.  
</P>
<P>
 She said the Friends of the Sylmar Library raise $350 per book sale, where 
used books donated from the public are sold for about 25 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the club's long-term goals is to raise enough money to find a newer and 
bigger facility for the library, Lee said. MAKI BECKER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; DRAIN-SYSTEM DUMPING LAW GETS INITIAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has given the first reading to a sweeping ordinance that 
prohibits dumping in the city's storm drain system. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the first reading this month, and the second 
and final vote is scheduled at the council's session Jan. 9.If passed, as 
expected, the ordinance would become law in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 City Public Works Director Mark Christoffels said the new ordinance is 
required to keep the city in line with federal law. The federal Clean Water Act 
prohibits local governments from dumping into drains that ultimately go to 
"federal waters," or in this case, the Pacific Ocean. The federal law is 
designed to protect the ocean from being polluted by dumping that sometimes 
goes on in local draining systems. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents, the new ordinance would mean it would be illegal to wash 
anything down the gutter that feeds into city storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, the law prohibits anything but storm water from being in the 
drains," Christoffels said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added the city is unlikely to try to fine a homeowner if a few stray 
grass clippings fall into the gutter. "What we would do is go after some man 
who was hired to mow a yard and them tries to dump all the clippings into the 
storm drain," Christoffels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of the new ordinance would be a misdemeanor, and Christoffels said 
specific fines have yet to be established. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (new) ordinance has a broader focus than the (city's) existing water 
pollution regulations," Christoffels said. He added that all cities in Orange 
County are being required to adopt similar ordinances because all drainage in 
the county ultimately goes to the ocean. BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; STUDENTS VOICE THEIR CONCERN ON BONDS CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A half-dozen Valencia High School students who went to Placentia's City 
Council meeting last week to ask about countywide financial woes expressed 
concern in interviews that the bonds crisis would hurt school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who did not get a chance to speak because they were mistakenly 
led to believe that youths could not address the council, were members of the 
high school choir who assembled at the Civic Center to go caroling. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Otto, 14, said that he and the others wanted to know whether the choir's 
minimal funding and other programs like clubs, drama, sports and student 
transportation would be affected by the failed investment fund and whether 
teachers would be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 James Crumley, 16, was concerned about the fate of school lunches and how cuts 
in student programs might impact crime in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to know, if you have to cut programs for schools, won't crime rates 
go up?" he asked, noting that some of his friends had flirted with gang 
activities but turned to after-school programs when they were offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you cut things like that, that's like saying, 'We don't have the time or 
the money to waste on you,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Ayling, 16, said she fears that classes will be interrupted and that 
would affect her class's graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If school lets out in February, we won't be able to make up the credits this 
year," she said. "That means we'd have to go to (high) school for five years. 
I'm not going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Carla Walworth, 14, said she worried that programs counseling safe sex and 
family planning would be cut and that teachers would be laid off. "It's hard to 
get good teachers," she said. "If they don't pay the teachers, they'll just 
hire anyone who'll work cheap and that doesn't really care about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Erica Ortega, 14, echoed those fears. "I heard some teachers say they wouldn't 
work if they didn't get paid," she said. HOLLY J. WAGNER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; ACTOR FOCUSES ON HIS ROLE AS SON, BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Broadway actor, Alan Muraoka has taken on challenging roles, but none so 
tough as the real-life one he faces today -- that of being the devoted son of a 
mother who is battling cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 32-year-old thespian, for all appearances, will step up to the 
challenge with the same dedication and commitment that has carried him through 
a career that has had both rewards and frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Muraoka is the male lead in the national touring company that is bringing the 
hit Broadway musical "Miss Saigon" to various locations throughout the country. 
The actor received special permission from the company to fly back to Los 
Angeles from Detroit, where the show is currently playing. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to come home for the holidays. Back to Mission Hills, where he grew 
up, and back to his mother, Carol, who learned in August that her breast 
cancer, which had been in remission, had returned. 
</P>
<P>
 This Christmas, the Muraokas' home served as a staging ground for a family 
trip to Las Vegas, where they spent Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The 
Muraokas decided on Vegas because it is a favorite vacation spot for Carol 
Muraoka, who loves to gamble. The family also thought Las Vegas would be a good 
place to hold a reunion in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
 They sent invitations to a Christmas Day banquet to family members and 
friends, and were surprised and delighted when 80 people accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a special lady," Muraoka said of his mother, who worked in a Toluca 
Lake day-care center for 37 years before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Carol Muraoka and her husband, Victor, flew to New York to watch 
their son perform in "Miss Saigon," the story of a tragic love affair between 
an American soldier and a Vietnamese girl during the fall of Saigon. Muraoka 
was the fourth actor to play the lead role of the Vietnamese engineer, who 
tries to use the girl to get to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very happy and proud," Victor Muraoka said. 
</P>
<P>
 The starring Broadway role capped a 10-year career that has included playing a 
secondary lead in the musical "Shogun" on Broadway, understudying the lead in 
the Tony Award-winning "M. Butterfly" on its national tour, and understudying a 
secondary lead in the musical version of "My Favorite Year" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Muraoka has also done television and film work. In his junior year at UCLA, he 
won a $1,000 scholarship, the Carol Burnett Musical Theater Award, for which he 
created and performed a comedic musical bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his successes, the actor said the dearth of quality roles for 
Asian-American actors has caused him to rethink his future in acting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at other career possibilities," he said, but added: "If other 
roles like ("Miss Saigon") come along, I could see myself continuing in this 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 Such concerns were set aside during his short vacation, which ended when he 
flew back to Detroit on Tuesday. Instead, he had the opportunity to focus on 
his family, which includes his older siblings, David and Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's the true meaning of Christmas," he said. "It's love and family, 
and it's remembering the good times and the possibilities of good times to 
come." KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; EX-CHAMBER HEAD TO JOIN COLLEGE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just three months before Glendale's municipal elections, Mary Hamilton has 
ascended from a candidate for the Glendale Community College Board of Trustees 
to a member-elect. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week -- one week after she took out nomination papers to place her name 
on the election ballot -- Hamilton was chosen by the college board to replace 
13-year incumbent Ted Tiffany, who is retiring and will leave the board in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton will be sworn in shortly after Tiffany steps down and will serve the 
remaining two years of his term, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, 53, a former Glendale Chamber of Commerce president and co-owner of 
Hamilton and Bache, an investment counseling firm, said her priority will be to 
protect the college's general-education curriculum from the effects of 
continued cuts in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is going to be the budget, and how we can intelligently pull 
back on programs and faculty without doing the college a great deal of harm," 
Hamilton said.  
</P>
<P>
 She added that in times of public funding difficulties, "I think it's time 
that financial people take their place in politics. I think we can add a new 
dimension." 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously to appoint Hamilton, but it also considered the 
two other candidates that have taken out nomination papers for the April 
election: Martin Pilgreen, a longtime principal in the Glendale Unified School 
District, and Victor King, a local attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In the election, the board seats currently held by board President Robert 
Holmes and Rae Berry will be contested. Holmes has announced he will seek 
reelection, while Berry, who has served three four-year terms, has said that 
she will step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Philip Kazanjian said trustees originally intended to hold a 
special election to replace Tiffany, but decided against it when they were told 
by city officials that it would cost taxpayers about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt (appointing Hamilton) would be a cost savings to the public, and it 
also makes sense. She has a financial background, she has business leadership, 
and she has been involved with a number of support groups to the college, so 
she knows what the college's issues are," Kazanjian said. STEVE RYFLE

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; BOMB THREAT PROVES 
TO BE FALSE -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scene Tuesday was all too familiar. A dozen or so squad cars blocking off 
a major thoroughfare, while frightened residents watch from behind yellow tape 
as helmeted officers scurry around a mysterious package. 
</P>
<P>
 And like most times, the only thing that went boom behind a Wilshire State 
Bank branch on Sherman Way in Reseda was the device police used to blow apart a 
prankster's idea of a fake bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers fled a Sav-on store on Etiwanda Street and houses on Sherman Way 
behind the bank, and traffic for blocks in either direction was rerouted for 
about an hour during Tuesday's scare, which began when a bank employee saw a 
timing device attached to cylinders that looked like dynamite, said Los Angeles 
Police Capt. Robert Gale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked very, very real," said Gale. "It looked too similar to an actual 
device to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Keanu Reeves can crawl under a speeding bus and, brow beaded with sweat, 
attempt to defuse a complicated bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on planet Los Angeles, though, the best way to get rid of a bomb seems to 
be to fire a projectile at it -- picking up the pieces later. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what transpired Tuesday, when officers fired at the phony bomb, 
found beside a retaining wall in a rear parking lot of the bank branch. That 
accounted for the small percussion and puff of smoke spectators heard and saw 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's false alarm marked the seventh time shopping centers were emptied 
recently due to bomb threats or suspicious-looking devices. No bombs turned up 
in any of them, but the culprits apparently accomplished what they wanted -- 
rattling the public and drawing attention to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all the commerce we shut down," said Gale. "The bank was full. We 
shut down a whole bunch of businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The pranksters also cost retailers thousands of dollars in lost sales. A bomb 
scare closed the Glendale Galleria for seven hours during the height of the 
holiday shopping season. In that incident, a shopper spotted a suspicious 
package in a men's restroom. Police later received a threatening call, and 
uncovered two more packages in two other restrooms. Each package was labeled 
"bomb" and turned out be sacks of flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hit with scares this month were the Westside Pavilion and Beverly Center 
in Los Angeles, Santa Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia and the Brea Mall in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Scott Miller of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in Santa 
Clarita knows the scenario well. "We've never had a call of a bomb threat where 
we actually had a bomb," said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often, such threats come from disgruntled employees looking to disrupt 
business, he said. Usually, deputies respond, search the building, and only 
call in the experts if they find anything unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone reports a suspicious-looking device, the bomb experts often have 
to be called to take a look, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, it's another story. Perhaps because the rural 
atmosphere allows pyrotechnic aficionados to get away with setting off 
explosives, authorities frequently find the real McCoy, said Sgt. Bob Denham of 
the Antelope Valley sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Denham's officers get many calls, "and frequently they find explosive devices 
-- from old military weapons to homemade bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat every (suspicious) item as if it was an explosive device," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it is difficult to profile the typical bomber. As the recent 
firebombing of a New York City subway train may show, a seemingly mild-mannered 
suburbanite could harbor the destructive tendencies of a bomber. Authorities 
say an unemployed man accidentally exploded a homemade bomb that was to be part 
of a blackmail scheme, injuring himself and dozens of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for bomb pranksters, most bear grudges or simply like to see spectacles, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think whoever is doing it likes to see the evacuations," LAPD bomb squad 
Lt. Steven Allen said of the recent mall incidents.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 23 DRIVERS ARRESTED OVER 78-HOUR PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County law enforcement officers arrested 23 motorists on suspicion of 
drunk driving during the maximum enforcement period that ended at midnight 
Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number compares with 14 similar arrests over the maximum enforcement 
period a year ago.But California Highway Patrol officials said the extra day in 
this year's long weekend contributed to the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year wasn't that long," CHP Officer Staci Morse said. "This year fell 
over a four-day weekend, so we had a lot more travelers on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum enforcement period -- when as many law enforcement personnel are 
on patrol as possible -- began this year at 6 p.m. Friday and ended at midnight 
Monday, a 78-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the enforcement period went from 6 p.m. Dec. 24 to midnight Dec. 
26, a period of 54 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP reported 25 traffic accidents over the four days that ended Monday 
night, up from 10 accidents over last year's three-day holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 25 collisions, five were injury crashes that resulted in six people 
being hurt, Morse said. Of the 10 accidents a year ago, two involved injuries 
to four people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of alcohol-related crashes remained stable, with three such 
accidents occurring over both weekends, Morse said. One person, however, was 
killed this year in a collision, while no one died during the maximum 
enforcement period last year, she said.

 "It's becoming more socially acceptable, and socially accepted, for people to 
designate a driver," Morse said. JEFF McDONALD

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CAR SEATS DONATED TO PARENTS OF NEWBORNS

 Babies born at Glendale Adventist Medical Center in January will receive a 
birthday gift -- a car seat -- from the Glendale Sunrise Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Safe-Ride-USA, 83% of the infants and children who died in car 
accidents during the past seven years lost their lives in survivable crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to this statistic, the Rotary Club donated $4,000 to the hospital 
toward the purchase of at least 200 infant car seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The club will present the check to hospital officials today, and members will 
be present with car seat in hand when the first infant makes his (or her) way 
into the world at Glendale Adventist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in helping out the community in any way we can, especially 
if it means saving a life," Rotary Club President Laura Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially setting out to supply the hospital with a year's worth of infant car 
seats, the Rotary Club scaled down its donation to its present size when it 
learned that car seats can be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Members decided to provide for the 200 to 250 babies expected to be born at 
Glendale Adventist during January. The club has asked that the hospital require 
the car seats to be returned by recipient families when their children have 
outgrown the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Once returned, the Rotary Club will then send the car seats to needy families 
in Central and South America. ANTONIO OLIVO

 Plans to give Main Street a half-million-dollar face lift may be scaled back 
because money for the project is in the county's beleaguered investment pool, 
officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(That) money was invested in the pool and was obviously impacted negatively," 
City Manager Arthur C. Simonian told a business owner at a City Council meeting 
last week."Where that (loss) is going to (be made up) is a fair question, one 
we are looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Scull, a plumber whose business is on Main Street, asked the council at 
its meeting last week when it would be spending the $500,000 approved last 
December to improve lighting, install a fountain, clock tower, benches and 
signs and expand parking on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are the funds forthcoming?" Scull asked. "If not, explain why." 
</P>
<P>
 The city invested $13.5 million in the pool, with most of the funds slated for 
capital improvements such as a new gymnasium, sports park and the improvements 
to Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 27% loss of the city's investment will not come out of one 
project, Simonian said, but would probably be distributed among several 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Simonian said his staff would be studying funding for those and other projects 
set to begin next year to determine where the city would make up the 
loss.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Parts of Ocean Avenue will be closed at times in January while the city

 Any necessary traffic detours will be clearly marked, and property owners in 
the area will be notified by mail of the construction schedule.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Flu season is already under way, but county public health officials say it is 
not too late to be immunized. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Department of Public Health suggests the shots for people 
most vulnerable to getting the flu: those over 60, those with chronic health 
problems, and young adults with heart, liver and respiratory problems, 
including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 The shots are also available for those who have frequent contact with the 
public, such as teachers, firefighters and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Public Health Officer Gary M. Feldman said the flu vaccine is 
usually in short supply, but that a recent delivery has left the county with a 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the shots is $5. 
</P>
<P>
 For details or to schedule an appointment, call the county public health 
clinic at 652-5918 in Ventura, 385-8652 in Oxnard or 584-5887 in Simi Valley.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LATE DONATIONS HELP CHARITIES MEET GOALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to last-minute support, Ventura County charities were able to overcome 
early fund-raising snarls and managed to meet their goals to help hundreds of 
families this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oxnard-Port Hueneme Salvation Army Corps had to dip heavily into its 
resources, spending $15,000 to provide food and toys to a targeted 500 
families, Lt. Fred Morasky said. Corps officials in Oxnard were forced to turn 
away 15 to 20 additional families who asked for help Christmas Eve because of a 
shortage of supplies on hand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a positive note, however, the Oxnard corps made its holiday fund-raising 
goal of $60,000. Morasky said "little givers" came through with loads of small 
change in the last days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Other area Salvation Army officials also reported meeting Red Kettle goals, 
despite initial problems in obtaining permission to put the kettles at various 
retail locations. But officials won't have a complete picture of their 1995 
budget for a couple of months, until results from a mail-in appeal and canned 
food drive are tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Corps officials were concerned for a time about the local Toys for Tots 
drive when they found themselves 9,000 toys short a few days before Christmas.  
</P>
<P>
 Marine Staff Sgt. John Hendrix said $11,000 raised by the K-HAY radio station 
in Ventura plus a flurry of last-minute donations enabled the corps to meet its 
goal of 38,000 toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the toys went to the Ventura County Rescue Mission, which had its 
biggest toy giveaway ever. Executive Director Jerry Roberg said the mission 
gave toys to 2,700 youngsters this year compared with 700 last year, and fed 
Christmas meals to as many as 12,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura County United Way officials said they had received $659,639 
in pledges toward a 1995 goal of $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, we are off to a great start," said Bob Quist, United Way's Conejo 
Valley volunteer chairman. JAN STEVENS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA PALMA; CITY REVISES LAW TO ADD BAN ON IN-LINE SKATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In-line skaters will no longer be able to glide through a loophole in a local 
law that bans skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week revised a 1988 ordinance that allows police to 
impose fines for skateboarding in Central Park and the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Those using the boards were destroying public benches, chipping the edge of 
concrete sidewalks and creating a safety hazard for pedestrians, said 
recreation director Ron Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
 In-line skates had not reached their current level of popularity at that time 
and their use was not addressed in that ordinance, Kenny said. The legal 
revision now takes care of both. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the newly renovated Central Park were not able to take action 
when they spotted negligent in-line skaters, although they can issue citations 
to skateboarders, Kenny said. Those tickets can run up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to tell (in-line skaters) not to skate or to leave the area," he told 
the council. "Staff has been directed to tell them that about the ordinance, 
but we had no teeth in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers have been calling the Recreation and Community Services Department 
to complain about the ban, but the city has no options for them, Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a phone call from a very articulate young man who said they get kicked 
out of every place they go," he said. "It is a problem, but we have no solution 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed that Kenny should ask neighboring cities if local 
youths may use any of their facilities. LESLEY WRIGHT

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: QUAKE COUNSELING PROGRAM GETS GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children still coping with anxiety caused by the Northridge earthquake will 
receive extra assistance because of a $23,000 special relief grant from Blue 
Shield of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Service of Los Angeles, which provides post-quake counseling on the 
campuses of Canoga Park and Reseda elementary schools, will use the extra funds 
to help families just now dealing with the psychological effects of the quake 
on their children, said Chief Executive Officer Emily Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents had so much to deal with, in terms of getting the house in order and 
making sure everything else was stable, that they weren't aware their kids are 
still experiencing emotional problems carried over from nearly a year ago," 
Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) every time there is an aftershock, the initial fear is brought up among 
those who haven't yet received help," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lloyd, children who experience a traumatizing event without later 
receiving the proper attention are prone to engage in regressive behavior, such 
as thumb-sucking, bed-wetting or temper tantrums. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems that only existed on a minute level before the quake were probably 
exacerbated Jan. 17, she said. Parents should recognize this possibility when 
dealing with what they may initially construe to be a deeper problem with their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, Family Service of Los Angeles features a two-handed approach 
to its counseling efforts. The first is an educational overview of symptoms 
parents should look for in their children after a traumatic event. Counselors 
are then on hand to guide concerned guardians on methods to employ in 
re-establishing emotional stability within the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the children are engaged in an art therapy program that allows them 
to draw out what happened to them on the day of the quake and to express their 
concerns about future disasters.  
</P>
<P>
 Counselors then go over disaster preparedness procedures with the young 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being on the school campus is very helpful to us," Lloyd said. "The message 
we want to send to the families is that the reactions they're experiencing are 
normal reactions to an extremely abnormal situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will allow Family Service to run the program, initiated by Blue 
Shield immediately after the quake, well into the last week of January. ANTONIO 
OLIVO

<P>
 Physical education and health professor Barbara J. Wright has been named 
faculty member of the year for 1994-95 at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Presenting the fifth annual award was the faculty's Academic Senate, which 
represents the 23 academic divisions on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Alamitos resident, Wright has taught at Orange Coast for 22 years. She 
holds bachelor's and master's degrees in physical education from Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm overwhelmed by this award," Wright said. "I'm stepping into some 
extremely large shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Four professors were nominated by their colleagues for the award. Students 
then submitted letters of recommendation on behalf of their favorite 
instructors, and the winner was chosen by a vote of the full-time faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 The other nominees were Kevin T. Ballinger of Lake Forest, an associate 
professor of neurodiagnostic technology; Art Moore of Los Alamitos, an 
assistant professor of mathematics, and Elizabeth Netoliczka of Irvine, a 
Spanish instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-year-old Alabama native, Wright coached the Orange Coast women's 
gymnastics team for 10 seasons. Her team won the state championship in 1982, 
and she was named coach of the year in 1983 for community college gymnastics in 
California. She also coached badminton and cross-country teams at Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 A triathlete for more than a decade, Wright has competed in the grueling 
Ironman Triathlon in Kona, Hawaii. Two years ago she finished third in her age 
bracket in the event with a time of 11 hours, 55 minutes. The Ironman consists 
of a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bike race and a 26.2-mile marathon run. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, George, is also a competitive triathlete. They have two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Orange Coast faculty in 1973, Wright taught physical 
education classes for four years at Santiago High School in Garden Grove. She 
also coached swimming and gymnastics at Santiago and served as an adviser to 
the cheerleading squad. ALAN EYERLY

 A 2-year-old who tumbled into a swimming pool earlier this year died after 
spending nine months in a coma, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariyam Ismail died at home in the 9900 block of Oasis Avenue on Monday, after 
months of daily prayers by her grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles. 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler fell into a back yard swimming pool March 17 while her family was 
eating lunch, her uncle, Mohammed Ismail, said. About five minutes later, the 
child's aunt, Shahen Ismail, saw her lying face down in the pool and shouted 
for help. Mariyam's father, Afzal Ismail, then jumped in after his daughter and 
tried to resuscitate her.  
</P>
<P>
 When paramedics arrived, the child still was not breathing and was taken to 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, where she regained a 
pulse but remained in a coma. After about two months in the hospital, family 
members took the comatose child home so that her mother, Salma Ismail, could 
care for her, Mohammed Ismail said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afzal and Salma Ismail have two other young children, Salama and Noman. They 
have since built a fence around the swimming pool, Mohammed Ismail said.THAO

 One of Orange County's most famous crossroads was at Main Street and Chapman

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; A SO-FAR UNEVENTFUL 'BURNING SEASON' STILL 
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The so-called "burning season" -- when cold, dry weather, seasonal Santa Ana 
winds and holiday decorations contribute to an upswing in house fires -- has 
fizzled so far, county authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the period from Thanksgiving through New Year's Day "is shaping up 
as one of our most fire-safe in many years," said Emmy Day, a spokeswoman for 
the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials, whose jurisdiction covers more than 900,000 people in 
18 cities and unincorporated areas, attribute this year's safe result to milder 
temperatures, rain and increased prevention efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, when temperatures drop in late November, firefighters start to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cold outside, and people think, 'Oh, we'll light a fire and snuggle 
around it,' " Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young said. "Well, that's all 
wonderful, but it's also extremely dangerous. If you're not careful, you can 
spark a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 unofficial "burning season" began the week of Thanksgiving, when 
seven house fires broke out in a 24-hour period. Those fires, some of which 
were caused by space heaters and sparks from a fireplace, left one person dead, 
half a dozen people homeless and caused nearly $1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, officials said, there has been a marked drop-off of serious 
house fires. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Christmas trees and holiday lights add to the fire danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Christmas season for the past several years has been marked by both death 
and destruction of property," Day said. In 1991, faulty Christmas tree lights 
sparked a fire in Santa Ana in which a body was so badly burned initially that 
the identity and gender could not be determined; three other family members 
also died as a result of burns, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a child in Costa Mesa playing with matches near a Christmas tree set 
a fire that caused $100,000 in damage and sent the home's owners to the 
hospital with critical injuries. Last year was safer, Day said, with no fire 
deaths reported in the county, although two families in Orange and Huntington 
Beach suffered thousands of dollars in damage to their homes by fires caused by 
faulty tree lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials cautioned, however, that the most dangerous period of the burning 
season is not yet over. 
</P>
<P>
 "With many homes still decorated and many Christmas trees still in place, 
there is still danger and a need for caution," Day said. "Traditionally, the 
worst of the Christmas season fires occur between Dec. 25 and the . . . New 
Year. Many homes still have Christmas trees, but people become more lax about 
watering them at just the time of their maximum dryness. A dry Christmas tree 
can be totally consumed by fire in three seconds." MARK I. PINSKY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; TREE FIRM'S PERMIT EXTENDED ON SPLIT VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A divided City Council has allowed a tree-trimming company that was the target 
of neighborhood complaints to continue to operate for six more months at 9856 
Santiago Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 3-2 vote allows the company's owner, Bobby Gilbert, to continue 
to use the land until next June.Gilbert could ask the city to extend the 
conditional-use permit as soon as April, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen John Frackelton and Barry L. Denes voted against the permit, saying 
that Gilbert's company had caused too many problems, and neighbors had 
complained of odors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an ongoing pattern" of problems, Frackelton said, in explaining why 
he opposed a six-month extension of the tree-trimming company's conditional-use 
permit. Denes similarly said he believed problems would continue if the company 
were granted an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbert told the council he has heeded warnings from the city about 
violations of land use. "I'm here not to cause anyone a problem," Gilbert said. 
"The place (business site) is spotless now. I'm here to work with the city." 
</P>
<P>
 City staff, after an inspection of the tree-trimming company's business site 
last month, said they found an illegal compost pile on the land. "Our 
inspection revealed that more than 100 cubic yards of decaying plant material 
were being stored on the property," City Manager Fred Maley said in a written 
report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, however, told the council that he and his employees had removed the 
offending decaying plant material. "The compost pile is gone, and it will never 
happen again," Gilbert said. BILL BILLITER

 The City Council has approved a 7% salary increase for police lieutenants and 
captains, the first such increase in three years. The increase will take effect 
Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The three captains and seven lieutenants in the Police Department also will 
receive a 4% raise in July to correct what officials called salary inequities 
created by a three-year salary freeze while police sergeants got annual 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week also approved a 2% salary raise for the police chief, 
fire chief, public works director, assistant city manager and other department 
heads, effective Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city employees, including police officers and firefighters, have 
received salary hikes this year under the terms of their contracts reached with 
the city last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel Services Director Steven Larson said that the salary increases for 
the police captains and lieutenants will cost the city about $91,000 and that 
the 2% raise for department heads will cost $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises have been allocated in both the $43.1-million 1994-95 general fund 
budget and the budget for the next fiscal year, Larson said.BERT ELJERA

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PALLETS RECYCLED IN NEW CSUN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Cal State Northridge student recycling program has added an innovative twist 
in its efforts to avoid creating garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Associated Students Recycling Program, damaged wood pallets are 
being recycled and used to receive food items, books and supplies delivered to 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
 The pallets provide a platform on which handlers can stack materials for 
delivery to university warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pico Rivera recycling company pays the Associated Students at least 60 cents 
per damaged pallet. The company then fixes the pallets and sells them for 
reuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the concept is not exactly a new one (similar programs have existed 
among major airlines for years), the CSUN program represents an idea in 
recycling that never gets old, said Joan Edwards, director of the Los Angeles 
City Integrated Solid Waste Management Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards and her office helped the CSUN students set up their program. 
</P>
<P>
 With 11% of Los Angeles-area landfill material consisting of some kind of 
wood, Edwards' office has asked major waste producers such as CSUN to 
incorporate programs reducing the volume of wood items found in their trash 
bins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first concern is, simply, to try to not make garbage," Edwards said. 
"People should reuse an item until all of its uses have been eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 "The larger facilities can generally recycle at no net cost," Edwards said. 
"They can also find themselves able to save on waste-hauling fees because, 
suddenly, they no longer need haulers to take away so many trash bins." 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Edwards said, companies with effective programs can get recycling 
companies to pick up for free what once was considered trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as in the case of CSUN, recycling programs can earn a profit. With an 
annual budget of about $10,000 for recycling efforts and education, the 
Associated Students collected more than $300 from the new program during its 
first month of operation.  
</P>
<P>
 "The money we gain will go toward educating students on the importance of 
recycling," recycling coordinator Cyndi Signett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the challenge in running a program on this campus has to do with the 
fact that we are dispersed through such a large area. It takes effort to run 
it, and we don't always have the people to collect from the bins we have placed 
in every (university) office." 
</P>
<P>
 With all the construction stemming from the school's earthquake recovery 
efforts, the new program may not have much of an impact on the overall amount 
of waste coming out of CSUN. But Edwards said that its intention is laudable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to the program," she said, "is that the school is focusing on reusing 
items, which means that it will take that much longer for them to reach the 
landfills." ANTONIO OLIVO

 If you get a phone call from the Oxnard police asking for money, it's a fraud, 
Oxnard police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Len Newcomb said the department has recently received several 
reports from residents saying they have been called by people soliciting 
donations for the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomb said the Oxnard Police Department does not engage in such phone 
solicitations. He said people should give only to recognized, legitimate 
organizations, and take the time to check out charities by asking for a name 
and call-back number before giving out any information or pledging any money 
over the phone. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICIAL TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District's assistant superintendent for business 
-- one of three top administrators in the sprawling district -- has announced 
his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Brown, 60, will officially step down Friday from his job overseeing 
finances, building maintenance and bus transportation for the 12,500-student 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Supt. Bill Studt and Gary Davis, assistant superintendent for 
educational services, Brown is among the district's leading staff members. His 
annual salary is $78,927. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's deputy, Assistant Business Manager Richard Canady, will take over the 
top job in business services for at least the rest of this school year, Studt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who is on vacation, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Studt said Brown decided earlier this year to retire after he turned 60, 
which qualifies him for his pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's old enough," Studt said. "He put in his years." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to becoming the Oxnard district's assistant superintendent seven years 
ago, Brown worked 13 years in business services for school districts in 
Monterey, Santa Barbara and Tulare counties. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; RECALL LEADER TO AID EFFORT IN CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Murphy, leader of a group trying to recall the five-member Agoura 
Hills City Council, plans to volunteer time to help a group of Cypress 
residents launch a recall against the Cypress City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should all help each other to get the message across, because they won't 
get the message otherwise," Murphy said. Her group, Citizens Against New Local 
Taxes, launched its recall movement in the summer after the Agoura Hills City 
Council voted to levy a 4% utility tax on residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Pepper, leader of the fledgling recall movement in Cypress, said he has 
talked by telephone with Murphy, who is considered knowledgeable about recent 
changes in recall laws. He called Murphy, he said, at the urging of Tom 
Babcock, a Fullerton resident who led a successful recall effort in that city 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbara is an extremely hard worker under a very difficult situation," said 
Babcock, who said he advised Murphy as she was launching the Agoura Hills 
recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's had attacks on her house, bricks thrown through sliding-glass doors," 
Babcock added. "Under some very nasty circumstances, they were successful with 
the petition drive and I give Barbara 100% of the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper said his group wants to recall three council members who voted to 
approve a 24-hour trucking warehouse, an operation he says will be disruptive 
to nearby residential neighborhoods. Now, the council -- despite a lawsuit by 
residents to block the warehouse -- wants to approve another trucking facility 
in the area, according to Pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Pavley, one of the five Agoura Hills council members targeted, said 
Tuesday that she finds it "interesting" that Murphy would concern herself with 
the affairs of another, distant city. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is she doing in Cypress?" Pavley said. "I find it ironic that someone 
who is supposed to be so concerned about (local) taxes would be involved in an 
effort that has no relationship to the well-being of the city of Agoura Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley and other council members maintain that the recall effort is being 
financed by local business people angry at the council for its support of an 
ordinance banning freeway signs, a charge the recall group denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Petitions containing the signatures for the Agoura Hills recall are still 
being validated by the office of the Los Angeles County 
clerk/registrar-recorder, according to city officials. The process is expected 
to be complete within two weeks. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CURBSIDE QUAKE DEBRIS PICKUP IS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's free curbside quake debris cleanup program will be extended six 
months, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The service was set to expire Jan. 17 -- the quake's one-year anniversary -- 
but the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state's Office of Emergency 
Services have agreed to provide the necessary funding through July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the program has hauled away about 2 million tons of fractured wood, 
concrete and other debris at a cost of about $149 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's plenty more on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen a slackening in the amount hitting the streets," said Jim 
Doty, assistant head of the city's Earthquake Recovery Division. "We get a lot 
of calls from people who can now do actual work on their property." 
</P>
<P>
 Doty said the city spends about $500,000 a day on demolition and debris 
removal. FEMA picks up 90% of the bill, the state 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Edmonston, a FEMA spokesman in Pasadena, said it's no surprise that the 
city requested additional time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We experienced a similar thing with Hurricane Andrew," Edmonston said. "This 
is a very widespread disaster and there's a lot of hidden damage that becomes 
more and more evident as people rebuild their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Though FEMA has agreed, in principle, to give the funds, the city isn't taking 
any chances. Deidre Reyes, a senior administrative analyst, said the city will 
submit a written request to the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of concern over FEMA's potential money shortage, Reyes said, "We want 
to assure the funds are obligated through July 17." 
</P>
<P>
 Barring any funding problems, Reyes said the deadline for people to call for 
pickup will be sometime in June. That will give the city enough time to pick up 
the remaining debris before July 17, Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll free telephone number to request debris pickup is (800) 498-CITY.

 Simi Valley police are searching for a man who they believe was responsible 
for two robberies that occurred within an hour of each other Tuesday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first robbery occurred about 1:40 p.m. at the Mail Depot store, 2760 Tapo 
Canyon Road.The robber, armed with a handgun, escaped with an undetermined 
amount of cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second robbery took place shortly after 2 p.m. at Popeye's Famous Fried 
Chicken & Biscuits restaurant, 1883 Erringer Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same description, the same method of operation, and it happened 
about the same time," Sgt. Mike King said. He added that police believe the 
same person was responsible for both crimes but had no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Police chased one suspect after the first robbery but determined he was not 
involved in the crime. 
</P>
<P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: CONEJO VALLEY; HOME SALES RISE 14% IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Home sales in the Conejo Valley during November rose by 14% from last year, 
and condominium sales also increased substantially, according to figures 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local realtors said the increase shows that the Thousand Oaks area is 
recovering from the recent recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it shows an ongoing trend toward economic good times as far as the 
real estate market is concerned," said Gene Baird, president of the Conejo 
Valley Assn. of Realtors, which compiled the statistics. "It makes us 
optimistic about 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Baird said the market has recently been dominated by young first-time buyers 
taking advantage of low interest rates, with 200 homes and 59 condominiums sold 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 He said these buyers helped bring down the median sales price for a 
single-family home, which dropped from $268,901 in November, 1993, to $263,363 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Baird said he expects to see home sales continue to rise, as has occurred for 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, realtors sold 175 single-family homes and 35 condominiums 
in the Conejo Valley, the report said. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; QUARTERLY SALES TAX REVENUES DOWN 9.5% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign that the city's economy continues to lag, Calabasas' second-quarter 
sales tax revenues were down 9.5% from the same period in 1993, prompting 
renewed calls for a more diversified tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials also were hoping that things may be improving, if only 
slightly. In the first quarter of this year, according to city records, sales 
tax revenues were down 13.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials blame this year's lagging revenues on the Jan. 17 earthquake 
and on slow sales at the city's auto dealerships, which make up about 30% of 
all revenues collected. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, Lockheed Corp. earlier this year announced it was 
moving its corporate headquarters, which will mean $400,000 in lost sales tax 
revenues, said City Manager Charles Cate. Lockheed also pays about $20,000 
annually in utility taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation troubles city officials, who note that sales tax revenues 
increased 2.9% in the last quarter of 1993. The dealerships' woes demonstrates 
the need to diversify, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our top nine or 10 business in the city provide 55 to 60% of the sales tax, 
and that's not healthy," City Councilman Bob Hill said. "We still need to look 
at spreading it around a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hill, the move of Ralphs supermarket into the yet-to-be-built 
Calabasas Park Centre project will help bring in more sales taxes. A movie 
theater to be built there will also spur economic growth, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The large-scale office and retail project, which recently received approval 
from the City Council, has divided supporters and critics, who say the project 
is too big. Council members cited the project's potential economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ted Rosenquist, a member of Save Our City, an organization formed to block 
the project, disputed the notion that the project will significantly add to 
sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The added wear and tear to streets from increased traffic, along with the cost 
of providing police, will offset any increased sales tax revenues, he said. 
Also, theaters generate little in sales taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking taxes from popcorn sales," Rosenquist said. "And you would 
have to generate a lot of popcorn sales to bring in any money." FRANK MANNING

JURY DECIDES MAN WHO SUFFOCATED HIS MOTHER IS INSANE; VERDICT: CLIFFORD L. 
BURGESS WILL BE COMMITTED TO PATTON STATE HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT, RATHER THAN 
PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A San Clemente man who contended he killed his mother so she would not be left 
alone in what he considered to be a deteriorating world was insane at the time 
of the crime, an Orange County Superior Court jury decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The same jury found Clifford L. Burgess guilty of first-degree murder earlier 
this month in the 1992 suffocation of his 76-year-old mother, Mary Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
 With the jury's finding that he was insane when he killed his mother, Burgess, 
45, will be committed to Patton State Hospital for treatment, rather than 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Jack M. Earley said his client, who appeared disheveled but 
calm in court, is still depressed and will likely spend many years in therapy 
at the hospital. State law requires that a defendant found insane by a jury be 
held in a state hospital until he or she is deemed recovered by hospital and 
court officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad story all around," Earley said. "It's obvious he loved his mother 
and cared for her all his life." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the evidence supported a finding that he was sane, but I respect the 
jury's finding," Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Kirkwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 After killing his mother on Sept. 6, 1992, Burgess slashed his wrists, Earley 
said. Police quickly arrested Burgess but released him the next day for lack of 
evidence pending results of key blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the death and his second arrest 18 months later, Burgess was in and 
out of mental hospitals four times and has been found to have a major 
depressive disorder, including bouts of paranoia, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, who had held various jobs, ranging from an office manager to a chef 
on a boat, experienced tragedy in his family from an early age, Earley said. 
His grandfather killed himself, and as a young teen-ager he found the body of 
his brother, who had also apparently committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess had lost his job and was increasingly depressed and despondent shortly 
before killing his mother, even stashing 40 pounds of dimes under the kitchen 
sink in the belief that the world was falling apart, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't get himself out," Earley said. "Things got worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing will be held Feb. 3 before Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore to 
review Burgess's placement in the state hospital system.

SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS SOUGHT IN BEATING OF TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were seeking four to five suspected gang members who severely beat a 
14-year-old La Palma boy Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who was not identified, was in serious condition with head injuries 
at UCI Medical Center in Orange after being kicked and beaten with fists and 
bottles near Windsong Avenue and Bellhaven Street, said Sgt. Jeff Kirkpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found the boy unconscious and convulsing on the sidewalk shortly before 
4 p.m., Kirkpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects -- described by police only as teen-age Asian boys -- fled in a 
light blue Honda Civic, Kirkpatrick said. He said they shouted the name of a 
gang based in Buena Park and Cerritos as they beat the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on the beating was asked to call police at (714) 
523-4552.

$6,500 IN DONATIONS FOR FAMILY OF SLAIN OFFICER STOLEN FROM CAR; THEFT: 
BRIEFCASE WITH MONEY FROM FUND-RAISER IS TAKEN FROM UNION PRESIDENT'S VEHICLE. 
IT WAS PARKED AT THE HALL OF ADMINISTRATION WHILE HE RAN AN ERRAND THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A thief who broke into a car parked Christmas Eve at the Hall of 
Administration lot made off with about $6,500 that had just been donated to the 
family of slain Los Angeles County Safety Police Officer Thomas B. Worley, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, raised at a dinner dance the night before, was in a briefcase 
belonging to Clifton Williams, president of the 400-member Safety Police Assn., 
who had stopped at the county office building Saturday afternoon to run an 
errand. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later, he came back to his car in the lot under the building 
to find a window shattered and the briefcase gone. "It kind of sets us back and 
it hurts," Williams said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, 33, was shot last Wednesday in the crowded parking lot of a Canoga 
Park strip mall after confronting Jesus Valenzuela, 44, who witnesses said had 
just held up a discount shoe store in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 After Worley identified himself as a police officer, investigators said, 
Valenzuela shot at him. Worley returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, who was off duty and not wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the 
chest and groin and died about 90 minutes later. Valenzuela, an ex-convict with 
three prior robbery convictions, was hit in the liver and died within the hour 
from internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, friends and family held a dance to raise funds for Worley's wife, 
Pam, 29, and two children, Christina, 6, and Matthew, 2, Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 The event netted $3,600 in savings bonds, some $2,000 in checks and at least 
$900 in cash, Williams said. The cash estimate, he said, was low because "a lot 
of those envelopes hadn't even been opened yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the union chief said, he stopped at the county building about 
3:45 p.m. to drop off a set of keys. He returned to his 1990 Ford Mustang to 
discover his briefcase -- with the cash, checks and bonds inside -- gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Also stolen were a pager and a cellular phone, said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Connie Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives have no leads, Gordon said. Police know only that the thief -- or 
thieves -- used the porcelain chip from an auto spark plug to shatter the 
window because the chip was found inside the car, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spark-plug chip is an increasingly popular tool for auto thieves because 
it will fracture a window but make little noise and often not even disturb a 
car alarm, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These low-down no-goodniks, they break into his car and to top it off, they 
take the money for the officer's wife and the kids -- they have no regard for 
this family or those kids," Gordon said. "These are rank opportunists. Or at 
least one opportunist." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrangements for Worley's funeral and burial, meanwhile, were announced 
Monday. Services will be held Thursday morning at First United Methodist Church 
of Santa Monica. Burial will follow at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth.

SIMI PARENTS GROUP BATTLES DISTRICT OVER SEX EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About a dozen conservative Simi Valley parents, frustrated by their school 
board's stance on birth control education, formed a grass-roots group last 
winter to fight the inclusion of such information in sex education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that fledgling group, known as Citizens for Truth in Education -- or CTE 
-- has grown into a highly vocal organization that boasts a mailing list of 
more than 800 people, members say. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's emergence has led critics and supporters to a common conclusion: 
CTE has the ear of Simi Valley school leaders and is defining itself as an 
education watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new year approaches, organizers of the group are moving full steam 
ahead with their own agenda, which some people believe should be closely 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think any time they get the ear of somebody -- and they have the ear of the 
board -- you have to realize they are a force to be reckoned with," said Paige 
Moser, coordinator of the local chapter of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 In just one year, the group has tried to thwart the Simi Valley Unified School 
District board's attempts to approve a new birth control curriculum and fought 
to defeat the California Learning Assessment System exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Two founding members -- Walt Madrid and Glenn Woodbury -- ran for school board 
seats in the November election. Both lost, but not without garnering support 
from like-minded voters who embraced their views on sex education, uniforms and 
school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the school board is more cautious now that there is a group of 
concerned parents watching them carefully," said Matt Noah, a former U. S. 
Senate candidate who ran under the Christian Pro-Life Party and is a founding 
member of Citizens for Truth in Education. Noah has since split from the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that they are a force in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But organizers say that was not their intent. They simply want to express the 
concerns of parents and have elected officials listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are truly seeking truth. We are trying to figure out what is best for our 
kids to be taught," CTE Chairwoman Coleen Ary said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the group's goals is to research and investigate educational issues, 
which are detailed in a monthly four-page newsletter. Members consistently 
attend school board meetings and usually address the board on one or more 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 They have pushed for a sex education curriculum that teaches only abstinence 
and a return to rigorous academic standards. Novel teaching methods that 
promote critical thinking are "feel-good mumbo-jumbo" that does not belong in 
the classroom, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's strong advocacy of abstinence-only birth control education has 
attracted the attention of People for the American Way, a self-appointed 
watchdog of the Christian right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know of CTE," said Jean M. Hessburg, state director of People for the 
American Way. "Their views and positions are certainly aligned with the views 
and positions that national religious right groups hold." 
</P>
<P>
 While some conservative activists in Simi Valley balk at such terms, Ary said 
sometimes her group does line up behind positions held by religious right 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that some of that would be true," she said. "It is certainly true 
with sex education and the CLAS test. That might not be true of school prayer 
or creationism. It depends on what the issue is." 
</P>
<P>
 The first and most controversial issue Citizens for Truth in Education tackled 
was sex education. The issue erupted in April, 1993, when a school trustee 
questioned the absence of pregnancy prevention information during a review of 
the district's curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, Debbie Sandland said, 'Where in this curriculum do we teach 
kids about birth control?' And the fact of the matter was, we were not," said 
Leslie Crunelle, director of secondary education for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex education is not required in California. But if school districts elect to 
include it in their curricula, state educators recommend teaching students how 
to protect themselves against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, 
state Department of Education officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the school board's direction, a committee made up of school officials, 
parents and students was formed to develop guidelines for a revised sex 
education or "family life" curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommended that seventh-graders learn about some methods of 
pregnancy prevention, such as birth control pills and condoms, and that 
10th-grade students learn all methods of birth control. The committee also 
suggested expanding lessons on abstinence and refusal skills. 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee's recommendations triggered a volatile debate in Simi 
Valley. CTE members cited studies saying that providing birth control 
information increases teen-age sexual activity, while students asserted that 
the information was vital in protecting teen-agers against disease and 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the school board approved the recommendations and, four months 
later, a committee of teachers and nurses set out to find materials that would 
meet those guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, the committee has been unable to get those materials approved. A 
proposed curriculum was presented in October, but some trustees found portions 
of the materials inappropriate, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the materials were never formally presented for board approval, 
members of CTE reviewed the texts and assailed trustees for letting teachers 
and nurses stray from the guidelines, they said.

 At an Oct. 18 board meeting, parent Kathy Burke singled out sections in the 
proposed curriculum that mentioned homosexuality, masturbation and oral sex, 
and scolded the trustees for allowing such information to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never discussed alternative lifestyles," Glenn Woodbury told the board 
that night. "I don't want my boy being taught this." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the materials a "travesty," Ary told trustees: "Children will be left 
to their own designs to determine right and wrong for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees received new materials before Christmas break this month, and said 
they planned to thoroughly scour the revised texts. Once the materials are 
presented to the public, CTE members said they plan to scour them too. 
</P>
<P>
 "They created one huge mess when they created these recommendations," Ary 
said. "With sex education, we make no bones about it. . . . The choice that 
they should make is abstinence." 
</P>
<P>
 That position disturbs some board members and community activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "As educators, I feel we need to come in with non-biased information about 
birth control," Trustee Carla Kurachi said. "State the facts, state the risks, 
state the side effects -- that's it. . . . I don't think telling students what 
choices they should make is going to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say CTE's efforts are a threat to education, which could hinder 
attempts at educational reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like what they stand for, which is a fear of knowledge," NOW's Moser 
said. "Across the nation, we are seeing people either out of ignorance or out 
of fear embracing reactionary concepts." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's rigid stance on such issues as sex education alienates some 
people, Kurachi said, which could keep CTE from establishing a significant 
toehold in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a watchdog for their own issues," Kurachi said. "If they are not 
willing to reach a middle ground, if it has to be an all or nothing, then they 
are going to lose the ear of the board." 
</P>
<P>
 But until parents are satisfied that school officials are responding to their 
concerns, Ary said, Citizens for Truth in Education will continue its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never going to be over if the people of Simi Valley don't feel that the 
schools are teaching the best way for their kids," she said.

THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THE SQUEAMISH IN WESTLAKE HIGH'S ANATOMY CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Carefully inserting a thin metal pin into an abdominal muscle, 17-year-old 
Ellie Novin-Baheran started labeling: External oblique. Umbilicus. Pectoralis 
major. Serratus anterior.  
</P>
<P>
 Her assignment: identify and tag muscles on a human cadaver. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellie is one of 24 students in Westlake High School's acclaimed advanced 
anatomy class, a course in which students study and dissect human bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after gross anatomy classes in medical school, the course is highly 
demanding of students' time -- and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Students pay a $90 lab fee and, despite donations from the medical community, 
must raise about $1,200 each year to support the program's $6,000 budget. Where 
do they get the money to buy four $650 cadavers? 
</P>
<P>
 Bagel and candy sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it's a very expensive textbook," Ellie said of her cadaver, which she 
shares with five other students. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to student efforts, Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park and 
Mortuary in Westlake Village gave Westlake High four body bags and will cremate 
the corpses at no cost. Their ashes will be scattered off the coast of Ventura. 
And Westlake Medical Center donated $1,000 to the program this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anand Patel, 17, a student in the so-called "cadaver class," doesn't mind 
raising funds to keep the program afloat. "It's worth it," he said. "I mean, 
how many high school students get to dissect a human body?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not many, says teacher Nancy Bowman, who created the unique class five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a real rarity," Bowman said. "We are the only school in the nation to 
have a second-year program in advanced anatomy. Nobody else is teaching a 
program modeled after a gross anatomy course in medical school." 
</P>
<P>
 A few Ventura County high schools -- such as Simi Valley, Oak Park and now 
Newbury Park High -- offer courses in which students work briefly with 
cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westlake High's course is the only one in which students dissect cadavers 
every day for an entire school year, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I foresaw was a second-year program where students would do all the work 
and learn the body as they would in medical school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, all of them seniors, are required to take a year of chemistry 
and physiology before advanced anatomy. Bowman handpicks the students, who must 
endure a competitive application process. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, about 35 applicants vied for 20 positions. Bowman later accepted 
an additional four students. "You might say these are the cream of the crop," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those elite few enrolled in class say they love it and are thankful for the 
opportunities that the course offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can actually say there is no other class that has been as exciting as 
this," said Joshua Hess, 17. "It's a college on a high school campus." 
</P>
<P>
 The program started as an independent study class. Three years ago, it evolved 
into an advanced course with a formal curriculum. The program has grown from 
four students working on one cadaver to 24 students working on four cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Donning green smocks and white latex surgical gloves in a recent class, the 
students slowly rolled four porcelain gurneys into the center of the classroom 
and unzipped the thick, blue body bags that protect their cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake High purchased the bodies for about $650 each from UC San Diego 
Medical School's Body Donation Program with money raised through candy sales, 
donations and class fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCSD program supplies cadavers to about five schools in Southern 
California, medical school officials said. About 250 people donate their bodies 
each year. "These people consciously and willingly make that decision," Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of each school year, Bowman talks to students about how to 
approach the cadavers. "I do have to address the issue and how different people 
deal with it," she said. "You have to have a mature outlook on death." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellie said she has distanced herself from her male cadaver, identity unknown, 
which the students have nicknamed "Gus." 
</P>
<P>
 "I refer to it as an 'it' -- not 'him' -- because it doesn't bother you as 
much when you dissect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students in the class plan to attend major universities in the fall and 
eventually want to go to medical school. Studying human cadavers in high school 
will help them meet those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have an edge on everybody else," said Brooke Shirey, 17, who aspires to 
be a cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be more confident because we've had this," said Andy Pan, 17. "When 
we're in premed and people are going, 'Ick,' we'll be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman's students are gearing up for med school in other ways, too. During a 
field trip to the UCLA School of Medicine last year, the students viewed a 
80-question test taken by first-year medical students. 
</P>
<P>
 The students have also welcomed guest speakers who discussed how to enter the 
medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dennis N. Sakai, a Thousand Oaks orthopedic surgeon, visited in October. 
Although he had reservations about a cadaver class in high school, Sakai said 
he was impressed with the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had misgivings because I was afraid the kids wouldn't be mature enough to 
dissect a human cadaver," Sakai said. "But the kids are very serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has always been a fear of not taking the human body seriously. That 
hasn't been a problem in Westlake." 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Unified School District officials had reservations at first, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with Nancy and (Principal) Curt Luft from the very beginning, and 
we spoke on issues of human dignity and security," said Assistant Supt. Richard 
Simpson, adding that the program has been well-supported by the community. "I 
have not had a single negative phone call."

RESIDENTS THANKED FOR LIBRARY FUNDING; MOORPARK: SUPERVISOR AT CEREMONY 
RECOGNIZES COMMUNITY LEADERS FOR RAISING $86,000 TOWARD THE EXPANSION PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 County leaders credited devoted Moorpark residents for sparking the first 
growth in Ventura County's library system in five years at a Tuesday ceremony 
hailing the coming expansion of the Moorpark Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard unveiled a plaque and thanked local business and 
community leaders for raising $86,000 toward the construction that will expand 
the tiny library by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be sure that everyone who has contributed to this project would 
be recognized," Howard said. "It has been wonderful to see the community and 
local businesses come together as they have here." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said funding the library expansion was one of her final goals before 
leaving office at the end of the year. Earlier this year, she helped organize 
the Moorpark telethon that raised $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and businesses contributed another $51,000 to fund the project, 
which will expand the 5,000-square-foot building to 8,300 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be recognized," said Eduardo Cerda, employee of a Moorpark-based 
pharmaceutical company that donated $5,000 to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of these businesses have been in this community for a long time 
and feel indebted to the people here," Cerda said. "The people of Moorpark have 
been good to us, so we wanted to give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Three-fourths of the $421,000 project will be covered by city and county 
money, with the rest coming from private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The county-run library has been forced to rely more heavily on donations from 
cities and residents in recent years as state tax cuts have shrunk budgets and 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the contributions, the project faces a few remaining hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said Tuesday that the project is still $10,000 shy of the funding 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Library boosters said they were confident that they could raise the remaining 
money in time to get the project off the ground early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the money is in the bank, county library officials said they will 
accept bids for the project. The expansion is scheduled to be finished in six 
months, said Barbara Loczi, Howard's administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 As for finding books to add to the library's 33,000 titles, Library Services 
Director Dixie Adeniran said new shelves will be filled with books acquired 
through private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid we don't have the funds to increase our stock of books," Adeniran 
said. "But even with its current collection, this library needed some 
additional room to breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 Parking problems and cramped conditions inside the small library have been a 
constant concern of area residents, according to Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why this has been such a priority," Lawrason said. "And we have been 
thrilled with the support we've gotten from everyone to make this happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Adeniran credited Howard's persistence and wide community support for pushing 
the project through a mire of red tape and budget constraints. She said it is 
the county's first new library project since the 1989 completion of a facility 
in Port Hueneme, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that people in Moorpark have been wanting for a long time," 
she said. "It's great to see them come out and raise the money, especially at a 
time when money is tight."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; NOT A TIME TO WASTE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anaheim City Council cannot afford the estimated $100,000 cost of a 
special election to fill an open council seat. The four council members should 
pick someone to fill the vacancy, created by a City Charter revision that 
lengthened the mayor's term and rearranged council positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week a group of concerned residents urged the council to pick Shirley 
McCracken. She finished third in the Nov. 8 election, in which the top two 
finishers in an at-large election won. Choosing her would be logical. However, 
there is nothing to prevent council members from considering other nominees as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents and one council member called for a special election. But that 
would mean operating with only four members, and inviting 2-2 deadlocks, until 
June. Anyone elected then would serve for only a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best of times, Anaheim would be advised to think several times about 
shelling out $100,000. In these times, when the city could lose more than $40 
million from the investment pool that plunged Orange County into bankruptcy, 
spending the extra money would be ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 If council members do not fill the seat by Jan. 29, a special election must be 
held. They should remember they were elected to represent the city's residents, 
and that includes taking action in an extraordinary situation like this one. 
They were not put in office to avoid responsibility and waste money.

RESIDENTS PROTEST MALATHION SPRAYING; VENTURA COUNTY: ARMED WITH SIGNS AND 
SONGS, ABOUT 30 PEOPLE VOICE HEALTH CONCERNS OVER AERIAL APPLICATIONS IN 
CAMARILLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 30 adults and children gathered outside Ventura County's public health 
office Tuesday to protest continuing applications of the pesticide malathion in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as helicopters were being readied for a sixth aerial spraying Tuesday 
night, the protesters carried signs and sang songs voicing concerns over the 
safety of the aerial applications that began nearly three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal agricultural and health officials have ignored significant 
medical research showing that malathion can have detrimental effects on humans, 
protest organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Gaishin, a Camarillo mother who helped organize the protest, suggested 
that the pesticide may cause further harm to youngsters in the spray zone who 
have leukemia or other cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to a Yale University study, malathion has been shown to cause 
leukemia," said Gaishin, gesturing toward stacks of literature about malathion 
that protesters brought to the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 She said residents should be warned of any possible health danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is not adequately warning people about the risks of malathion," 
Gaishin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, who belong to a loose-knit organization called Group Against 
Spraying People, said they targeted Dr. Gary Feldman, Ventura County public 
health officer, because he is charged with warning residents about possible 
health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman met with seven of the protesters at 1:30 p.m., about 2 1/2 hours after 
the demonstration began outside his office on Loma Vista Road in Ventura. The 
meeting lasted two hours, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the GASP members failed to convince Feldman that aerial applications 
of malathion are dangerous, he did agree to review additional information about 
possible toxic effects of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the risks are quite minimal," Feldman said. "But there is a lot that 
is not known about malathion, particularly its long-term effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Several protesters brought their children, who carried signs with such slogans 
as "Gov. Wilson, why are you spraying poison on children?" 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Fraley, who moved her family from the spray zone shortly after aerial 
applications began, said she decided to bring her 9-year-old daughter and 
2-year-old son to the protest as a civics lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter is learning about her civil rights right now," Fraley said as she 
planted more posters in a grassy area outside the public health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters said their goal is to broaden public awareness about the 
dangers of malathion and stop aerial spraying of the pesticide over Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Five applications of malathion have been sprayed over a 16-square-mile Medfly 
eradication zone in east Camarillo since the first fruit fly was found there 
Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth aerial spaying started as scheduled Tuesday night, said Larry 
Hawkins, spokesman for the state Cooperative Medfly Project. Residents in the 
spray zone can expect up to six more applications before the program is 
completed, he said.FRUIT FLIES

2 MEN CONVICTED IN EXECUTION MURDERS OF 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were convicted of first-degree murder Tuesday in 1992 double 
execution-style slayings that prosecutors say were motivated by a plan to steal 
guns and marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury deliberated more than two days before 
finding Ralph Ervin Dennis and Marcus Edward Marsh, both 24, each guilty of two 
counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances that mandate life in 
prison without the possibility of parole.They will be sentenced Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Patrick H. Donahue contended that Dennis and Marsh executed Robert 
Klecker, 40, and Karen Stevens, 30, on the morning of Nov. 17, 1992, during a 
robbery and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Klecker was shot twice in the face, while Stevens died of a bullet wound to 
the back of her head, Donahue said. The locked door to their Garden Grove home 
had been smashed open, and it appeared as if a pillow had been used to try and 
muffle the sounds of the gunshots against Klecker's head, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 About two weeks after the killings, authorities said they connected Dennis to 
attempts to sell two of Klecker's stolen handguns in Hanford, Calif. The trial 
also included testimony from a woman who said she heard the defendants talking 
about a robbery before and after it happened, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the defendants could not be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis, who had no permanent address, was arrested in January in San Diego. 
Marsh, was extradited from Texas in April after completing jail time for an 
unrelated crime. 
</P>
<P>
 An arrest warrant remains for a third suspect who is believed to have fled the 
country.

UTAH OVERCOMES ARIZONA'S DEFENSE; FREEDOM BOWL: UTE QUARTERBACK MIKE MCCOY 
THROWS FOURTH-DOWN, FOURTH- QUARTER TOUCHDOWN PASS IN 16-13 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Body-slammed, badgered and about to be beaten, Utah quarterback Mike McCoy 
scrambled and threw the football where he hoped a teammate might catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumped to the Anaheim Stadium turf by Arizona nose guard Chuck Osborne, McCoy 
heard the crowd roar and wondered whether that meant good news or bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, he sat up and saw Utah wide receiver Kevin Dyson sprinting through 
the back of the end zone, cradling the football. 
</P>
<P>
 With that improbable fourth-down, fourth-quarter pass and catch, Utah rallied 
for a 16-13 Freedom Bowl victory over Arizona before 27,477 Tuesday at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Utah needed two five-yard scoring drives and a safety to sneak 
past one of the nation's best defenses. The Utes almost didn't get the second 
one, but McCoy, who had been having an awful time handling the Wildcat defense, 
pulled out a five-yard desperation heave to Dyson with 3:34 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Beck's 72-yard kickoff return after Arizona punter Matt Peyton stepped out 
of the end zone for a safety set up the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know which side was cheering," said McCoy, pressured into a 
season-low 69 yards passing. "I knew (Dyson) was in the flat and I saw that he 
went behind his guy. My guy kind of came up on me." 
</P>
<P>
 And that left Dyson standing alone with the ball fluttering toward him and the 
game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all happened real slow," said Dyson, a redshirt freshman who caught only 
one other pass Tuesday. "All I saw was the football and I knew I had to catch 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory enabled Utah to post a school-record 10th victory and the No. 
14-ranked Utes probably will move up when the final poll is announced next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Arizona, Sports Illustrated's preseason pick as the top-ranked team and 
a consensus favorite to win the Pacific 10 Conference, finished 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give Utah credit," Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. "They did a great job. I 
thought we did a lot of good things, but obviously not enough. This is not the 
time to pick out things that didn't go right for us, though." 
</P>
<P>
 This was a game Arizona's renowned defense dominated, with Osborne and 
defensive end Tedy Bruschi hounding McCoy at every turn. McCoy, a senior who 
started his career playing for George Allen at Long Beach State, went into the 
game with 3,035 yards passing and 28 touchdowns, but the Wildcats gave him 
little chance to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
 They sacked him six times -- Bruschi got him three times and Osborne twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's defense against the run, second-best in the nation by giving up an 
average of 65 yards per game, stuffed the Ute ground game. Entering the fourth 
quarter, Utah had a grand total of five yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real surprised that Arizona dominated on the front lines," Utah Coach 
Ron McBride said. "Our (offensive linemen) are a lot better than they 
demonstrated today." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona could have, should have put Utah away in the second half, but managed 
two field goals by Steve McLaughlin in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats were inside the Utah 30-yard line twice, but one drive stalled 
and McLaughlin kicked a 44-yard field goal. On their next possession, the 
Wildcats drove to the two, but two dropped passes brought McLaughlin into the 
game for a 20-yard field goal with 8:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
 First, quarterback Dan White had Tim Thomas alone for a sure touchdown on 
first and goal. Then, White found wideout Lamar Lovett uncovered on third and 
goal from the three. The ball hit Lovett smack in the No. 7 on his chest and 
bounced to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 After the safety, Tomey opted to have McLaughlin kick off rather than have 
Peyton punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, who came close to breaking long runs earlier in the game, fielded the 
ball at the 23, made a swift cut through the Arizona coverage team, then 
sprinted up the left sideline. Shawn Parnell made a touchdown-saving tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole season came down to this one play, 138 days of blood sweat and 
tears came down to one play," Beck said. "I had faith that Mike would come 
through and he did." 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy was confident, but after three plays gained zero yards, he scrambled for 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin Dyson made a great play," McCoy said. "I was kind of hoping, just 
hoping he would catch it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Utes were lucky to be tied, 7-7, by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Their potent offense was left in a shambles by a relentless Wildcat pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah couldn't run either, but that figured. Arizona had shut down better 
rushing attacks than Utah's. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the half, Utah had more punts, six, than completed passes, five. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah had a mere 27 yards to Arizona's 146. By game's end, Arizona had 
outgained Utah, 184-75. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utes' best production came from punter Jason Jones, who averaged 42 yards 
on his six punts. 
</P>
<P>
 White provided the break Utah needed by fumbling on a quarterback sneak from 
his own one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's Ernest Boyd recovered at the five and, after a screen pass lost a yard, 
tailback Charlie Brown broke a tackle, then slipped into the end zone with 
10:03 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats took a 7-0 lead thanks to a goal-line steal by tailback Ontiwaun 
Carter with 1:57 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter ripped the ball out of the hands of Utah defensive back Edwin Garrette 
for Arizona's first touchdown, a 23-yard pass from White. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrette outjumped Carter at the goal line, had the ball in his hands, but 
when he fell backward into the end zone, Carter yanked the ball away for a 
touchdown.

JOE PATERNO; NO PLAYOFF? TRY ROSES; A TITLE GAME IS PREFERABLE, BUT COACH WILL 
TAKE PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Paterno has taken Penn State football teams to 24 bowl games, and has won 
15, but No. 25, the Rose Bowl game Monday against Oregon, might be the crown 
jewel. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be because of the game's national championship implications, what 
with No. 2 Penn State hoping to be more impressive than No. 1 Nebraska in its 
Orange Bowl game Sunday night against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be because a victory over 12th-ranked Oregon (9-3) would give Paterno 
his fifth undefeated and untied team at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be because this is Penn State's first opportunity to carry the Big 
Ten's banner into the annual New Year's joust with the Pac-10 champion. 
</P>
<P>
 And it won't be because Paterno, who turned 68 last Wednesday, might not be 
around to coach many more bowl teams. 
</P>
<P>
 It is because it is the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, I talked with 20, maybe 25, coaches who had been to different 
bowl games and to a man they told me that nothing compared with the Rose Bowl 
experience," Paterno said. "Now that I'm here, I believe them. Nothing 
approaches it. Like they say, it's the granddaddy of them all. What more needs 
to be said?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno readily admits that the opportunity of coaching in the Rose Bowl 
played a part in his decision to stay at Penn State when he passed 65. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never even dreamed of getting to the Rose Bowl because we were an 
independent and I knew I never wanted to leave Penn State," he said. "But the 
day Penn State became a member of the Big Ten (June 4, 1990), I started 
thinking about it, and I'd say, yes, the opportunity of coming to Pasadena 
influenced me in sticking around." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Paterno has never had a team in the Rose Bowl, he has seen one game. 
After the 1970 season, he was chosen to coach in the Hula Bowl and on his way 
to Honolulu stopped in Pasadena, where he watched Jim Plunkett and Stanford 
upset undefeated Ohio State in the 1971 game, 27-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great time that day," Paterno said. "It was a great game and I sat up 
in the press box with (announcer) Bob Murphy and didn't have a thing to worry 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out here a couple of days and the thing I remember most is how big Los 
Angeles is and how I kept trying to figure out where I was and how I was going 
to get to the next place. It hasn't changed, has it?"  
</P>
<P>
 As far as retirement is concerned, the little man with the Coke-bottle glasses 
says it's at least seven years off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thoroughly enjoy coaching," he said. "I am in no hurry to get out of it. I 
don't play golf, or fish, or have any other compelling hobbies. There's nothing 
I enjoy more than football." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 45th year as a member of the Penn State coaching staff, and his 29th as 
head coach, Paterno sets records every time he sends a team onto the field. His 
268 victories are the most of any active coach and his 15 bowl victories leave 
him sharing the record with Bear Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 By putting a team in the 81st Rose Bowl game, the 1950 graduate of Brown 
University joins Bill Alexander of Georgia Tech, Bob Neyland of Tennessee and 
Frank Thomas of Alabama as coaches who have taken teams to all four major bowl 
games -- Rose, Sugar, Cotton and Orange. A victory Monday would make Paterno 
the only one to have won all four. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowl games and New Year's game triumphs aside, Paterno is an outspoken 
advocate of a national championship playoff for college football. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the only sport that doesn't have a playoff," he said. "And even 
football has playoffs everywhere but Division I. It doesn't make sense to not 
have one. I know why we don't; a lot of coaches like it the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a playoff, when it's over, only one coach is sitting on top of the world. 
How many bowl games are there, 18 or so? (Actually, 19.) That means there will 
be 18 coaches still smiling when their season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't something I'm supporting because this year we're undefeated and 
only ranked No. 2. It's something I've stood for for close to 30 years. It's 
something college football needs. In 1968 and 1969 I became more convinced than 
ever that a playoff was needed. We had undefeated teams both years and I felt 
we were as good as any team in the country and never had a shot at the 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Each season, Penn State was voted No. 2, behind Ohio State in 1968 and Texas 
in 1969. Paterno's team was also unbeaten in 1973, yet was ranked No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always kind of resented the fact that we have had only two national 
champions (1982 and 1986)," Paterno said. "I like to think we had five. I think 
the 1968, 1969 and 1973 teams were worthy of national championships." 
</P>
<P>
 What does he think of the national championship aspirations of this year's 
powerful team, with its two Heisman Trophy candidates, quarterback Kerry 
Collins and running back Ki-Jana Carter, and its 47.8-point scoring average in 
11 games? 
</P>
<P>
 "First, we've got to worry about beating a very fine Oregon football team," he 
said. "The odds, and what you so-called experts write, doesn't tell the story. 
We've studied the films and we know how good they are, especially on defense. 
They blitz much more than any team in the Big Ten and that could pose a real 
problem for us in moving the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they have great people in the skill positions offensively. Their 
quarterback (Danny O'Neil) is a gutty kid who knows how to get the job done and 
their offensive line is probably as big as any we've played all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a tendency to look at those two early losses (to Hawaii and Utah) 
and overlook what they've done since. The way they beat USC and then won their 
last six games was pretty impressive to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to look back very far to know what can happen to us in a bowl 
game against a Pac-10 team. Remember Stanford and the Blockbuster Bowl three 
years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won, 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the championship is concerned, all we can do is play our very best 
football against Oregon and see what happens. We could play as well as we can 
and it could have nothing to do with being No. 1. If it happens, it happens. If 
it doesn't, it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno will be watching closely Sunday night, however, when No. 1 Nebraska 
meets No. 3 Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be watching the Orange Bowl, sure, but I would watch it under any 
circumstances because I'm a college football fan and it should be a great game 
between two fine teams," he said. "What happens Sunday night really doesn't 
make any difference in our plans for Monday. No matter what, we have to stay 
focused on the matter at hand . . . and that's beating Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has worked too hard not to play well. They've got one more game to 
go, and if they win in the Rose Bowl, this group of players will become one of 
the great teams in Penn State football history, as good or better than any 
before them." 
</P>
<P>
 National championship or not.

RICH BROOKS; HE'S ALWAYS BEEN PLUCKY; OREGON'S COACH DOESN'T MIND UNDERDOG 
ROLE; HE'S USED TO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the late 1950s, when Oregon football coach Rich Brooks was the best high 
school athlete in the Northern California town of Grass Valley, his team was 
outclassed in the league championship game one year. But Brooks wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In a steady rain, he kept battling his opponents, even when they ripped his 
jersey off. Brooks fought on in his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they ripped that off. And he played the second half in his pants and 
shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school couldn't afford replacement uniforms," a classmate, Sacramento 
lawyer Russell Porter, recalls. "And Brooksie's gear was so torn and mud-soaked 
that it was never used again. But that didn't bother Brooksie." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, very little ever does. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first nine seasons at Oregon, when his record was 36-60-4, Brooks 
fought back every year, refusing to consider quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last nine seasons, he is 53-48, and counting, and still fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Rose Bowl Monday, with Penn State coming in, a fighter is just what 
all the doctors in Oregon ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, Brooks, who is favored to lose by 17 points, will be the biggest 
underdog in a big game since possibly Joe Namath, who, in Super Bowl III, was 
expected to lose by 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know what happened to Namath," says Brooks, noting that Namath's 
underdog New York Jets beat the Baltimore Colts. "It doesn't bother me to be 
the underdog. I've been there before." 
</P>
<P>
 Like every week, some years. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining to guarantee victory this time -- as Namath did in 1969 -- Brooks 
adds, "I'll just predict this: If we play our game, it will be a heck of a 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 If it is, if he makes things even for a while, Brooks will in one respect have 
an edge on the other coach, Joe Paterno of Penn State, who is used to running 
up a lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks is used to running in adversity. In his Oregon State student days, he 
was a backup to a player nobody could have beaten out, Terry Baker -- a Heisman 
Trophy winner. Downstate, as the leader of the Ducks -- formerly the Webfoots 
-- Brooks has known adversity almost every year, including this year, when a 
group of boosters tried to run him out of town after Oregon started 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was still playing in adversity just the other night, when 15 or 20 of 
his old Grass Valley pals -- four of whom coach football on different levels -- 
gathered for an annual party. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all that talent, we decided to name a Grass Valley coach of the year," 
Brooks' good friend Porter says. "And in the voting, Brooksie finished fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who enjoyed the rib, was Oregon's athletic director as well as 
football coach until this year, when he stepped down from administration to 
focus on the football program. 
</P>
<P>
 The job is getting tougher. Almost every star he recruits for Oregon chooses 
USC instead, or Washington, or Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping Brooks will change his mind, one of his biggest campus boosters, Oregon 
Vice President Dan Williams, has assumed the position of athletic director 
temporarily, keeping the seat warm for Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams told John Conrad, sports editor of the Eugene, Ore., Register-Guard, 
"My strong support for Rich and his staff has to do with the kind of coaches 
they are, and what they represent." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks is gifted as a teacher, loyal and stable as an executive, charismatic 
in the company of good friends, "and a very private person," Conrad says. 
</P>
<P>
 At 53, married and the father of two daughters and two sons, Brooks has the 
athletic build, the stern features, and the dark hair of a man who is used to 
having his way and never worries about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, though, it's his wife, Karen, who keeps him in Eugene, her 
favorite town. After living for years on a Eugene golf course, they are moving 
into a new house in the nearby Mohawk Valley on a 62-acre tree farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're farmers now, on the side," Brooks says. "We raise Ponderosa pines for 
harvest." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mohawk Valley is a long way from Grass Valley, where, 50 years ago, 
Brooks' late father was a gold miner who turned to law enforcement as a 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich's brother was in junior high and Rich was in the sixth grade when their 
parents were divorced. Rich remained with his mother, who still sees some 
Oregon games. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, Brooks' friends remember, he was the biggest, fastest and 
toughest of the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the same size as a high school freshman that he is now," Porter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Each spring, Brooks, an all-around athlete, competed in the pole vault. One 
day in the sectional meet, he was barely holding second place when his pole 
broke. It was the only vaulting pole Grass Valley had, meaning Brooks was 
finished for the day, or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, with the audacity he regularly shows under pressure, he walked up to 
the leader, asked to borrow his pole, and, ruining his rival's afternoon, set a 
section record on his next attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strange day," Porter says. "He broke that guy's pole too." 
</P>
<P>
 That year, Tommy Prothro recruited Brooks for Oregon State, driving down to 
Grass Valley to make the first contact. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Prothro invited Brooks to ride back with him, and, "showing 
his faith in me, asked me to drive his car," Brooks says. 
</P>
<P>
 That sold the pride of Grass Valley on Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for weeks did he learn that Prothro hated driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man never drove anywhere if he could help it," Brooks says. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oregon State, the future Oregon coach graduated in four years, got his 
master's degree immediately, and went into coaching with Prothro, following him 
to UCLA and then to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen years ago, he settled down in Eugene -- for good, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich has a very young team this year," Conrad says. "Nobody expected him to 
make the Rose Bowl this year -- I didn't -- but I won't be surprised if he 
comes back." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena this time, Brooks will be breaking, or at least bending, two 
personal precedents. He likes to take his own car to Oregon football games. 
It's a 1948 Plymouth shined up, sporting big white sidewalls and painted Duck 
green, but he won't have it at the Rose Bowl Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will he go fly-fishing the day before the game, as he likes to do in 
Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a great life," he says. "Only one thing beats watching a fish come 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, as everybody knows, is being chosen coach of the year in Grass 
Valley.

MIKE DOWNEY: A LION IN HIS HEART, IF NOT PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My membership in the Penn State Alumni Assn. has entitled me to receive all 
sorts of topical Rose Bowl literature. 
</P>
<P>
 I am invited to the Penn State alumni golf tournament this Saturday morning in 
Tustin, shotgun start 8:15. 
</P>
<P>
 I am invited to "Joe's pep rally," to cheer the Nittany Lions to victory 
Sunday afternoon at the South Coast Repertory Theatre, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 I am invited to do volunteer float work for the Rose Parade by the city of 
LaCanada-Flintridge, to help create a float of a giant elephant riding a hang 
glider. 
</P>
<P>
 I am invited to join the Orange County chapter's "holiday beach party" for 
some "fun in the sun," Pacific Coast Highway Brookhurst Beach, Saturday from 
noon to 5, hot dogs and soft drinks available. 
</P>
<P>
 I am invited to "paint the town blue" with the L.A. chapter at its New Year's 
Eve gala at the Pasadena Convention Center, buffet supper and champagne toast, 
65 bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 I am invited to watch the game itself Monday on TV with my brother and sister 
Penn State alumni at the Sutter Club in Sacramento, at Ricky's in San Leandro 
or at San Jose Live, 150 South First St., San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, to California chapter presidents Kirsten Vensel of Los Angeles, Judy 
Wolfe of Orange County, Tom Lavenda of Sacramento-San Joaquin, Meri Jo 
Petrivelli of San Diego, Jim Howard of the San Francisco Bay area and Art 
Kushner of the Silicon Valley, may I humbly say, hurrah for Penn State, and I 
thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 If only I had attended Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago or so, some dedicated Nittany Lion took note of a column I wrote 
about the football program at Penn State and how much I admired it. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe what I actually wrote was that, as a child, my chances of ending up 
at Penn State were not as good as my chances of ending up at State Pen. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy took pity and pushed me for membership in the Penn State alumni 
family, as warm and loving a bunch as the Bradys. I have been receiving their 
literature ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus bookstore sends brochures of Penn State shirts and caps, all of 
which are a lot more colorful than Penn State's uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, I got tempted by a Rose Bowl tailgate celebration "fan-pak," 
including one for a party of 25 that included 25 megaphones, 25 glitter 
buttons, 25 spirit shakers, 25 acrylic mugs and 25 pounds of blue-and-white 
button candy. 
</P>
<P>
 The part, "20% discount to all alumni members" really caught my eye. After 
all, the fan-pak did go for $285. And most of my life, Christmas after 
Christmas, I have been begging people to buy me a glitter button or a spirit 
shaker, but they keep getting me socks and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 All purchases from the Penn State bookstore benefit Penn State scholarships, 
so I figured by purchasing a couple of fan-paks, I might be able to land Joe 
Paterno a really fine high school linebacker from Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody back in State College or University Park or Kampus Korner (or 
whatever they're calling that town now) is pretty excited about being in the 
Rose Bowl, let me tell you. It really feels great being champion of the Big Ten 
Plus Northwestern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 I am informed by my alumni association newsletter that in 1923, when Coach 
Hugo Bezdek brought his Nittany Lions out here to play in Pasadena's new 
$272,198.26 stadium, they traveled to the game in taxicabs -- right after Hugo 
got back from viewing the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the 2:15 p.m. kickoff approached, the Nittany Lions found themselves mired 
in traffic as the 57,000 spectators clogged Pasadena's streets," the newswire 
reports. "Only after some 'Laurel and Hardy-esque' driving by the cabbies over 
the local citizens' lawns did the Penn State party finally reach the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "There they found that the kickoff already had been delayed by 10 minutes. 
Coach Bezdek and the Trojans' head man, 'Gloomy Gus' Henderson, almost came to 
blows as the Lions' skipper successfully lobbied the game officials for 
additional time for his squad to warm up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game finally started an hour late and ended in moonlight. Even with the 
60-minute delay, many spectators did not reach their seats until the second 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, my reaction to this memoir is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 They found taxicabs? In L.A.?  
</P>
<P>
 As a veteran Californian now, might I politely suggest to all my Penn State 
fraternity brothers and sorority sisters that you leave for the game plenty 
early, because if you indulge in any Laurel and Hardy-esque driving this time, 
your vehicle might be pulled over by one of our famously stern Los Angeles 
police officers, or else Jack Nicholson with a nine-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 As for you Oregon Ducks . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Question: What natural phenomenon will change the course of migrating Ducks 
to Southern California?" asks my alumni brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Answer: Thousands of Nittany Lion fans cheering their team to victory!" 
</P>
<P>
 I have to say that I absolutely agree, and that Penn State is an easy choice 
to win this game until Oregon comes to its senses and makes me an alumnus.

FATE OF BASEBALL PLACED IN HANDS OF THE COURTS; LABOR: AS EXPECTED, UNION FILES 
COMPLAINT AGAINST OWNERS WITH NLRB. RESULT IN 4-6 WEEKS. 
</P>

<P>
 The decision on whether baseball's salary cap stays or goes is now up to the 
federal government and federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, players began their legal attempt to overturn the cap Tuesday, 
filing an unfair-labor-practice charge against owners with the National Labor 
Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Players claimed the owners began negotiations with the intention of forcing a 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners, having lost two cases in two tries with the NLRB this month, also 
filed a charge against the union, claiming the players have refused to bargain 
over wages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll talk to the parties about the need for relief and begin the 
investigative process immediately, which means within a day or two," said 
Daniel Silverman, the NLRB's New York regional director. "Most cases are 
investigated within four to six weeks. We'll try to stick to that timetable." 
</P>
<P>
 If Silverman finds merit to either charge, he will ask Fred Feinstein, the 
NLRB's general counsel in Washington, to issue a complaint, which is tantamount 
to an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agency issues a complaint against the owners, Feinstein may ask the 
five-member NLRB for permission to seek a preliminary injunction against the 
cap in federal court, probably in Manhattan. That could lead to a court hearing 
on the cap in February or March. 
</P>
<P>
 If a judge issues an injunction, the pre-cap system will return, including 
salary arbitration, until the case is decided, which could be any time between 
1996 and 1999, depending on appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fehr, main union negotiator, said, "From the beginning, the clubs have had 
one and only one thought in mind, forcing a salary cap upon the players. As the 
investigation proceeds, we are confident the board will come to see that the 
clubs entered into negotiations with no intention of reaching an agreement 
other than upon the clubs' preconceived terms." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners broke off negotiations last Thursday, declaring an impasse in 
bargaining, their right under federal labor law. They implemented the cap 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is reviewing the rules owners implemented and will decide whether to 
recommend if players should sign contracts until there is a legal determination 
on the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners claim the union bargained in bad faith, accusing players of 
refusing to negotiate wages on a collective basis, unlawfully insisting on the 
individual negotiation of wages and salary arbitration, and engaging in surface 
bargaining that wasn't real. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Silverman issued a complaint against owners for failing to make a 
$7.8-million payment Aug. 1 to the players' benefit plan. A trial on that is 
scheduled for March 14 before an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman also dismissed management's charge that the union had violated the 
law by threatening violence against potential strikebreakers. Owners say they 
will appeal his dismissal to the NLRB. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are, of course, mindful of the great public interest in the resolution of 
this dispute," Silverman said. "It should be emphasized to the public that our 
role is to protect the collective bargaining process, but not to require any 
party to agree to a proposal or to require them to make a concession. This 
dispute must be settled by the parties themselves."

TEACHING A TEAM TO VALUE FAMILY TIES; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: USC'S NEW DEFENSIVE 
COORDINATOR, KEITH BURNS, OFFERS PLAYERS LIFE LESSONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long ago, Keith Burns, the USC football team's new defensive coordinator, 
was asked to speak at a high school football awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't talk about USC's Cotton Bowl date with Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Or about standout wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who was also there to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Or on how he planned to retool USC's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And he didn't use the occasion as a recruiting opportunity -- not even with 
two dozen high school prospects sitting before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Burns, 34, talked about mothers and fathers, pegging his message to 
his own father, who died 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just finished my senior football season at Arkansas when my dad died," 
Burns told the players, then expanded on his talk to a reporter afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 "And I still feel good today about the fact that when he died, I felt like 
there wasn't anything more I could have done to have made my relationship with 
him any better. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was my best friend as well as my father. I remember sitting on the 
front porch with him and sometimes talking until 2 a.m., about sports, girls, 
cars . . . we talked about anything.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and dad never missed a game I played at Arkansas, despite the fact 
they lived in Dallas. They traveled to the road games, too.  
</P>
<P>
 "He worked for Bell Helicopters in Dallas for 35 years, and was a foreman in 
his last years. One time, he got a cough that didn't go away. The doctors found 
titanium dust in his lungs.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big, strong healthy guy, never sick in his life. And when he was 
bedridden the last couple of months, it was hard on him.  
</P>
<P>
 "One day, my brother and I were playing a very competitive game of checkers in 
his hospital room and dad suggested a move to me he felt I should make. I 
didn't, and I lost.  
</P>
<P>
 "He whispered to me, 'Never get to the point in your life where you can't take 
advice.' He died four hours later." 
</P>
<P>
 Talking directly to the high school players, Burns said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do yourself a favor sometime today and ask yourself if you've done everything 
you possibly can to make things as good as they can be between you and your mom 
and dad, because they can be gone from your life very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 That's Keith Burns, Mr. Family, who, days after receiving the biggest 
promotion of his coaching career, had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, what a day tomorrow is going to be. I've got several recruits coming in 
. . . and Little League basketball tryouts start in Monrovia." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns and his wife, Yvonne, live in Arcadia, with their sons, K.C., 7, and 
Tanner, 5.  
</P>
<P>
 For Burns, the difficulty of balancing football coaches' hours with home life 
just got more difficult. His family, he said, is his "home team." 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaches work such long hours, we're away from home so much, the little time 
I'm with my family becomes very important to me," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Little things a lot of parents might take for granted, like decorating a 
Christmas tree, is a big deal at our house.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is assigned a limb to decorate. Even picking out the tree is a big 
deal, it's a team operation. So are our outdoor cookouts, when my two boys both 
have their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems like the best conversations I have with my boys are during those 
cookouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns is among the most vocal of USC's 13-member coaching staff, possibly 
ranking just behind offensive line coach Mike Barry and new defensive line 
coach Rod Marinelli.  
</P>
<P>
 He was finishing his second season as coach of the Trojans' safeties when John 
Robinson promoted him earlier this month to replace Don Lindsey, who had been 
dismissed Nov. 30.  
</P>
<P>
 In a coincidental twist, Lindsey was the defensive coordinator at Arkansas 
when Burns was a starter in his junior and senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keith will do a great job, he's an awesome coach," said Lindsey, just days 
after his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' orders from Robinson are to field a more aggressive defense next year, 
somewhere between the high-risk defense used by Washington State and Lindsey's 
low-risk, bend-but-don't-break system.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Robinson and Lindsey were unhappy at the ease with which some opponents, 
particularly UCLA, ran against USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that disturbs me most was the way they could run the ball on us," 
said Robinson, moments after UCLA's surprising 31-19 victory Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns says no major changes will be made for Monday's Cotton Bowl game against 
Texas Tech, but that the 1995 Trojans will have a new look.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense next year will take more risks than we did this year, but not to 
the extent Washington State did," he said. "Washington State goes over the 
edge. We won't.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our toughest job will be replacing our senior linebackers (Brian Williams, 
Jeff Kopp, Donn Cunnigan and Errol Small). But guys like Errick Herrin and 
Scott Fields will be back, and I'm excited about that."

SAN CLEMENTE'S SAMPERI SAYS HE'LL ATTEND USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Clemente High offensive tackle Brett Samperi, a Times All-Orange County 
first-team selection, said Tuesday he has made an oral commitment to play 
football at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-5, 270-pound Samperi was a three-year varsity starter at San 
Clemente and was an All-South Coast League selection as a junior and senior. He 
said he will probably be a redshirt his freshman season.

6 FROM AREA RECEIVE TOP STATE HONOR; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: WESTLAKE'S MILLER 
AND NOTRE DAME'S SAILER AMONG 30 FIRST-TEAM SELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Six area high school players were among 30 first-team selections to the 1994 
All-State football team compiled by Cal-Hi Sports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Billy Miller of Westlake, tackle Mark Manskar of Canyon and 
All-American kicker Chris Sailer of Notre Dame were chosen to the first-team 
offense. Linebackers Lawrence Larry of Littlerock and punter Ignacio Brache of 
Village Christian were first-team defense selections. Junior Durell Price of 
Sylmar, a running back and linebacker, was a first-team multipurpose selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior tailback Daylon McCutcheon of La Puente Bishop Amat, who rushed for 
2,359 yards and scored 33 touchdowns, was chosen Cal-Hi Sports player of the 
year. McCutcheon, son of former Rams running back Lawrence McCutcheon, led 
Bishop Amat to a national ranking and a Del Rey League championship. McCutcheon 
scored four touchdowns in a 28-6 victory over league rival Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, Price and even Sailer, who booted a state-record 22 field goals in 28 
attempts, played major roles this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller (6-foot-3, 210 pounds) caught 67 passes for 1,057 yards while leading 
Westlake to a Marmonte League championship and into the Southern Section 
Division III playoffs. As a running back, Price rushed for 1,936 yards and 
scored 29 touchdowns as Sylmar went 14-0 and claimed the City Section 4-A 
Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer, who tied a state record with 33 career field goals, connected on seven 
of at least 50 yards to help lead Notre Dame to the Division III championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Manskar (6-7, 250) and Larry (6-3, 230) are among Southern California's 
most-recruited linemen, and Brache, who doubled as a kicker, booted 16 field 
goals, including a 60-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-team selections included tackle Kane Cullum of Crespi, running back 
Jerry Brown and defensive back DaShon Polk of Taft, and defensive tackle Caleb 
Smith of Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Josh Hawkins of Nordhoff, who rushed for an area-high 2,454 yards 
and 32 touchdowns, was selected to the all-state medium schools team. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the small-schools all-state selections were offensive linemen Matt 
Phelan of Paraclete and Langston Woodberry of Montclair Prep, defensive tackle 
Garveia Freeney of Kilpatrick, linebacker Akhil Anderson of Montclair Prep, and 
defensive backs Ryan Johnson of Oak Park and Darrell Dent of Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Selby of Harvard-Westlake was a third-team selection to Cal-Hi's 
All-State girls' volleyball selections.

A PLACE TO CALL HOME -- FINALLY; LANCE FAY ONCE SPURNED VENTURA; NOW, HE'S A 
KEY PLAYER FOR TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The schools were separated by only a few miles but to Lance Fay, their 
basketball programs were worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew it and still chose the wrong one. For his style of play, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, a 6-foot-2 sophomore guard at Ventura College, could have joined the 
powerful Pirates straight out of Buena High three seasons ago but opted for the 
promising program at Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not his slickest move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of good freshmen that year but it never panned out," Fay said. 
"With the guys we had on the team, we should have been 25-5." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoulda. Woulda. Couldn'ta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Condors, torpedoed by internal strife, never achieved their potential that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that matters to Fay anymore, because now he is a key figure on a 
team with a legitimate shot at the mountaintop. Now, he is at Ventura, the 
place he admits was better suited for him all along, where they play at the 
wide-open pace he likes. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition is working fine. 
</P>
<P>
 After redshirting last season, Fay is averaging 9.7 points, has 29 steals and 
is the team's co-captain with freshman center Curtis Ganes. The numbers are not 
overwhelming, but that's because Ventura Coach Philip Mathews this season 
resurrected his "Orange and Black" scheme, a system that rotates two five-man 
units into action every few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In that system, each unit is on the floor for about 20 minutes a game. One 
unit starts one game and the other might start the next. It's not the ideal 
format for someone with visions of grandeur but it's one that Fay says serves 
an important purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have to put aside the pride of starting," Fay said. "It's really not 
that bad. We go in and do our job and come out. The other unit goes in and does 
its job and comes out. It's weird because the game goes by real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe to Fay and the Pirates but not to their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every game this season has been a rout for Ventura (16-0). They have 
scored 100 or more points eight times and only four opponents finished within 
10 points of the Pirates. Ventura has jumped from No. 6 in the preseason state 
poll to No. 1, the same perch it occupied the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, although loaded with freshmen -- Fay and returning guard Willie West 
are the only sophomores -- is considered a contender for the state title, 
something that evaded the Pirates the past two seasons. Ventura lost in the 
state championship game to Columbia, 97-88, in 1993 and to Long Beach, 63-61, 
last March. Fay, who played against one of those Ventura teams and practiced 
with the other, believes this Pirate team can win it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is much deeper than those two teams," Fay said. "We have 10 guys 
that could start at any other JC. We have so many offensive weapons. 
(Opponents) never know who is going to be hot or cold." 
</P>
<P>
 At Buena, Fay was usually hot. He averaged 29.2 points his senior season in 
1991-92 and was the Southern Section Division I co-player of the year with 
Santa Ana Mater Dei's Reggie Geary. Mathews and the Pirates were only a short 
walk up Telegraph Road but Fay chose Oxnard, where several of his friends were 
going to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I recruited him out of high school, I thought he could play but Lance 
thought he might have a better chance to play at Oxnard," Mathews said. "I 
think he felt he could get more minutes there. . . . He knows he doesn't have 
the athletic ability of other players, but he makes up for it with his 
hard-nosed play." 
</P>
<P>
 His freshman season at Oxnard started well. Coach Remy McCarthy had recruited 
several talented players, including Fay and former Santa Clara High standout 
forwards Steve Amar and Chris Cole, to blend with top returners Art Wallace and 
Tony Ziuraitis, and the Condors got off to a good start. They were 16-8 overall 
and 2-0 in the Western State Conference North Division when things went sour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Condors hit a six-game skid. McCarthy, who resigned after the season and 
is now the interim women's coach at Moorpark, kicked Amar off the team with 
three games left to play for questioning the punishment he received for 
arriving late to a practice. Wallace, a 6-10 center, quit the team the same day 
because he felt McCarthy treated him unfairly. Oxnard finished 16-14 and 2-6, 
and Fay, the team's leading scorer at 16.1 points per game, went to see 
Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I had made a mistake not going to Ventura to start with," Fay said. "I 
had no problems with Remy. But all (the problems at Oxnard) made my decision 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Because nonfreshmen enrolling at a junior college must have completed at least 
12 units of work at that school before becoming eligible to play sports, Fay 
redshirted last season and concentrated on academics. He said it wasn't easy to 
watch the Pirates cruise to another state tournament without him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Ventura's opponents are trying to deal with Fay and his teammates. Fay is 
loving every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more pressure at Ventura, but success breeds success," Fay 
said. "I look back at it now and I don't know what I was thinking when I passed 
(Ventura) up the first time."

OFF THE BEATEN PATH; WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA DESERT PROTECTION ACT, 
OFF-ROAD ENTHUSIASTS FEARED THE WORST, BUT ITS EFFECTS IN DEATH VALLEY ARE AS 
UNCLEAR AS PARK BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ranger Hank Kodele fingered the long, thin sagebrush scratches along the sides 
of Rick Russell's glossy red Hummer and said, "Know what they call these 
things? Desert pinstripes." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Russell, who makes off-road maps and videos for a living, hadn't heard 
that one, so it was one thing he would learn from an expedition to Death Valley 
National Park to explore the mysteries of the federal California Desert 
Protection Act (CDPA) enacted last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Through eight years of lobbying, politicking, compromising, trade-offs and 
wheeling and dealing, with a transition in Democratic caretakers from Sen. Alan 
Cranston to Sen. Dianne Feinstein along the way, SB 21 collected its own desert 
pinstripes on the road to becoming a somewhat confusing law. 
</P>
<P>
 California's federal wilderness lands are held by the National Park Service, 
the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management or the Fish and Wildlife 
Service. The CDPA expanded those holdings from 6.3 million acres to 13.97 
million acres, and prohibits the use of any mechanical conveyance, including a 
bicycle, in a wilderness area. Leaders of the state's estimated one million 
off-road enthusiasts feared the worst when it inevitably became law. 
</P>
<P>
 First, says Harry Lewellyn, who publishes a monthly newsletter called 
Ecological 4-Wheeling and leads caravan trips in California and Mexico, "I hate 
the word off-road. "  
</P>
<P>
 Off-highway would be more accurate, Lewellyn says, since responsible 
four-wheelers -- the vast majority -- don't drive cross-country but travel on 
existing rocky, rutty roads and trails. Yet the perception that they were 
ravaging the desert flora and terrifying the fauna was a major thrust behind 
the CDPA.  
</P>
<P>
 The law hasn't changed much yet. Russell, Lewellyn and some friends set out to 
find out for themselves in a pair of Hummers -- the market version of the 
military truck that proved its worth in Operation Desert Storm during the 
Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service also has a couple of Army surplus Hummers in Death Valley, 
but since it became a national park and expanded from 2.1 million acres to 3.4 
million acres, Kodele patrols the back roads in the same white Bronco he did 
when Death Valley was only a national monument. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodele offers a map outlining the new boundaries -- drawn on a copy of an Auto 
Club map. Most of the people in charge of enforcing the CDPA's restrictions are 
still trying to figure out exactly where the boundaries are. The blueprint maps 
sent from Washington this month are too smudgy to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Aardahl, a leader of the park's transition team, said, "The boundary line 
is not well-defined. It's just meandering around." 
</P>
<P>
 The map makers in Washington sometimes ignored geographical features, such as 
ridges and washes, to serve private interests -- such as the Last Chance sulfur 
mine that required a 10-mile, dandelion-shaped invasion of the new northern 
boundary to accommodate a two-lane road leading to the mine. Although now 
surrounded by the park, the mine is technically outside the park and free to do 
business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely having the "national park" status is expected to increase Death 
Valley's business about 25% from one million visitors a year, but four-wheelers 
might not notice any difference. Russell said, "If there's an increase in 
visitors to this park, it's going to be on the paved roads." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, Russell said, "It cut out 100,000 miles (of dirt roads and trails 
accessible to four-wheel-drive vehicles) and didn't add any." 
</P>
<P>
 What's left? Plenty, it seems.  
</P>
<P>
 "If Death Valley, for example, is going to be managed the way I've been told, 
I'm elated," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal custodians apparently plan to keep existing roads open, although 
some may be "cherry stem" corridors across new wilderness land, allowing access 
to old destinations, such as the Barker Ranch, where Charles Manson and his 
clan were captured in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manson might not have been impressed if the law had pulled up to the ranch in 
Hummers that day, but the big, boxy vehicles turn a lot of heads.  
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter loves it when I take her to school," Russell said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hummer was born in the mid-1980s when the Army put out bids for a super 
machine that could serve all the purposes of everything from a Jeep to a 1 
1/4-ton truck. Fully loaded, it had to have 16 inches of ground clearance, 
climb a 22-inch vertical step and a 30-degree grade and ford 30 inches of water 
-- and it had to have automatic transmission because some of the kid recruits 
couldn't handle a stick shift. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was the High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) that is 
now the most-used mode of transportation in the U.S. military. AM General of 
South Bend, Ind., which started out as Willys and built the first Jeeps in 
World War II, won the contract and has built more than 120,000 Hummers for the 
U.S. military and, according to a spokesperson, "friendly" foreign governments. 
Along the way, HMMWV became Humvee, then Hummer. 
</P>
<P>
 Straightforward and functional, Hummers aren't stylish, but they can be 
ordered with almost any option you can get on a luxury sedan and are 
sufficiently expensive -- $40,000 to $75,000, depending on options -- to 
attract the young and affluent in search of the latest fad. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger owns five Hummers, including the first one that was 
hand-modified for civilian use before AM General started building them for the 
public in 1992. Andre Agassi and Demi Moore own Hummers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the average pair of rocky ruts, the Hummer breezes along. Even when you hit 
a rock higher than 16 inches, it's harmless because the underside is heavily 
armored. The creators were thinking land mines. 
</P>
<P>
 John Sweeney, a friend of Russell's from Palmdale, brought one of his two 
Hummers on the Death Valley trip. 
</P>
<P>
 At 86 1/2 inches, not counting the breakaway mirrors, the Hummer is much wider 
than other four-wheel-drive vehicles, but Sweeney said, "I haven't been 
anywhere yet it's too big for. I like big vehicles. Jeeps scare me." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, Sweeney added, according to factory warranty information, only 5% of 
the Hummer owners ever take their beasts off the pavement. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Sixteen years ago, Don Connolly, 54, quit selling insurance in Los Angeles and 
moved to the desert. He is the mayor, sheriff and only resident of Ballarat, an 
otherwise abandoned mining settlement. He owns a small general store, a tired 
car and a trailer he shares with his scruffy, friendly dogs, Buddy and Blackie. 
The Desert Act has put Ballarat in a new wilderness area. Or has it?  
</P>
<P>
 "I've had the BLM rangers here and the park rangers here, all scratching their 
heads," Connolly said. "(They say,) 'We don't know. No one's told us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He expects that his site at the base of the Panamint Mountains, which separate 
Ballarat from Death Valley, will experience a jump in the population of wild 
desert burros. Under current policy, the BLM rounds up excess animals for 
adoption. The Park Service shoots them.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we have so many wild burros on this side," Connolly said.  
</P>
<P>
 Connolly also is concerned about plans for a massive gold strip-mining 
operation seven miles down the Panamint Valley that will blow out a piece of 
Redlands Canyon roughly half a mile wide and half a mile in.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were going to blow up 505 acres of public land inside Redlands Canyon 
and cyanide it for gold," he said. "The passage of the Desert Protection Act 
has now released an additional 19,000 acres of mining claims that they have on 
the mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, this dry lake bed here was in a wilderness study area. The mining 
company wanted to put in a 47-acre clay pit to take clay out to line their 
cyanide pits with. They couldn't do that until the passage of the act lifted 
the wilderness study area. Then at the end of six years they're driving off and 
leaving it. No one will notice it. It's just a 47-acre hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly, commuting to Trona, 25 miles distant, and Ridgecrest, even farther 
away, has been waging a lonely battle against the project, which under the CDPA 
now seems a fait accompli. He muses bitterly over the irony that such a thing 
would be permitted under a law called the Desert Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But the desert now seems safe from Charles Manson and four-wheel-drives and 
even an occasional Hummer or two.

OSBORNE'S NEAR SACK DOESN'T HELP; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: ARIZONA NOSE GUARD HARASSED 
QUARTERBACK ALL NIGHT BUT CAME UP JUST SHORT ON DECIDING PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Chuck Osborne knew better, but so many things can become blurry during a 
chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne, Arizona's junior nose guard, had Utah quarterback Mike McCoy 
smothered -- again -- late in the fourth quarter of the Freedom Bowl Tuesday 
night. It looked as if Osborne would deliver the knockout blow the Wildcats 
wanted, but McCoy fired a pass as he fell that helped Utah to a 16-13 victory 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just going for the tackle and I should have gone for his arm," Osborne 
said. "The way we play defense, we emphasize the turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had just made a little better effort, I'm sure I could have knocked it 
down. I'm going to play this over in my mind forever." 
</P>
<P>
 As was the case throughout the game, Osborne chased McCoy out of the pocket on 
the play -- fourth and goal from the five-yard line. McCoy rolled to his right 
where Osborne caught him at the 11-yard line and threw him down. But as Osborne 
engulfed him, McCoy tossed a pass to Kevin Dyson in the right corner of the end 
zone with 3 minutes 34 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even see him get it off," Osborne said. "I had him down on the 
ground and I thought the play was over -- then I heard the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was the NFL, he would have been in the grasp. But this isn't (the 
NFL)." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Osborne and his fellow Desert Swarm mates played an excellent game. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne, selected honorable mention All-Pacific 10 Conference, had four 
tackles, including three for losses and two sacks. He entered the game with a 
team-leading 11 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona limited Utah to 75 yards in 57 plays. Osborne said this was the most 
complete game the defense played this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defensive backs played great tonight, which is what we thought would 
happen going in," he said. "This was the craziest game I've ever been in." 
Wildcat All-American junior defense end Tedy Bruschi prepared to congratulate 
his buddy on sack No. 3 -- then he heard the crowd too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were after (McCoy) all night, and I thought Chuck had another one," 
Bruschi said. "We pounded him the whole night, but he hung in there and made 
the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona senior cornerback Spencer Wray wasn't as understanding about Utah's 
good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "We completely dominated them for the whole game," Wray said. "They couldn't 
run on us, they couldn't pass on us they couldn't do anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was going down. You couldn't ask for us to play any better than 
we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona senior defensive end Akil Jackson said the Wildcats were bound to have 
a close one go against them because they've done the same things to other teams 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts bad," he said. "I knew we were in for a fight, but to go down that 
way is tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of breaks have gone our way, so I guess we were due."

O.C. WEIGHING SALE OF AIRPORT, MORE CUTS TO DEAL WITH LOSSES; BANKRUPTCY: ALL 
SHOULD BE UP FOR REVIEW, INCLUDING LANDFILLS AND JAILS, SUPERVISOR-ELECT 
BERGESON SAYS. MOVE TO TRIM BUDGET BY $120 MILLION IS ONLY THE BEGINNING, 
OFFICIALS ADD.

<P>
 The collapse of Orange County's investment pool is forcing supervisors to 
consider the sale of John Wayne Airport and other drastic steps -- including 
the privatization of government departments -- to cope with heavy financial 
losses, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "All bets are off. There are no sacred cows," Supervisor William G. Steiner 
said. "Even the airport. That is one of the scenarios that needs to be 
considered." 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of the county's only commercial airport has been discussed for years, 
but this time the temptation to follow through in light of the county's 27% 
investment loss may prove overwhelming, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely everything should be put on the table for review," said former 
state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who will succeed retiring 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley on Monday. "I'm talking about landfills and jails 
and everything. This is the greatest opportunity a county could ever have to 
take control of its future. It happened during a crisis, but government often 
reacts to crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no formal discussions have begun over selling the airport, widespread 
talk among county supervisors and administrators about such a move is one more 
indication of the seriousness of the county's financial problems. Last week, 
officials said they would immediately move to trim about $120 million from the 
county budget over the next 18 months, an action expected to result in hundreds 
of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But that figure is only the beginning, officials said. Because the county's 
contribution to the investment fund was $2.7 billion and the portfolio has lost 
27% of its value, it is estimated that county government has lost nearly $730 
million, reducing not only the county's cash holdings but the nest egg it 
relies on to produce interest income. 
</P>
<P>
 As county department managers on Tuesday continued to weigh how the budget 
should be further slashed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Felix Rocha Jr., a Fountain Valley resident who sits on the county 
Department of Education's Board of Trustees, personally served Supervisor Roger 
R. Stanton with recall papers and submitted to the county registrar of voters a 
notice of intent to recall Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to reply to the recall as called out in the law and continue my 
efforts to make sure we maximize the value of this investment portfolio and 
make sure it doesn't happen again," said Stanton, a county supervisor for the 
past 13 years. "I invited Mr. Rocha to join me in that effort, but he felt this 
action was more appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Fullerton city employee filed a class-action lawsuit against the county on 
behalf of all government workers with money frozen in one of three county 
retirement funds that were placed in the county's now-bankrupt investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit states that Sgt. David Stanko, an 18-year veteran of the Fullerton 
police force, deposited $22,000 in deferred salary for his retirement with the 
county treasurer's office. Stanko's attorney said the officer is one of 
thousands of government employees in Orange County who have had money taken out 
of their paychecks and stashed in the county investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * In an effort to provide cities and school districts with cash, the county 
announced Tuesday that it will distribute property tax payments collected in 
mid-December about a week earlier than normal. Chuck Hulse, the chief deputy 
auditor-controller, said the move will allow agencies "to get their hands on 
more money." 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials continued to simmer about the withholding of other property 
tax revenue, which were placed in the pool before the Dec. 6 bankruptcy and 
have since been frozen. Yorba Linda officials said they may sue the county to 
gain the $1.7 million in property taxes withheld last week. The Huntington 
Beach City Council will meet in closed session today to discuss possible 
litigation over the more than $2 million withheld from them. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county agreed to meet today with its largest labor union, the Orange 
County Employees Assn., which wants to block anticipated layoffs. Rival union 
leaders criticized the association for "jumping the gun" and creating friction 
with county leaders. The union also called on the Board of Supervisors to 
borrow money or issue new bonds to make up for the investment fund's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steiner said he will recommend today that $921,000 more be forwarded to 55 
nonprofit agencies that provided services to the county before its Dec. 6 
bankruptcy filing. Coming about a week after the county agreed to pay nearly $3 
million to more than 100 nonprofit groups, the new request would cover services 
such as witness assistance and emergency housing. Most of it would eventually 
be reimbursed by the state or federal government, Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 As county officials continued to sort through their financial problems and 
what they mean to the future of county government, the idea of having private 
interests run the airport or other agencies took on new appeal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, who first raised the idea of selling the airport in June, 1992, 
during a budget crunch, said the prospects of that happening are more likely 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was an idea (that) would be more ripe a year or two down the 
road, never realizing that it would take a bombshell like this to ripen the 
fruit," Stanton said. "It's got to be considered. Anyone offering a billion 
dollars for the airport can have it right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say they have no idea how much the facility would be worth 
if it were sold, but the airport has become increasingly successful in recent 
years. It generated $58.1 million in revenue in fiscal 1994, and has seen an 
increase in flights and passenger loads this year, due largely to the start of 
service by low-fare carriers such as Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 But a potential sale of the airport could be stymied by requirements that the 
federal government must be reimbursed for the millions of dollars it has 
invested. The deal also could be complicated by the millions of dollars more in 
bonds that have been sold to pay for massive improvements at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 An airport spokeswoman, Courtney C. Wiercioch, said: "If the board requests 
our assistance, we will certainly provide it. However, we believe there are 
federal regulations which may make that option unfeasible." 
</P>
<P>
 Various companies have expressed an interest in buying John Wayne Airport, 
including Lockheed Air Terminal, the Lockheed subsidiary that has managed 
Burbank Airport for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an interest in talking to the county (to see) if we can help them," 
said Viggo Butler, president of Lockheed Air Terminal. "There are some 
impediments to outright sale, but whether there are intermediate steps" is yet 
to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said he believes there may be methods to overcome the financing 
hurdles. Other Potential Sales 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time county officials are looking at the airport for possible 
sale, the county's three-member management council has asked the county's 
General Services Agency to compile a list of properties that could be sold to 
make up for lost revenue and cash holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely there are discussions going on internally about what assets could 
generate capital," said Chuck West, the agency's real estate director. 
</P>
<P>
 West said he expects to give the management council a list of county assets as 
early as today or Thursday. Two key parcels, he said, are a 7.7-acre parking 
lot near The Pond in Anaheim that the city of Anaheim leases from the county 
and an 11.7-acre parcel in Anaheim that houses the offices of the county's 
agriculture commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest parcels with sale revenue potential cited in the county's own 
annual property survey include the 329-acre Joplin Youth Center, a detention 
facility for juvenile offenders in Trabuco Canyon, and 100 acres of undeveloped 
land surrounding the James A. Musick Branch Jail in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The list will be reviewed by the council, which in turn will make 
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors, which must approve any sale, West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is looking specifically for general-fund properties from which 
proceeds could be spent at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors. Much of 
the land owned by the county is dedicated to particular needs, such as flood 
control, waste management, harbors, beaches and parks. State law restricts the 
use of any money raised by the sale of such land. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few general fund assets that are big and very few available 
for sale that aren't being currently used," West said. The two parcels in 
Anaheim are among the largest general fund properties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 West added that county officials will weigh the potential loss of lease 
revenue in choosing what, if anything, to sell. In 1994, he said, the county 
generated $70.6 million in lease revenue from various properties. Labor Wants a 
Say 
</P>
<P>
 As they urged the county to look for new sources of revenue, labor leaders 
continued to press for a greater say in the imposition of $30 million in 
cutbacks announced last week -- cuts that will fall on dozens of county 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors should take positive command to remove the 
bankruptcy from the backs of Orange County citizens and immediately adopt 
revenue measures which will restore the principal lost in the investment pool 
setback," read a letter to supervisors from county employees association 
General Manager John H. Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also called for the immediate reinstatement of collective 
bargaining agreements suspended in the wake of the bankruptcy filing. It said 
the county's recent actions had been based on "alarmist speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Orange County Employees Assn.'s 16 bargaining units were called 
in for an evening meeting Tuesday with the organization's board of directors to 
prepare for Wednesday's "meet and confer" session with county management. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the employees, who have sat across the bargaining table from county 
management to negotiate their contracts, said they welcome legal action if the 
county refuses to restore layoff provisions in their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only alternative that we have," said Bruce Moore, a deputy probation 
officer who has worked for the county for 23 years and negotiated numerous 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 In another letter delivered to department heads, the union also asked for a 
full accounting of each department's financial situation and requested that a 
host of cost-cutting measures be considered before managers even think of 
reducing their work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Those steps included reducing expenditures on outside vendors, suppliers and 
contractors, renegotiating leases and other real estate agreements and 
auctioning surplus equipment and property. If department heads still feel more 
cost-cutting measures are necessary, the letter said, they should work within 
the union's negotiated contract and explore job sharing, part-time positions 
and leaves of absence. Washington Response 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, meanwhile, the role played by so-called derivative securities 
issued by government-sponsored agencies drew the attention of another federal 
regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates the 
Federal National Mortgage Assn. and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., asked 
those agencies -- whose securities carry an implicit federal guarantee -- for 
information about their disclosures to investors about the risks inherent in 
derivative securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Exotic notes issued by the agencies make up a large share of the derivatives 
bought and still held by the Orange County investment pool. Many of the 
securities were designed to pay higher interest as market interest rates fell. 
But when rates rose, those securities paid out progressively smaller dividends 
throughout 1994, triggering the county's financial debacle.

indication of the seriousness of the county's financial problems. Last week, 
officials said they would immediately move to trim about $120 million from the 
county budget over the next 18 months, an action expected to result in hundreds 
of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But that $120 million is only the beginning, officials said. Because the 
county's contribution to the investment fund was $2.7 billion and the portfolio 
has lost 27% of its value, it is estimated that county government has lost 
nearly $730 million, reducing not only the county's cash holdings but the nest 
egg it relies on to produce interest income. 
</P>
<P>
 As county department managers Tuesday continued to weigh how the budget should 
be further slashed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Felix Rocha Jr., a Fountain Valley resident who sits on the county 
Department of Education's board of trustees, personally served Supervisor Roger 
R. Stanton with recall papers and submitted to the county registrar of voters a 
notice of intent to recall Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to reply to the recall as called out in the law and continue my 
efforts to make sure we maximize the value of this investment portfolio and 
make sure it doesn't happen again," said Stanton, a county supervisor for the 
past 13 years. "I invited Mr. Rocha to join me in that effort, but he felt this 
action was more appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Fullerton city employee filed a class-action lawsuit against the county on 
behalf of all government workers with money frozen in one of three county 
retirement funds that were placed in the county's now-bankrupt investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Sgt. David Stanko, an 18-year veteran of the Fullerton 
police force, deposited $22,000 in deferred salary for his retirement with the 
county treasurer's office. Stanko's attorney said the officer is one of 
thousands of government employees in Orange County who had money taken out of 
their paychecks and stashed in the county investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * In an effort to provide cities and school districts with cash, the county 
announced Tuesday that it will distribute property tax payments collected in 
mid-December about a week earlier than normal. Chuck Hulse, the county's chief 
deputy auditor-controller, said the move will allow agencies "to get their 
hands on more money." 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials continued to simmer about the withholding of property tax 
revenue that was placed in the pool before the Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing and has 
since been frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda officials said they may sue the county to gain the $1.7 million in 
property taxes withheld last week. The Huntington Beach City Council will meet 
in closed session today to discuss possible litigation over more than $2 
million withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county agreed to meet today with its largest labor union, the Orange 
County Employees Assn., which wants to block anticipated layoffs. Rival union 
leaders criticized the association for "jumping the gun" and creating friction 
with county leaders. The union also called on the Board of Supervisors to 
borrow money or issue new bonds to make up for the investment fund's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steiner said he will recommend today that $921,000 more be forwarded to 55 
nonprofit agencies that provided services to the county before its bankruptcy 
filing. Coming about a week after the county agreed to pay nearly $3 million to 
more than 100 nonprofit groups, the new request would cover services such as 
witness assistance and emergency housing. Most of it would eventually be 
reimbursed by the state or federal government, Steiner said. Airport's Worth 
</P>
<P>
 As county officials continued to sort through their financial problems and 
what they mean to the future of county government, the idea of having private 
interests run the airport or other agencies took on new appeal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, who first raised the idea of selling the airport in June, 1992, 
during a budget crunch, said the prospects of that happening are now likelier 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was an idea which would be more ripe a year or two down the 
road, never realizing that it would take a bombshell like this to ripen the 
fruit," Stanton said. "It's got to be considered. Anyone offering a billion 
dollars for the airport can have it right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say they have no idea how much the facility would be worth 
if it were sold, but the airport has become increasingly successful in recent 
years. It generated $58.1 million in revenue in fiscal 1994. It has seen an 
increase in flights and passenger loads this year, largely because of the start 
of service by low-fare carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 But a potential sale of the airport could be stymied by requirements that the 
federal government be reimbursed for the millions of dollars it has invested in 
the facility. The deal also could be complicated by the millions of dollars 
more in bonds that have been sold to pay for massive improvements at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 An airport spokeswoman, Courtney C. Wiercioch, said: "If the board requests 
our assistance, we will certainly provide it. However, we believe there are 
federal regulations which may make that option unfeasible." 
</P>
<P>
 Various companies have expressed an interest in buying John Wayne Airport, 
including Lockheed Air Terminal, the Lockheed subsidiary that has managed the 
Burbank airport for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an interest in talking to the county (to see) if we can help them," 
said Viggo Butler, president of Lockheed Air Terminal. List of Properties 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time officials are looking at the airport for possible sale, the 
county's three-member management council has asked the county General Services 
Agency to compile a list of properties that could be sold to make up for lost 
revenue and cash holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely there are discussions going on internally about what assets could 
generate capital," said Chuck West, the agency's real estate director. 
</P>
<P>
 West said he expects to give the management council a list of county assets as 
early as today. Two key parcels, he said, are a 7.7-acre parking lot near the 
Pond in Anaheim that the city leases from the county, and an 11.7-acre parcel 
in Anaheim that houses the offices of the county's agriculture commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest parcels with sale revenue potential cited in the county's annual 
property survey include the 329-acre Joplin Youth Center, a detention facility 
for juvenile offenders in Trabuco Canyon, and 100 acres of undeveloped land 
surrounding the James A. Musick Branch Jail in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is looking specifically for general-fund properties whose sale 
proceeds could be spent at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors. Much of 
the land owned by the county is dedicated to particular needs, such as flood 
control, waste management, harbors, beaches and parks. State law restricts the 
use of any money raised by the sale of such land. Labor Seeks More Say 
</P>
<P>
 As they urged the county to look for new sources of revenue, labor leaders 
continued to press for a greater say in the imposition of $30 million in 
cutbacks announced last week -- cuts that will fall on dozens of county 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors should take positive command to remove the 
bankruptcy from the backs of Orange County citizens and immediately adopt 
revenue measures which will restore the principal lost in the investment pool 
setback," read a letter to supervisors from county employees association 
General Manager John H. Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, meanwhile, the role played by so-called derivative securities 
issued by government-sponsored agencies drew the attention of another federal 
regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates the 
Federal National Mortgage Assn. and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., asked 
those agencies -- whose securities carry an implicit federal guarantee -- for 
information about their disclosures to investors about the risks inherent in 
derivative securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Exotic notes issued by such agencies make up a large share of the derivatives 
bought and still held by the Orange County investment pool. Many of the 
securities were designed to pay higher interest as market interest rates fell. 
But when rates rose, those securities paid out progressively smaller dividends 
throughout 1994, triggering the county's financial debacle.

HOMELESS AID IS CASUALTY OF FISCAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. R. MOEHRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the men and women who find refuge and supper each night in Orange County's 
churches and shelters, the county's complicated financial crisis is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 It translates directly into more hardship: canceled rent assistance, vanished 
job training programs and cold, bland food. 
</P>
<P>
 Some among the homeless can literally taste the aftereffects of risky 
investments that went awry and prompted the biggest municipal bankruptcy case 
in U.S. history, because one program, designed to give them more nutritious 
fare, has been abruptly scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still amazes me how thin they can cut that meat," said one homeless man, 
Jim Enriquez, 43, after finishing a low-budget baloney dinner at a Santa Ana 
shelter. "I just hope (county supervisors) are eating good. I hope they really 
enjoy their meals. They're always welcome to come down here and dine with us." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, much of the public attention in the Orange County financial crisis has 
focused on the irony of an affluent county fighting for its financial life and 
on outrage over school cutbacks and municipal layoffs. But advocates for the 
homeless say the crisis is most severe -- and immediate -- for the 12,000 to 
15,000 Orange County residents who might starve or freeze without county money. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 30 to 50 nonprofit agencies offer services to the homeless countywide, 
and nearly all no longer receive county funds. The list includes the agency 
running emergency shelters at county armories, as well as several running 
rental assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they don't yet know if these programs will get money from 
the county in the future. Some are owed thousands of dollars for services 
rendered before the county filed for bankruptcy court protection, but those 
nonprofit agencies might have to line up in court with thousands of other 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking note of these difficulties, County Supervisor William G. Steiner said 
Tuesday that he would recommend today that about $100,000 be forwarded to 
nonprofit agencies providing shelter to the homeless and others in need of 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 That will come as welcome news to Jim Miller, executive director of a 
nonprofit agency called Shelter for the Homeless that runs a $260,000-program 
at two armories during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If emergency funding from the county doesn't come through, then we're going 
to have to take some drastic steps, including closing one of the armories," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he has been phoning the county for 10 days, frantically trying to 
learn the status of $30,000 that his agency is owed for running two National 
Guard armories for the homeless -- in Santa Ana and Fullerton -- the past three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite leaving repeated messages, Miller said he can't get a county 
representative to call him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said that without the funds, he would be forced to end free shuttles to 
the armories, a service that helped curtail the size of homeless crowds 
congregating in various neighborhoods throughout the county. Next, he would 
have to fire the security guards who make the armories safer for families. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he eventually would be forced to close one of the armories, where 
about 300 men, women and children seek a bed and a hot meal each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Mendoza, the county's homeless-issues coordinator, said Miller's agency 
and others that help the homeless won't know for months where they stand with 
the beleaguered county. But prospects for the homeless are bleak, she said, 
because many rely solely on county funds rather than a mix of public and 
private money. 
</P>
<P>
 Any agency depending solely on the county is facing extinction, she said, as 
the county tries to "prioritize" all expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know the extent of how they're going to be affected," she said of 
nonprofit agencies and their homeless clients. "All I know is, they're at the 
bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 And others may be pushed into homelessness as a result of the financial 
debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Rental assistance programs, which helped struggling people avoid shelters by 
offering no-interest rental loans, have been postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Families on the brink of homelessness still call the agencies that once 
administered $1 million in emergency rental aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to tell them we can't help them right now," said Janine Limas, a 
spokeswoman for Interval House Crisis Shelters, one of the agencies that 
dispensed rental aid. "We've had several people call between this month and 
last month. With the holidays and stuff, it gets tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the funds were frozen, Interval House helped more than 100 people 
escape or avoid homelessness this year, said Limas. 
</P>
<P>
 People who had received eviction notices, as well as those already living on 
the streets, were eligible for the loans. They could use the money to cover the 
first month's rent or moving expenses, whatever spells the difference between 
staying independent and returning to a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great program," Limas said. 
</P>
<P>
 So was the job training program, which gave homeless people skills to build 
careers -- "The stuff that really gets people off the streets," said Tim Shaw, 
executive director of the Homeless Issues Task Force, a county-funded nonprofit 
group that coordinates homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people learned to polish their employment skills or hone their 
resumes thanks to the job training program that now exists somewhere in budget 
limbo, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to compete with other programs that provide "essentials," such as food 
and shelter, Shaw and others said job training can't win. But those who provide 
food and shelter are not having an easy time either. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the crisis, the Orange County Sheriff's Department had agreed to serve 
supper in the armories, which have crude kitchens and no refrigeration systems. 
Under the plan, the Sheriff's Department would make a bit extra each night when 
it prepared meals for the county's thousands of jail inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the plan, Mendoza said, would have been negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the midst of a budget catastrophe, even a few extra pennies were seen 
as an extravagance. So instead of chicken and hamburger and Salisbury steak, 
the homeless will get canned soups and cold sandwiches. For Christmas, they 
made do with a thin beef stew. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (the financial crisis) first came down," said Enriquez, the homeless 
man, "we all said, 'You watch. The first place it's going to hit is the 
homeless.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the day before Christmas Eve, Mendoza stopped at one of the 
armories to find the homeless dining on soup and sandwiches, and it made her 
feel a bit bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the one meal they have per day," she said, "and we always try to make it 
kind of special." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, as a consequence of the budget crisis, the meals will be inferior 
to those served to county jail inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the bottom of the line," Miller said of the homeless. "And that's the 
sad thing about it, because there's a lot of suffering people."

NEWS ANALYSIS; A MIXED MILESTONE FOR CHIEF WILLIAMS; POLICE: HALFWAY INTO TERM, 
HE IS WIDELY POPULAR WITH PUBLIC. BUT MANY OFFICIALS, SUBORDINATES QUESTION HIS 
MANAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Police Chief Willie L. Williams marks the midpoint of his five-year term 
today, he closes the books on a mixed first half: Since arriving in Los 
Angeles, Williams has become the nation's most famous police officer and a 
beloved local figure, but his immense popularity has obscured growing doubts 
about his management of the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a paradoxical record, one in which Williams is accused of 
failing to take command of the department even as his job approval ratings top 
those of every public figure in Los Angeles and affection pours in from 
unexpected quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' force of personality was on display, for instance, when he appeared 
last spring at Cal State L.A. to discuss community-based policing. A group of 
protesters briefly interrupted the session to unfurl banners urging more money 
for education and less for police. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the meeting ended, the same demonstrators rolled up their banners and 
scurried down the auditorium benches for a chance to get their pictures taken 
with the chief. The charismatic Williams signed some autographs, shook some 
hands and answered a few questions. The same demonstrators who came to protest 
police left with keepsakes of their meeting with a cop who surprised them. 
</P>
<P>
 Venture into almost any one of the LAPD's run-down squad rooms, however, and a 
very different picture of the chief emerges. In the Hollywood Division one 
recent afternoon, several officers gathered quietly in a corner, drinking black 
coffee and privately grousing about the man they publicly salute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Suit," they call him, or, even more disparagingly: "His Corpulence." The 
working conditions at the station are dismal, the cars are run-down, even 
pencils and paper are sometimes hard to come by. There's talk of embarking on a 
more community-oriented style of policing, but these officers say they have 
seen little evidence of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the city's political circles, officials admire Williams' ability to woo 
the public and are intensely grateful for his success in restoring confidence 
in the LAPD after the Rodney G. King beating and the 1992 riots. Nevertheless, 
a consensus is building that Williams has been unable to take command of the 
department, has allowed highly touted reforms to languish and has failed to 
communicate a clear message to officers about where the department is headed 
and why. 
</P>
<P>
 All that has fostered an atmosphere of muted fury and quiet despair in the 
upper reaches of the LAPD, where command officers say they are eager to see the 
chief succeed but fear that he has allowed the organization to drift into 
near-paralysis. The rank-and-file police union and the Command Officers' Assn. 
have both talked of holding no-confidence votes, although neither has acted. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams dismisses much of the criticism, arguing that it is too soon to judge 
his record. He maintains that his efforts have been stymied by opposition 
inside the Police Department and that some of his critics are unwilling to 
accept an outsider as police chief -- Williams is the first non-LAPD officer in 
a generation and the first African American to ever command the 7,950-officer 
department. Still, the chief acknowledges that opinion of his performance so 
far is divided. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll talk with some people who will say: 'The chief's doing a good job, or 
he's doing a so-so job,' " Williams said in one of several recent interviews. 
"Others might say, 'When's he going to leave?' But as the chief of police you 
learn you have to live with that. You go through cycles, and it's part of the 
price you pay for sitting in the chair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even Williams' fiercest critics credit him with a historic accomplishment of 
the first order: By dint of his personality and his perseverance, Williams has 
reconstructed public faith in the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 3, 1991, Los Angeles police officers struck and kicked Rodney King, 
not realizing that their actions were being recorded by a resident of a nearby 
apartment complex who had just bought a video camera. The images plunged the 
LAPD into its most tumultuous period ever. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, after three officers and their sergeant were acquitted on all 
but one count, the LAPD came under fire again, this time for moving too slowly 
as rioters tore through Los Angeles. The violence left 53 dead. It also 
shattered the city's confidence in the Police Department and in Williams' 
prickly predecessor, Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams arrived in a still-rattled Los Angeles barely two months after the 
riots. The week he took office, the police contract expired. By then, polls 
showed that more than half of all city residents had lost faith in the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Williams worked tirelessly to change the department's image. 
Copies of his schedules for the past two years reveal a grueling pace of 
sessions with community representatives, meetings with some of the department's 
sternest critics, meeting after meeting in auditoriums, churches, and local 
gathering places. There is barely a neighborhood that Williams has not courted. 
</P>
<P>
 The results have been profound. More than two-thirds of city residents polled 
by The Times last summer said they approved of the job the LAPD is doing. A 
majority of blacks, who historically have been more critical of the LAPD than 
whites have, now say they too approve of their police force. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the result of a lot of hard work," Williams said. "None of that was 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime LAPD observers, including some of critics of the department, say 
Williams deserves enormous credit for that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California, said Williams has won admirers in communities where police 
were previously unwelcome. Police Commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr. 
said he has rarely seen anyone better able to soothe an angry crowd or inspire 
faith in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents South-Central Los Angeles and is 
a member of the council's Public Safety Committee, said Williams "has 
effectively helped lower the tension level between communities throughout the 
city and the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan said Williams' image-building efforts on behalf of the 
LAPD are all a mayor could hope for. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a public leader," Riordan said, "he's fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking command, Williams has pushed for increased hiring of female 
officers and taken a strong rhetorical stand against sexual harassment and 
discrimination in the ranks. He has backed reform of the department under the 
blueprint drawn up by the Christopher Commission in 1991 after the King 
beating. He has supported Riordan's call for more officers and has been handed 
money to pay for new police cars, a new academy and renovations at some of the 
department's most run-down stations. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other areas, critics say, Williams has been a big disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city payments for excessive-force lawsuits are down, complaints of 
police brutality continue -- Michael Zinzun of the Coalition Against Police 
Abuse says his organization still fields three to four a day, about the same as 
before Williams took office. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-ballyhooed community policing effort remains nascent and Riordan's 
Police Department expansion plan already is behind schedule. Even in the area 
of sexual harassment and discrimination, where Williams' rhetoric has been 
strong, progress has been slow. In a rare public confrontation with the chief, 
the Police Commission forged ahead with its own special investigative unit 
despite Williams' reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there have been accomplishments: A new LAPD training facility is 
nearly complete; the department has stepped up its hiring; a comprehensive 
review of the LAPD's basic car areas, a prerequisite to citywide community 
policing, is complete and new cars are being assigned; promotions, which had 
been frozen, are at last going forward; construction on new police stations, 
stalled for years, now appears on the verge of commencing. 
</P>
<P>
 But many observers say Williams has failed to take full advantage of the 
public and political support he has enjoyed since taking over. The problem, 
supporters and critics agree, has been the chief's slowness to develop an 
effective management style. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to evaluate the management skills of his police chief, Riordan started 
by using himself as an example. "I'm a manager who delegates," the mayor said. 
"I don't have the time or luxury to focus in on the details of matters. What I 
can do is come up with ideas and delegate them and supervise. That's a style 
that the chief is learning. I think he's had a little trouble learning it, but 
I think he's doing well at that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, Riordan and his staff have pushed Williams to move faster 
on the expansion plan -- intervention that contributed to the biggest 
controversy of the chief's tenure. Responding to the criticism of his 
management, Williams in September demoted Assistant Chief Bernard Parks, one of 
the LAPD's most senior officials. 
</P>
<P>
 After a messy back-room struggle in which some City Council members went to 
bat for Parks, the subordinate accepted the demotion but got a raise. Today, he 
remains a member of Williams' command staff, relegated to the periphery of 
decision-making but still in a powerful position. Relations between him and 
Williams are frosty on a good day, department insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Commission has been intensively monitoring the chief's performance 
for the last year and is compiling an evaluation that sources say will take 
Williams to task on several fronts, faulting him for failing to assertively 
manage the department and for not communicating his program to underlings, 
among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be a completely positive review," said Commissioner Gary 
Greenebaum, although he declined to comment on the specifics. "He knows we are 
not entirely happy with his management." 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources in and around the Police Department, three areas in 
particular have raised questions about Williams' stewardship. The department's 
slow progress on certain reforms advocated by the Christopher Commission and 
its failure to keep pace with LAPD expansion goals top the list. In addition, 
LAPD morale remains low despite the resolution of the police contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The first area is of most concern to department critics, many of whom see the 
Christopher Commission reforms as the key to producing an LAPD more firmly 
under civilian control and one in which excessive-force cases are far less 
frequent. Despite Williams' rhetorical support for the package of reforms, many 
remain unfulfilled. For instance, a computer system to keep track of police 
discipline still is not in place, there is no routine psychological testing for 
officers and training techniques are far from what the Police Commission would 
like to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was hired to usher in such reforms, and some backers are discouraged 
by the lack of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there some personal disappointment about that?" asked Joe R. Hicks, 
executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Council of Greater Los 
Angeles. "Of course there is. . . . I would like to have seen him be more of a 
workhorse for reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams retorted: "I think I have been a bigger workhorse for reform than 
Chief Gates was in his entire 14 years." He cites accomplishments including 
changes in the disciplinary system, installation of video cameras in some 
police cars and creation of civilian police advisory boards throughout the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 If reform is Williams' mandate, Police Department expansion is Riordan's. 
Elected on a pledge to add 3,000 officers to the LAPD within four years, 
Riordan announced after being sworn in that he was counting on Williams to 
develop a plan to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams at first was publicly skeptical, saying it was risky to add so many 
officers so fast. But he directed his staff to draft a plan, and when Riordan 
eventually released a scaled-down version of his promise, it bore the Police 
Department's imprimatur. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the plan is behind schedule, handicapped mainly by a high attrition 
rate that bleeds away gains in hiring. Most observers concede that even the 
more modest goal of 2,855 officers in five years is unlikely to be met. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to demonstrate the seriousness of the expansion goals, commission 
President Hernandez has posted two wall charts in the commission meeting 
offices, one measuring the goals, the other reflecting the reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department," said Hernandez, "has languished a bit longer than I would 
have liked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams has detractors outside the LAPD, nowhere is the criticism of 
him more scathing than within the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of officers' grievances seems endless. Most of the complaints are 
about working conditions and promotions. But some of the complaints are more 
personal and pointed: Out of the earshot of supervisors, officers routinely 
swap stories about the latest slights, real or imagined, that they attribute to 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The anger reached a flash point in October, when Officer Charles Heim, a 
popular policeman from the elite Metropolitan Division, was shot and killed in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Heim was killed on a Friday night, and it was not until Sunday that Williams, 
who had been celebrating his 28th wedding anniversary with his wife in Las 
Vegas, appeared back in Los Angeles. Officers say the delay was unforgivable, 
and it sparked a mutinous outcry that began in Hollywood and quietly spread 
through the ranks, escaping public notice but building within the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers of Hollywood Division have lost all respect for Chief Williams," 
one civilian employee wrote to the chief. "All agree that it is difficult to 
follow someone when that someone shows no concern for the people he commands." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams calls the author of that letter "misinformed, misguided and way off 
base." In fact, Williams said, he did not return sooner from his trip because 
the families of the slain officer and of another who was wounded in the 
shooting were too grief-stricken to see him immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "To indicate that the chief didn't care was outrageous," Williams said. "I 
found the tone of that letter insulting." 
</P>
<P>
 But fallout from the incident continues. Hernandez, who holds regular 
brown-bag lunches with officers, said he is often asked about Williams' failure 
to return immediately after the Heim shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction, Hernandez added, might have been different had the chief been 
more successful at cultivating good will in the ranks. To the contrary, 
however, LAPD observers say that morale remains distressingly low. 
</P>
<P>
 Police commissioners, high-ranking officers and leaders of the Police 
Protective League say responsibility for that rests with Williams. Dennis Zine, 
a director of the league, said his union's officers recognize that Williams has 
"made headway with the community, but they don't feel like he's with them. They 
need a chief who will go to battle for them." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed that the morale is as low as it is," Hernandez said. "I 
believe from my many discussions that there is a vacuum of a clearly understood 
strategic direction for the department. Until there is a clear direction, I 
think there will continue to be a morale problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams concedes that morale is low but attributes most of it to the long 
struggle for a police contract, which was finally concluded last fall. He also 
blames mid-level department officials for failing to communicate to the troops 
the full extent of the LAPD's accomplishments under him. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people in the department who are managers and a lot of people who 
are elected officials don't take the time to look at what we've accomplished," 
he said, listing developments ranging from gains in the number of women on the 
force to the dramatic overhaul of the LAPD's public image. "We've tackled more 
issues in the last 2 1/2 years than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the chief has offended yet another faction within the department by 
supporting a ballot measure that would remove Civil Service protections for 
upper-echelon officers in the LAPD. That would give Williams much more 
flexibility in promoting and demoting his top staff, but the proposal has 
infuriated the Command Officers' Assn., which was not consulted before Williams 
announced his position and which convened an emergency meeting last week to 
discuss its response. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnout at that meeting was huge, and the mood was surly, according to 
officers who attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more militant officers wanted to confront Williams openly, calling 
for an immediate vote of no-confidence in his leadership. They were talked out 
of that, at least for now. But even moderates among the command staff expect 
1995 to bring more bitter confrontations between Williams and his inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is the first LAPD chief subject to term limits enacted by voters as 
part of a 1992 police reform measure. His five-year term can be renewed once if 
the Police Commission is satisfied with his performance and the City Council 
concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps surprisingly, in light of his unrivaled popularity outside the LAPD, 
there even is some private speculation that unless Williams takes firmer 
control of the department, he might not be reappointed when his term expires in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Police commissioners decline to speculate on Williams' prospects for another 
term, saying only that they expect him to improve his performance in the coming 
months: "We're all just waiting to see him work the same magic inside that he 
has worked with the public," Greenebaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, both the mayor and the chief continue to speak as if Williams 
will stay on until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he keeps doing the job he's doing, I'd very much like to see him continue 
on," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Williams, who is periodically rumored to be a candidate for various 
high-level law enforcement jobs in Washington or Sacramento, said he has no 
interest in leaving the city or the LAPD any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly would like to do another term, and at this point I expect to do 
another term," he said last week. "I expect to finish my public service career 
here in Los Angeles, but I don't expect that to happen for several more years."

5 FELONS SEEK REDEMPTION AND CHICAGO COUNCIL SEATS; POLITICS: MARION BARRY 
VICTORY SETS PRECEDENT. THEY'LL BE TESTING A STATE LAW BARRING THEM FROM 
RUNNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a city where politics is often played as a game of organized revenge and 
human frailty is not something one tends to advertise, an unlikely new theme is 
being bruited about by hardened operatives -- the politics of redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a cue from the strategy that swept Washington Mayor Marion Barry back 
into office last fall despite his federal misdemeanor cocaine possession 
conviction, five Chicagoans with criminal histories are now seeking their own 
public salvation, vying for seats on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 They have declared their intentions despite a new Illinois state law that 
seeks to block felons from running for municipal office. But a respectable body 
of legal opinion in the state suggests that the law may prove unconstitutional 
because it provides a stricter standard for municipal offices than it does for 
statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The felon candidates will learn how the state will react today as 278 rivals 
for 50 council seats play a municipal lottery to determine their positions on 
the Feb. 28 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The former convicts' noisy insistence of their right to run has become the 
talk of a town long accustomed to seeing its politicians become felons, but now 
startled by the attempt to reverse the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Barry can do it, why can't we do it?" said Tom Hendrix, a Democratic 
candidate for alderman who served four years in federal prison for conspiracy 
to solicit murder for hire. "I made my mistake, like a lot of people do. But 
are we supposed to pay for it, over and over, the rest of our lives?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is a question posed, too, by Wallace Davis Jr., a former alderman who 
served four years on corruption charges and now owns a catfish restaurant on 
Chicago's West Side. Davis said he wants to return to the council because he 
"got a call" from his constituents -- just as Marion Barry did. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Davis' rivals is Walter Burnett Jr., a convicted armed robber who told 
the Chicago Sun-Times: "I was a kid. Everyone makes mistakes in life." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3rd ward, two other council rivals share a criminal past. Tyrone 
Kenner, yet another ex-alderman who served time on corruption charges, faces 
Wallace (Gator) Bradley, a convicted armed robber and burglar who has been a 
prominent spokesman for 21st Century V.O.T.E., a rising political action group 
with ties to the Gangster Disciples, one of Chicago's most notorious street 
gangs and narcotics organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers who have spent years clamoring for tougher laws and government 
action against corruption insist that the state law barring felons from running 
is one of the few institutional checks against graft that works in a political 
culture with a poor collective memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems to me we should applaud having come up with a way of ensuring that if 
you're convicted of a felony, you're out," said Terry Breuner, a former federal 
prosecutor and now president of the city's reform-minded Better Government 
Assn. "We shouldn't be going in the other direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois is now one of 21 states that have laws barring felons from running 
for office. Most of the laws have been on the books for generations, reflecting 
a traditional American sternness toward the rights of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only doing what a lot of other places do," said Andrew Raucci, a 
lobbyist and attorney who specializes in election law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature made the law apply to municipal elections in Illinois, but was 
careful to exempt all state elected posts -- allowing one of their own 
colleagues, state Rep. Coy Pugh, once convicted on car theft, shoplifting and 
heroin possession charges, to continue running for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven B. Snyder, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer who has researched the 
history of state laws barring felons from running for office, said the 
exemption "might well be looked at by the courts as a constitutional weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 And if voters show a strong preference for a candidate with a criminal past, 
Snyder said, "in a democracy, who the hell are we to argue?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick Sawyer, a lawyer representing council candidate Bradley, complained 
Tuesday that the law was an attempt to derail the growing political muscle of 
groups like 21st Century V.O.T.E. and others that cater "to the 
disenfranchised. Let the people decide." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the message Tom Hendrix plans to bring to voters in Chicago's 1st Ward 
if he gets the chance to run. "I think redemption is very important," he said. 
"You can't try us again for something we already paid for." 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, Hendrix, now 37, held a patronage job working for a 
Polish-American neighborhood political machine organization. But he quit in 
anger during an argument with the local ward boss and several years later, was 
arrested and convicted on federal charges after talking with an undercover 
informant about killing a witness who was planning to testify against his 
brother in another criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Hendrix explained, "I was addicted to cocaine and alcohol and I 
had no control over myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Now on leave from his job as director of operations for a security firm, 
Hendrix rekindled a passion for politics in -- of all places -- Chicago's 1st 
Ward, a downtown neighborhood with a 60-year reputation for corruption 
stretching back to the days of Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
 One former law enforcement official noted drily that Hendrix "might be a 
considerable improvement" over such 1st-Ward characters as Fred Roti, a former 
23-year alderman convicted in 1993 on bribery charges, and John D'Arco, a 
former ward boss long tied to organized crime by police investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he were to win, Tom Hendrix or any of the other felon candidates might 
find themselves faced with a new problem. The state law barring felons from 
running for office appears to also prevent them from serving, said James 
Scanlon, a legal adviser to Chicago's Board of Elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a question whether they could hold office even if the voters elect 
them," Scanlon said. "That's something we'll probably only find out in court."

HIJACKERS HAD PUT DYNAMITE ON FRENCH JET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four Muslim extremists killed by French paramilitary forces Monday had 
planted dynamite in the Air France jetliner they hijacked, apparently intending 
to at least threaten to blow up the plane carrying them and 170 hostages as it 
flew over Paris, French investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 sticks of dynamite connected to detonators were found in bunches 
under one seat near the cockpit and under another in the midsection of the 
wide-body Airbus A-300. That was enough, said French Interior Minister Charles 
Pasqua, "to blow the plane to bits in mid-flight." 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation offered the first strong evidence of the ultimate goal of the 
hijackers, who commandeered the Paris-bound airplane on the airport tarmac in 
Algeria's capital Saturday and were killed 54 hours later in Marseilles in a 
daring French police commando raid in which 25 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 And it suggested the lengths to which the hijackers, members of the Armed 
Islamic Group fighting the military-backed government in Algeria, were willing 
to carry their demand that France end its support for the Algerian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the standoff in Marseilles, where the plane arrived before dawn 
Monday, French negotiators had refused to meet the hijackers' demand that the 
jet be refueled and allowed to fly to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasqua said Tuesday that authorities had strong suspicions, after receiving an 
anonymous tip from a caller to a French consulate in Algeria and questioning 
some of the 63 hostages released Saturday, that the heavily armed hijackers had 
dynamite and planned "a suicide mission over Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 The authorities also were suspicious of the hijackers' request for nearly 
three times the amount of fuel that would be necessary to fly to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Pasqua decided that the only 
option was to keep the plane in Marseilles and use the elite "intervention 
force" of the national police to end the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijackers, who already had killed three hostages in Algiers, had set a 5 
p.m. deadline Monday for being allowed to fly to Paris, where they said they 
wanted to hold a news conference. So determined were French authorities to keep 
the plane on the ground in Marseilles that they offered to take television 
crews on board "so (the hijackers) could make their declarations," Pasqua told 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly after 5 p.m., when one of the hijackers pointed a weapon out a 
cockpit window and fired at the control tower, the black-uniformed police moved 
in, killing the gunmen and freeing the hostages in a seven-minute operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Tuesday that they weren't sure whether the hijackers would have 
carried out the suicide mission. But they said the guerrillas may have intended 
to use the threat of detonating those explosives in a fuel-laden plane, over a 
metropolitan area of 8 million, to press the French government to withdraw 
support for the rulers in its former colony. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the violence in Algeria continued Tuesday when four Roman Catholic 
priests, three French and one Belgian, were killed by assailants that the 
Algerian government said are Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas. The four 
priests, members of an order known as the White Fathers, were shot to death in 
Tizi Ouzou, 70 miles east of Algiers. The assailants escaped, and no group has 
yet claimed responsibility for the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The most radical anti-foreigner guerrillas battling to install Islamic rule in 
Algeria are members of the hijackers' organization, the Armed Islamic Group, or 
GIA. It says it wants to purge the North African nation -- which won 
independence in 1962 after 114 years of French colonial rule -- of Western 
influences. And it has repeatedly pressed the French government to halt its 
economic and political support of the Algerian regime, which seized power by 
force three years ago when an Islamic party won the first round of 
parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people have been killed, many in 
clashes between the Algerian government and Islamic fundamentalists. Of more 
than 70 foreigners killed, 24 have been French expatriates. 
</P>
<P>
 President Francois Mitterrand held a reception Tuesday in Paris to honor the 
50-member police unit that freed the hostages, and he expressed "the nation's 
gratitude" for its actions. Earlier, officers were applauded by hostage 
families awaiting the return of their loved ones at Orly Airport outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those injured in the raid, 16 were passengers and crew members and nine 
were police officers. Eight of the police had gunshot wounds, and one lost 
several fingers on his right hand in a grenade explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, France's top terrorist prosecutor began interviewing the hostages. 
And the leader of the hijackers was identified by the police Tuesday as 
Abdallah Yahia, head of one of the more militant cells of the GIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijacking marked the most serious intrusion of the Algerian conflict in 
France, which is home to about 1 million Algerians. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 15 months, police have stepped up their efforts to identify 
supporters of the Algerian guerrilla movements in France and have expelled 
several dozen suspected terrorists. Human rights groups have complained, 
though, that the crackdown has given police a free hand to harass all 
foreigners of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Although France recognizes the Algerian government, it has urged that 
country's leaders to negotiate with the militants.

YELTSIN DEFENDS CONTINUATION OF CHECHNYA WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered Russian forces Tuesday to continue 
disarming the rebel fighters of Chechnya, and he defended the war against the 
Muslim republic as necessary to end the violence and instability of an outlaw 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reign of banditry on Chechen soil poses a danger to our entire country," 
Yeltsin said in a nationally televised address, his first speech explaining why 
he sent thousands of troops into the tiny republic Dec. 11 to crush Chechnya's 
3-year-old bid for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "No territory has the right to secede from Russia," Yeltsin declared, saying 
that Chechnya is an "indivisible" part of Russia under the constitution adopted 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Yeltsin sought to reassure the Chechen people, who suffered 
under Russian rule in czarist and Soviet times, by promising that "Russia is 
not an enemy to the Muslims" and will respect Chechnya's unique traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The president made it plain that Russia will not rest until the Chechen rebels 
and foreign mercenaries alleged to be fighting alongside them are disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law and order on the territory of the Chechen Republic will be restored," 
Yeltsin promised. "Grozny should be cleansed of criminal elements shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence sources said a major attack on Grozny, the besieged capital, is 
expected before Saturday. Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai D. Yegorov said the 
cleanup operation in Chechnya is to be completed within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 In a gesture to the many Russians who have reacted with revulsion to televised 
footage of the carnage inflicted on civilians by Russian air strikes, Yeltsin 
ordered the military to halt "bombing raids that can cause casualties among the 
peaceful population of Grozny." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the bombing of Grozny was halted several days ago, although Chechen 
authorities reported Russian air strikes on outlying villages Monday and 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Yeltsin held an olive branch in one hand, the Kremlin's other hand was 
still clenched in a fist. An unnamed military official quickly gave warning 
that the presidential order not to bomb Grozny did not mean that Chechnya's 
skies are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as weather conditions permit," the Russian air force plans to attack 
Chechen positions with laser-guided missiles, a tactic that "practically rules 
out casualties among civilians" because the missiles are accurate to within 
three yards, a senior Defense Ministry official told the Interfax news agency 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A unit of elite Omon riot police was dispatched to Chechnya on Tuesday to take 
part in the "second phase" of the Russian military operation, that of restoring 
order in Grozny, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. The feared Omon troops 
have been used to crush rebellions and riots, and they stormed the Russian 
Parliament building in Moscow in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin insisted that a political settlement is still possible. He 
authorized three senior officials to negotiate with the Chechens for a 
cease-fire and disarmament. That offer has been made before by Moscow and 
repeatedly rejected by Chechen President Dzhokar M. Dudayev, who has demanded a 
Russian withdrawal before his forces lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev remained defiant Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We propose, while there is still time, an immediate withdrawal of troops from 
Chechen territory," Dudayev said in an interview in Grozny before Yeltsin's 
speech. "Chechnya does not want to shed the blood of Russian soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Baiting the Russian bear as he has consistently since coming to power in 1991, 
Dudayev was shown on Russian television Tuesday giving an interview to a 
Turkish reporter in which he called on Ankara to supply Chechnya with warplanes 
capable of bombing Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me some airplanes who may fly to Moscow and I (will) attack," the former 
Soviet air force general said in English, arguing that Turkey should help a 
Muslim neighbor defend itself against Russian bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has vied with Turkey for centuries over influence in the strategic 
Caucasus region, and the plea for Turkish intervention in what Russia considers 
an exclusively internal affair seemed calculated to enrage the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 In Grozny, residents emerged from hiding in their basements Tuesday and went 
out in search of food and water. Kiosks and small markets reopened, but the 
city reportedly remained without electricity or running water. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting continued in at least five areas outside the city. Russian 
authorities said two more Russian soldiers had been killed, bringing the 
official toll to 44 dead and 147 wounded. But casualty figures on both sides of 
the conflict are considered to be of dubious accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen officials claimed to have captured 16 Russian prisoners after fierce 
fighting near the city of Argun. They said Dudayev's 23-year-old son, Avgur, 
was seriously wounded during a Chechen attack on Russian positions there. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian authorities said armed Chechen "gangs" in many areas have taken to 
wearing Russian military uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian government press service alleged that busloads of refugees trying 
to flee Grozny have been turned around and sent to Freedom Square in downtown 
Grozny, where they are being kept as human shields in case Grozny is stormed. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no independent confirmation of this, and Russian official 
information has proved highly unreliable in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a press-freedom watchdog group protested "outrageous violation of 
journalists' rights of access to comprehensive and authentic information," the 
pressuring of journalists to make their reports more sympathetic to Moscow and 
other violations of the Russian constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin's response was more of the same. A reorganization of the official 
press service was announced that put Deputy Prime Minister Sergei M. Shakhrai 
in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin has ample reason to worry about negative media coverage. A poll 
released Tuesday found that 75% of Russians disapproved of Yeltsin's actions as 
president, up from 70% in September, Interfax reported. The poll surveyed 1,602 
Russians across the nation and was conducted Dec. 16-20, before the intensive 
bombing of Grozny began. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin promised to step up humanitarian aid to Chechnya, rebuild its schools 
and hospitals, restore postal service and telephones, and pay pensioners who 
have not received their benefits for months or years. All the money Moscow has 
allocated for such purposes has been diverted by the Dudayev regime to buy 
weapons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg N. Soskovets estimated that it will cost a 
trillion rubles -- about $285 million -- to rebuild Chechnya's shattered 
economy. The first priority will be restoring severed railroad service, he 
said.

COLUMN ONE; WITCH HUNTS: THE FATAL PRICE OF FEAR; SUPERSTITION SPURS A 
POST-APARTHEID SURGE IN SLAYINGS IN SOUTH AFRICA. FEW SPEAK OUT TO HELP THOSE 
ACCUSED OF SORCERY OR TO CATCH THEIR KILLERS.

<P>
 By all accounts, the mobs were deliberate, determined and deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 In Leeuwfontein, they dragged an 82-year-old grandmother from her home, put a 
gasoline-soaked tire around her neck and burned her alive. In Inverane, they 
marched two women to a riverbank, stoned them to death and torched their 
battered bodies. And in Moraphalala, an elderly woman was painfully poisoned to 
death and then heaved into her blazing hut. 
</P>
<P>
 The four grisly deaths earlier this month in different parts of rural South 
Africa had several things in common: The women were all accused of being 
witches. The killers were almost certainly their own friends and neighbors. And 
the slayings were not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 In this year of liberation, when democracy dawned and the evil of apartheid 
ended in South Africa, an ancient crime has made an ugly comeback. At least 100 
accused witches have been incinerated or stoned to death in 1994, sometimes by 
their husbands and children. 
</P>
<P>
 But the toll is misleading. More than one-third of the deaths occurred in the 
impoverished Seshego district, near Pietersburg. And local police Col. Mohlabi 
Tlomatsana concedes that "only a tiny proportion has been reported. The real 
problem is decidedly worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of those accused of casting evil spells, raising the dead or using 
supernatural powers were killed. Many were forced to flee their villages, had 
their homes burned and children chased from school, or took refuge with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of accused witches and their families now live in Witches Hill, a kind 
of refugee camp for the damned, in a police-sponsored witches protection 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an eerie place. Slithering lizards, gnarled cactus and razor-sharp thorn 
bushes line the sun-seared slope. Dust devils twirl in a bone-dry wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said I bewitched two women," said one resident, Lina Ngoepe, a 
60-year-old woman with an engaging smile and piercing eyes. "It was just pure 
jealousy. But they accused me of being a witch." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors banished the Ngoepe family from the town of Early Dawn and torched 
their spacious six-room home. They moved to a one-room, mud-walled shanty here 
in September after living five months in a tent at a police station. A heap of 
charred window frames and a broken sewing machine are the only remnants of 
their former life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expelled by the community," Ngoepe said sadly. "It was an injustice. 
They were so cruel to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have arrested hundreds of people for witch-related murder, assault and 
arson but have won few convictions. Villagers rarely agree to cooperate or 
testify in court. Some fear reprisals. But most simply applaud the vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel the people who have murdered the witch have done the community a 
favor," said Koos Van Der Heever, a Pietersburg lawyer who specializes in 
witchcraft cases. "If you don't participate in the killing, it's an offense 
according to traditional law. So the whole village shares the guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 This grim side of the new South Africa is centered in Pietersburg in the vast 
northern Transvaal region north of Pretoria, especially in the dirt-poor, 
largely illiterate former black "homeland" of Lebowa. "Eighty percent of all 
murder cases in our region involve witchcraft," Van Der Heever said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that the desolate, treeless hills of the high veldt draw 
dramatic displays of lightning. Each summer, fierce thunderstorms shoot bolt 
after blinding bolt onto the grassy scrub, giant boulder piles and hapless 
hamlets. Scores are killed each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever someone is killed by lightning, we get a witch-burning," said police 
investigator Willem Faurie. "Always. People say there is bad witchcraft in the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers blame witches for misfortune, like a road accident, or for events 
they cannot explain, like cancer or epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
 But some secretly settle family feuds, target business competitors or simply 
express envy for a neighbor's prosperity by accusing the person of witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In one recent case, a long-destitute man was forced to flee the town of 
Bayswater after his two sons got jobs in the city and sent him money. When he 
suddenly bought furniture, his neighbors accused him of using zombies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even old age is suspect. "If a woman reaches 85 or 90, they say: 'A normal 
person can't get so old. She must be a witch,' " Faurie said. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the village elders convene a tribal court if witchcraft is 
suspected. Every family must contribute to hire a special witch hunter called a 
nyanga , usually from outside the tribal area, to "sniff" out the demon. He 
gives the instigators a hallucinogenic potion to drink and then tells them to 
shout out the witch's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the suspected sorcerer is simply banished. More often, an angry mob 
of youths uses the agony of fire to exorcise the evil spirit forever. Women are 
usually the victims, but a man is sometimes targeted as a wizard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kill him, his wife and his goats," Faurie said. "They set fire to the 
house. Then they throw the bodies inside, and throw the dogs, cats and anything 
else alive into the fire. If his car is there, they burn that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Witch hunts aren't new in South Africa. But the gruesome reports of trial by 
fire have given pause to the new government. For one thing, the tense 
transition from apartheid to democracy sparked a witch-burning epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The assumption was the new South Africa should be free, even free from 
superstition and traditional beliefs," said sociologist Anthony Minnaar, a 
witchcraft expert at the Human Sciences Research Council in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "So gangs of militant, politicized youths went around saying now is the time 
to get rid of witches once and for all," he said. "They held tribal courts 
where anyone could accuse anyone else of being a witch. There was mass 
hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials have repeatedly condemned the attacks. Because many local 
police are also terrified of witches, a multi-agency police task force was 
created to investigate and prosecute what a spokesman called "this barbaric 
scourge." 
</P>
<P>
 But the deaths have been an unsettling reminder that one of South Africa's 
deepest divisions is between traditional beliefs and modern ways. The national 
government hopes to bridge the gap by incorporating traditional healers and 
herbalists into the formal health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Western-trained doctors are skeptical at best. In a report released this 
month, the Medical Assn. of South Africa estimated that 80% of the black 
population regularly consults the country's 200,000 traditional healers. The 
cultural barriers may be insurmountable, the group warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traditional healer shares with the patient a view of the world and the 
way it works which is completely alien to the non-African, Western-oriented 
health care worker, in particular with regard to the nature and causation of 
disease," the report said. "This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for 
Western doctors or nurses to understand all those aspects of the patient which 
are essential to really effective medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 Academics struggle to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Thornton, head of anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand, 
compares witch hunts to lawsuits in America. "People (in the United States) sue 
because of problems of childbirth, or an operation going wrong, or accidentally 
falling into a hole," he said. "It's a search for blame. It's the same with 
witches. It's a denial of the fact that misfortune does happen, and it happens 
on a random basis." 
</P>
<P>
 As in many countries, superstition is pervasive in South Africa. University 
students routinely scar themselves with razors before exams to ward off evil 
spirits. Businessmen pay witches for spells to prevent accidents in a new car. 
Millions raise their beds on bricks to guard against sinister, sex-mad trolls 
called tokoloshes.  
</P>
<P>
 But there is a more ominous side. Johannesburg, for example, abounds with muti 
shops, which sell animal potions and herbal brews for cures and spells. 
Although obviously illegal, some shops also sell human body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 One major supplier was a local police morgue. A sergeant was arrested last 
month and charged with hawking hearts, brains, genitals and other body parts 
from a Johannesburg mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the most powerful muti is believed to come from children, 
especially girls. "In the townships, there are little girls that go missing 
every week," Minnaar said. "It's presumed they're used for ritual murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Murder was real, not presumed, on Dec. 18 in Inverane, about 60 miles from 
Pietersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people have been charged with leading a mob of about 350 people who beat 
two women to death with rocks and sticks by a dry riverbed. They then burned 
the naked bodies on a pyre. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and witnesses say a man who returned to Inverane from Johannesburg for 
the holidays incited the slaying when he suddenly accused 38-year-old Mmaapholo 
Matlabo of killing his mother and another woman and turning them into zombies 
six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The village chief called a meeting of the kgoro, or tribal court, to consider 
the charges. Matlabo denied she was a witch but was ordered to take the man to 
his long-dead mother. If she could, she was a witch. If she couldn't, she was 
disobeying village elders. Either way, it was a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The kgoro deputized a small group to accompany the woman. But other youths 
armed with sticks quickly joined in, and the surging mob soon paraded her down 
the dusty street. Apparently hoping to escape, she blamed her neighbor, 
54-year-old Manolobane Nkgoeng. 
</P>
<P>
 Nkgoeng's 22-year-old daughter, Florina, watched in terror as the mob then 
took her mother and Matlabo half a mile to the riverbank. "I could not scream 
because I was so afraid," she recalled. "I could not stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she knew anyone in the crowd, her eyes grew wide. "I could not 
recognize them," she said quickly, looking nervously at the ground. "There were 
so many." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Joseph Nkgoeng, 67, sat beside her and stroked his white mustache. 
His wife was not a witch, he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 But his face was expressionless until his visitor got up to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family is gone!" he suddenly cried. "Now, my family is gone."

U.S. SAYS ISRAEL GAVE COMBAT JET PLANS TO CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years ago, in the face of mounting costs, the United States withdrew 
from an elaborate project to help build an advanced combat aircraft for Israel. 
The idea was scrubbed -- or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to the consternation of U.S. officials, much of the American know-how and 
initial planning for the canceled "Lavi" fighter plane are about to be put to 
use in China. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. government officials have recently concluded that China and Israel are 
collaborating to develop and produce an improved fighter for the Chinese air 
force. Comparable to an American F-16, the new plane will be based on the Lavi 
and will incorporate extensive technological innovations derived from that 
project, according to U.S. government experts on the Chinese military. 
</P>
<P>
 China and Israel already have finished work on a prototype, and production 
will probably start soon at a plant in the Sichuan province capital of Chengdu, 
U.S. officials said. The plane's deployment is seen as a major step in 
Beijing's effort to modernize its air force, and some observers believe it has 
negative implications for China's longstanding rival, Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plane would fit in with a scenario for (conflict over) Taiwan 10 years 
from now," one U.S. government expert said. "And for someone to help the 
Chinese build a production line, a turnkey facility, for this aircraft is 
ominous." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government's confirmation of Israel's role in developing the new 
Chinese plane could create tensions between Washington and the Jewish state. 
The joint work on the plane is the latest in a series of military projects in 
which Israel has helped China over the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although China's impending production of the Lavi-style fighter has been 
closely monitored and discussed in the U.S. intelligence community in recent 
months, White House and State Department officials say there has been no 
official diplomatic protest to Israel about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Administration officials are said to believe the issue is of no great 
concern. While the plane represents a big step forward for China, they say, it 
is based on 1980s-era technology and will not be placed in service for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Klemow, vice president for government affairs of Israeli Aircraft 
Industries International, the Washington subsidiary of Israel's state-owned 
export firm, denied that his company is transferring U.S. technology to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "IAI does not transfer any technology illegally. Any U.S. technology that 
requires a license (from the United States), we apply for that license," Klemow 
said. "And we have not applied for any license for any Lavi-associated 
technology for China." 
</P>
<P>
 Klemow would not say whether his company is providing China with other, 
non-American aircraft technology from the Lavi project. "We never confirm or 
deny who we do business with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An official at the Israeli Embassy in Washington also denied that Israel had 
passed on U.S. technology based on the Lavi. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, there was speculation that China and Israel were working 
together on a new plane based on technology from the Lavi project. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first report that the plane is nearing production came in November in 
a British aviation publication, Flight International. U.S. officials confirmed 
that report in recent interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plane is in the prototype stage. The prototype has been built," one U.S. 
official said. "It is a very capable aircraft. It uses extensive U.S. 
technology." The official said the combat fighter will be ready for 
flight-testing in about a year and will be in full service in China's air force 
about a decade from now. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, which China intends to call the F-10 fighter, represents the latest 
in a prolonged effort by Beijing to obtain modern combat planes and to be able 
to manufacture them on its own soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of China's current combat planes are 1960s-era aircraft based on Soviet 
designs. In 1986, the Ronald Reagan Administration agreed to provide modern-day 
electronics, navigation and radar equipment for some of those Chinese planes in 
a $550-million project called Peace Pearl. The project was suspended when the 
George Bush Administration imposed sanctions on military sales to China after 
the 1989 Tian An Men Square crackdown. China, which became increasingly 
irritated by mounting costs associated with Peace Pearl, pulled out of the deal 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after Peace Pearl's cancellation that China turned to Israel, 
apparently aiming to obtain indirectly some of the American-style military 
technology it could not obtain from the United States itself. The principal 
U.S. defense firm in the aborted Peace Pearl project, Grumman Corp., was 
heavily involved in the Lavi project too, according to U.S. experts. 
</P>
<P>
 By producing the new plane, China's once-antiquated air force will take a 
quantum leap forward, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, China can't establish air superiority even over China itself. 
India has a better air force than China does," one U.S. official said. "But 10 
years from now, China will be able to establish air superiority over all of 
China's territory, and also over the periphery of China, in places like Vietnam 
and the South China Sea." 
</P>
<P>
 China has made extensive territorial claims in the South China Sea, 
particularly in the Spratly Islands, many of which are claimed by other 
countries in the region, including Vietnam and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, in the first big step toward modernization of its air force, 
China bought 26 Sukhoi-27 advanced jet fighters from Russia. U.S. experts said 
the Russian planes have a longer range than the F-10 China is about to build. 
But the F-10 will be faster and will have a greater ability to intercept enemy 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "A competent air force would need both of them, just like we have the F-16s 
and F-15s," one U.S. official said. "The SU-27 fits for a scenario involving 
the Spratlys. The F-10 would fit in better with a scenario for Taiwan 10 years 
from now." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the SU-27 deal, in which China simply purchased jet fighters made in 
Russia, the new project with Israel will give China the ability to manufacture 
its own advanced jet fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Flight International, officials of Israel Aircraft Industries 
have helped guide the way for the Chinese air force to develop and produce the 
plane under a contract signed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 15 years, China has established itself as the biggest customer 
for Israel's arms export industry. The first public demonstration of this 
cooperation came in a Chinese National Day parade in 1984 when foreign military 
attaches in Beijing were surprised to find Israeli guns, cannons and electronic 
equipment mounted on top of Chinese tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. laws forbid Israel to pass on to another country any military technology 
obtained directly from the United States. Any company that violates those laws 
can be suspended from doing military business in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is often difficult to prove conclusively that U.S. technology has been 
re-exported, because a foreign government or company can claim that it has 
changed the U.S. technology or has produced something similar on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, U.S. intelligence agencies reported that Israel might have 
transferred Patriot missile technology to China in violation of American laws. 
A State Department team found there was not enough evidence to support the 
charge, and a department spokesman said the case is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, State Department Inspector General Sherman Funk reported 
that a leading recipient of American military technology, separately identified 
as Israel, had engaged in a "systematic and growing problem of unauthorized 
transfers" of U.S. technology to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 A congressional staff member suggested recently that the U.S. government might 
have quietly accepted or encouraged Israel's decision to help build the Chinese 
plane -- in effect using Israel as a proxy to supply China with military 
technology that the United States can't provide directly to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, was there a conscious decision on the part of someone in 
Washington to let this happen?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials insist, however, that transfers of the Lavi technology to 
China are not something the United States wants or accepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen Guoqing, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, declined to 
comment on the production of the new aircraft.

POLICE PRESSURE KEEPS THE GANGS ON FILE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: L.A. OFFICERS' 
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS ARE QUESTIONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the moment the deadly shots rang out, it didn't matter that Omar Valdez was 
not a gang member. His gangster-look shaved head and baggy clothes, police 
said, were enough to attract the attention of two carloads of authentic gang 
members looking to avenge an earlier attack. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 17-year-old San Fernando High School senior stood alone at a pay phone 
on Laurel Canyon Boulevard last month, he was shot several times in the chest 
and back, and died a few hours later at Holy Cross Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it was a drive-by shooting and Valdez's age and clothes made him look 
like a gang member, the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood 
division called in their gang experts, the CRASH unit. 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly surmised that he was not a gang member, but also not a stranger 
in the gangs' dark world. Rather, they identified him as a "gang associate," 
someone who hung around with gang members but was not a formally initiated -- 
or "jumped in" -- member. 
</P>
<P>
 How do police know that? 
</P>
<P>
 On what do they base such fine distinctions? Gang members don't have to 
register anywhere and they certainly don't keep records for the government to 
review. So when CRASH officers unhesitatingly identify arrest suspects and 
bullet-riddled bodies in the street as gang members, what information do they 
have to make such a statement? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers lie in a determined effort to track gang membership, right down to 
the individual and "wanna-be" level, by the LAPD's specialist teams, called 
CRASH (for Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums). 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is not without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 While police say aggressive methods are the only way to gather intelligence on 
the 400 gangs and more than 50,000 gang members they estimate inhabit the city, 
youths complain they are constantly rousted by CRASH officers based simply on 
their ethnic group and clothing. And civil liberties activists complain that 
the criteria officers use to pick subjects for questioning are arbitrary and 
that the classification process borders on being unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Valdez, he had been interviewed four times on the street since 
March by officers who were able to establish that he had connections to a local 
gang, said CRASH Detective Mark Aragon. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez told them that he hung around with members of a neighborhood gang 
because he grew up with them. But he never took part in gang business. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths like Valdez play a dangerous game, Aragon said, making themselves 
targets for attacks by other gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They draw attention to themselves," he said. "If Omar was wearing a polyester 
suit, this probably wouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 In the North Hollywood division alone, there are more than 2,800 gang members 
and "associates" like Valdez on file, Aragon said. Valleywide, the figure is 
20,000 gang members and their associates. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they are 18 years old, about 90% of gang members in the LAPD's 
files have been arrested, and 75% have been arrested at least twice, police 
say. By the time they reach age 20, more than half of those in the file are 
dead or in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 To gather information for those files, CRASH officers stop and interview 
people, usually boys or men between the ages of 14 and 25 with shaved heads or 
slicked-back hair, wearing large pants, white T-shirts, baseball caps with gang 
insignias and big jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be at a traffic stop, or for any legitimate reason," said Aragon, 
adding that popular gathering spots for gang members are parks, alleys or in 
front of apartment houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Police fill out a field interview card on each person they stop. A name, 
address, description and any gang affiliation is required. A brief description 
of who the person was with and what they were doing at the time of the stop is 
compiled by the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sometimes check for tattoos, drugs and weapons in such field 
interviews, but only after asking the subject's permission, Aragon said. If 
someone claims to be a gang member, a picture is taken and filed with the 
information card in the station's gang membership files. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not like the police just pick out any Hispanic kid and give him an 
affiliation to a gang," Aragon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say stopping youngsters -- and often conducting searches without 
warrants -- verges on being unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has never been clear what the guidelines are" for stopping and identifying 
gang members, said Manny Velasquez of Youth Gang Services, a city agency that 
works with gang members. "I think the police are walking a really thin line 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said officers stop and photograph even youths who don't claim gang 
membership, harass other youths and search them without permission. Often 
police consider youths guilty simply by association, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is right that they are labeling a lot of kids who don't need 
to be labeled," Velasquez said. "If you do, you are empowering the kid to 
become a homeboy when he wasn't going to before."

 Jerry, 19, dressed in a pair of 50-inch-waist Dickie pants and a large Ben 
Davis shirt, was recently detained by the North Hollywood CRASH unit after he 
was caught drinking in front of his brother's apartment house with some of his 
"homies" or gang friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had our faces on the floor and their feet on our backs," said Jerry, who 
declined to give his last name. 
</P>
<P>
 An admitted gang member, Jerry said he is constantly being harassed by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens because the police see four or five Mexicans standing around and 
see the way we are dressed," he said. "They stop us because we are gang 
members; it doesn't matter if we are doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But police say it is just such aggressive questioning, constantly tracking 
gang membership, that pays off in investigations of serious crimes -- like the 
slaying of Omar Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 It was through gang files, Aragon said, that CRASH officers came up with a 
suspect, a 17-year-old member of a Sun Valley gang who was arrested Dec. 15 on 
suspicion of murder and is being held at the Juvenile Hall in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gangs are something that society considers an epidemic," Aragon said. "We 
know we aren't going to eradicate them, but we try to keep them at a 
controllable level, and the files help." 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon, 39, is no stranger to gang life. With the LAPD for 12 years and a 
CRASH detective for five, he freely uses gang lingo gleaned from the street and 
the routine training seminars mandatory for all CRASH investigators in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But he knows the culture on a more intimate level. Gang tattoos cover his arms 
and shoulders as reminders of his youthful years as a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12, he was initiated into a gang. By 16, he was a father and husband. Not 
until he was 20 did he leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest lure to gang life is the sense of power you get," Aragon said. 
"Not everyone can get 100 people behind them with a single phone call (for a 
fight)." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that although gang members' style of dress does attract attention from 
police, suspected gang members are usually stopped because they are in a 
neighborhood where gangs are prominent or for drinking in a public place. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any crime, Aragon said, there must be probable cause for police to 
detain and search someone in a field interview. But simply striking up a 
conversation with a suspected gang member, asking him about life in the gang 
world -- new members, animosities, relationships -- does not qualify as a field 
interview and requires no probable cause, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal scholars agree, said Dr. Eugene Price, a professor of constitutional law 
for 20 years in the Cal State Northridge political science department. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legality of field interviews, questioning and photographing suspected 
gang members on the street, has yet to be challenged in the courts, Price said. 
Recent Supreme Court rulings allow warrantless searches only if a police 
officer "acted in good faith" and no irrevocable harm was done, but probable 
cause is still required, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If police engage in an informal conversation with suspected gang members, "and 
then find something on them when they decide to search them, the case could be 
thrown out because there is no probable cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many youths are afraid to say no when officers ask permission to search them 
and "police use that fear effectively," he said. "Police cannot simply engage 
in fishing expeditions." 
</P>
<P>
 To conduct a warrantless search, police must prove they believed a crime was 
about to take place, someone's safety was in jeopardy or that the evidence 
might disappear unless they conducted an immediate search, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When police stop a group of gang members, they could just be patrolling," 
Price said. "But if a search takes place, they need probable cause or 
permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Gang membership information takes on added importance when arrests lead to 
trial. If police can establish that a defendant is a gang member, it is easier 
to get a conviction, according to both prosecutors and defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average citizen sees gang members as violent and they are prejudicial 
against them because of that," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels of the 
Valley's Hardcore unit, which prosecutes gang-related murders, attempted 
murders and robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 For defense lawyers, a gang label can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to try to prevent the jury from hearing that they are a member of a 
gang," said Marty Mizel, an attorney with the Los Angeles public defender's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because a person is in a gang, it doesn't mean he runs around every 
moment of the day raping and pillaging," Mizel said. "But the juries' general 
reaction to gang members is highly prejudicial." 
</P>
<P>
 Mizel said details of gang membership can be critical for defendants facing 
trial for serious crimes, such as murder or robbery. Establishing that one 
18-year-old defendant was a gang associate, not a full-fledged member, may have 
helped him win an acquittal on two murder charges against the youth, Mizel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez of Youth Gang Services said youths need to protect their own rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they have the spotlight in their face, the kids know they have to come 
up with the correct answer. They might say something that they didn't really 
want to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A correct address and prompt answers are the most effective way to deal with 
the police, he said. "They empower police when they give answers like 'I don't 
know,' " Velasquez said. "If (police) ask them why they are wearing a Raiders 
jacket, you either say you are cold or you are a hard-core Raiders fan." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that if a police officer is harassing them, youths should quietly 
memorize the officer's badge number and report him to the station later. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent night, while CRASH detectives were combing the streets for 
Valdez's killer, Aragon, in full uniform but an unmarked car, stopped youths on 
the street, in front of a home and anywhere they looked suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, get rid of that Raiders jacket," Aragon told a young man talking to his 
girlfriend on a pay phone late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone is going to think you are a gang member." 
</P>
<P>
 Because that's what someone apparently thought about Omar Valdez.

ISRAELIS DRIVE PALESTINIANS OFF DISPUTED LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using their fists and rifle butts, Israeli soldiers drove hundreds of 
Palestinian villagers from a disputed hilltop Tuesday as bulldozers began 
clearing the land for a Jewish settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Saeb Erekat, minister of municipalities in the Palestinian Authority and one 
of its chief negotiators with Israel, was one of several people injured in the 
fracas. More than 50 people were arrested, including several Israeli peace 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians had prepared themselves for a confrontation for days, 
planting olive trees on the rocky hilltop and sleeping on the land to guard it 
from settlers and soldiers. When bulldozers arrived to start clearing the site 
Tuesday morning, the villagers threw themselves in front of the earthmovers and 
hurled insults at the soldiers sent to ensure that the work proceeded. When 
they were ordered to leave the site, villagers pummeled the soldiers with their 
fists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the graveyard of the peace process," Erekat said after he was knocked 
to the ground by a border police officer. Eyewitnesses said that Erekat was 
assaulted after he tried to step between villagers and soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Television reported Tuesday night that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres had decided to review the proposed construction. 
The two met Tuesday, and Peres reportedly expressed concern that peace talks 
with the Palestinians might be jeopardized if the building was allowed. Three 
government ministers publicly expressed opposition to the building plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Erekat said that the Palestinians will appeal to Israel's Supreme Court today 
to halt the project. The clash between soldiers and El Khader villagers came as 
Palestinians accuse Israel of strengthening its hold on Jerusalem by expanding 
Jewish settlements that lie to the northeast, east and south of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The government recently announced plans to build several hundred more homes in 
Maaleh Adumim, an eastern settlement satellite of Jerusalem. A Bedouin tribe 
claims that the land slated to be developed belongs to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also announced that it will confiscate land from the 
Palestinian neighborhood of Beit Hanina northeast of Jerusalem to make room for 
a Jewish neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 El Khader, home to 7,000 Palestinians, lies just south of Bethlehem, near the 
Gush Etzion bloc of Jewish settlements. The settlement of Efrat, where about 
6,000 Israelis live, has laid claim to a hilltop on the outskirts of El Khader 
that the villagers say they own. The Israelis say the villagers cannot prove 
ownership. Efrat plans to build 500 homes on 75 acres of the disputed land. 
</P>
<P>
 The hilltop lies about a mile north of the nearest neighborhood of Efrat, 
separated from that cluster of homes by a valley farmed by El Khader villagers. 
But a spokesman for the settlement said the distance between Efrat and the 
planned neighborhood is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This land is government land," said Menachem Spitz, a member of the Efrat 
municipal council. "The land is not theirs (the villagers). There is no Arab 
that can come and show proof of ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 Spitz said that 500 families "from all around the country" have applied to 
live in the apartments, villas and townhomes that will be built on the hilltop. 
"I don't want to get into politics, but this is the beginning of the battle 
over Jerusalem," Spitz said. "Efrat and the Gush Etzion area is the southern 
entrance to Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 Spitz said he is not worried about the security risks of building a new 
neighborhood adjacent to a Palestinian village. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have another Arab village that today butts up to Efrat," he said, "and we 
have excellent relations with those Arabs. They shop in our stores and eat in 
our restaurants, and some of our residents give them hand-me-down clothes. We 
hope to have the same sort of relationship with El Khader." 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority said Saturday that Israel's continued construction 
of homes in the West Bank violates the September, 1993, peace accord that 
Israel signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization. A spokesman said that 
the authority will ask the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israel's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The actions of the settlers this morning in El Khader . . . protected by the 
Israeli army, is a clear violation of the Declaration of Principles," said 
Nabil abu Rudaineh, a spokesman for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. "The policy of 
the Israeli government, confiscating the land from its owners, cannot serve the 
peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Rudaineh said that the Palestinian Authority "holds the Israeli government 
totally responsible" for what happened at El Khader. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also said that he hopes the expansion of settlements will not derail 
Israeli-PLO negotiations. The two sides are negotiating a redeployment of 
Israeli troops out of West Bank towns and villages, the expansion of the 
Palestinian Authority throughout the West Bank and the holding of Palestinian 
elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that nothing would stop the negotiations," Abu Rudaineh said. "But 
this sort of thing makes the negotiations look meaningless. These actions 
strengthen the fundamentalists and all those who are against the peace 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, both the status of Jewish 
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza and the status of Jerusalem are to be 
determined only in the final phase of negotiations, which is scheduled to begin 
in 1996. Israel maintains that it can legally continue to "thicken" existing 
settlements in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 Erekat said that the Palestinian Authority's credibility will be damaged if 
settlement construction continues. "I tried to stop residents from beating the 
soldiers and I found myself being beaten," Erekat said. "I'm here to save the 
peace process, and they're trying to destroy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Elik Ron, commander of the Judaea and Samaria police district, said 
that Erekat will be charged with assaulting a police officer because he 
allegedly kicked an officer in the leg during the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other people were injured, and one Israeli peace activist fainted 
during the confrontation. Two left-wing members of the Knesset, Israel's 
parliament, tried to block the bulldozers but were led away by soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very distressing sight," said Tzaley Reshef, a spokesman for Peace 
Now, a leftist Israeli organization. "Here we have a Labor-Meretz (left-wing) 
government, and that's what it is doing. It is inconceivable that such a thing 
will happen in a peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 After days of telling reporters who visited them on the wind-swept hilltop 
that they would rather die than see a Jewish settlement built there, the El 
Khader villagers seemed stunned by the turn of events Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are all liars; this is not peace!" one elderly man shouted at Erekat. 
"They are coming here and taking our land, and there is nothing that we can do 
about it. This is not peace -- it is surrender."

BROWN WARMS UP HIS COLDEST FOES; SPEECH: FORMER SPEAKER MAY NOT HAVE WON HEARTS 
OF DIAMOND BAR AUDIENCE, BUT HE MAKES A STRONG SHOWING AGAINST CONSERVATIVE 
ASSEMBLYMAN RICHARD MOUNTJOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Willie Brown, the former and now would-be Speaker of the California Assembly, 
the silver-tongued Democrat who has represented a slice of San Francisco for 
three decades, came to the lair of the conservative enemy Tuesday to lecture on 
California politics and government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-year-old Brown told an affluent luncheon audience in Diamond Bar that 
the battle over the Assembly is far more complicated than the story they have 
heard since the legislative house deadlocked Dec. 5 on the selection of a 
Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a democracy," Brown said after nearly two hours of discourse with 
conservative Republican Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy of nearby Arcadia 
before an overflow audience of 250 at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon at the 
Diamond Bar Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no corner on truth, honesty and rationality," Brown said. "Only the 
Master is, in fact, perfect. Only the Lord occupies that position. The rest of 
us are simple applicants attempting in one fashion or another to emulate his 
teaching and his being. And believe me, that requires a great deal of 
discipline in the world of politics." 
</P>
<P>
 And Willie Brown, the simple applicant in the impeccable silk suit, said that 
once all the members of the Assembly reach consensus on leadership, "if it 
includes Willie Brown's participation -- so be it. If it doesn't -- so be it. . 
. . I thank you for at least accepting me in your environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown may not have won the hearts of the mostly Republican suburban audience, 
but he was accepted with moderate and respectful applause. What boos there were 
came at the mention of the name of an absent Republican, Assemblyman Paul 
Horcher of Diamond Bar, the former Republican who switched to independent and 
on Dec. 5 cast the vote that deadlocked the Assembly 40 to 40 and prevented GOP 
leader Jim Brulte of nearby Rancho Cucamonga from becoming Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadlock remained Tuesday and Brulte also declined an invitation to come 
to the Diamond Bar luncheon because he was busy lobbying colleagues in the San 
Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy, one of the more conservative members of the Assembly since his 
election in the Proposition 13 year of 1978, is a key figure in the dispute 
because he not only won reelection Nov. 8 to the Assembly, he also won a 
special election to the area's state Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mountjoy vowed again Tuesday that he would sacrifice the Senate seat as 
long as he remained the possible swing vote that would elect Brulte Speaker or 
keep Brown from occupying that post. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy accused Brown of arm-twisting Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is about, 'I want to be Speaker so I can go down as the 
Speaker emeritus,' " Mountjoy said. "That's nonsense. That's ego. That's 
craziness. That's not what this country is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 If the chamber members came to find out who ultimately would become Speaker of 
the Assembly, they learned nothing much new. Mountjoy predicted that he might 
have to remain in the Assembly as late as mid-January, until Brulte picks up 
enough Democratic votes to give him the job. The Assembly Speaker is usually 
regarded as the second most powerful official in California after the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least some in the audience were captivated by Brown's trademark 
oratory, which made actions that Mountjoy described as treachery, back-room 
dealing and dictatorship sound like statesmanship and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown even made the argument that he had been a better representative of the 
Diamond Bar area in the Assembly than Mountjoy, citing his efforts on behalf of 
a land swap for a Diamond Bar high school site and a local traffic safety 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 He rejected Mountjoy's portrayal of the Nov. 8 statewide vote as a mandate to 
seat a Republican as Speaker of the Assembly, even though voters chose 41 
Republicans and 39 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown pointed out that the Speaker is chosen by the members of the Assembly, 
not by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me indicate to you that the people of the state of California deserve 
quality representation," Brown said. "They deserve representation that is 
serious, that is focused, and that moves from the campaign rhetoric to actual 
legislating. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "That includes consulting all members and arriving at some conclusion just as 
you do in any other aspect of your life. That is how the Legislature needs to 
be organized." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy said that in spite of Brown's high-minded talk, he has treated the 
GOP in dictatorial fashion, noting that Brown is seeking to remove him from the 
Assembly and force him to take the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Fitzgerald, vice president of the Diamond Bar Chamber of Commerce, was 
impressed with the visitor from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brown came into Republican territory and took on all comers," she said. "He's 
got quite a personality. I believe Brown came off better (than Mountjoy) and 
I'm a Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles House, executive director of the Republican Party of Los Angeles 
County, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie Brown is a fair man and very articulate, but Mountjoy came off better 
because he spoke to the issues," House said as members of the audience swarmed 
around Brown, seeking to have a word with him or to get a snapshot taken. 
</P>
<P>
 By describing Brown as fair, GOP official House was more charitable to Brown 
than Mountjoy was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democracy has spoken," Mountjoy said in his closing remarks. "On Nov. 8, the 
people of the state of California chose a new direction for California. The 
Speaker (Mountjoy repeatedly referred to Brown as the Speaker, although at the 
moment he is not) today proposes by manipulation of the rules . . . to turn 
(his) back on the law and cast me out of the Assembly so he can regain the 
speakership of the California Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a travesty of justice," Mountjoy added. "I think it's dead 
wrong. It's not good for this district. The question that needs to be asked of 
Willie Brown is: What is it about democracy that you don't like?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy's sharp rhetoric drew some gasps, but afterward Mountjoy, who served 
in the Assembly all 14 years that Brown was Speaker, conversed jovially with 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if they are still friends, Mountjoy gushed, "Oh, he's a great dinner 
companion." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said: "Let me tell you something, I don't think we'll ever cease being 
personal friends. That's got nothing to do with politics."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; PORTFOLIO OF 'SAFER' BONDS HELD SOME OF THE MOST 
RISKY; SECURITIES: RECORDS SHOW THAT IT BORROWED TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS. 
MUNICIPALITIES THAT USED THE FUND SAY THEY WERE MISLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "safe" Orange County bond pool designed to hold short-term money for 13 
agencies and cities actually held some of the most volatile and risky 
securities purchased by county Treasurer Robert L. Citron, portfolio records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 An inventory of the bond pool's portfolio dated Dec. 31, 1993, shows that for 
every dollar invested, the pool had borrowed about $1 to make further 
investments. Although that level of borrowing did not approach the 3-to-1 
leverage in the county's main investment fund at the time, it was still much 
higher than many of its investors expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the portfolio inventories, examined Tuesday by The Times, document 
county investment adviser Thomas W. Hayes' assertions last week that the two 
pools resembled each other, both in the nature of their investments and in that 
they used leverage to boost investment yields. 
</P>
<P>
 The character of the two pools -- the $1.2-billion "bond pool" and the 
theoretically riskier $6.6-billion "commingled pool," which had investments 
from 187 public entities -- has become an issue in Orange County's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: The 13 municipalities with money in the bond pool contend that 
they were assured by Citron that their money would be segregated and managed 
separately from the larger fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond pool should have been safer, they say, because it was made up largely 
of proceeds of tax-exempt borrowings. Under federal law, municipalities may not 
earn more in interest from the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds than they pay out 
in interest on those bonds. Any excess must be rebated to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the bond pool investors argue that they should be protected from 
shouldering the loss of as much as 27% projected for the county's investments 
as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, what Citron did and did not disclose about how he was investing the 
municipalities' money are among the issues being investigated by a raft of 
federal, state and local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously thought it would be a lot safer," said Gary Burton, deputy 
director of finance and administration for the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, the bond pool's largest investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other investors in the bond pool include the county itself; the Transportation 
Corridor Agencies; the Orange County Sanitation District; Coast Community 
College; the Irvine Unified School District; the cities of Santa Barbara, Yorba 
Linda, Newport Beach and Santa Ana; the Moulton Niguel and Santa Margarita 
water districts and the Midway City Sanitary District. 
</P>
<P>
 The portfolio records indicate that as of last Dec. 31, derivatives accounted 
for almost exactly the same percentage of total holdings in the bond fund and 
the county's portfolio as a whole -- 21%. Because more recent portfolio lists 
are not available for the two funds, it is unknown to what extent the 
portfolios changed over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at year-end 1993, the bond pool contained a substantial volume of 
securities representing highly volatile bets that interest rates would remain 
steady or decline. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one $4-million investment purchased in July, 1993, paid interest 
of 12.7% minus two times the six-month London Interbank Offering Rate, a 
standard money-market interest benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
 As rates declined, the security would pay sharply higher interest. Instead, 
however, they have risen, and the interest payable on the note has dropped from 
5.575% last December to only 0.45% last month. The interest rate is to be 
recalculated in May, but at current LIBOR rates of 6.5%, the security would pay 
zero interest. Its market value would deteriorate accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 It could not be determined if the county bond pool still owns the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond pool investors say Citron paid them as much as two percentage points less 
in yearly interest than was paid on the larger commingled fund, presumably 
because their investment earnings were limited by law. As a result, many 
officials say, they assumed that their money was invested in conventional 
short-term securities paying market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't aware of any of these structured notes (derivatives)," said Gary 
Streed, director of finance for the Orange County Sanitation District. "Whether 
they were there wasn't a question I thought needed to be asked."

 December was the month when this city, home of Disneyland and three 
professional sports teams, expected to add the final details to its blueprint 
for the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hoped to reach an agreement by year's end to build a new 
baseball stadium for the California Angels and choose the designer for a 
dazzling entertainment complex that would surround it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving ahead with that project and the Anaheim Resort -- a $172-million 
renovation proposed for the area surrounding Disneyland -- was the key to the 
city's plan to spruce up its shabby commercial areas, widen streets and make 
itself over as a modern metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County's Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing rocked the city, which had $169 
million -- about 20% of its money -- in the investment pool that has lost $2.02 
billion through risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the financial crisis raised serious doubts about whether Anaheim can 
proceed with its ambitious redevelopment, city officials vow that they will 
proceed. "This is a bump in the road," said James D. Ruth, Anaheim's city 
manager. "It's going to hurt, but there are ways to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the city faces other potential setbacks. The Los Angeles Rams are 
reportedly close to announcing plans to move to St. Louis, in spite of an 
intense effort by community leaders to keep the football team with enticements 
that include a new or renovated stadium for football only, rather than one 
shared with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's newest professional team, the popular Anaheim Mighty Ducks, had a 
spectacular first season at the new city-built arena, the Pond. A continuation 
of that success is expected -- if the National Hockey League can settle its 
labor dispute, which has stalled the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The week before the bankruptcy filing, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly met with Rams 
President John Shaw to assure him that the city is serious about keeping the 
team. A detailed proposal for a new stadium was to have followed, but city 
officials have had to focus instead on financial crisis management. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with the Angels also have been postponed, dashing earlier hopes 
that an agreement on a new stadium could be sealed by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still hopeful in terms of Rams negotiations and optimistic about the 
Angels, but this is obviously not the right time to sit down and cut deals," 
Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also anxious to see what effect the financial setback will have 
on Walt Disney Co.'s proposal to build a $3-billion resort next to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's plan is insulated somewhat from the county's problems because it does 
not depend on public money. But county-financed roads and other infrastructure 
improvements envisioned as part of the project could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there will be some impact," said Michael Johnson, manager of 
communications for Walt Disney Development Co. "But we are going to look for 
ways to keep our plan for a project in Anaheim on track and work closely with 
Anaheim officials to see that we're able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly is optimistic that the city will continue its progress, even if it has to 
take a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the county bankruptcy makes clearer than ever is that we will have to 
rely on partnerships with the private sector to build major projects," Daly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear yet how much the city is out. Anaheim invested heavily in the 
county pool. And because that strategy netted the city $12 million in revenue 
over the past three years, officials borrowed $94 million early in 1994 solely 
to invest in the fund, Ruth said. That loan comes due in April, and it is not 
clear where the city will get the money to repay the loan if it loses some of 
the principal invested with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, it was a very prudent business decision, and we were advised 
that it was almost no-risk," Ruth said. "We feel somewhat misled." 
</P>
<P>
 In a worst-case scenario, the city could lose as much as $45 million out of 
the $169 million it put in the fund, Ruth said. Until city officials learn the 
final figure, they have put a hold on all new capital improvement projects, 
instituted a city hiring freeze and canceled the order for a new fleet of city 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the Anaheim resort project is continuing, though, with the city now 
placing utility lines underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Zemel said that the board has no contingency plan yet to deal 
with a major loss and that any solution will have to include a way to proceed 
with major projects such as the Disney resort and baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely difficult to think that a city can take a hit like this in 
stride, but it is up to us to make sure that we do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have made several moves to regain their momentum, including a 
meeting last week with 50 members of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce to update 
them on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us a relatively upbeat presentation," said Jay Walton, government 
affairs manager for the group. "The bankruptcy doesn't help, but these dreams 
can still happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said that in January the city is "going to hit the track running" and 
resume meetings with the Angels and Disney. Also, he said, the council will 
vote on a consulting firm to develop an updated land-use strategy for the 
stadium area, a step that officials say must be taken regardless of what the 
Rams do.

CROATIAN LEADER DRIVES FOR PEACE; BALKANS: PRESIDENT TUDJMAN TRAVERSES 
EAST-WEST HIGHWAY THAT'S BEEN CLOSED SINCE 1991 BY WAR WITH SERBS. HIS GOAL: 
'PEACEFUL RE-INTEGRATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three years after the former Yugoslav federation's "Brotherhood and Unity" 
highway was closed by ethnic warfare, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman drove 
the east-west artery Tuesday to proclaim his commitment to a peaceful 
settlement with Serbian rebels who hold nearly a third of his country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although camouflaged U.N. peacekeeping troops and armored vehicles were more 
visible in the winter fog than any display of regional brotherhood, Tudjman was 
able to drive east along the highway through 16 miles of rebel-held territory 
in an armored BMW without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall be working to liberate every inch of Croatian soil without new 
casualties," Tudjman told municipal officials in the government-controlled town 
of Slavonski Brod, about 150 miles east of Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 "This trip of mine today was intended to show we are in favor of peaceful 
re-integration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the four-lane highway, which runs from Zagreb to Belgrade, were 
reopened last Wednesday for the first time since the Serb-Croat war of 1991, 
under an internationally brokered agreement that aims to bring the Croatian 
Serb-held territory under government control. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers took Tudjman's drive along the highway -- which he made 
with Defense Minister Gojko Susak -- to mean that the government intends to 
prolong the 2-year-old mandate of the U.N. Protection Force in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Tudjman has been threatening to expel the U.N. force and 
resume the war with Croatian Serbs -- a move that U.S. and international 
officials warn would draw Serb-led Yugoslavia and Bosnian Serb rebels into the 
Croatian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian Parliament, dominated by Tudjman's nationalistic Croatian 
Democratic Union, is to take up the U.N. issue Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatians have grown increasingly angry and frustrated with the U.N. force, 
called UNPROFOR, which they thought would have recouped Serb-held territory by 
now and returned Croatian refugees expelled from the areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevalent Croatian belief that the U.N. troops side with the Serbs is 
evident at the force's headquarters in Zagreb, which is smeared with such 
graffiti as "Go Home" and "UNPROFOR, Quit Sowing Hatred." Outside the 
sandbag-reinforced compound, Croatian refugees from Serb-held territories have 
stacked bricks bearing names of the dead and displaced and turned the wall into 
a makeshift altar with candles and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 A Croatian engineer-turned-taxi-driver described the peacekeepers as "a bunch 
of people who failed to amount to anything in their own countries." 
</P>
<P>
 The Balkan conflict began in 1991 after Croatia and Slovenia broke away from 
the Yugoslav federation. A war was fought between Croatians and Croatian Serbs, 
the latter supported by the government of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 people died in the war before former U.S. Secretary of State 
Cyrus R. Vance brokered a peace deal in January, 1992, that left Croatian Serbs 
in control of about a third of the country and eventually brought in about 
15,000 peacekeepers to patrol the four areas that Serbs call the Republic of 
Krajina. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the Croatian Serb-controlled sectors cut across the highway of 
"Brotherhood and Unity" -- a political slogan that the former Yugoslav 
government used to fight nationalistic sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening of the highway coincides with a cease-fire in neighboring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina between the Muslim-led government and Bosnian Serbs. The 
fighting there started a couple of months after the Vance plan went into effect 
in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The highway was opened under an Economic and Confidence-Building Agreement 
signed Dec. 2 by the government in Zagreb and the Croatian Serbs at their 
headquarters in Knin. 
</P>
<P>
 In practical terms, reopening the road through Croatian Serb-held territory 
shortens the trip for drivers by reducing the five-hour journey around the 
sector to a half-hour drive through it. For most people, however, the highway 
still is not a Zagreb-to-Belgrade link, because Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia 
do not have diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opening is an important symbol for Croatia. Serbs had been delaying 
implementation of the agreement, and in his "state of the nation" address last 
week, Tudjman threatened to cancel the U.N. mandate if the accord was not 
carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 On the road Tuesday, Tudjman asserted that railroad service through Serb-held 
territories also will be resumed as agreed. "The next step," he said, "is the 
return of refugees to their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian Serbs have exhibited no intention of giving up the territory they 
hold or of recognizing Croatian government rule. They have portrayed the 
reopening of the highway as an act of goodwill on their part and as a concrete 
step toward independence, because the agreement effectively recognizes them as 
a political force capable of negotiating with Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 But their cooperation may have been intended primarily to steer Tudjman away 
from a military option. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs have a military mutual assistance agreement with Croatian Serbs, 
but Tudjman insists that Yugoslavia would not intervene in Croatia if the 
government went back to war with the Serbian rebels -- which may mean he thinks 
the government could win a military conflict.

U.S. MAY BLOCK N. KOREA OIL DEAL IF PILOT IS NOT RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The outgoing chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said Tuesday that 
Congress will block a scheduled $5-million shipment of oil to North Korea if 
that country does not release a pilot whose helicopter was shot down after 
straying into North Korea on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has said it would allow the oil shipment to occur under the 
terms of an agreement that requires North Korea to begin unraveling its nuclear 
weapons program, but Foreign Affairs Chairman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) 
predicted that Congress will scuttle the accord unless North Korea returns Army 
Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Another congressman, who was in North Korea when Hall was captured and thought 
that he had secured a promise from the North Koreans to return him, said 
Pyongyang officials "are putting us through water torture." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on NBC-TV's "Today" show, Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) counseled 
patience while State Department official Thomas Hubbard, who arrived in North 
Korea today, negotiates further. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said the situation has been complicated by a struggle between North 
Korea's Foreign Ministry, which seems ready to release Hall, and its military 
Establishment, which apparently does not agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's right now keep an eye on the ball with our diplomat," Richardson said. 
"It may take a few weeks longer. But I think we have to keep an eye on the 
prize." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard, a deputy assistant secretary of state, was in Seoul for consultations 
with U.S. and South Korean officials. He crossed the demilitarized zone into 
North Korea early today for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Koreans insist that Hall was taking part in an espionage mission 
when his helicopter was shot down over North Korea. A second pilot, Chief 
Warrant Officer David Hilemon, died in the crash. His body was returned last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, who was interviewed on the same program as Richardson, said there is 
no reason to link Hall's release with implementation of the pending nuclear 
agreement. Even so, he said, it will be difficult to separate the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this airman is not returned, then it is bound to have a negative impact on 
our relationship with North Korea, and it's bound to have a negative impact on 
the attitude of the Congress toward this agreement," said Hamilton, who will 
become the panel's ranking Democrat when Republicans take control of Congress 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to provide some $5 million worth of heavy fuel to North Korea under 
this agreement," Hamilton said. "It's difficult for me to see the Congress 
doing that unless this airman is returned." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was circumspect in dealing with Pyongyang's accusation of espionage. 
"I have absolutely no information that would lead me to think the American 
helicopter inside North Korea was anything other than an inadvertent 
navigational mistake," he said.

CLAIMS FOR DEADLIER BULLETS SHOT DOWN; GUNS: AMMUNITION SAID TO BE CAPABLE OF 
PIERCING BULLETPROOF VESTS, CAUSE MAXIMUM DAMAGE TO HUMAN TISSUE. LAWMAKERS TO 
SEEK BAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two lawmakers said Tuesday they would try to ban new bullets that would 
maximize damage to human tissue and penetrate bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
 But top firearms experts said the novice arms manufacturer's claims of a 
better, deadlier bullet are full of holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are really out there, I think we would have seen them," said David 
Boyd, director of technology for the National Institute of Justice in 
Washington, D.C. "I'm trying to get a hold of some. That's assuming they 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
 And the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Assn., which supports the rights 
of gun owners, dismissed "the dubious claims of a would-be manufacturer." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators said such bullets likely wouldn't be approved for at least 
another month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rhino-Ammo and the Black Rhino bullets would fragment into thousands of 
pieces when they hit human flesh, says creator David Keen, a research chemist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Rhino would have a convex point to penetrate bullet-stopping 
material such as Kevlar; since it would be made of carbon-based plastics called 
polymers, it would sidestep current federal law banning metal-based, 
armor-piercing rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Keen, chief executive of Signature Products Corp. in Huntsville, Ala., called 
Rhino-Ammo "a strictly defensive round. The beauty behind it is that it makes 
an incredible wound." 
</P>
<P>
 Keen said his bullets would be sold only to law enforcement agencies and 
federally licensed gun dealers; gun-control advocates fear the ammunition would 
fall into criminals' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) 
each said he would propose legislation to ban Keen's bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Keen's product wouldn't be the first to trumpet its ability to pierce 
protective vests. One South Carolina distributor was advertising last year that 
customers could order 12-gauge slugs that had previously been available only to 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When fired from 50 yards, not only did the 'Sabot' go through a car door and 
out the other side, the slug had also penetrated a very high-quality police 
vest in the process!" an ad boasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Protective League board member Dennis Zine said: "We don't 
see any need whatsoever for (Rhino bullets). I've checked with our SWAT 
operations. The SWAT personnel are satisfied with the weapons and ammunition 
that they currently use. . . . There is absolutely no reason and no sense to 
manufacture or distribute this type of bullet. There is no need whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntsville Times said that Keen claimed he had received $250,000 in orders 
for the new bullets and named Larry's, a mega-sporting goods store in 
Huntsville, as one of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But the store's owner, Larry Barnett, said Tuesday he had spoken with Keen but 
never placed an order.

U.S. JUDGE KEEPS OREGON'S NEW SUICIDE LAW IN LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge blocked Oregon from putting its first-in-the-nation assisted suicide 
law into effect Tuesday until a court can decide if the voter-approved measure 
is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure 16, narrowly approved in November, allows a patient to request a 
lethal dose of drugs if at least two doctors determine the person has less than 
six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surely, the first assisted suicide law in this country deserves a considered, 
thoughtful constitutional analysis," U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan wrote in 
his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan did not set a trial date but said he hoped to resolve the matter as 
quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office said last week that if Hogan issued a 
preliminary injunction, as he did Tuesday, it could be a year or more before 
the constitutional challenge is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Atty. Gen. Tom Balmer said he was not surprised Hogan decided a 
trial was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a novel law, and it was bound to end up in court," Balmer said. "I 
think the judge is saying this is the first law of its kind, that these are 
difficult issues, and that he wants to take the time to decide them correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was supposed to take effect Dec. 8, but Hogan issued a temporary 
restraining order the day before so he could hear arguments for and against it 
before deciding whether to grant an injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure 16 was approved by Oregon voters by a 51% to 49% margin after an 
emotional campaign that pitted the Hemlock Society against the Roman Catholic 
Church and anti-abortion groups.

WOMEN IN AIDS VIRUS STUDY DIE FASTER THAN MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women infected with the AIDS virus die faster than men with the infection, a 
study has found. 
</P>
<P>
 No medical reason for the difference was apparent, said the study's authors, 
led by Sandra L. Melnick, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota 
School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the researchers said, women may wait until they are sicker before 
seeking care or may be treated differently. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
tracked 768 women and 3,779 men -- all infected with the AIDS virus -- for 
about 15 months and found that women were 33% more likely to die than men who 
were comparably ill when they were enrolled in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 In women, twice as often as in men, death was the first sign that AIDS was 
progressing, researchers found. In men, the first signs were more likely to be 
bouts of pneumonia or fungal infections.

LAW ENFORCEMENT; RENO STEPPING UP PURSUIT OF CHILD-SUPPORT DELINQUENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even her severest critics agree on this: More than any other U.S. attorney 
general in history, Janet Reno has gone to bat for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a recent Reno directive, the Justice Department is stepping up the 
pursuit and punishment of deadbeat parents who fail to make court-ordered 
child-support payments after moving across state lines. The move is intended to 
put sharp teeth into a 1992 law that made the practice a federal crime for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, hopes the accelerated 
enforcement will have a genuine impact on a national problem of staggering 
proportions. More than half of all court-ordered child support currently goes 
unpaid, and the accumulated IOUs total an estimated $34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1992 law, first-time violators face a possible misdemeanor 
conviction, up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Repeat offenders face a 
possible felony conviction, up to two years in prison and a $350,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said charges have been filed this month in 28 cases involving nearly $1 
million in overdue payments by parents in 13 states. That is nearly twice the 
number of cases in which federal charges were filed in the preceding 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The new cases include one in California against Mark Pyeatt, an electrician 
who is believed to have moved to Florida. Pyeatt allegedly has failed for five 
years to make court-ordered payments to a child living in Inyo County and owes 
more than $30,000 in back child support. A state warrant was issued for his 
arrest in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides those 28 cases, the Department of Health and Human Services has 
referred to federal prosecutors another 25 for consideration, and more than 200 
remain under active review. The latter group includes 14 California cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Child Support Recovery Act of 1992 made it a federal offense to willfully 
fail to pay support for a child living in another state. To qualify as a 
federal case, the unpaid support must be greater than $5,000 or outstanding for 
more than a year, and a violator must have the proven ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Primary responsibility for enforcing court-ordered child support remains with 
state and local authorities. But their powers are stretched, Reno said, when 
parents move to another state and "simply thumb their nose at the court and at 
their children." 
</P>
<P>
 The 94 U.S. attorneys will prosecute cases in which authorities already have 
pursued all reasonably available remedies. They will target those cases in 
which a parent flees after being served with court papers, engages in deception 
to avoid paying, fails to pay after being held in contempt, or has other 
federal charges pending against him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's interest in children and their treatment under the nation's criminal 
and civil justice policies is not the whole story behind the federal crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. for Children for Enforcement of Support, which claims to be the 
largest child-support organization in the country, turned to members of 
Congress after becoming frustrated with enforcement of the 1992 law by federal 
prosecutors. Last summer, the association complained to Rep. Henry J. Hyde 
(R-Ill.), who is expected to head the House Judiciary Committee in the new 
Republican-controlled Congress, and Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, who 
switched to the Republican Party after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 A Shelby-sponsored amendment to the Justice Department's appropriations bill 
stated the Senate's intent to see the 1992 law enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice Department officials deny that the association's lobbying and the 
accelerated enforcement are directly linked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Congress realized that the primary responsibility is on the 
state agencies," Reno said. "When we didn't get referrals from the state 
agencies, we went to them (and) to HHS to try to develop a mechanism for 
ensuring that they know we are available to assist when it's proper and 
appropriate."

SOCIAL ISSUES; YOUNG INNER-CITY ARTISTS GIVEN A BOOST; YOUTHS, DOWNTOWN PATRONS 
GET TOGETHER, THANKS TO A BOSTON TEACHING, DEVELOPMENT GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Inner-city teen-agers and downtown professionals mingled before a recent art 
auction while a hip-hop group harmonized on "Old Man River." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations marked the freshness and urgency of the students' work. Three 
teen-agers in baggy jeans and out-sized jackets sold clothing with the 
graffiti-style logo "salted" -- a word that can mean assaulted or insulted, or 
both. The lights were dim and the donated food was gourmet. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction was a benefit for the burgeoning Boston-based youth development 
group Artists for Humanity. Pulling in $5,000 for student artwork and gathering 
about 300 people who might never have met otherwise, the event accomplished the 
essence of the group's mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's equally important for people to hear them as for the kids to have 
something to say," said program co-founder Susan Rodgerson, a minimalist 
painter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have limited opportunity to communicate with the adult population -- 
it's their neighborhood, their teachers. By applying their ideas to fine art, 
they reach the business community." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Nicynski, a sales manager in Cohasset, Mass., who described his family as 
classic suburbanites with little contact with the inner city, called the art 
"refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is America, this is who's going to run our country," Nicynski said, 
adding that he wished he had brought his own children. 
</P>
<P>
 After joining Rodgerson to paint a pilot mural as middle school students in 
1991, about 15 teen-agers went to work in her studio and eventually started a 
nonprofit company that designs T-shirts for Massachusetts universities and 
colleges, as well as the "salted" gear. They also do individual pieces -- from 
lilting, simple figures to strident medleys of graffiti and dark-visioned 
portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen of those students are now paid to come, three times a week during the 
school year and full time in the summer, to the group's downtown loft -- where 
along with artistic technique, they learn to present their work to potential 
clients and funders. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of limited funding -- the program ran this year on about $102,000, 
including rent and salaries for Rodgerson, co-founder Kate Schrauth and 
part-time teacher Tim Jones -- no more students can be paid. Another 75 have 
dropped in periodically this year, and seven attended a new six-week program 
for younger students. By next summer, 235 students will have participated in 
Artists for Humanity, Schrauth estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, their exhibits and commissioned work for businesses 
such as Lotus Development Corp. and the student loan fund known as Nellie Mae 
have brought in about $55,000 and affected thousands more people, Schrauth 
said. For instance, David B. Walek, a partner with Boston's largest law firm, 
Ropes & Gray, and a member of the group's board of directors, said the 
self-portrait his firm bought by 17-year-old Carlos Lewis is the only piece in 
its vast art collection depicting a black person. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants and program supporters said students are gaining more than the 
self-esteem or mastery of airbrush technique that would come naturally with a 
strong art program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taught me a number of things -- entrepreneurship, business skills, 
public speaking," said Artists for Humanity's first graduate, Damon Butler, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the 98 students who have participated so far had run into trouble 
with the law or at school before joining, Rodgerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said he was on the verge of dealing drugs when a friend told him not to 
waste his talent, and Artists for Humanity gave him an outlet. Eventually, the 
group helped him patch together enough scholarships to attend Boston's Art 
Institute.

PUMPING IRON HELD BOON TO BRITTLE BONES

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to help your grandmother avoid a broken hip, get her to pump iron 
a couple of times a week, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-menopausal women who trained intensively on exercise machines twice 
weekly for a year built up bones, increased muscle size and power, and improved 
their balance, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bone density is only one element in these fractures," said Miriam E. Nelson, 
a physiologist at Tufts University in Boston. "It may be even more important to 
improve women's muscle strength and balance to prevent falls." 
</P>
<P>
 The study is published in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fractures caused by osteoporosis -- the thinning of bones that accompanies 
aging -- strike 1.5 million Americans annually, mostly women. The fractures 
often lead to long-term disability or death.

U.S. RETAINS TIGHT CONTROL ON HAITI POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. troops maintained tight control of the Haitian army headquarters Tuesday, 
one day after a group of Haitian ex-soldiers stormed the building in a protest 
over back pay and military cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Four former soldiers were killed and at least six were injured Monday in the 
most dramatic clash since U.S. troops arrived in September to usher in the 
return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops and loyalist Haitian soldiers fired at the dissidents, "but it is 
not clear if any of the casualties were caused by U.S. or by Haitian forces," 
U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's government has slashed the size of the army from about 7,000 to 
1,500. The pay dispute has been brewing since last week, when the army command 
said only 1,500 soldiers would get their December pay.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; EDUCATION OFFICIAL BEGINS EFFORT TO OUST STANTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL and SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first recall effort sparked by the county's financial crisis was launched 
Tuesday when a county education official filed a petition against Supervisor 
Roger R. Stanton, alleging "malfeasance and nonfeasance in office." 
</P>
<P>
 Felix Rocha Jr., a member of the Orange County Department of Education Board 
of Trustees, contends that Stanton and the other supervisors share the 
responsibility for the failed county investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, has said the crisis 
threatens the future of the schools countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement contained in the recall notice, Rocha criticized Stanton for 
"malfeasance and nonfeasance in office by failing to audit the nature of the 
aggressive investment strategy . . . and for failing to determine if that 
strategy was colored by financial or personal relationships" between county 
officials and financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha, 49, personally served Stanton with the recall papers at the county Hall 
of Administration Tuesday afternoon, Stanton said. Rocha lives in Fountain 
Valley, which is part of Stanton's 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said it was Rocha's right to seek a recall, but the supervisor added 
that he would fight any such effort. According to state law, Stanton has seven 
days to file a written response to Rocha's recall papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to reply to the recall as (spelled) out in the law and continue my 
efforts to make sure we maximize the value of this investment portfolio and 
make sure it doesn't happen again," said Stanton, a county supervisor for the 
past 13 years. "I invited Mr. Rocha to join me in that effort, but he felt this 
action was more appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton took his own shot at Rocha, whose board borrowed money to invest in 
the county investment pool. Rocha seconded the motion that enabled the Orange 
County Department of Education to borrow $42.5 million to invest in the pool, 
Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I relied on the same information from the experts who were in place as Mr. 
Rocha did when he voted to borrow $42.5 million to invest in Mr. Citron's 
pool," Stanton said. "I asked him if he could understand that we are all 
victims in this, but he didn't answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha had said in an interview Monday that he wasn't sure if he approved the 
plan to borrow the money. "I'll take whatever heat there is," he said. "Maybe I 
should have paid attention. Maybe I should be critical of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 When news spread of Rocha's efforts, other county educators quickly came to 
Stanton's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Parker, a colleague of Rocha's on the five-member board of trustees, 
described the recall attempt as a political ploy aimed at calling attention to 
Rocha. She said Rocha was acting only as an individual and his recall efforts 
did not reflect the feelings of the board and other county educators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed (Rocha) has chosen his personal ambitions over doing a 
governance job and working for the kids," said Parker, 34, a Costa Mesa 
resident and 12-year member of the board. "I believe very strongly that the 
education community should work together as a team . . . to deal with the 
crisis. As far as blaming anyone, that comes later, once all the information 
comes out." 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Yamagata-Noji, current president and seven-year member of the Santa Ana 
Unified School District Board of Education, said Stanton has been part of the 
solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always found Roger Stanton to be very accessible to us, and right now 
he seems to be leading the charge to find a solution to this mess," she said. 
"We have great confidence in his leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 But an activist cheered the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best thing. (Stanton) should be out. He's been there so long," said 
Carol Walters, president of the Orange Taxpayers Assn. "I'm always happy when 
any resident goes out and fights." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said Stanton deserves a share of the blame for the county's financial 
woes. "He was playing games with the taxpayers' money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he would like to see the structure of the county changed so that 
the county treasurer is no longer publicly elected. He prefers the treasurer 
serve as a department head directly under the Board of Supervisors' control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Independently elected department heads are not a good idea," he said. "They 
are accountable directly to the voters. . . . I think there is a responsibility 
on the part of the board, but we have to give the elected representatives the 
power to directly give orders to their department heads, not have them hanging 
out there on a limb," as in the case of Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the county registrar of voters office said Rocha submitted a 
notice of intent to recall Stanton about 3 p.m. To make the recall valid, Rocha 
must now file the proposed wording of the recall petition next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the wording is approved, Rocha will have 160 days to collect the 
signatures of 10% of the registered voters in Stanton's district, or about 
15,000 signatures. If the petition is certified, a recall election would be 
held within 125 days.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; OTHER COUNTRIES USE PRIVATIZATION; FINANCES: GREAT 
BRITAIN AND CANADA PIONEERED IN THE SALE OR LEASE OF AIRPORTS TO GENERATE 
REVENUE. ONLY A FEW SMALL U.S. AIRPORTS ARE RUN BY PRIVATE OPERATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While there has been a great deal of discussion about letting private 
operators take over airports in the United States, most airport privatization 
has occurred in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization took hold in the 1980s when conservative governments in Canada 
and Great Britain began looking for ways to more efficiently perform public 
services while easing the financial burden on taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada, the Conservative government decided in 1987 to privatize 99 
government-run airports. It also undertook a partial privatization of Canada's 
largest, Pearson International Airport in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea gained greater attention the same year when Great Britain privatized 
London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports. The airports' sale in a public stock 
offering raised $2.5 billion for the British treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the sale attracted millions of dollars in private investment. 
The airports' services were upgraded and developers built shops that prompted 
passengers to spend more money at the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The success in Britain has led numerous other countries -- including 
Australia, Turkey and Russia -- to privatize airports. Many cities in the 
United States have also explored the possibility of privatization, but legal, 
political and practical obstacles have frustrated most efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The proponents of privatization say it provides efficient operations, new 
sources of funds and improved customer amenities such as shopping malls, and 
shifts risks from taxpayers to the private sector. But critics counter that it 
often means higher costs to users, less public accountability and less control 
over operations, expansions and development. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Reason Foundation, a Los Angeles-based conservative think 
tank that supports privatization, fewer than a dozen small U.S. airports are 
privatized -- that is, leased or managed by private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last five years Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Indianapolis, Los 
Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Syracuse, N.Y., and Worcester, 
Mass., have all considered privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major factor in the growing interest in airport privatization is government 
fiscal stress," said Robert W. Poole Jr., head of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said commercial airports often fail to generate a reasonable rate of return 
when operated by the government. Poole believes the push to reinvent government 
will increase the pressure to treat airports as business enterprises that 
should be run by the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest form of privatization is contracting out the management of the 
airport for a short period. Lockheed Air Terminal operates the airports in 
Burbank and in Albany and Stewart, N.Y., under such a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A municipality also can privatize by offering a long-term lease of an airport 
to a company, allowing the firm to operate and develop the facility. Atlantic 
City, N.J., leases its airport to Johnson Controls World Services on this 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a government entity can sell its airport outright. While such sales 
are now common abroad -- as with London's Gatwick and Heathrow, for instance -- 
none has occurred in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Albany, seeking to free up funds for other government services, tried to sell 
its airport to Lockheed in 1989 for $30 million. But the Federal Aviation 
Administration objected, saying federal money spent to build the airport could 
not be used for other purposes. Albany dropped the sale plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien last year stopped the privatization of 
two terminals in Toronto when his Liberal government declared that the proposal 
was not in the public interest. Chretien charged that business interests were 
being enriched at the expense of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization is largely opposed by airlines, which fear higher landing fees. 
"We have never seen a privatization that brought costs down," said Edward 
Merlis, vice president of the Air Transport Assn. of America, an airline 
industry trade group.

OFFICER CHARGED IN FRIENDLY-FIRE DEATHS SEEKS EXONERATION; MILITARY: HE SAYS 
RELEASE OF SECRET INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT WOULD HELP HIS DEFENSE IN THE MISTAKEN 
DOWNING OF TWO U.S. HELICOPTERS OVER IRAQ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Air Force Capt. Jim Wang, the lone airman ordered to a court-martial in the 
worst friendly-fire case in recent military history, is spending the holidays 
in the city where he grew up, far from the accusations that might ruin his 
decorated military career. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang is trying to persuade his superiors to open a secret defense intelligence 
document that he believes will convince the Air Force he should not go to 
prison. Failing that, he hopes his general court-martial on three criminal 
counts of dereliction of duty will come swiftly next month. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to exonerate himself, to prove to his country and the families of the 
26 killed in two Army helicopters over Iraq earlier this year that the deaths 
were not intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, he wants to walk shoulder-high again with the other five airmen 
who, after pretrial hearings, were absolved of any criminal wrongdoing in the 
April 14 tragedy. He doesn't believe that he alone should carry the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wonder whether it could have been prevented, and you know definitely it 
should have been," Wang said in an interview in his parents' Columbus home. 
"But there were a lot of breakdowns. And in hindsight, there were a lot of 
people who could have done something to break the chain of events. There were 
things I could have done, too, had I had the right information." 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in Taiwan, the only son of a carpenter. The family immigrated here 
when he was 2-years-old. He became a naturalized citizen. Just down the street 
is his old school, Hamilton High, where he was a star athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 A thousand miles away -- maybe more, it seems now -- is the U.S. Air Force 
Academy in Colorado, where he went when he left here 10 years ago, full of 
promise at the start of his military service. 
</P>
<P>
 He is soft-spoken and subdued. He appears much younger than his 28 years. The 
other day, he had to show an ID to buy beer. He could almost pass as the local 
high school kid, had he not come home this time accompanied by his wife, Wendy, 
their 22-month old son, Jim Jr., and his deep, sad reflections on what has been 
a most terrible year. 
</P>
<P>
 Just across town live John and Linda Garrett, the parents of one of the U.S. 
servicemen killed in the accident, Army Warrant Officer 2nd Class John W. 
Garrett Jr. He, too, was a career military man, and he was their only child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry he's the only one being charged when so many people did so much 
wrong," Linda Garrett said Tuesday. " . . . The Pentagon already said it was a 
combination of mistakes made by a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 She has not met Wang, but she would tell him this: "He feels bad he's going to 
lose his career. But it's better to still have your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Wang said he feels "very much for the families" who lost loved ones. "But I 
don't feel they should hold this against me," he said. "Because before this is 
over, I want to air as many questions as they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wang graduated from the Air Force academy in 1988 with a basic science degree 
and an emphasis on computers. Almost immediately, he focused his career on 
radar technology. He joined the special AWACS crews -- the airmen who provide 
Airborne Warning and Control System backup to help pilots spot enemy aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has won the Air Force humanitarian medal, the Southwest Asia 
service medal and three outstanding unit awards. Just before April, he was 
accepted into a special instructor school for squadron officers at Tyndall Air 
Force Base in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 One last assignment was a 35-day duty in Operation Provide Comfort, which 
enforces the "no-fly" zone over Iraq. He left the United States on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The ill-fated mission was his first deployment in Iraq. He was supervising 
three crew members aboard an AWACS plane that was flying in support of two F-15 
jets enforcing the "no-fly" zone. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour or so into the flight, he said, his crew "locked up some contacts on 
the radar" -- meaning their screens showed what could be enemy aircraft in the 
"no-fly" area. He and his crew passed that information to the two F-15 pilots, 
who he said answered that they had identified them as Iraqi Hind helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how they called them off," Wang said. "And from all the information we 
had received up to that time, there was nothing contrary that said they were 
friendly. We even interrogated them, we asked them if they were friend or foe, 
and we didn't receive any return." 
</P>
<P>
 Both pilots fired, each of them blowing a helicopter out of the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "They followed their own rules of engagement, and there was no requirement for 
them to come back to us for a second opinion or for permission to fire," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Wang said, he believed the pilots fired defensively. He heard the 
pilots radio "Splash one Hind" followed by "Splash second Hind." 
</P>
<P>
 The AWACS crew flew for another 11 hours, but within 30 minutes Wang began to 
worry something had gone wrong. He was told to help direct search and rescue 
operations, something that wouldn't be done for a downed enemy aircraft. Then 
he heard radio transmissions reporting that the F-15s had shot down two Army 
Blackhawk helicopters carrying military personnel and civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable," he said. "Nobody on board the AWACS plane wanted to 
believe that. It was so silent. Then everybody kept saying, 'No way could that 
have happened.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Wang and five other airmen were named in various criminal 
charges. One of the F-15 pilots was accused of 26 counts of negligent homicide. 
But Wang eventually learned that he alone would be court-martialed, while the 
rest would be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang has been charged with failing to supervise his radar controllers, failing 
to maintain a "current and accurate" radar picture of his area of 
responsibility and failing to make sure the pilots knew there were Army 
helicopters in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, he faces a maximum of three months in prison on each of the 
three counts, a garnishing of his wages, and possible discharge from the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Air Force Maj. Donald P. Holtz, said he learned recently of a 
secret National Security Agency report that, if revealed, could provide 
evidence that would clear Wang. The exact nature of the information is not 
known, but so far, military authorities have refused to turn the document over, 
saying it is not relevant.

 About 13.5 million Americans have been homeless for at least a few days 
sometime during their lives, contends a Columbia University study that provides 
the highest estimate yet of the prevalence of homelessness. An additional 12.5 
million have stayed off the street only by moving in with friends or family at 
some point, for periods of from a few days to a year, says the study published 
in American Journal of Public Health. The estimates are based on a survey of 
1,507 adults that asked whether they recalled ever being homeless, for how long 
and where they slept -- in the street, a shelter, abandoned buildings or 
someone else's home.

SUBWAY BOMB SUSPECT LOVES N.Y., WIFE SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The man accused of firebombing a crowded subway car in an extortion attempt 
could not have committed such a crime, his wife insisted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Leary "has always loved New York City," especially its subways, 
Marge Shaller said."He enjoyed the transit system -- he felt it was something 
that was a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary was in critical but stable condition with severe burns over nearly half 
his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't think he did it,"' Shaller said. "I think he's a victim." 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury indicted Leary on one count each of attempted murder, assault, 
attempted grand larceny and criminal possession of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had filed 45 counts of attempted murder against Leary. But because 
authorities are still investigating whom Leary allegedly intended to harm, the 
grand jury returned a single count of attempted murder against an unnamed 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is expected to return additional counts as victims recover and 
are able to testify. Leary could face up to 25 years in prison on the attempted 
murder charge alone.

 Seven weeks after losing the state's closest gubernatorial race in 75 years, 
Republican Ellen Sauerbrey asked a judge either to declare her the winner or 
order a new election because of what she claimed was voter fraud. In her 
Circuit Court suit, the former 16-year state lawmaker who lost to Democrat 
Parris Glendening by 5,993 votes, said volunteers had identified more than 
11,000 suspected cases of fraud or illegal voting. Glendening, a former 
three-term Prince George's County executive, was certified the winner this

KWANZAA; CELEBRATING AN AFRICAN PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monday marked the start of Kwanzaa, an African American holiday that 
celebrates culture, family and community. For seven days, through Jan. 1, 
African Americans will gather in their homes and at community events to reflect 
on the past year and to focus on the ideals that will enable them to lead 
prosperous and meaningful lives in the upcoming year. During this time, when 
"the edges of the year meet," African Americans who observe Kwanzaa place their 
attention on the Nguzo Saba, or the seven principles. The name Kwanzaa is taken 
from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, which means first fruits. Swahili is 
the language of Kwanzaa and the principles are known by their Swahili names. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa ceremonies are joyful, hopeful events that celebrate the good in life. 
Traditional African clothing is typically worn to Kwanzaa gatherings, which 
also include African music and dance. Because Kwanzaa is a time to commemorate 
the past, poetry and spoken tributes are paid to people of African descent who 
have contributed much to black life and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa is also a time of reverence to the Creator, an important element of 
Kwanzaa gatherings. * The Seven Principles Each day of Kwanzaa corresponds to a 
different principle. Those who observe Kwanzaa greet each other with "Habari 
gani?" which means, "What's the news?" The person being greeted responds with 
the principle of the day. 1. Umoja (Unity) 2. Kujichagulia (Self-determination) 
3. Ujima (Collective work and responsibility) 4. Ujamaa (Cooperative economics) 
5. Nia (Purpose) 6. Knumba (Creativity) 7. Imani (Faith) History of the Holiday 
Kwanzaa is not a "black Christmas," and is not specific to any religious group. 
In fact, it is not uncommon for families to celebrate Kwanzaa and other 
religious-based holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa is based on African harvest ceremonies that celebrate the first 
fruits. The holiday was founded in 1966 by Maulana Karenga, who is now chairman 
of the black studies department at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 18 million people of African descent worldwide now celebrate 
Kwanzaa, most of them in the United States. Symbols and Celebration The Flag: 
The bendera was created for people of African descent by Pan-Africanist leader 
Marcus Garvey. The red bar stands for the struggle for freedom, the black for 
unity and the green for future. * 
</P>
<P>
 Candles: Three red, one black and three green, they represent the seven 
principles. Each night of Kwanzaa, a different candle is lit, beginning with 
black, which is always in the center, and alternating from red to green. * 
</P>
<P>
 Kinara: With the candles, the candleholder is the heart of the Kwanzaa setting 
and symbolizes African ancestors. * 
</P>
<P>
 Muhindi: Corn represents children and the future. * 
</P>
<P>
 Mkeka: A mat that symbolizes history and tradition, the foundations upon which 
the community and family are built. * 
</P>
<P>
 Zawadi: Gifts signify the labor of parents and their love for their children. 
* 
</P>
<P>
 Mazao: Fruits and vegetables symbolize harvest and the rewards of labor. *

GOING COLD TURKEY; O.C. WORKPLACES, RESTAURANTS GEAR UP FOR SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On New Year's Day, one of the nation's toughest anti-smoking laws takes effect 
in California, banning people from lighting up in most enclosed workplaces and 
virtually all restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 While health groups and others have praised the new law as a key victory in 
the fight against the dangers of secondhand smoke, some business groups argue 
that the statute is vague and will give employers headaches. And it is not 
universally popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer offering a choice," said Craig Gilbert, manager of Antonello 
Ristorante in Santa Ana, which has separate dining rooms for smokers and 
nonsmokers. "A lot of our clientele enjoys smoking," he said. "Maybe now 
they'll just have to go outside to smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law will have a greater effect in Orange County than in Los Angeles, 
which last year required its restaurants to be smoke-free. Suburban and rural 
areas generally have not been as aggressive in imposing smoking prohibitions in 
restaurants and other public places. 
</P>
<P>
 The law will apply in all cities except those that have stronger anti-smoking 
ordinances. Smoking will be allowed in bars, including those inside 
restaurants, but only until Jan. 1, 1997. And new federal or state clean-air 
regulations could move up that compliance date. 
</P>
<P>
 That uncertainty plus certain aspects of the new law trouble some businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Reeves, director of industrial safety and health at the California Chamber 
of Commerce, said the law requires employers to post "clear and prominent" 
no-smoking signs, "but it gives no requirements on signage." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Health, which lobbied to get the law enacted, 
said the state is working with local governments to educate employers about the 
new law, including details such as signage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an enthusiasm in California for smoke-free work sites," said Colleen 
Stevens, an analyst with the Health Department in Sacramento. She said 
California's law is the strongest of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides bars, other places exempted from the ban are gaming clubs, truck cabs, 
most rooms and lobby areas of hotels, large warehouses in which 20 or fewer 
employees work, and businesses that employ five or fewer workers where all 
agree to allow smoking and where minors are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant industry, however, has been at the center of the debate on 
smoking bans and will probably feel the broadest and most costly effects from 
the new law, signed by Gov. Pete Wilson in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether voluntarily or because of local ordinances, an increasing number of 
workplaces in the state have become smoke-free in recent years. But many 
restaurants, fearing a loss of business, have maintained smoking areas wherever 
they can. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Restaurant Assn. supported the smoke-free legislation largely 
because it felt that a uniform ordinance would put all restaurants in the same 
competitive situation. "Hopefully, the playing field will be leveled," said 
Stan Kyker, the association's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when Sacramento enacted a workplace and restaurant smoking ban 
about two years ago, "we clearly lost business to two similar coffee shops just 
two blocks away outside the city limit," said a senior executive at Family 
Restaurants Inc., the Irvine-based company that operates 200 Coco's and Carrows 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you don't have to go two blocks away," said the executive, who asked not 
to be identified. But the new law, he said, could cost the company business 
anyway if people who smoke decide not to eat out as much because they can't 
light up in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyker said that probably will not happen on a large scale because most people 
have become accustomed to smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June, 72 cities in California had laws specifying that workplaces be 
100% smoke-free, and 91 cities had such smoking bans specifically for 
restaurants, according to California Smoke-Free Cities, a nonprofit group in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities in Orange County, including Laguna Beach, Huntington Beach and 
Laguna Hills, prohibit smoking in restaurants, but none has such an ordinance 
for the workplace. And the county's largest cities, Anaheim and Santa Ana 
included, do not have 100% smoking bans for restaurants, according to the June 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, Pasadena, Long Beach and Santa Monica are among those 
cities that ban smoking in restaurants or workplaces or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement of the statewide smoking ban is expected to be handled by local 
law agencies or health departments. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Smoke-Free Workplaces 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Sunday, state law prohibits smoking in most enclosed workplaces in 
California. An enclosed workplace can be broadly defined as any place of 
employment, including offices and restaurants, that has four walls and a 
ceiling. The following places are specifically excluded from AB 13 but may be 
regulated by local governments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Small businesses (five or fewer employees), when all four of the following 
conditions are met: 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking area is not accessible to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 No employees are required to work in smoking area against their will. 
</P>
<P>
 Air from smoking area is vented directly to outside of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Employer complies with all applicable state and federal ventilation standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gaming clubs, bars and taverns are exempt until Jan. 1, 1997, unless state 
or federal agencies set smoke-limiting standards for such places sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sixty-five percent of hotel and motel guest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Designated portions of hotel and motel lobbies. In large lobbies, smoking 
area can cover up to 25% of entire space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meeting and banquet rooms in hotels, motels, restaurants and convention 
centers, except when used for exhibit purposes or when meals are being served. 
During these times, smoking may be permitted in corridors or anterooms if no 
employee is stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Warehouses with more than 100,000 square feet of floor space and 20 or fewer 
full-time employees. Does not apply to any office space within a warehouse, 
which must be kept smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco shops and attached private smokers' lounges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employee break rooms designated for smoking, under strict ventilation rules 
like those for small businesses, listed above. 
</P>
<P>
 * Truck cabs and tractors, when a nonsmoking employee is not present. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private residences, except when used as a licensed child-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
 Theatrical production sites, if critical to the production. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical research or treatment sites, if necessary for research. 
</P>
<P>
 Patient smoking areas of long-term health-care facilities. What Employers Need 
to Do 
</P>
<P>
 The state law, called AB 13, requires specific actions on the part of 
employers to ensure the safety of all employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * If building is entirely smoke-free, employer must clearly post "No Smoking" 
signs at each building entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 * If building has a designated smoking area, signs stating "Smoking Is 
Prohibited Except in Designated Areas" must be clearly posted at each building 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 * If non-employee is seen smoking in the enclosed work area, employer must ask 
that individual to refrain from doing so.

ADVIL MAKERS LOSE FIGHT OVER ADS FOR ALEVE; COURTS: HOWEVER YOU SPELL RELIEF, 
THE WHOLE THING GAVE NEW JERSEY JUDGE 'A MONUMENTAL HEADACHE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Tuesday rebuffed the makers of Advil, who had sought to quash 
advertising claims for Aleve, a fast-rising competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge complained that the mountains of conflicting claims he had to read 
about the two painkillers had left him with a "monumental headache." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan rejected the contention that Aleve's 
distributor, Procter & Gamble Co., deliberately intended to mislead consumers. 
He also said there was no reliable proof that the ads conveyed a message that 
Aleve worked better than Advil or was effective for longer periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble, which began marketing Aleve in June, claimed victory. Andrew 
T. Berry, a company lawyer, said the ruling confirms that Aleve advertising was 
"fair and straightforward."  
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and other representatives of American Home Products Corp., which makes 
Advil, did not return telephone calls requesting comment. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home, based in Madison, N.J., filed the suit Aug. 8, asking that the 
Aleve ads be halted. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads proclaimed Aleve to be "All day strong -- all day long" because its 
recommended dosage is one or two pills every eight to 12 hours instead of every 
four to six hours. The ads stopped short of claiming one dose of Aleve would be 
effective for eight to 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Products surveys found that consumers got the message that Aleve 
lasts longer, but the judge said the studies were flawed. On the other hand, he 
said, three studies of Aleve's active ingredient done for its maker, Syntex 
Corp. -- though not definitive -- suggest that Aleve relieves pain for a longer 
period of time than Advil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the mass of evidence and exhibits, however, Politan wrote, "it is 
thus not surprising that the court presently finds itself in possession of a 
monumental headache, the alleviation of which is beyond the durational powers 
of any of the analgesics discussed herein." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ordered one minor adjustment, to which the companies had already 
agreed. It makes small changes to ads aimed at medical professionals regarding 
the testing of Aleve and the people involved in those tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Advil's active ingredient is ibuprofen. It is the No. 2 brand in the nation, 
with 13.6% of the $2.5-billion market for over-the-counter pain pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol, essentially acetaminophen, is No. 1 with 29.4% of 
the market, according to November figures from the research firm Information 
Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleve, the brand name for naproxen sodium, captured third place within three 
months of its introduction, with about 6.8%. By November its market share had 
fallen to 4.9%, but it was still in third place. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Products is not the only competitor that has bristled at claims 
for Aleve. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble agreed in November to modify some Aleve ads 
after the maker of Bayer Aspirin complained to the Council of Better Business 
Bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Those ads said a dose of aspirin lasts just four hours. Bayer maker Sterling 
Winthrop Inc. said that was misleading because Bayer aspirin is available in 
different dosages. Procter & Gamble said the revised ads will differentiate 
between Genuine Bayer and Bayer's eight-hour version.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: EMERGING MARKETS' TROUBLES MAY PULL U.S. INVESTORS

 Return to the First World? 
</P>
<P>
 For investors, that may be the clarion call resounding from Mexico's deepening 
financial crisis. As plunging Latin American share prices worsen an already 
lousy year for "emerging markets" stock owners, the lower-risk allure of U.S., 
European and Japanese securities may grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe that U.S. stocks and bonds in particular are poised to 
benefit as Americans -- and other global investors -- reconsider the hazards 
versus the potential rewards in committing money to far-off and usually 
illiquid Third World markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's stunning currency devaluation and seeming loss of financial stability 
since last week have been unnerving even to professional emerging-markets 
investors, because until this year the country had been considered one of the 
greatest foreign-market success stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think one can ignore that Mexico was seen as one of the more 
blue-chip emerging markets," said Richard T. Saler, manager of the Lexington 
Worldwide Emerging Markets stock fund. With the Mexican market now down nearly 
40% this year in dollar terms, "To pretend that it's not going to have an 
impact (on investors' attitudes) is kidding oneself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on the heels of the Mexican stock market's tremendous 1988-92 gains 
that emerging-markets investing in general became fashionable in 1993, leading 
to a spectacular surge in purchases of foreign stock mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 International funds, which took in $5.1 billion in new cash in 1992, saw $26.3 
billion pour in during 1993. And through October of this year, the inflows kept 
up a record pace, reaching $26.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The assets of emerging-markets stock funds alone, which had totaled a mere 
$600 million at the end of 1992, ballooned to $10 billion by last Sept. 30, 
says fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
 But after huge stock gains in 1993, the continuing inflow of cash into 
emerging-markets funds hasn't been matched by performance this year, despite a 
summer rally in many of those markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The average emerging-markets stock fund plunged 12.6% in the first half of the 
year, according to Lipper, as the Indian uprising in Mexico's Chiapas state 
last January and the fallout from rising interest rates worldwide slammed many 
Third World markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer, a rebound in Mexico and other major emerging markets erased the 
first-half loss, but the gains proved fleeting. By last Thursday, as other 
Latin American markets slumped with Mexico, the typical emerging-markets fund 
share owner was down 10.6% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the average U.S. stock fund is off about 2.5% this year, while 
the average diversified international fund (many of which invest mostly in 
major foreign markets) has lost a mere 1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been possible to make money in emerging markets this year. But the 
biggest gainers have been some of the smallest and least liquid of world stock 
markets -- places where most mutual funds would have very little invested. 
Bangladeshi stocks, for example, are up nearly 114% this year. The tiny 
Peruvian market is up about 51%. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, the year's big losers have included markets that, like 
Mexico, had been touted as particularly promising in the 1990s: China, where 
the Shenzhen market index has plunged almost 64%; Hong Kong, off 30%, and 
Malaysia, which has lost about 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, any investor taking a chance in high-risk emerging markets should 
in theory be prepared for raucous volatility. What's more, the give-back in 
Third World stock prices this year has been relatively small compared with 
1993's gains: The Fidelity Emerging Markets fund, down 19% this year, was up 
82% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But with this latest and more terrifying decline in Latin American stocks, 
some investment pros worry that the public's patience is wearing thin. "What 
concerns me is that much of the money (in emerging-market funds) may have been 
invested by people who had no idea what could happen" when trouble hits, said 
Madelynn Matlock, manager of the Bartlett Value International stock fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as a surprising number of municipal bond fund investors bailed out of 
those funds in the wake of Orange County's bankruptcy this month, managers of 
emerging-markets funds worry about a delayed reaction to the Mexican crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of heavy shareholder redemptions in international funds in early January 
have kept the Lexington fund's Saler from bargain hunting in Latin markets, he 
says; if fund investors begin to exit in droves, the carnage in the Mexican, 
Brazilian and Argentine markets could worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, even though investors have been conditioned to buy when markets 
plummet, the relative attraction of most emerging stock markets is dimming for 
another reason: U.S. stocks, bonds and money market investments, and their 
counterpart investments in Europe and Japan, have become much more enticing for 
global investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in short-term U.S. interest rates has lifted the yield on one-year 
U.S. Treasury bills to 7.2%, an extraordinary risk-free return. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, long-term U.S. bond yields -- and European bond yields -- 
are coming down as more investors assume that both economic growth and 
inflation in 1995 will be moderate. A continuing bond rally could draw in an 
increasing number of risk-averse, yield-hungry investors. 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S., European and some Japanese stocks, the renewed attraction is the 
prospect of another gain in corporate earnings in 1995, with stock prices now 
at reasonable valuations after this year's declines. Indeed, with many First 
World and Third World stocks now priced in the same range -- at 11 to 15 times 
estimated 1995 earnings per share -- investors may logically ask whether the 
risk inherent in Third World markets makes them relatively overpriced.  
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, there's no question that emerging markets should offer higher 
returns for higher risk. But near term, the message of Mexico may be that the 
glory days of emerging-markets investing have run their course.

MEXICO'S FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL; PESO FALLS ANOTHER 8%; INVESTORS BAILING OUT; 
CRISIS: U.S. TRADERS SAY THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS DOING TOO LITTLE. ZEDILLO IS 
TO UNVEIL A STRATEGY PLAN MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concern over government inaction and the specter of renewed inflation wrought 
havoc on Mexico's financial markets Tuesday as the peso lost another 8%, stocks 
and bonds tumbled and short-term interest rates skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors impatiently awaiting a government plan to control the chaos made for 
the exits. The plan, scheduled to be unveiled by President Ernesto Zedillo on 
Monday, is expected to include broad-based currency, wage and price controls 
and possibly a blueprint for selling government-owned assets to generate cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso closed Tuesday at about 5.55 pesos to the dollar, from 5.1 pesos 
Monday -- a loss of 60% since the previous Monday. The Bolsa stock index closed 
down 65.89 points, or 2.8%, at 2,276.90, and overnight interest rates zoomed to 
36%, up from Monday's 26%. Rates for government securities rose to 30% from 
23%. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of Mexican fixed-rate bonds posted their biggest one-day decline 
ever, falling 9% in value to their lowest level in almost four years, amid 
complaints from U.S. traders that the Mexican government was doing too little 
to resolve the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists, discouraged by the continued weakness of the peso since 
devaluation began last week, now predict a sharp increase in Mexican inflation 
in 1995 to as high as 20%, up from 7.5% this year. That's because Mexican 
consumers will not be able to wean themselves from a dependence on foreign 
goods, which are now significantly more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some warned that the inflation rate could go higher if the government 
fails to enlist the support of labor unions and businesses in renewing the 
Pacto, the agreement by which the government over the past six years has gotten 
business and labor to accept proscribed limits on wage and price hikes.  
</P>
<P>
 "The patient is lying on the table and hemorrhaging," said John Liegey, head 
of the Weston Group, a New York-based firm specializing in Latin America. If 
Mexican officials "don't do something quick, there won't be a patient." 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers echoed the view of several 
analysts when he said the value of the peso had fallen further than justified 
by the state of the Mexican economy, adding that "excessive depreciation" is in 
no one's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recent movements in the value of the Mexican peso have gone considerably 
beyond what can be justified by Mexican economic fundamentals," Summers said in 
a statement. "We are in close contact with the Mexican and Canadian authorities 
regarding the situation in the currency markets." 
</P>
<P>
 But few held out hope that the currency will stabilize before Zedillo 
announces his plan, which could include lines of credit from the International 
Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso's problems continue to affect other Latin American stock markets. The 
Sao Paulo stock index, the Bovespa, slumped 1,646 points, or 3.8%, to 41,137. 
In Argentina, the Merval index sank 4% to 437.62 and Chile's IPSA index dropped 
2.3% to 142.29. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peso is out of control for three reasons: The Mexican government 
misjudged foreign investor reaction to devaluation. The government betrayed 
people's trust after saying earlier in the month that they wouldn't devalue. 
And third, they have been silent ever since," said Geoffrey Dennis, an equity 
analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso began its free fall last week after the government announced it would 
let its value float against the dollar. The government changed its 
anti-devaluation stance after a severe depletion of its foreign reserves, which 
it used to buy up pesos on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Observers such as Salomon Bros. economist Larry Goodman expressed doubt that 
Mexico will see a recurrence of inflation such as that triggered by the 1982 
devaluation. The seven-year financial crisis that followed saw triple-digit 
inflation, massive capital flight to safe havens in Zurich and Miami, 
government seizure of banks and foreign investors' loss of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 As unstable as Mexico may now appear, Brookings Institution economist Nora 
Lustig said, the country is on much more solid footing. In 1982, Mexico ran a 
16% budget deficit, forcing it to print money to pay its foreign and domestic 
debts. Now, after years of austerity, the government takes in more revenue in 
taxes than it spends, Lustig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, we are very worried, and the government has to come out with a 
coherent and transparent exchange rate policy," Goodman said. "There is going 
to be a time of uncertainty and volatility."  
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche said that to control short-term inflation, 
the government is relying on a 60-day wage and price freeze with key businesses 
and labor unions, beginning the day the government floated the peso last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra Puche and Mexican Central Bank economists indicated they will use that 
two-month moratorium to formulate new economic measures for the remainder of 
1995 that will address long-term inflation. Zedillo's speech Monday will give 
at least a preliminary view of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mexican economic analysts and independent columnists have strongly 
urged all businesses in the country to resist the temptation to hike prices 
immediately. For example, a front-page editorial Monday in Mexico's prominent 
economic daily El Financiero appealed for employers and employees to treat the 
60-day freeze as nothing less than a cease-fire on a battleground. 
</P>
<P>
 "These 60 days set aside for the authorities to adjust and design a new 
strategy must be understood as a necessary truce to evaluate the real state of 
the economy," the editorial said. "For this reason, it is indispensable that 
during this break, society and especially the production sectors make 
additional sacrifices to combat speculation, avoid price increases and resist 
pressure on salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said the government assets that may be sold to raise cash could 
include the state-owned toll roads, airports and secondary petrochemical 
plants.

VIACOM AGREES TO SELL CABLE UNIT FOR $2 BILLION; TELEVISION: THE DEAL WITH 
INTERMEDIA PARTNERS WOULD CREATE THE NATION'S BIGGEST MINORITY-OWNED SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that would create the nation's largest minority-owned cable TV 
system, Viacom Inc. has agreed to sell its cable franchises to a San 
Francisco-based partnership, sources close to the deal said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement the parties expect to disclose this week, Viacom is to 
receive about $2 billion in cash and a lucrative tax certificate that would 
enable the New York-based cable TV network and media company to defer or avoid 
a capital gain of more than $1 billion on the sale of its half a dozen cable 
systems, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which has been under negotiation for at least three months, would 
catapult Intermedia Partners -- a privately held minority-run cable company 
with 750,000 cable TV subscribers and annual revenue of about $200 million -- 
to the nation's sixth-largest cable operator with nearly 2 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Intermedia, whose cable holdings are now concentrated mostly in Santa Clara 
County, Calif., and Nashville, Tenn., would get 1.1 million Viacom subscribers 
in metropolitan Seattle; Dayton, Ohio; the San Francisco Bay area, and three 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really started focusing on this deal last Tuesday; we expect to announce 
the deal before the end of the year," a source close to the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokespersons at Viacom's cable unit and at Intermedia would neither confirm 
nor deny that an agreement had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough apparently came after federal regulators resolved an 
antitrust dispute with Intermedia investor and Denver-based cable giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission had been investigating whether the TCI-planned 
acquisition of rival Tele-Cable Corp. would create antitrust violations in 
Columbus, Ga., where the two companies competed for 2,800 viewers. Federal 
officials said subscribers would no longer have a choice of cable providers if 
TCI's purchase went through. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI agreed to exclude those 2,800 subscribers from the deal, freeing it to 
purchase the other Tele-Cable properties and removing a cloud of uncertainty 
over whether the FTC inquiry might affect the Viacom-Intermedia deal because of 
TCI's 31% interest in Intermedia. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides catapulting Intermedia to the top ranks of the $20-billion cable 
industry, the deal highlights the meteoric career of Frank Washington, a 
principal of Intermedia and a former executive at Times Mirror Co., publisher 
of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, as a result of the Viacom deal, Washington would capitalize on an 
obscure Federal Communications Commission tax rule he worked on while working 
as an aide and subsequently bureau chief at the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington would not comment when reached at his Sacramento office. But legal 
experts say that because Washington is a minority -- he is black -- Viacom can 
receive an FCC tax certificate enabling it to defer or avoid the income tax on 
any gain from its sale of cable properties to Intermedia as long as the money 
is reinvested in the purchase of other media properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the purchase price for Viacom's cable systems is about $400 million 
lower than previously reported, analysts said there would probably be few 
financial repercussions on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's been expecting something around $2 billion to $2.4 billion; I've 
got to believe that figure is already accounted for in the (current) stock 
price" of Viacom, said Ray Katz, an analyst for Bear, Stearns & Co. in New 
York.

THE CUTTING EDGE; A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE; UC IRVINE BOOKSTORE WINS ACCLAIM FOR ITS 
INTERNET ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's 6:30 p.m., and Michael Kiley, associate director of the UC Irvine 
bookstore, is rushing off to Japanese class. "I need to learn just some 
rudimentary stuff so I can handle orders from Japan," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The bookstore has been drawing as many as 120,000 browsers a week from around 
the globe since it began advertising on the Internet. Among its biggest 
customers, Kiley said, have been Japanese academics seeking technical books 
published only in English, and aficionados of Japanese animation art, called 
anime.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Kiley started the venture in April just for fun, his experiment is 
drawing national acclaim and is even helping to set the standard for Internet 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have an excellent format," said David Scott Lewis, editor of the 
electronics industry magazine Hot Off the Tree. "It is one of the best I have 
seen." Kiley describes the service as the only on-line college bookstore in the 
world. Books, records, CD-ROMs and sweat shirts are displayed on the World Wide 
Web, a subset of the Internet -- a group of computer networks linking an 
estimated 30 million computer users around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Wide Web offers not only standard text but also color pictures, 
video displays and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI bookstore's Web venture has not been terribly lucrative yet, Kiley 
said, drawing about $5,000 worth of electronic mail orders a month. But he and 
others see great profit potential for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is doing it now," Lewis said, citing the consortium of computer 
makers -- including Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Apple -- that recently entered the 
on-line marketplace by offering home computer accessories for sale on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
 Multinational corporations, among them Pizza Hut and Hilton Hotels, are also 
experimenting with Internet advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Students across Southern California see the UCI cyberstore as a welcome 
alternative to fighting over textbooks and standing in long lines to make 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA student Joshua Chou said he shops electronically at the UCI store because 
he likes the easy pace. He can browse through the inventory from his computer 
terminal at home, then send his orders by electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The store also courts repeat business by offering a 10% yearly discount to 
e-mail customers, who pay an annual $10 membership fee. The price break and the 
convenience, Chou said, keep him coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Wide Web is only about 5 years old, and the idea of advertising on 
it is even younger. Companies that do use it typically make presentations 
similar to that of Hilton, which adds color photos to text so that its displays 
resemble magazine pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCI's site is very attractive," Lewis said. "I have seen sites that are more 
attractive, but they don't have a lot of content." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI is on the cutting edge, designing dozens of pages that combine text with 
color pictures, graphics and sounds such as narration and music. A recent 
promotion for a travel book titled "The Big Island of Hawaii" included an 
interactive map that allowed readers to get information about specific points 
of interest on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use it to draw people into the site," Kiley said, "and hope that once they 
are there they will browse." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's biggest on-line sellers, technical books, typically do not have great 
visual appeal, he said, but the store hopes to attract people drawn to the site 
by travel and other picture books. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, UCI has also managed to market on the Web without drawing criticism 
from purists who say there is no room for commerce on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 A heated debate on that topic began in April when two Arizona lawyers sent 
e-mail advertisements for their services to millions of Internet users. They 
were bombarded by thousands of messages from outraged subscribers warning them 
that they had violated an unwritten law prohibiting unsolicited commercial 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said the UCI bookstore ads are not prompting a similar outcry because, 
unlike the e-mail messages, these ads must be sought out. Besides, he said, the 
UCI idea is in sync with the interests of the Internet's technology-savvy 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is tremendous demand for a service like this," Lewis said. "I can't 
tell you how many times in the user groups people ask where to find books on 
certain topics." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroshi Deguchi, a professor of communications at the International University 
of Japan, shops for books on subjects such as econometrics and set theory. 
Those English texts are difficult to find in Japan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's selection is excellent, Deguchi said, as is the bookstore's service. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big draw after technical publications is the extensive inventory of 
anime, including comics, books, videos, laser discs and CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mats Roger Nielsen has become a frequent UCI shopper since discovering the 
anime collection last year. Anime, he said, is nearly impossible to find in his 
country, Norway, and browsing the UCI Web site is much cheaper and faster than 
making inquiries to bookstores by regular mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in Norway, regular mail to and from California takes at least five 
days," Nielsen said. "With e-mail, I get answers to my numerous questions the 
next day, even with a nine-hour time difference -- and for free."

 Customers Allege Fraud at Great Western: About 50 senior citizens said 
securities brokers at bank branches deceived them into investing their savings 
in risky, uninsured mutual funds.Attorney Michael Linfield said he organized a 
forum in West Hollywood to try to gauge the extent of the problem and determine 
if he should file a class-action or a multiple-plaintiff lawsuit. Linfield 
filed suit against the bank last month on behalf of a Santa Monica widow. Ian 
Campbell, a spokesman for Great Western Bank, said, "We're very angry at these 
charges because we think they distort our records and our performance and 
distort it wildly."

 U.S., Japan Hope to Resume Car Trade Talks: Officials from the two nations, 
after meeting in London, said negotiations could start up again in January, the 
Commerce Department said.In a statement the department said Undersecretary 
Jeffrey Garten and Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo 
Okamatsu met in London "to review a wide range of trade and commercial issues 
coming up in 1995." The statement said the two officials will make 
recommendations this week to MITI Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and to Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. Details of 
the talks and the agenda will be announced early in 1995, the department said.

 GTE to Acquire Rest of Contel: The telephone company said it has reached an 
agreement to acquire the 10% of Contel Cellular Inc. that it does not already 
own for $255 million in cash. The offer o $25.50 a share represents an increase 
of about $31 million from the $224 million, or $22.50 a share, GTE Corp. bid in 
September for the remaining stake in Atlanta-based Contel Cellular.GTE is 
offering to acquire the Class A common shares of Contel Cellular. Under the 
terms of the agreement, a newly formed subsidiary of GTE would merge into 
Contel Cellular. The two companies also said they reached a tentative agreement 
to settle suits filed by shareholders who claimed the original offer was too 
low.

 Tiny Vermont Firm Awarded $25.5 Million Royalty: A U.S. District Court 
magistrate in Burlington, Vt., set the award to compensate Vermont Microsystems 
Inc. for software pirating.VMI, which has 10 employees, had sued Autodesk Inc. 
of San Rafael, Calif., alleging that secrets purloined by a former VMI employee 
enabled Autodesk to produce certain computer-aided design software. Peter Reed, 
president of VMI, called the judgment "very conservative" and said he was 
disappointed that the court did not order Autodesk to stop selling products 
based on the VMI technology. Autodesk issued a statement denying any wrongdoing 
and saying it intends to appeal the judgment.

 UPI, AT&T Discuss Forming Venture: United Press International, the privately 
held news wire service, said it is in talks with the long-distance telephone 
company, possibly to provide on-line information services.Such an agreement 
would enhance AT&T Corp.'s push into the $6-billion on-line services market; 
the firm bought Ziff Communications Co.'s on-line business last week. AT&T 
officials refused to comment. Ziff's Interchange Network is being tested and is 
expected to be launched in 1995. MCI Communications Corp. and Ameritech Corp., 
the Chicago-based Bell operating company, have also talked to UPI about a joint 
venture, said Ron MacIntyre, UPI vice president of marketing.

 J.C. Penney Co. in Pension Settlement: The department store chain said it has 
reached a tentative settlement of a lawsuit over retirement benefits under 
which its pension plan would pay up to $80 million to current and former 
personnel.If approved, the settlement could mean additional benefits for tens 
of thousands of employees amounting to as much as several thousand dollars 
each. The class action protested the formula that Plano, Tex.-based Penney 
formerly used to calculate pensions. Using that formula, the company subtracted 
from an employee's pension benefits the amounts it estimated the employee would 
be eligible to receive from Social Security.

 Texaco Inc. Seeks Dismissal of Ecuadorean Indians' Lawsuit: The oil company 
said it asked a federal judge to dismiss the suit, which seeks $1.5 billion in 
compensation for damage to the rain forest.Last year, several Ecuadorean groups 
filed suit, alleging that Texaco had ruined bodies of water and land while 
working at the site. They also charged that waste from crude oil drilling had 
given some of their people cancer. White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco said it had 
met a court's conditions for dismissal of the case by negotiating with the 
Ecuadorean government an agreement under which Texaco will clean up the site. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs could not be reached for comment.

IRS TO CHARGE FEE FOR PAYING TAX BILL IN INSTALLMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service has a new wrinkle for taxpayers: a fee for paying 
federal tax bills on installment plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency on Tuesday proposed regulations that would allow it to begin 
charging $43 a year for new installment-plan payers. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers already paying in installments won't escape the charges, either. The 
IRS plans to impose a fee of $24 for payment plans that are renewed or 
restructured. The fees will begin in March. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2.7 million taxpayers will ask to pay their tax bill in 
installments for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, an IRS spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 If half that number of taxpayers were approved for installment plans, the IRS 
would take in more than $58 million from the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said it needs the cash to cover costs associated with setting up 
individual installment plans. They include determining whether installment 
payment is appropriate, setting up a schedule, processing the payments and 
making sure the taxpayer sticks to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the plan is set for Jan. 20, but there's little chance of 
persuading the agency to reconsider the fees, the spokeswoman said.

STUDY SEES ONLY MODEST CHANGE FROM PROP. 103; INSURANCE: STATE REPORT ALSO SAYS 
VIRTUALLY ALL COMPANIES ARE VIOLATING THE INITIATIVE WITH CALCULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shooting down concerns raised by auto insurers about prospects for 
skyrocketing rates for some motorists, a state study released Tuesday found 
that most California drivers would notice only modest changes in their premiums 
if Proposition 103 were fully implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the state Insurance Department -- an 18-month analysis of auto 
policies covering 10 million Californians -- also found that virtually all 
insurers are currently violating the consumer initiative in the way they 
calculate premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 In what amounted to a goodby slap at auto insurers, outgoing California 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said in a statement that the report's 
results "clearly show that the sky will not fall if insurance companies use the 
rating factors they are mandated to use under Proposition 103. In fact, the 
majority of California drivers will not experience rate increases at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The rating factors Garamendi cited are the three primary criteria that 
Proposition 103 provides for insurers to rely on in calculating premiums: an 
individual motorist's safety record, the number of miles driven annually and 
the years of driving experience.  
</P>
<P>
 The intent was to sharply de-emphasize the weight insurers give to the 
communities where drivers live -- a factor that historically penalized urban 
and minority motorists but which, the study suggests, continues to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103, passed in November, 1988, also called for a one-time rollback 
of auto, home and business insurance rates 20% below 1987 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 However, insurers have blocked the initiative through the courts and in 
administrative hearings. Just last week, a group of insurers asked the U.S. 
Supreme Court to review a California Supreme Court ruling that upheld rebate 
regulations imposed by Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to auto rates, insurers have also argued that some rural and 
suburban motorists' premiums would leap under Proposition 103 unless the 
insurance commissioner spells out additional rate-setting criteria that can be 
used to determine premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the results of the new state study, consumer activists disputed 
that point. "Insurers have been crying wolf," said Jamie Court, organizing 
director for the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tim Hart, a spokesman for the Assn. of California Insurance Cos., said 
Garamendi himself is to blame for the finding that the insurance industry is 
violating Proposition 103 by not properly applying the three primary motorist 
rating factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart faulted Garamendi for failing to issue regulations indicating to what 
extent secondary rating factors, such as location of residence, can be used to 
calculate rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Court rushed to Garamendi's defense, saying the commissioner was thwarted in 
his efforts to write regulations and to evaluate how insurers are determining 
auto premiums because the industry refused to yield important data regarding 
their calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, only 4% of drivers would face increases of $100 or 
more in their twice-a-year premiums for bodily injury coverage if the 
initiative were fully implemented. An equal percentage would benefit from cuts 
of $100 or more. Bodily injury coverage accounts for roughly half of a driver's 
overall insurance bill.

ADVIL MAKERS LOSE FIGHT OVER ALEVE ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Tuesday rebuffed the makers of Advil, who had sought to quash 
advertising claims for Aleve, a fast-rising competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge complained that the mountains of conflicting claims he had to read 
about the two painkillers had left him with a "monumental headache." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan rejected the contention that Aleve's 
distributor, Procter & Gamble Co., deliberately intended to mislead consumers. 
He also said there was no reliable proof that the ads conveyed a message that 
Aleve worked better than Advil or was effective for longer periods. Procter & 
Gamble claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home, based in Madison, N.J., filed the suit Aug. 8, asking that the 
Aleve ads be halted. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads proclaimed Aleve to be "All day strong -- all day long" because its 
recommended dosage is one or two pills every eight to 12 hours instead of every 
four to six hours. The ads stopped short of claiming one dose of Aleve would be 
effective for eight to 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Products surveys found that consumers got the message that Aleve 
lasts longer, but the judge said the studies were flawed.

 T-Bill Rates Drop: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell in 
auction to the lowest level in a month.The Treasury Department sold $13.0 
billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.56%, down from 
5.59% last week. An additional $13.1 billion was sold in six-month bills at an 
average discount rate of 6.24%, down from 6.30%. The three-month bill rate was 
the lowest since the bills sold for 5.44% on Nov. 28. The six-month bill rate 
was the lowest since it averaged 5.86%, also Nov. 28. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 5.72% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,859.50 and 6.53% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,684.50.

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REACHES 4 1/2-YEAR HIGH; ECONOMY: CONFERENCE BOARD DATA 
SUGGESTS GROWTH WILL CONTINUE. BUT SIGNS OF WEAKNESS ALSO EMERGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American consumer confidence surged in December to the highest level in 4 1/2 
years, a leading business group reported Tuesday in a survey that suggests the 
economy will expand further next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But new signs of weakness also emerged in the data gathered by the Conference 
Board, as well as in a separate report from a real estate trade group that says 
rising interest rates may be starting to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board's survey shows the perception of more job opportunities 
and low inflation have made consumers more comfortable about their present 
financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's index of consumer sentiment, based on survey results, rose to 
102.2, up from a revised reading of 100.4 in November. It was the highest since 
the 102.4 reading in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The index, calculated from a base of 100, is derived from responses to 
questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide on topics ranging from local job 
availability to plans to buy a washing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 It is considered useful by some economists for anticipating the spending and 
borrowing patterns of consumers, who account for two-thirds of all U.S. 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabian Linden, head of the Conference Board's consumer research unit, 
attributed the confidence levels to the four-year low in national unemployment 
rates and the country's benign inflation rate, which has remained below 3% for 
the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two measures are among the most important factors affecting consumer 
confidence," he said. "The latest survey readings strongly suggest that 1995 
should be another good year for the U.S. economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the survey shows that expectations for the next six months 
dropped in December, suggesting consumers don't necessarily expect the better 
times to last. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists saw this as an indication that interest rates, which have been 
rising since February, might be forcing consumers to re-evaluate whether 
they'll be able to afford a new house, car or appliance next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Realtors, a real estate trade group, said sales of 
previously owned homes dropped 2.6% in November to an adjusted annual rate of 
3.81 million, the lowest since June, 1993.

 FCC to Streamline Bidding for Small Firms: Auctions of mobile phone licenses 
for entrepreneurs that want in on the wireless personal communications services 
market will be put on a fast track under a new Federal Communications 
Commission plan aimed at reducing bidding complexity and speeding license 
awards. Federal regulators have set aside a block of licenses to help small 
companies compete with wealthier giants such as AT&T and the regional Bell 
telephone companies. Bidding is restricted to companies or individuals with 
less than $125 million in gross revenue and total assets of less than $500 
million.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW RISES 28 AS LATIN STOCKS TUMBLE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. stock and bond markets rallied Tuesday, even as Latin American markets 
plummeted in the wake of Mexico's worsening financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said U.S. markets are in part benefiting from a "flight to quality" 
as investors seek lower-risk alternatives to battered stocks and bonds of 
emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials, continuing their December rally, gained 28.26 points to 
3,861.69. Since Dec. 8, the Dow has risen 176 points, or 4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Most broader stock market indexes also rose Tuesday, though they trailed the 
Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell to a 
three-month low of 7.76% from 7.84% on Friday, responding to a National Assn. 
of Realtors report that sales of previously owned homes fell in November to the 
lowest level in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say long-term bond yields have been declining as more investors have 
grown confident that the economy will slow in 1995, lessening the chances of 
higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations of a slowing economy are evident in the shape of the "yield 
curve," which simply measures yields on bonds of various maturities. On Tuesday 
the yield curve "inverted": Five-year Treasury note yields were 7.78%, compared 
to 7.76% on 30-year T-bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the longest-term bonds pay the highest yields. An inverted yield 
curve often heralds a less-robust economy, as the Federal Reserve Board keeps 
shorter-term interest rates artificially high while the market lets longer-term 
rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas sales reports from a number of retailers added to the sense that the 
economy is slowing: Sales were said to be less than expected in many regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing and retail sales data suggests that the Fed's six interest rate 
increases this year may finally be having the desired effect on the booming 
economy, said Don Hays, investment strategist at Wheat First Butcher Singer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, a slower economy would be welcomed because it would 
relieve concerns about higher inflation and allow the Fed to show restraint in 
future rate hikes, potentially stretching out the economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some analysts noted that the broad market's rally wasn't as impressive as 
the Dow's on Tuesday, suggesting continuing investor caution. Winners topped 
losers by just 12 to 10 on the New York Stock Exchange, and volume was a mere 
211 million shares. Many traders are away for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as the December rally plows on, and as Mexico's crisis dampens 
enthusiasm for Third World stocks, analysts say the chances are increasing that 
U.S. stocks could benefit from a windfall of new money in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Latin American issues traded in U.S. markets dominated the losers' list, as 
investors bailed out on the heels of continuing selloffs in the home markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar-denominated Mexican shares were hit the hardest, in part adjusting to 
their lowered value as measured in pesos, following last week's currency 
devaluation. Telmex plunged 2 7/8 to 37 3/4, Grupo Tribasa slid 2 5/8 to 17 
1/4, Vitro plummeted 2 1/8 to 11 3/8 and Empresas ICA fell 3 5/8 to 15 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Among closed-end stock funds, Mexico Fund plunged 3 1/4 to 20, Brazil Fund 
lost 1 1/2 to 30 3/4 and Argentina Fund gave up 7/8 to 11 7/8. Most Latin stock 
markets dropped between 2% and 4% in local currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. blue chips leading the Dow higher included Alcoa, up 1 to 85 1/8; GE, 
up 1 1/2 to 51 1/4; Caterpillar, up 7/8 to 55 1/4, and IBM, up 3/4 to 74 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software stocks led another technology rally. Sybase gained 1 1/8 to 51 3/8, 
Computer Associates added 1 to 48 1/4 and Oracle jumped 1 11/16 to 45. 
</P>

POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / 
TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; TINKERING ON THE INTERNET? HERE'S HOW TO STOCK YOUR 
TOOLBOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL AKST, Daniel Akst, a Los Angeles writer, is a former assistant 
business editor for technology at The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't take much beyond a computer and a modem (and perhaps a capacity for 
wasting time) to have fun in cyberspace. But just as homeowners over the years 
acquire a number of tools they couldn't live without, on-line veterans 
typically have several items that make exploring cyberspace more rewarding, 
less painful or both. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll assume here that you want to roam beyond, say, America Online to try 
smaller bulletin board systems (BBSes) and the Internet. Perhaps you even want 
to dial into the computer at work, or the computer system at the offices of 
your clients. Here's a rundown on some of the basics you'll find useful. 
Exploring cyberspace shouldn't bankrupt you, so almost everything recommended 
here is free or cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the first thing you need is a decent telecommunications program. 
Windows users -- that's probably most of us these days -- already have Windows 
Terminal, and it actually works. But it lacks many features you'll want sooner 
or later, particularly the ability to capture everything coming across your 
screen, so get something better. 
</P>
<P>
 Several shareware packages offer terrific value in this department. WinRamp 
Lite, for example, has an impressive array of features that includes floating 
toolbars that can be customized, Zmodem for fast and easy file transfers, 
multiple simultaneous terminal windows, RIPScrip support for BBSes that use 
this graphics system, and more. If you keep the program, registration is just 
$35. For more information, e-mail info@vironix.com. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of file transfers, you've probably noticed that many of the files you 
want to download have the ".zip" extension. That's because they've been 
compressed to save on storage and transfer times, using a program named Pkzip. 
In order to use these files, you first have to "unzip" them. The Pkzip package 
for zipping and unzipping is available all over cyberspace as pk204g.exe. It's 
a self-extracting zip file, meaning you just run it and it unzips itself. You 
can also find shareware Windows shells for Pkzip, which is a DOS program. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's say you've created a nifty Word for Windows template for writing 
screenplays, and you want to send it to someone in New York. Trouble is, you're 
on America Online and your friend gets e-mail via MCI Mail, so you can't just 
attach the file to a message. 
</P>
<P>
 What the two of you need is uuencode and uudecode, a free pair of DOS 
utilities that make it possible for binary files to be posted all over the 
Internet. Both are widely available on the major on-line services and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's consider your WinWord template. To send it to your friend, you simply 
uuencode it. This creates a sort of text image of the file while leaving the 
original intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you paste this "text" into your e-mail message and send it off. When it 
arrives, your friend can uudecode it, which translates the "text" back into a 
binary file. It's really easy. Binary files are uuencoded all over the 'Net, 
which is how it is possible for Internet newsgroups, which can carry only text, 
to contain so many pornographic images. 
</P>
<P>
 Photos, after all, are binary files. Good Internet newsreading programs -- 
such as tin -- will ask if you'd like to uudecode any files you are saving. If 
you plan to do a lot of uuencoding, there's even a shareware telecommunications 
program called WinTel that has uuencode/uudecode built in, along with ".gif" 
and JPEG viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, viewers should be a part of every wanderer's tool kit. You need 
something for looking at .gif, JPEG and other formats. Good shareware products 
for this purpose abound, but for Windows you might want to consider a shareware 
product called Drag & View, which will view almost anything -- including, say, 
a WordPerfect file, even if you don't have WordPerfect. A similar commercial 
product is Eclipse Find, whose main role is indexing your hard drive for fast 
searches. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Windows user, I'd find cyberspace a pain without a good clipboard 
collector. (For non-Windows users, the clipboard is where Windows stores the 
last item that you've copied or cut.) They're everywhere as shareware, and I 
use a cheapie (because I am a cheapie) called Yet Another Clipboard Collector. 
For top-of-the-line clipboard control, try ClipMate, also shareware. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Basically these handy little devils give the clipboard the ability to hold 
more than one thing at a time. A good clipboard collector will store up 
everything you cut or copy and let you to go back and choose which one you want 
to paste. ClipMate even lets you combine several clips into one large one. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, if you see http://www.onramp.net/shopping in (a pretty cool World Wide 
Web shopping site, by the way) and then see the gopher address 
una.hh.lib.umich.edu, you can just copy them to the clipboard one after the 
other and keep going. And by copying and pasting, rather than writing them down 
and typing them in again, you eliminate the chance of errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if you do a lot of e-mailing, you might want to consider an off-line 
reader. If you use a BBS for your e-mail, you'll want one with ".qwk" support. 
This enables you to quickly retrieve all new mail and forum postings, log off, 
and respond off-line, where you can read everything at your leisure.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Mailing Sights, Sounds in Windows 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the task of e-mailing pictures, sounds, word-processor files and other 
binaries, try a clever little Windows utility called WinCode. Besides handling 
uuencoding and uudecoding with aplomb, the program will zip or unzip the file 
as well, without forcing you to do any work at the DOS command line. It 
supports drag and drop, too; just click a file from File Manager and drag it 
over to the minimized WinCode icon. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want, WinCode will even hook itself into another Windows application, 
creating a menu item in your telecommunications program, for example, so 
WinCode is always there for you. Uuencoding and uudecoding are built in, but 
you'll need to get pkware on your own. Most impressive of all, WinCode is free, 
but without the usual Help file. If you want that, it's $5, but the program 
comes with a good help text file, so it's not crucial. WinCode, from Snappy 
Inc., is available on CompuServe, America Online and elsewhere.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; MATERIALS THAT TAKE THE HEAT 
</P>

 Scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., have developed a 
process to make high-temperature components for jet engines, smokestack 
filters, heat- and impact-resistant armor for military vehicles, and many other 
products. The basic material involved is silicon carbide, a ceramic that has 
long been known for its excellent performance at high temperatures but has been 
impossible to form into a safe, reliable, affordable and non-brittle composite 
material for industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
 To make their composite, which is three times lighter than steel and can 
withstand temperatures that would melt most metals, the RPI researchers started 
with commercial silicon carbide fibers, which look something like black 
fiberglass cloth. The fibers are first placed in a vacuum chamber and 
impregnated with a liquid, pre-ceramic polymer known as 
hydriodopolycarbonsilane. They are then placed in a mold and heated in a 
two-step procedure that eventually reaches 1,000 degrees centigrade. The 
process is repeated until the composite becomes a solid, armor-hard silicon 
carbide component. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturing process is environmentally friendly and less costly when 
compared to other technologies. Starfire Systems Inc., a company founded by two 
Rensselaer Ph.D.s and which is housed in the university's incubator facility, 
already has contracts to produce composite smokestack filters that remove solid 
materials from corrosive and extremely hot exhaust streams.

 Reach Out and Touch: Most computer joysticks are heavy and unwieldy, making 
them ill-suited to the fine pushing and feeling needed for detailed work such 
as telesurgery. In telesurgery, a surgeon in a city hospital could guide 
scalpels and other surgical instruments to rate on a patient in a high-tech 
ambulance in a war zone or in a small town that has no surgeon. No one has 
actually undergone a long-distance operation, and no one is likely to for some 
years. But the technology is already under development. One device that 
telesurgeons might use has already been commercialized. It is known as PHANToM 
and was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. PHANToM 
consists of a small mechanical arm, an amplifier interface to run the arm, a 
personal computer and the software that controls the whole package. It looks 
something like a desk lamp with an arm where the bulb normally goes. When a 
user inserts afingertip into a thimble on the mechanical arm, PHANToM tracks 
the motion. Computer software exerts an external force on the finger, creating 
the illusion of interacting with physical objects that appear on the computer 
screen. Users can replace the thimble with different tools, such as a scalpel 
or screwdriver. They will feel as if they are using the actual tool. PHANToM 
can convey the sensations of softness, hardness, friction and other mechanical 
attributes of an object. Thomas Massie, an MIT graduate student and co-inventor 
of the device, has started a company called SensAble Devices in Vanceburg, Ky., 
to market PHANToM under license from MIT. So far, his orders have come 
primarily from researchers who will write their own software to develop 
commercial applications for the tool.

 Cool Cleaning: While sandblasting and water-blasting have been around for a 
long time, recent legislation on hazardous waste disposal has caused the 
industry to look for methods that reduce the residual waste created by 
conventional abrasive blasting operations. In a typical operation, up to 85% to 
90% of the waste is actually the abrasive itself. Finding an abrasive material 
that would vaporize or melt would go a long way to solving the waste disposal 
problem. Supersonic Abrasive Ice-Blasting, which uses tiny ice particles at 
very high speeds to remove surface dirt, grease, grime and paint, may turn out 
to be the next environmentally friendly cleaning method. Ice as an abrasive has 
been tried before but previous systems required large refrigeration equipment, 
hoses and a delivery system for the ice pellets, making the systems bulky and 
expensive. Now researchers at Penn State Gas Dynamics Laboratory have come up 
with a simplified system that makes the ice in the blasting nozzle, eliminating 
the separate refrigeration machinery and delivery system. It is similar to a 
snow-making machine, but produces ice rather than artificial snow. The system 
uses tap water with the addition of a small quantity of an additive used in the 
snow-making business. The speed of the three- to four-thousandths of an inch 
ice particles can reach approximately 500 m.p.h. Airplane de-painting is a 
prime area for ice blasting. So too as a replacement for the chemicals used to 
degrease automobile parts.

 Space-Age Bulldozers: Combine the Global Positioning System (GPS) with some 
software developed at Ohio State University and you may have a way for 
construction companies to help save time and money when surveying and preparing 
building sites. At the first stages of a project, a GPS receiver is mounted on 
a vehicle and an operator drives the site to be leveled and graded. Signals 
from the GPS are gathered by the receiver and that information is used to draw 
up a map and construction plan for the site. Once the grading begins, the GPS 
monitors the progress of the bulldozers and other equipment and guides machine 
operators using a TV-like monitor in the vehicle's cab. The ultimate aim is to 
feed signals directly to the vehicle's hydraulic controls, automating the 
earth-cutting and filling much as an automated navigation system in an aircraft 
feeds course information into the aircraft's controls. But don't look for a 
space-age bulldozer at a vacant lot near you any time soon. A prototype of the 
system currently lists for around $100,000. Ohio State's Center for Mapping, 
which developed the software, is currently working with several GPS 
manufacturing companies to develop a less-expensive system with a narrower 
scope of operation. The Center for Mapping is one of 11 research and 
development groups in the United States funded by NASA to promote the 
commercialization of space.

BRIEFCASE: AUTOS; HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA POSTS PRICES FOR SUBCOMPACT THAT 
REPLACES THE EXCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by John O'Dell, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hyundai Motor America has posted the price list for its subcompact Accent, 
which replaces the aging Excel. 
</P>
<P>
 The new line comes in five variations: a three-door manual transmission 
hatchback; a pair of three-door coupes, one with automatic transmission and one 
with manual; and four-door sedans with automatic and manual transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Base prices will range from $8,079 for the hatchback to $9,709 for the 
automatic-equipped four-door. 
</P>
<P>
 The Excel hit the U.S. market in 1986 at about $5,000 but fell from grace when 
nearly three years of high demand boosted Hyundai's production of the cars well 
beyond its ability to ensure their quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Accent is expected to arrive at dealer showrooms in February, an unusual 
month for a car debut but one that Hyundai Motor America executives say is best 
for them and for their customers. An earlier unveiling was junked when the 
South Korean car company's U.S. marketing arm, based in Fountain Valley, 
demanded improvements to make Accent more salable in this country and decided 
to wait until the punched-up version was ready and tested. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing the Accent to its predecessor, AutoWeek magazine wrote last week 
that the "only honest response" to shoppers' questions about the Excel in 
recent years was that "a good used car was a viable -- even preferable -- 
alternative for those squeezed for cash. (But) early indications suggest that 
those days will be over when the Accent gets here." 
</P>
<P>
 The car "seems to be a solid, modern piece of work that fully belongs in 
today's car market," AutoWeek wrote.

HOME SALES IN CALIFORNIA UP FOR FIRST TIME SINCE '89; ECONOMY: THE AVERAGE 
PRICE FELL AGAIN, BUT SLOWER. PRICES IN ORANGE COUNTY ARE OFF 4%, PROJECTIONS 
SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California home sales will show an increase this year for the first time since 
1989, and though the average price will be down again, it fell at a slower 
pace, according to projections to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, total sales of new and existing homes will be up 10.9% from 
1993, while sales of new homes will show a gain of 16.5%, according to a survey 
by TRW Redi Property Data, a market research firm based in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a lender, appraiser or broker, obviously the turnover in the market 
affects your sector of the industry, so this is good news," said Nima Nattagh, 
a research analyst at the company that wrote the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a homeowner, you're primarily interested in price trends, so this 
isn't great," he said, "But it's not bad. It depends where you live." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, home prices will show a decline of 4%, less than in any 
other Southland county except San Diego. The decrease will be despite an 
estimated rise of 16.6% in the number of homes sold in Orange County this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which ranks the cost of homes in dollars per square foot, is based 
on samples of property values gathered from county assessors' and recorders' 
offices. Projections for the entire year were made according to data from the 
first 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nattagh said the report also will show that the state's home builders have 
focused on more affordable houses. Statewide, 57% of new homes sold for less 
than $175,000 this year, compared to 47% in 1991. 
</P>

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; SHOPPERS DECK THEIR 
HOMES WITH PCS; COMPUTERS: CONSUMER ELECTRONICS RETAILERS ENJOY RECORD 
BUSINESS. DESPITE INTEL'S HANDLING OF BUG, PENTIUM SALES ARE STRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Happily for personal computer makers and retailers, the Pentium bug did not 
end up being the Glitch That Stole Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas many retailers had trouble meeting sales goals, consumer electronics 
sales soared, largely on the strength of booming sales of PCs to the home 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 International Data Corp., a market research firm, projects that PC shipments 
in this year's fourth quarter will rise a robust 32%, to 5.8 million units, 
over those in last year's final period. Multimedia-hungry families latched onto 
machines in record numbers, straining supplies at consumer electronics, 
warehouse and office products stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the aggregate steam of the market is based in the consumer market or 
derived from the evolution of consumer technologies as they bubble up into the 
small business or corporate market," said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, research 
director at the firm, based in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 With few exceptions, PC makers rose to the occasion, offering powerful systems 
with built-in software at affordable prices -- generally from $1,600 to $3,000. 
IBM, which vastly underestimated the potential for its new Aptiva line of 
desktop PCs, had the unfortunate distinction of being left on the bench as 
manufacturers such as Apple Computer and Compaq scored big gains. Privately 
held Packard Bell, for one, said sales for all of 1994 will total $3 billion, 
more than double the 1993 level. 
</P>
<P>
 At the CompUSA store in City of Industry, "very few systems went out the door 
without multimedia," said Scott Patrick Costello, a sales associate. At Whole 
Earth Access in San Francisco, families with young children "were very excited" 
about Apple Computer's Performa line of CD-ROM systems, which are capable of 
playing sound and moving pictures, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good Guys consumer electronics chain, with 59 stores in California, 
Washington state and Nevada, sold "a wicked big amount" of personal computers, 
said spokesman Keith Foxe, who added: "Consumers were there to buy, and they 
wanted speed." 
</P>
<P>
 That appeared to account for the continuing popularity of machines based on 
Intel Corp.'s Pentium chip, despite the bashing the Santa Clara-based giant 
took for its handling of a defect in the advanced microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers at CompUSA's City of Industry store had "quite a few concerns" about 
the Pentium, Costello noted, but visiting Intel representatives were able to 
allay most of those. He added that "Pentium sales have been picking up." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Kern, vice president of product marketing for Packard Bell in Westlake 
Village, said one major national retailer, which he declined to name, reported 
that Pentium was its top seller in the consumer electronics category. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Zwetchkenbaum of IDC maintained that the Pentium debacle represented 
a watershed -- the passage of the PC into a consumer rather than a corporate 
product. Consumers, he noted, are bound to be more cautious about technology 
leaps from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of the lessons learned," he said, "the public information 
exchange (about computer products) will be forever changed."

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR IN COMPUTER WORLD; LOWER PERSONAL COMPUTER 
PRICES WERE JUST ONE OF 1994'S WELCOME DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>

 If you're still struggling to get your Christmas PC to work properly -- or if 
you're still waiting for your replacement Pentium chip to arrive in the mail -- 
you may not believe this, but 1994 was a very good year in the computer world. 
Prices continued to fall as home users, once shunned in favor of business 
buyers, started buying PCs by the millions. The 66-megahertz 486 central 
processing unit -- considered the high-end chip at the beginning of the year, 
is now the mainstream CPU. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Pentium, despite its well-publicized flaw, became a 
serious contender for both home and office use, with complete systems selling 
for as little as $1,500 by year-end. 486 systems could be found for as little 
as $800 -- about 20% cheaper than a year ago. Even notebook PCs, which once 
carried a hefty premium, have dropped into the $1,000 to $1,200 range. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 was a good year for Apple as well: the company hit a home run with its 
Power Macintosh line, which features the Power PC microprocessor co-developed 
by Apple, Motorola and IBM. The Power Macs, as promised, can run virtually all 
previous Macintosh software but they really shine when running programs 
designed for the machine's CPU. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs written specifically for the Power Mac rolled out a little slower 
than Apple had hoped, but there are now plenty to choose from, including the 
leading programs such as Microsoft Word, Excel, WordPerfect and ClarisWorks. 
Apple's prices, while a bit higher than equivalent IBM compatibles, are no 
longer out of sight -- making them a viable option even for budget-minded 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel would have hit at least a triple with its Pentium systems had it not 
been for a foul ball: The CPU can make division errors under some 
circumstances, forcing Intel to offer replacements for millions of flawed 
chips. Even without a replacement chip, Pentiums are still fine for typical 
home applications including word processing, graphics, communications and home 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROM drives finally caught on in 1994, and they are now included in many new 
home systems. If you buy a CD-ROM drive, make sure it's at least double speed 
-- some newer CDs won't run on slower drives. If it's for a young child, be 
sure you get one that doesn't require you to insert the disc into a special 
caddy before slipping it into the machine. As my 8-year-old discovered, opening 
a caddy can be tricky for people with little hands. 
</P>
<P>
 I have CD-ROM drives on my Mac and two IBM compatible PCs, and I'm happy to 
report that the Mac was able to run every CD program I tested. I can't say the 
same for the PCs. A lot of the many Windows and MS-DOS discs I tested this year 
didn't run correctly -- at least not right out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've learned a couple of lessons here: Never install CD programs while kids 
are watching because they're too often disappointed when the program doesn't 
run correctly. And when you buy CD-ROMs, be sure the dealer agrees to take them 
back if they don't work. Don't accept a "replacement disc" guarantee. If a CD 
doesn't work, chances are that an identical replacement will have the same 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope that 1995 will be the year that the software industry begins to 
clean up its act in this regard. Imagine if we had these problems with VCRs, 
cameras and other devices. Computer companies are only beginning to understand 
the demands of real consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 was a great year for children's software. My children, Katherine, 10, and 
William, 8, like "Real World Math: Adventures in Flight" (Windows and Mac) from 
Sanctuary Woods, which teaches children about aviation while enhancing their 
math skills. They're also very fond of Davidson's Flying Colors (Windows and 
Mac), a great painting program that lets them add a spectacular shimmering 
effect to their creations. Their favorite new program is Claris' Amazing 
Animation (Mac), which lets them create their own animated mini-features by 
clicking on a stamp and using the mouse to move it about the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some programs introduced in 1994 have been a flop with my family. Microsoft's 
Creative Writer, ostensibly a writing tool for children, is full of wacky 
sounds and zany cartoon characters. But it doesn't follow the Windows user 
interface standards, comes with very little documentation, and is hard to use 
for its intended purpose. Katherine tried to use the program for a school 
writing project but quickly became confused by all the strange icons. I finally 
had to pull her away from the computer because the program was affecting her 
self-esteem. William, who's exceptionally good with software, couldn't figure 
it out either. For that matter, neither could I. Both of my kids find it easier 
to do their writing with Microsoft Word, WordPerfect or Microsoft Works. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 was a huge year for the on-line world. America Online says it tripled its 
membership to 1.25 million users, and CompuServe says it grew from 1.5 million 
to 2.5 million. Prodigy experienced modest growth during the year. (Unlike TV, 
newspapers and magazines, there are no audit bureaus to verify the accuracy of 
company subscriber claims.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet also grew like Topsy, though hard numbers here are equally hard 
to find. 
</P>
<P>
 And Microsoft, which has long been criticized for allegedly trying to 
monopolize key segments of the computer industry, announced its own on-line 
service, the Microsoft Network. It should get a big -- and some say unfair -- 
jump start by being bundled with Windows 95, the new Microsoft operating 
system. And now Microsoft is going after my business. The New York Times 
syndicate is going to distribute a column by Bill Gates. Is no one safe?

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; A MOST HORRIFYING BOOK 
ON COMPUTER CULTURE; CUISINE: HACKER COOKBOOK FEATURES RECIPES FOR TWINKIE 
CASSEROLE, SPAM SUSHI AND COLD POP TART SOUP. 
</P>

<P>
 The most horrifying book about computer culture that I've ever read landed on 
my desk last week. The title is "Gigabites: The Hacker Cookbook," by Jenz 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 It has nothing to do with viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other things that 
go bump in the eternal night of cyberspace. It's far more insidious. It's about 
food -- hacker food. It's about Twinkie Casserole, Chinese Leftover Lasagna, 
Liverwurst and Anchovy Tub, Fish Stick Stir-Fry, Hot Dog Stroganoff, Spam Sushi 
and Cold Pop Tart Soup. 
</P>
<P>
 If indeed you are what you eat, then this volume goes a long way toward 
explaining our suspicions that the software we use must have been written by 
aliens, or at least by humans who aren't wired according to code. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a self-described hacker who moonlights in pancake houses, offers a 
guided tour of the world of hacker cuisine, which is designed mainly to fuel 
the 18-hour bursts of programming that hackers enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food is often the only interruption that is tolerated in the hacker world," 
Johnson explains, and even then, hackers demand food that can be eaten at the 
keyboard, usually scooped from a bowl with chips or the end of an old slide 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson sums up hacker cuisine with three gastronomic principles: "Eat until 
you drop. Eat what you drop. Enjoy first -- ask questions later." 
</P>
<P>
 With so many wonderful prepared foods on the market, Johnson says, hackers see 
no reason to reinvent the wheel by making anything from scratch. So their 
recipes are heavy on Cheez Whiz, Velveeta, salsa, refried beans, Cheetos, Cool 
Whip, Spaghettios, mashed potatoes, sour cream and other calorie-packed goodies 
that can be mashed, squeezed, slammed, stirred and blended with solid 
ingredients such as beef jerky, pork rinds, Oreo cookies, french fries, 
liverwurst and sauerkraut -- and then seasoned with ketchup, soy sauce, 
Worcestershire and jalapeno chilies. 
</P>
<P>
 The right cooking utensils are critical: a spoon long enough to reach a bowl 
of Spam soup when you're at the keyboard but small enough to fit inside the 
mouth of a jar of bean dip, an industrial strength can opener, a bowl that's 
equally appropriate for cooking and serving, and a heavy-duty microwave oven. 
(It only needs one power setting: high.) 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson offers special tips for entertaining. "With hacker cuisine, serving 
technique doubles as a distraction. You do not want your guests to scrutinize 
the meal too closely. The food has suffered enough in the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 If you wonder how, consider this excerpt from his section on cooking 
techniques: "Remove your hands from the concoction and visually inspect it for 
any active life forms. Pull it apart, pushing aside any large pieces and 
examine the minutiae. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson includes special sections on the economics of hacker cuisine (your 
time is too valuable to spend cooking), cleaning techniques (the forearm 
squeegee) and finding the right Japanese samurai movie to watch during meals. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipes speak for themselves. This light dessert was my favorite: Twinkie 
Casserole 
</P>
<P>
 Ingredients: 2 dozen Twinkies. 1 large jar caramel topping. 1 bag miniature 
marshmallows. 1 large jar hot fudge sauce. 1 teaspoon cinnamon. 1 large bag 
Oreos. Dash of brown sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Line the bottom of a casserole dish or large plate with the Twinkies. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Pour the caramel topping evenly over the Twinkies and smooth with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Pour the miniature marshmallows over the caramel until it is completely 
hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Pour the hot fudge over the marshmallows. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Sprinkle the spices over the hot fudge. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Layer the Oreos on top of the casserole. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Serve immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Serves 2 or 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, "The Hacker Cookbook" ($11.95) is a great gift for your favorite 
hacker. If you can't find it at your bookstore, contact Ten Speed Press, P.O. 
Box 7123, Berkeley, CA 94707. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of presents, there's a new program from Maxis that will let you 
design personalized gifts such as T-shirts, coffee mugs, running suits, Teddy 
bears, baseball caps, pennants, neckties, tote bags and Windbreakers on your 
computer and have them delivered to your home or your favorite recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 This Windows package -- produced in conjunction with the Austin James design 
house and Artisting Greetings Inc. -- goes way beyond typical personalized gift 
catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gift Maker allows you to design all the artwork yourself with a simple drawing 
program that uses special templates for each gift. Once you've selected your 
gift, you can choose from a variety of backgrounds, borders and clip art 
drawings, or import artwork stored in most popular graphics formats. You can 
also use photographs, either by scanning the image yourself or including a 
photo with your order. 
</P>
<P>
 You can add whatever text you like in any font and color, using a variety of 
tricks to slant, rotate and apply other special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to use. If you've ever worked with Broderbund's Print Shop, Maxis' 
Print Artist or any other basic graphics program, you probably won't even need 
to hit the help key. The package includes dozens of sample designs, complete 
with cartoon-style help bubbles to walk you through the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've finished your design, you can save it on a disk and mail it to 
Artisting Greetings or send it electronically via modem. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices are close to those in personalized merchandise catalogues -- $11.95 
for a mug or baseball cap, $13.95 for a T-shirt, $17.95 for a large tote bag, 
$19.95 for a necktie, $23.95 for a sweat shirt and $68.95 for a light jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Gift Maker has applications that extend well beyond Christmas. It 
provides an easy way to create T-shirts for a softball team, business premiums, 
prizes and other items without the hassle and expense of using a design house 
and finding a manufacturer. For information, contact Maxis, 2 Theatre Square, 
Orinda, CA 94563.

</P>
<P>
 * Stay at the system so the technician can talk you through the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call after peak business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't get through: 
</P>
<P>
 * Contact the corporate or sales office and ask to be transferred to the 
technical-support line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fax your detailed question to the technical-support center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Message the manufacturer through one of several on-line services, like 
Prodigy or CompuServe. (Many companies also have on-line bulletin boards with 
answers to frequently asked technical questions.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Contact the store where you purchased the system. (Some chains like CompUSA 
have their own technical-support lines.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Call a PC user group and ask to speak to one of the experts. The Assn. of 
Personal Computer Users provides a list of local groups ((914) 876-6678).

 Anti-Subleasing Appeal: A bid by the former operator of an Orange County-based 
auto subleasing agency to have the state's 1988 anti-subleasing law overturned 
has been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Nov. 30 decision, the state Court of Appeal denied Thomas C. Carter's 
appeal of his 1993 conviction on seven counts of illegal subleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who now faces three years in state prison, had operated a business 
that arranged to find sublessees for people who could not keep up with the 
payments on their vehicles and couldn't sell them for as much as they owed. The 
sublessees typically were people who needed cars but couldn't qualify for a 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's business took an advance fee of $1,500 to $3,000 from the sublessees 
and promised to find them permanent financing within six months so they could 
buy the cars. In the seven cases in which Carter was charged with illegal 
subleasing, none of the sublessees ever got that financing or a refund of their 
money. In each case, the original loan prohibited subleasing without the bank's 
permission -- permission Carter's company never obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal, Carter, a Lake Forest resident, argued that the law didn't 
apply to his business because his company was just a middleman and didn't sign 
any of the paperwork or actually transfer any of the vehicles from one 
purchaser or lessee to another. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal court, however, said that Carter's argument "would frustrate the 
Legislature's intent (in passing the law) because it would absolve those who 
promote and assist parties . . . in unlawful or fraudulent activities that they 
could not do themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot, said Rande King, the Irvine-based investigator for the Department 
of Motor Vehicles who spent several years building cases against Carter and 
several other subleasing company operators, is that it remains a felony in 
California to charge a fee to arrange a sublease of an automobile if you were 
not a party to the original financing agreement and if the lender who still 
holds title to the vehicle has not approved the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 King found that Orange County was a hot spot for subleasing operations like 
Carter's in the late 1980s. In most cases, he said, the leasing agents never 
provided the financing they promised and simply pocketed the fees. That left 
the original buyer on the hook for a car someone else was driving, and it left 
the sublessees in possession of cars they could never own, even if they 
continued making the monthly payments.

CURRENCY TRADING TAKES OFF WHEN RUMORS START FLYING; MARKET: DEALERS RESPOND TO 
TALL TALES ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL HEALTH, ARMED INVASIONS AND A VARIETY OF 
HALF-TRUTHS. THOSE WHO IGNORE THE LATEST REPORTS DO SO AT THEIR PERIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY HOFFMAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Psssst. Tensions were building on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea had 
stymied U.S. efforts to get international inspectors into the North's nuclear 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on June 9, came word the State Department had advised American citizens 
to leave South Korea. Had the dreaded showdown arrived? Would war erupt? 
</P>
<P>
 In sleek trading rooms at big banks and brokerages in New York and London, 
legions of currency dealers leaped into action. They barked buy and sell orders 
into phones, exchanging dollars, Japanese yen and German marks. In a few hours, 
small fortunes were made and lost. The U.S. currency, considered a safe haven 
in times of turmoil, surged against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Washington denied that an advisory had been issued. The dollar went 
back down, to end the day unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for assumptions that traders at the big banks and brokerages that 
dominate the $1 trillion a day world currency market -- whose activities 
influence the price of everything from cars to caviar -- base their decisions 
on the sober stuff of government data, investment flows and trade balances. 
</P>
<P>
 They also respond to wild rumors about presidential health, armed invasions 
and a variety of more mundane half-truths. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories about the impending fall of a government tend to drive down a currency 
as investors worry about changes in policy that could affect their holdings; 
word of a likely interest-rate increase usually pushes a currency higher, since 
that makes many short-term investments more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 It might seem absurd that unconfirmed scuttlebutt could influence such a 
serious business. But advances in telecommunications and computer technology 
over the past decade have transformed currency trading into a split-second 
affair. The same technology has made the transmission of news and other 
information instantaneous and ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers who pause too long to ponder the veracity of a piece of news can 
quickly find themselves "stopped out" -- forced to sell or buy to avoid bigger 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The markets are very skittish, and they're very global. The impact of rumors 
is greater than ever," said economist and author Joel Kurtzman, a former editor 
of the Harvard Business Review. "Everyone has to act on imperfect information 
because the information travels so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezra Zask, president of Ezra Zask Associates Inc., a Norfolk, Conn.-based 
money-management firm, likens the process of rumor development to "a kids' game 
of telephone." 
</P>
<P>
 "Often you start out with a bit of truth and by the fifth person it's become a 
full-blown crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Zask, a fair number of rumors are deliberately planted in an effort to 
profit from the rise or decline of a currency. The most successful of these 
deal with an ongoing event or situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martians won't go," Zask said. "It has to be something in the air that people 
are already nervous about. When a crowd is nervous about something, sometimes 
it just needs a tweak to get it going." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Reagan era, rumors about the septuagenarian president's health 
routinely buffeted the dollar. Those haven't been heard during the tenure of 
the youthful Bill Clinton, but the market's been rife with fictitious tales 
about twists in the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korean nuclear bomb development and impending U.S. invasions of Haiti 
have been popular themes this year. The most effective tales concern matters 
that can't be proved or disproved immediately, giving the rumormonger time to 
collect a profit. Or they hit on Friday afternoon, when few players are in the 
market and just a few trades can make exchange rates jump. 
</P>
<P>
 While high-profile tales of intrigue can shake the market for hours, the rumor 
mill mainly generates workaday white lies about interest-rate and monetary 
policies or the buying and selling activities of central banks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day of the purported Korean standoff, former Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Roger Altman was said to be preparing to tell business executives 
that Washington wanted to establish a 105-to-115 yen range for the dollar. That 
gave the dollar -- then trading at about 104 yen -- a short-lived boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors sometimes provide an after-the-fact rationale for exchange rate 
movements that could simply be due to technical trading -- dealers buying or 
selling at certain levels to lock in gains or limit losses -- on a day when 
nothing else is happening. 
</P>
<P>
 On such occasions, Zask said, dealers might concoct stories about mysterious 
and powerful Middle Eastern sources whose trading activities make the dollar 
rise or fall. "It's . . . like primitive tribes inventing outside influences to 
explain things that affect their societies." 
</P>
<P>
 Where do the tall tales start? 
</P>
<P>
 "When we hear them, they're often attributed to traders on the floor of the 
(Chicago) Mercantile Exchange," said David De Rosa, a director at Swiss Bank 
Corp. "When they hear them, they're probably attributed to the interbank 
foreign exchange market." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Zask, "the people in the Chicago futures pits think of rumors as 
a tactical tool in money management. They think it's legitimate to start a 
rumor if it helps their position. There's less of that in the interbank market. 
But some banks . . . are known for being rumormongers." 
</P>
<P>
 But market watchers say it's becoming more difficult to play the rumor game, 
partly because so many rumors turn out to be duds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winning edge comes from being the first on the block with information. 
But the market is becoming a bit less willing to throw money behind information 
because we've seen traders get burned over the past few years," said Lisa 
Finstrom, senior currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, dealers who ignore potentially big market-moving news do so at their 
peril, as illustrated in a story told by Hubert Pedroli, who manages Credit 
Suisse's New York foreign exchange desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, I thought that was another stupid 
rumor. I said, 'Yeah, yeah' and hung up the phone. After 20 minutes I thought, 
'What if it was true?' So I called up the Middle East and found out it was 
true. The dollar was up four yen by then. I lost a pretty penny on that."

<P>
 The fast-food chain's new TV commercial features its famous smiling clown -- 
dressed in a business suit -- detonating the company boardroom to get revenge 
at executives for blowing him up in a famous 1980 spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial introduces a new campaign called "Jack's Back," in which the 
clown who once adorned the chain's drive-through speaker boxes shows off the 
restaurant's new bigger burgers and revamped outlets decked in vibrant colors 
and neon striping. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is designed to help the nation's fifth-largest fast-food chain 
recover from $140 million in losses since the deaths of four children who ate 
bacteria-contaminated burgers in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But corporate identity consultants say the new ad's violent message is all 
wrong at a time when the news is filled with explosions and death -- a suicide 
bomber in the Gaza Strip, a mail bomb in the suburbs of New Jersey, a fire 
bomber on New York's subway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible that you'd be running an ad campaign showing anything being 
blown up today," said Al Ries, a marketing consultant in Great Neck, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at parent company Foodmaker Inc. of San Diego and Venice-based 
Chiat-Day, the ad agency that created the spot, discussed the violent content 
and decided few people would take it seriously, said Brad Haley, a corporate 
marketing executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that it's done in a cartoonishly humorous fashion hopefully will 
make any connection with any real-world events a stretch to make," he said. 
Haley added that the ads will run in areas distant from recent bombing 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 1,200 Jack in the Box outlets are in the western and southwestern 
parts of the country, while recent U.S. bombings have occurred in the East, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand they have to catch the attention of male teen-agers, who are 
going to say, 'Yeah, cool, man' and maybe not take it seriously," said Mary 
Fox, vice president of research for the San Francisco-based corporate image 
consultant Addison Seefeld & Brew. "But I just think it's inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The TV spot is the first of at least four. It will be introduced this week in 
Phoenix, Sacramento and St. Louis, then expanded early next year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts off with a replay of the 1980 ad, in which the famous clown was 
blown up to symbolize the company's movement away from meals catering just to 
kids and toward more adult fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes Jack's return as the company "founder" walking down a street, 
sporting a natty suit, wingtips and the familiar white clown's head with big 
blue eyes, a gigantic smile and tiny yellow cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, thanks to the miracle of plastic surgery, I'm back, ready to make Jack 
in the Box better than ever," he explains, riding up the elevator at company 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 He walks up to a door marked "Boardroom," which bears a sign saying, "In use," 
pulls out a triggering device and -- still smiling -- pushes the button, 
setting off an explosion that blows off the door and sends papers flying. 
</P>
<P>
 In later ads, Jack is seen in-line skating and cruising in his convertible 
while describing the chain's latest fare, as the camera flashes on close-ups of 
burgers, fries and soft drinks.

$1 BILLION IN GROSSES? IT TAKES GUMPTION; MOVIES: BEING FIRED FROM 'COCOON' 
SENT HIS CAREER INTO A SPIN, BUT ROBERT ZEMECKIS DIDN'T QUIT. HE REBOUNDED WITH 
'ROMANCING THE STONE' AND A STRING OF OTHER HITS, INCLUDING A TALE OF A MAN 
NAMED 'FORREST.' 
</P>

<P>
 In modern times and in modern dollars, the most successful director of them 
all is, of course, Steven Spielberg. From "Jaws" to "Jurassic Park," his films 
have grossed well in excess of $4.5 billion at the box office here and abroad, 
and in many cases are still doing business. Even "Schindler's List," never 
expected to be a big moneymaker, did about $96 million in this country and $220 
million abroad to date. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rarefied category of billion-dollar directors, it is a matter of some 
curiosity as to who places second. At the moment, it would appear to be 
42-year-old Robert Zemeckis, whose "Forrest Gump" is about to pass $300 million 
at the domestic box office alone. His films, including "Romancing the Stone," 
all three installments of "Back to the Future," "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and 
"Death Becomes Her," have done upward of $1.5 billion thus far, and "Gump" has 
miles to go before it sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Running a close race with Zemeckis is Ivan Reitman of "Ghostbusters" fame. 
Daily Variety has estimated the business that his films have done at $1.3 
billion (it has not yet compiled an estimate on Zemeckis). But Reitman's 
"Junior" looks to be off to a soft start while "Gump," likely to have a new 
thrust from Academy Award nominations and other honors, is already a major hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Zemeckis, from his new home in Montecito, recently said his career 
looked to be over before it had really begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd made two films before I shot 'Romancing the Stone.' I made 'I Wanna Hold 
Your Hand' and 'Used Cars,' and they were both box-office flops. I'd spent a 
year developing 'Cocoon.' Then I got fired because of 'Romancing the Stone.' 
When I showed Fox the finished 'Stone,' they thought it was a disaster. Not the 
Zanucks, but the studio. They were all very nervous in those days, and 'Cocoon' 
was budgeted at $15 million. They said, 'We can't give this guy another movie 
to make!' So they fired me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Romancing the Stone" turned out to be a very large success. Had it not been, 
Zemeckis says, its failure, plus the fact that he had already been fired from 
"Cocoon," would have meant his career was indeed over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's this tradition in the industry that some filmmakers are lucky, and some 
are unlucky. It's what they told Michael Douglas when he wanted me to direct 
'Stone': 'But his films don't make money.' To his everlasting credit, Michael 
said, 'Yeah, but look at the style of "Used Cars." That's what I want.' It's 
the idea that the director can control the box office, which nobody can." 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, Zemeckis went from "Romancing the Stone" to his string of 
successes. By another irony, Zemeckis may have been sought for "Forrest Gump" 
because of his skill at merging live action and animation in "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit." At one stage of the script, "Forrest Gump" was to include a lot of 
animation. It was later thrown out, though several scenes of special effects, 
which blend historical footage with newly shot film, remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy using special effects," he says. "Part of the spectacle of film is 
illusion, and illusion is more and more part of the spectacle. But you can't 
let it get in the way of the story. When you think about it, the close-up is 
about as strong an image as you can have." 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary sequences in which Tom Hanks as Gump is seen in newsreels 
with JFK and other historic figures have aroused wide comment, suggesting that 
seeing is no longer being able to believe. The implications fascinate Zemeckis, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a political candidate had enough money and wanted to put himself in 
newsreels with heads of state he's never met, he could do it," Zemeckis said. 
"It would be dangerous because he could be exposed, but it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The larger question, being explored by the Artists Rights Foundation, which 
Zemeckis supports, is that of who owns and controls a movie's images. "Say in 
20 years a guy who wants to sell canned ham asks to use a piece of Tom's 
performance in 'Gump' in a commercial. Does Tom have a say in that? The 
director, the writer, the staff, the people who had a hand in the look, the 
haircut, the wardrobe, the performance? Do I have a say?" 
</P>
<P>
 Zemeckis thinks it conceivable that stage acting that led to film acting may 
evolve again into what he calls digital acting. In the same way a soprano can 
dub a better high C onto her recording of an aria, an actor could stockpile 
some of his better line deliveries into a kind of computer-banking system. 
</P>
<P>
 "An actor will be able to say, 'Gee, I wish I hadn't done that little thing 
with my mouth; I'd like to be able to do what I did in my last movie,' and I 
think you'll be able to go back to his computer bank and change it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Forrest Gump" was delayed in the making, not only because of script problems 
but also because of its presumed similarity to "Rain Man." It never stopped 
seeming risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give Sherry Lansing credit, because for what we were going to 
have to spend on 'Gump,' it made no sense," Zemeckis said. "How would you 
promote it? There were no exploitative elements you could put in a flashy 
trailer. There was no tie-in to McDonald's. We had Tom Hanks -- but that was 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie has been variously interpreted as a metaphor for America at 
mid-century, or an America in need of lobotomizing. But Zemeckis says, "My 
reaction when I first read the script was very emotional and had nothing to do 
with all the intellectual stuff, although it was obviously there. It was risky, 
because Gump could become grotesque, or you could slip over into the saccharine 
and the maudlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never really certain until we began to screen the film whether the 
portrayal of Gump, and his strange accent, was going to work for audiences. To 
Tom's enormous credit, he pulled it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Zemeckis met Bob Gale, his frequent script collaborator, at USC film school; 
they wrote the ill-fated "1941" for Spielberg. Now, off his successes, Zemeckis 
has clout, and he finds it a boon but also a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows you to take time off, and that's important, because you live in 
such a rarefied atmosphere when you're directing a movie. You're not in the 
real world. All you have to do is direct, and everybody around you all day is 
telling you how great you are. My wife kids me about that all the time," 
Zemeckis says. 
</P>
<P>
 The burden of clout is to choose the right projects. "I've read some good 
scripts since 'Gump' came out, but I'm still frazzled. If you find a script 
with a flaw in it, you think, 'The last thing I'm ready to do is roll up my 
sleeves and get in a room with a writer and start shaking this screenplay out.' 
You need a break."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: ONLY 'WAY' TO GO FOR SOME SEASONAL GOOD TIDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 What did you do Christmas Eve? I spent much of it with Bing and Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 You can have "Miracle on 34th Street," "Holiday Inn," "It's a Wonderful Life," 
"A Christmas Carol" (all versions) and every other Christmas goose that comes 
to mind. Remember, you heard it here. When it comes to antique movies on TV, 
Christmas Eve can't get any better than writer-director Leo McCarey's "Going My 
Way." 
</P>
<P>
 It's masterful, artistic, Oscar-winning corn, two hours and 15 minutes of 
shining sentimentality perfect for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Affirmation came Saturday night with the appearance of "Going My Way" on that 
trove of elderly cinema, cable's American Movie Classics. It had been so many 
years since I'd seen it, I'd forgotten its charms. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the others don't also have something to recommend them. The original, 
now-twice-remade "Miracle on 34th Street" has unforgettable Edmund Gwenn as 
Kris Kringle. Fred Astaire's elegant footwork and Bing Crosby's singing of 
"White Christmas" are almost enough to prop up snowbound "Holiday Inn." Even 
though various incarnations of "It's a Wonderful Life" celebrate what, to me, 
is a tragically wasted life, the story's enduring popularity attests to its 
strength. And "A Christmas Carol," especially the 1951 British movie version 
with Alastair Simm and TV's 1984 version with George C. Scott, is indispensable 
on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what I thought until my reunion with "Going My Way." 
</P>
<P>
 It was released in 1944, and, like all movies, should be assessed in the 
context of its times. It stereotypes the aged as doddering, Catholic priests as 
tender-hearted, atheists as heartless. It inaccurately depicts an urban society 
that racially is nearly monolithic. And the World War II era in which it was 
made gets only an insufficient footnote. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, though, "Going My Way" is a movie that wears its enormous 
heart and humanity like a medallion, with Crosby (in his finest dramatic work 
outside of "The Country Girl") as kindly, progressive Father O'Malley and wee 
Barry Fitzgerald (with his trademark Irish brogue) at his most huggable as 
kindly, old-fashioned Father Fitzgibbon. Crosby, Fitzgerald and McCarey won 
Academy Awards for "Going My Way," which was named best picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going My Way" is soft-sell Yule, the only hints of Christmastime coming when 
Crosby croons "Silent Night" and when he later joins Met star Rise Stevens in a 
stirring rendition of "Ave Maria" -- both being moments that can move even 
non-Christians to tears. Yet even without overtly referring to Christmas, its 
sermon of goodness and giving epitomizes the best of this holiday -- preaching 
redemption of the wayward, love of mom, and generosity toward the 
underprivileged and elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley, for example, is too kind to tell the much-older Fitzgibbon (although 
only 56, Fitzgerald was persuasively playing a man of at least 70) that he's 
been sent to replace him as head of troubled St. Dominick's, a parish in deep 
financial arrears largely because of Fitzgibbon's own unrestrained benevolence. 
And when he finds out the truth, Fitzgibbon is too kind to become an impediment 
to the new man, even though disappointed at being supplanted by someone whose 
modern ways he questions. In fact, every major character in this movie is 
innately kind, except for the church's wealthy landlord played by Gene 
Lockhart, and even he's merely a benign fuddy-duddy who turns out to be 
educable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going My Way" is a tightly enclosed universe in which a juvenile street gang 
can be turned around by a few stanzas from a crooning priest, such as Father 
O'Malley's miraculous transformation of some local hoods into a sweet-singing 
boys choir. "They're angels," says Stevens. Botticelli angels. And their 
singing of "An Irish Lullaby," as Father Fitzgibbon rejoins his 90-year-old 
mother in a lovely scene without dialogue, puts a jackhammer to your tear 
ducts. Somehow, McCarey makes this goo not merely palatable, but deliciously 
rewarding and deeply felt to your toes, as he mostly did with his 1945 sequel, 
"The Bells of St. Mary's," which returned Crosby as O'Malley and added Ingrid 
Bergman as a Sister Superior. 
</P>
<P>
 Simplistic, yes. But what's significant is that you can hold on to the ideal 
of "Going My Way" without embracing every detail. At one point, Fitzgibbon 
pours himself and O'Malley some Irish whiskey to mark their new friendship, a 
shot of booze matched by a big belt of old-fashioned values. "Good stuff," the 
old priest says. Very good stuff. 
</P>

 A Fifth of Fantasy: It's wise not to get too worked up about anything as 
subjective as awards. Yet the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. affirmed what 
planet it's been living on by excluding some of TV's best programs and 
performers from last week's nominations for its annual Golden Globe awards. 
</P>
<P>
 That planet is Pluto. 
</P>
<P>
 Omit HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" -- consistently the funniest, smartest, 
most inventive comedy program anywhere -- from the musical or comedy series 
nominees? That is a laugh. Someone must have watched "The Larry Sanders Show" 
because its star, Garry Shandling, was nominated for best comedy actor. 
Snubbed, though, were his superb supporting actors, Rip Torn and Jeffrey 
Tambor. 
</P>
<P>
 As were the outstanding British mystery miniseries "Prime Suspect 3" and its 
scintillating star Helen Mirren, even though their presence on PBS for a third 
season was arguably the drama highlight of 1994 on U.S. television. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda Richardson did get a gift nomination for her ho-hum supporting work in 
HBO's "Fatherland." Yet, otherwise, the British appear just too foreign for the 
Foreign Press Assn.

CELLULOID GUIDES KEEP GAINING HEFT; MOVIES: HALLIWELL STARTED IT. NOW THERE ARE 
A HOST OF FILM BOOKS OFFERING WIDE-RANGING INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MALCOLM JOHNSON, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all began in 1965 with Leslie Halliwell's "The Filmgoer's Companion," which 
boasted a foreword by none other than Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
 The first "Companion" packed plenty into the 469 pages of the first American 
edition, a maroon hardcover with discreet gold lettering on the spine. 
Biography/filmographies of stars, directors and notable producers along with 
minireviews of classics made this creation by a British film encyclopedist a 
handy, compact reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years later, Halliwell, who died in 1989, has created an industry. 
The boom in cable movies and video stores has sparked an interest in old 
movies, film history and movie trivia. Halliwell's first slender encyclopedia 
and its successors now have many rivals, all fighting for the space on 
movie-library shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Halliwell's credits total 13 books. His work and name continue, with John 
Walker as the editor, in two frequently updated editions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Halliwell's Film Guide," whose thick 1994 edition (HarperPerennial, $21) ran 
to 1,347 pages, is an annual compendium of movie descriptions, brief quotes 
from contemporary reviews, quotes from dialogue and obscure facts. Though hard 
to handle, it is fun to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "Halliwell's Filmgoer's and Video Viewer's Companion" (HarperPerennial, $25) 
is a biographical encyclopedia containing complete filmographies for major 
figures, with pertinent quotes from films. It also includes useful and 
sometimes amusing category lists. The one on "horses," for example, begins: 
"Horses have in several cases risen to the rank of star." Mini-histories of 
studios and of Hollywood itself are also included in the 819 pages (addenda 
bring the total of the 10th edition to 834 pages). 
</P>
<P>
 Film references fall primarily into two categories, defined by the two 
Halliwell opuses: those offering brief reviews of every movie that ever 
achieved wide visibility, either in theaters or on television, and the 
biographical encyclopedia. Some references offer both movie descriptions and 
filmographies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephraim Katz's monumental "The Film Encyclopedia" (HarperPerennial, $25) is 
the major biographical source. Now in an "All-New Edition," the 1994 
encyclopedia supersedes the original, first published in 1979. (Katz died in 
August, 1992, before publication of the new edition. Melinda Corey and George 
Ochoa completed his work.) 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing in at 1,496 pages, the new encyclopedia brings the world of movies 
up-to-date. It even carries a brief entry for Halliwell himself, describing his 
books as "two of the most wide-ranging and idiosyncratic reference works on 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, the Katz book ranks as the most authoritative American film 
encyclopedia. It includes technical definitions ("Diffuser -- translucent 
material attached to a lighting unit for the purpose of softening the light 
falling on a subject"). However, there are no short entries on individual 
films, not even "Birth of a Nation" or "Gone With the Wind." Though never as 
droll or crisp as Halliwell and his successors, the Katz book stands as 
probably the most definitive for film scholars, with terse, informative 
biographies with complete film listings if warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Any of the film historians and critics who have followed in their footsteps 
must acknowledge their debt to Halliwell, the Englishman who started it all, 
and to Katz, the Israeli-born American who brought the film encyclopedia home 
to this country. But respect for the founding fathers has not prevented film 
experts from launching their own reference series. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most useful has been overseen by longtime film writer James Monaco. 
His "The Movie Guide" (Perigee Books, $24.95) offers a well-thought-out 
selection of knowledgeable movie reviews, with pertinent bits of history and 
lore. Its biggest advantage over other collections of minireviews is its 
inclusion of credits -- directors of photography, writers, etc., and names of 
characters as well as stars. But the 1,099-page guide makes no attempt to 
describe every movie out there in videoland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Encyclopedia of Film" (Perigee Books, $18.95) boasts lively and 
analytical descriptions, but this 596-page volume, published in 1991, suffers 
from some omissions. Goldie Hawn, for example, a major star by any measure, is 
among the missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest American film authority to enter the encyclopedia sweepstakes is 
television personality and critic Leonard Maltin. 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin's annual "Movie and Video Guide" (Signet Reference, $7.99) is 
celebrating its 25th anniversary with the 1995 edition. Not content with 
publishing the "No. 1 bestseller" as the jacket proclaims, Maltin has launched 
a new reference volume: "Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia" (Dutton, $34.95), 
a 976-page tome, is brand-new. Only time will determine its usefulness compared 
to Katz, Halliwell and Monaco. Separating Maltin's encyclopedia from the others 
is its failure to list separate filmographies -- though some are contained in 
his annuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best-known critics to produce an annual is Roger Ebert, whose 1995 
edition is waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger Ebert's Video Companion/1994 Edition" (Andrews and McNell, $14.95), 893 
pages, proclaims on the cover: "Full-Length Reviews of Movies" and "All-New 
Essays and Interviews." Ebert's reviews are tightly written, complete and match 
up stars with the names of their characters. Though his star ratings are 
somewhat unreliable (he tends to go overboard), this is the place to search out 
a key fact about a recent movie. The index is also a bonus. Ebert must be 
counted as the successor to Pauline Kael, whose 945-page "5001 Nights at the 
Movies" (Henry Holt, $22.50) represented the hugely influential New Yorker 
critic's swan song in the world of movie references.

Q & A WITH AL FRANKEN; HE'S DOING THE 12-STEP COMEDY RAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY SPILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stuart Smalley may not be a licensed therapist, but he is a member of no fewer 
than five 12-step programs. In February (apparently undaunted by the poor 
showing of fellow "Saturday Night Live" character Pat in his/her first feature 
film), the show's font of recurring self-affirmative wisdom ("I'm good enough, 
I'm smart enough and doggone it, people like me!") gains even higher power, 
starring in Paramount's feature film "Stuart Smalley," directed by Harold Ramis 
in his first outing since "Groundhog Day."  
</P>
<P>
 The quivering host of his own self-help cable show, Smalley is played by 
creator Al Franken, the Harvard wise-acre who tagged the '80s "The Al Franken 
Decade" and whose screen credits include co-writing "When a Man Loves a Woman." 
Franken, 42, put aside his caring, nurturing pose during the film's shooting to 
meet with Calendar . . . after gifting the crew with esteem-building hand 
mirrors.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How did Stuart come to be?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I go to Al-Anon, a 12-step program for family members and friends of 
alcoholics. One valuable thing I learned in Al-Anon is that you can learn stuff 
from people who aren't necessarily smarter than you. Which is kind of an 
obvious thing, but I didn't understand that. I'd be in an Al-Anon meeting and 
I'd hear somebody say something and I'd be very judgmental and say, "Oh, that 
person's an idiot," and a month later that same person would say something that 
would touch me very deeply. 
</P>
<P>
 I was brought up to do well in school, and you learn from people who know more 
than you, and that's about it. So Stuart is kind of a character that people can 
learn stuff from, even though he's an idiot. For every hundred steps forward, 
he takes 99 backward, but he does end up one step ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you concerned that Stuart Smalley might offend other 12-step 
believers?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I was never really worried about that because I knew what my intention was. 
Now the biggest fans of Stuart are people who know all about this stuff. So, 
he's kind of a . . . I don't want to say a cult figure, but I get letters from 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did Al-Anon change you as a writer?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The kind of comedy we do on "Saturday Night Live" is kind of antithetical 
to any kind of feeling. The smart ass, "Saturday Night Live," Lettermanesque 
comedy -- that's what I valued as a person, that cynicism. Al-Anon opened me up 
to another side as a person, which changes you as a writer. So I wanted to 
explore that side. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the movie, Stuart tries to save his dysfunctional family. Did you grow 
up in a dysfunctional family? Or around them?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you know, I don't discuss my own family life. My dad was not an 
alcoholic. He died (last) December; I miss him every day, I loved my dad very, 
very much. So, in no way is this my family, at all. A lot of what I came up 
with is through experience with other friends and in Al-Anon, hearing the 
stories that are sometimes hilarious, sometimes very moving. So, it's not about 
my family. Harold (Ramis) told me Rodney Dangerfield said everyone is normal 
until you know them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you graduated from Harvard, you started doing stand-up comedy and 
writing with your high-school buddy Tom Davis. You were among the first writers 
hired for "Saturday Night Live." What was that like?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It was very exciting. The first day I got there and started meeting 
everybody else, I knew this was going to be a hit because (we thought) we 
should all be on TV. Although I didn't understand what was going on. The power 
of it, what was happening to everybody. People would get intoxicated with 
power, success, some crazy things started happening.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did drug abuse have to do with the pressures of the show's success?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I really don't know. I think John Belushi was a drug addict and he died. If 
he hadn't been a big success, would that have happened? I don't know. Maybe. 
Just as many people who aren't very successful have problems with drugs and 
alcohol.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I did my share of recreational drugs. I was lucky in that I never became 
addicted to anything. There'd be cocaine around the show and if it was 
(mid-week) at 3 in the morning and I wanted to finish something I was writing 
I'd do some. But for some reason, toss of the dice, I was not addicted, at 
least not to drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What have you been addicted to?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, in 12-step jargon, I've sort of been addicted to co-dependent 
attitudes. Deriving my self-worth from things outside of myself. Addicted to 
other people's feelings. I used to be the person who needed to control things, 
otherwise I didn't feel safe. That sort of classic co-dependent behavior. It 
was harder to define than (if) I was addicted to alcohol or cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've witnessed your share of dysfunction on "Saturday Night Live." Has 
that changed over the years?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It can be a pretty brutal place to be. Because everyone wants to be on, 
wants to be the star of the show and every cast member who comes in wants to 
score, and every writer thinks their stuff is the best. So there's a lot of 
competition for not much time, there's a lot of people who are very good who 
get overworked. And they resent it. There's just a lot of jealousies and 
gossip. It's that kind of place, not unlike probably most offices. It's always 
been that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will you be on next season?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know. My contract is over. They want me to return. But I'm talking 
about what capacity I'm going to do. I love the show, it's a great thing to be 
involved with, I love New York, so I'm just not quite sure.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is Al Franken a perfectionist?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes and no. What's funny is you'll sit in Al-Anon meetings and a person 
will go, "I'm a perfectionist." And you look at this person and you'll go, 
"Hard-lee!" So it might surprise some people to hear that I am. Because I think 
that I am, but not to a really horrible, obsessive degree. To make things work 
in comedy, it helps both to understand how much work it takes and also to know 
when to let go.

THE LANE-SCAPE CHANGES DAILY ALONG THE FREEWAYS WE FREQUENT. FOR DRIVERS, THE 
SANTA ANA FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT CAN BE DISORIENTING; FOR MERCHANTS, IT'S 
COSTLY. BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO SURVIVE THE DRIVE UNTIL THIS, TOO, PASSES.; A 
SHOULDER TO CRY ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There you are, humming along nicely on the Santa Ana Freeway northbound from 
Irvine, and suddenly there it is: a Tinkertoy combination of ramps, flyovers, 
high-occupancy vehicle lanes, connectors -- all of them jutting out of the 
landscape in various stages of construction. And nearby, in the center of the 
freeway and littering the sides, huge piles of old concrete, immense mounds of 
earth, all of it being shoved around by heavy equipment. And signs, confusing 
and otherwise, everywhere. Worse, all of this activity holds out the promise of 
smooth, rapid, stress-free driving at almost any hour of the day, but right now 
you can't use any of it. It seems as if every inch of the Santa Ana Freeway, 
from northern Tustin to the dreaded "Orange Crush" -- the interchange of the 
Garden Grove, Orange and Santa Ana freeways -- is under construction, and has 
been since time began. 
</P>
<P>
 Makes you a little crazy? You're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 For drivers who regularly navigate the section of freeway that planners refer 
to as "Orange County's Main Street," the experience can be a bit like the 
common and disorienting dream in which you're walking down your street and 
suddenly become aware that everything has changed, that no sight is familiar 
and that, in your own house, someone has rearranged all the furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Only this time it's on a really grandiose scale. Entire connectors have 
disappeared and reappeared elsewhere. On- and off-ramps that you could use last 
week may have vanished just in time for your Monday morning commute. Old 
landmarks have been bulldozed, new and strange ones constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 If you live or work in Santa Ana, or pass through regularly, just getting in 
and out of town can feel like looking for the Northwest Passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters is concern that Orange County's bankruptcy may keep the 
whole confusing scenario in place indefinitely. But before you start gripping 
your head with both hands and yelling, here's some comfort: Spokespersons for 
both the Orange County Transit Authority and Caltrans, the agencies overseeing 
the Santa Ana reconstruction project, say the county's recent bankruptcy filing 
won't affect the schedule of the project. The central segment of the task, 
which includes the Santa Ana stretch, should be completed on schedule in 
mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Freeway reconstruction is "the single largest public works 
project in Orange County history," said Tom Bogard, OCTA's manager of project 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 When its three phases -- totaling 37 miles from San Juan Capistrano to the Los 
Angeles County line -- are completed by mid-2000, the 240,000-vehicle-per-day 
capacity of the freeway will have doubled, and the peak hour speeds will have 
risen from between 15 and 20 m.p.h. to a wind-in-the-hair 55, Bogard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire project is budgeted at $1.9 billion, and the highly visible 14-mile 
central phase, from the El Toro "Y" to the Orange Crush, will cost $653 
million, Bogard said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like kids in the back seat on a cross-country trip, what many commuters 
want to know is simply, "Are we there yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 "In Orange County, people think of freeways as their personal streets," Bogard 
said. "They know them often better than the streets around their houses. As the 
changes go on, there's so much personal interest." 
</P>
<P>
 And, to varying degrees, personal angst. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's generally the case that things that decrease predictability and personal 
control add to stress," said Ray Novaco, a professor of social ecology at UC 
Irvine and a specialist in the study of commuter stress. "The discomfort people 
might feel (driving on the freeway through Santa Ana) is sort of a low-grade 
aspect of the survival response. It gets aroused by new stimuli and can be felt 
as a potential threat to the individual. But . . . recognize that these bits of 
stimulation are safe and that they don't threaten you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They can, however, put a kink in one's business, especially if that business 
is in what might be called the project's ground zero, the neighborhood 
surrounding the intersection of Main and 17th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of freeway construction, the Main Street bridge that used to span 
the Santa Ana Freeway just south of the MainPlace/Santa Ana mall is closed, 
turning one of the county's busiest through streets into a dead end. And 
heavily trafficked 17th Street, busy at most hours of the day, comes to a 
ferocious bottleneck at the freeway overpass during peak hours, when traffic is 
severely pinched by construction beneath and around the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Farinacci lives only a few blocks from the restaurant he owns in the 
shadow of the 17th Street overpass, Ruby Tuesday's Bar and Grill. He has few 
commuting worries, but others who do have been staying away from his business, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction, he said, "has really wiped out my day business; that's when 
(the traffic is) the worst. And it's somewhat affected at night. Basically, 
people avoid the area because it's such a hassle. When it's congested, people 
want to get out of it as soon as possible. The regulars eventually avoid the 
area entirely, and those that are just passing through don't stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn to circumvent the traffic after a while, but it's still not 
uncommon for a five-minute trip to turn into 15 or 20 minutes. And that's what 
kills my lunch hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farinacci estimated that it would take "a good year" for his business and 
others in the area to rebound after the Santa Ana phase of construction is 
complete and 17th and Main streets can once again fully accommodate traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 It likely won't take long for drivers to adapt to their new surroundings once 
the job is done, however. The completed project promises a degree of traffic 
relief tantamount to coronary bypass surgery. The old freeway through Santa Ana 
had six lanes and could handle 13,000 vehicles per hour during peak drive time. 
Upon completion of the project, 26,000 vehicles per hour will whiz along 12 
lanes, said OCTA's Bogard. (For a taste of this, try the southbound Santa Ana 
Freeway through Irvine, where the freeway has been widened.) 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic will also be eased by the introduction of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) 
lanes, among the most spectacular-looking aspects of the project. They are the 
structures that soar above the Santa Ana Freeway and parts of the Costa Mesa 
Freeway near the Santa Ana Freeway interchange. Designed to lift buses, vans, 
car pools and other multiperson vehicles out of the rest of the traffic and 
speed them on their way, today the HOV lanes look like so much wood shoring in 
many places. The wooden latticework that makes up the framework of the flyovers 
can look almost Byzantine. 
</P>
<P>
 And those vexing tight turns through the looping connectors at the Santa Ana 
Freeway/Costa Mesa Freeway interchange? They'll be gone, said Bogard, replaced 
by great parabolic flyovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adding a little more spaghetti to this thing" is the way Bogard puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the earthmovers crash on, and drivers try to keep their eyes on the 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "People recognize that the end result will improve the traffic mobility in the 
area and that they are actually going to benefit," said Marina Duran-Rojas, 
spokeswoman for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially there was a lot of surprise that this was actually going to happen. 
People really didn't understand the impact of the project until we began the 
actual construction work that affected their lives. Then they were no longer 
able to get around the area like they used to. It was making their lives more 
difficult. Some people were angry. Their perception of something familiar had 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 How to beat the snarl? Elaine Beno, a spokesperson for OCTA, offered a few 
tips: Plan your trips and commutes ahead, and pay attention to construction 
updates on radio, TV and in newspapers. When possible, use alternate means of 
transportation, such as buses, trains or carpools. If your employer allows, 
make your commute at non-peak hours or stagger your work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, both OCTA and Caltrans offer help over the phone. OCTA's commuter 
assistance and route planning line, thorough which you can receive help in 
mapping out a more convenient route to your destination, is (714) 636-RIDE 
(toll-free from South County, (800) 636-RIDE). Caltrans' transportation help 
line, which provides updated information on construction and closures, is (714) 
724-2077. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologically, people are pretty much resigned now, in the midst of it," 
said Duran-Rojas. "And they're already beginning to see the light at the end of 
the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Beaver has already seen it, albeit through a haze of surface street 
traffic. The manager of the Sinclair Paint store on 17th Street near the 
freeway, Beaver, who commutes from Anaheim, said that his freeway drive on the 
Santa Ana Freeway actually takes less time than it used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept moving the 17th Street ramp around for a while, but it's back in 
the same place now. Once I get on the freeway, it's fine. It's getting to the 
entrance on 17th that's the problem," he said. "It really takes a while to get 
there, especially if the traffic on the street is clogged up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bottlenecks continue, but throughout all construction the Santa Ana 
Freeway has never been closed. Manhandled, yes. Camouflaged, seemingly. But 
always open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's continually changing," said Caltrans' Duran-Rojas. "Early on there were 
a lot of closures of ramps, and people had to deal with that, but now we have 
about a year and a half to go, and we are seeing ramps opening up. And we 
rescheduled some closures of ramps so they (wouldn't) impact during the 
holidays. And we've flip-flopped on closures -- say, Grand Avenue at one point, 
Main Street at another point. There's disruption, but we've tried to share the 
disruption with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Disruption? asked Will Recker. What disruption? 
</P>
<P>
 Recker is the director of the UCI Institute of Transportation Studies, and his 
analysis of the impact of the project comes down to: It could have been a lot 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of years ago," he said, "when they first started planning the 
reconstruction, Caltrans was very interested and edgy about such a massive 
undertaking. It was going to be like doing surgery on a patient while the 
patient is still awake. Doom and gloom was predicted. It was thought that 
everything would come to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know what? It never materialized. I'm not always a Caltrans booster, 
but they did something right here. As an engineer, I'm amazed how it's gone so 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there's a lot of anxiousness in that people are wanting it to be done so 
they can use it. But many of us, for the past 20 years, thought that we 
wouldn't be able to build our way out of this one. But the way things look, 
maybe we can."

THE POET OF THE NIGHT SHIFT; LITERATURE: FOR PHILIP LEVINE, IT WASN'T A LONG 
TRIP FROM FACTORY WORK TO WRITING SOME OF AMERICA'S BEST POETRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL FRANK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mornings, Levine zips himself into a warm-up suit, grabs coffee, pops old jazz 
in the tape player, hefts a fat fountain pen and a yellow pad, and settles into 
his armchair to write some of the best poetry in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, the same guy, "in a dirty work shirt that says 'Phil,' " 
would have been punching in at Chevy Gear & Axle, Detroit Transmission or the 
Mavis Nu Icy Bottling Co., would have been running jackhammer, muscling cases 
of soda pop, polishing flexible plumbing tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Levine published "The Simple Truth" (Knopf) last month, his 16th volume 
of poems and his 20th book, including translations and essays, in 31 years. A 
collection of essays, "The Bread of Time," was published early in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Simple Truth," as in all his earlier books, from "On the Edge" in 1963 
to the National Book Award-winning "What Work Is" in 1991, Levine is our "poet 
of the night shift," as one critic calls him, the writer who knows in his own 
bones the corrosive effects of heat, foul air, long hours, low pay and heavy 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Such conditions, he admits, were an unlikely seedbed for poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in the wrong year and in the wrong place," he says in the title 
poem of "One for the Rose" (1981). The year was 1928, eve of the Great 
Depression. The place was Detroit, where Levine and his identical twin, Eddie, 
lost their father at age 5 and went to work as soon as they hit their teens. 
</P>
<P>
 An amateur boxer, Levine enjoyed physical work at first. He believed working 
with his hands would leave his mind free for poetry. Indeed, when asked which 
job was the worst, he likes to say Detroit Transmission was pretty bad, but the 
semester he spent teaching poetry to a classroom full of future lawyers and 
doctors at Princeton was worse. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a pivotal moment that drove Levine from the factory to the 
academy, it may have been when co-workers baked him a cake to mark his first 
anniversary at a plumbing supply house called Brass Craft. He was appalled. He 
thought he had only been there a few months. He quit the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt myself wearing down," he said during a recent chat in the living room 
of his comfy old bungalow in fog-bound Fresno. "I wasn't going to have the 
strength or will to keep writing. Now I see that it made me as a poet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of a master's degree from Wayne University (now Wayne State) 
-- his thesis was on Keats' "Ode to Indolence," of all things -- Levine got a 
job teaching part-time at the University of Iowa, which enabled him to crash 
the Iowa Writers Workshop, the hothouse for American poetry of the 1950s and 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The poems and connections he forged in Iowa City snagged him a one-year 
fellowship at Stanford University, which led, in turn, to a job at Fresno State 
in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 His twin still lives in Detroit, still runs his grandfather's and his father's 
used auto parts business. He is also a painter of some local repute. Even 
though Levine left Detroit more than 40 years ago, you'd never know it from the 
poems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of burlap sacks, out of bearing butter," he intones in his most famous 
poem, "They Feed They Lion" (1972). "Out of black bean and wet slate bread, Out 
of the acids of rage, the candor of tar, Out of creosote, gasoline, drive 
shafts, wooden dollies. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Let others sing of nature or New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detroit is perfect for me," Levine said in his gravelly, urban-Midwestern 
voice. "It's not dinky. It's just big enough. I know it. I'm a Detroit-sized 
poet. It took me a long time to be able to write about it without snarling and 
snapping. I had to temper the violence I felt toward those who'd maimed and 
cheated me with a tenderness toward those who had touched and blessed me." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Levine's work so compelling is that the poems are not just about 
his co-workers, but for them. Quoting Walt Whitman, Levine calls his poems 
"vivas for those who have failed": 
</P>
<P>
 For a black man whose name I have forgotten who danced all night at Chevy Gear 
& Axle, for that great stunned Pole who laughed when he called me Jew Boy, for 
the ugly who had no chance, the beautiful in body, the used and the unused, 
those who had courage and those who quit. -- From "Silent in America" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mockingly, Levine calls himself "Fresno's dumb bard": Aside from an occasional 
reference to the fruit trees in his back yard, the magpies and oaks in the 
fields, he has written more poems about the two years he spent in Spain than 
the 36 he has spent in the San Joaquin Valley. What little he does write and 
say about Fresno is not kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's spread out into a little L.A.," he said, "with all the disadvantages of 
a big city -- crime, pollution, druggies -- and very few of the advantages." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the nearby Sierra Nevada, Yosemite? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hiking was what we did in Detroit when the car broke down," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among Fresno's disadvantages, for one who makes his living jetting to 
poetry readings, is the lack of a big-league airport. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not go elsewhere, now that, at age 66, he's retired from Fresno State? 
</P>
<P>
 Levine was aghast. Abandon his doctor, his dentist and his mechanic? 
</P>
<P>
 "It took ages to find these people," he said. "You don't just run out on a 
great car mechanic." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, nobody gets rich writing poems. Levine's biggest blockbuster has 
sold 25,000 copies, which is not exactly in Stephen King's league. Levine and 
his wife, Fran, a painter, have settled into one of Fresno's loveliest 
neighborhoods. Where else could they live as well? 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, I can't afford New York, I don't care about the Bay Area so 
much and I don't write as much in those places as I write here," Levine said. 
"I'm not in the poetry world when I'm here and I don't like being in the poetry 
world. People start kissing my ass and try to use me. Nobody does that in 
Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But plenty of people around town know who he is -- "Levine the poet?" he was 
asked when he recently joined a new gym -- but a famous poet is not famous like 
a famous actor, athlete or musician is famous. Published routinely in the 
Atlantic and the New Yorker and praised lavishly by influential critic Harold 
Bloom ("I wonder if any American poet since Walt Whitman himself has written 
elegies this magnificent," Bloom gushes on the jacket of "The Simple Truth"), 
Levine is untroubled by the paradox of his anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you accept when you accept poetry, because for the last 
several hundred years poetry has not been the driving force, not in America," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he blames the titans of the previous generation, T.S. Eliot 
and Ezra Pound, for making poetry so forbidding to modern readers. Their 
attitude, Levine said, was " 'If you don't have my education you better get 
it.' I resent that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Levine's poems are easy. Many are dense with the kind of surreal 
images found in the work of the Spanish poets he admires. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Will the reader understand?' is not a question you can ask yourself," he 
said. "My hope is I'll lure him into working very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Readers of poetry may not be numerous, but they're loyal. For them, Levine 
said, "Poetry matters the way it's always mattered: to make sense out of our 
emotional lives, to show us the possibilities of language." 
</P>
<P>
 For them, Levine uncaps the fountain pen, worries the yellow pad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poems are curious beasts," he said. "They come on their own time or they 
don't come at all. You have to be patient and wait for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after all these years, Levine can't quite believe that this is how he 
gets to spend his time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus, Levine," he marveled. "There are all these other people who've got to 
go out at 6 a.m. and pick onions or fix cars. You live in such immense luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 He exaggerates, of course. For one thing, "after years of living badly, 
without security or certainty," the comfort he has attained is no more than 
that of a middle-class retiree. 
</P>
<P>
 For another thing, this business of making poems is also hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Another dawn, leaden and cold. I am up alone, searching again for words that 
will make some difference . . . . -- From "Words"

A PLACE TO CALL HOME; LIFE IS GRIM WHEN YOU LIVE ON THE STREETS. AND WHILE IT 
SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE HAS A PLANTO CREATE HOUSING, IT'S FINDING THE RIGHT PLAN 
FOR SHELTER THAT'S CAUSING ALL THE TROUBLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Where were you when the cold rains came on Christmas weekend? 
</P>
<P>
 In your car with the heater on and the windows cracked open? In a hut 
constructed of cardboard cartons? Beneath a concrete overpass next to a blazing 
fire? Or perhaps on a cot in a shelter -- alert to the smells, sounds and 
threats of others too close for comfort? 
</P>
<P>
 The options are grim for more than 100,000 people on frosty nights when almost 
everyone with four walls to call home is sleeping safely inside them. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of homeless in Los Angeles County has increased about 9% in the 
past year, according to a study released last month by the Shelter Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very conservative estimate," said Ruth Schwartz, executive director, 
"because it is based on data from agencies which give financial support." The 
people who don't get aid -- and therefore are not counted -- is assumed to be 
huge, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are all these people? And what would constitute a home if they could have 
one? 
</P>
<P>
 Few experts agree on the answers. Their passionate differences flared last 
month after a plan was announced to transport Downtown street people to a huge 
lawn east of the city, where they could rest and maybe be allowed to sleep. 
Also planned for the site was a shelter where they could rent lockers, take 
showers and have access to social services. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Orwellian poorhouse," pronounced Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias 
del Pueblo. "Building a large fenced (area) is nothing but a prison." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's doghouses for the poor," blasted Gary Blasi, UCLA law professor and 
former attorney for the homeless. "The homeless need the same as everyone else: 
four walls, a window and a bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great idea for a certain segment of the population," countered Tanya 
Tull, director of Beyond Shelter, which finds affordable housing for homeless 
families. "For some, a safe lawn would be an improvement over where they are 
now. The homeless are not cookie-cutter people -- this plan wasn't meant to 
fill all needs." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mayor Richard) Riordan's no fool," said advocate Ted Hayes, who founded 
Genesis II, the dome village for homeless people near Interstate 10 in 
Downtown. "The mayor's plan to clean up Downtown will help business while 
giving urban campers a place to go. I don't agree with where they'd go, but I 
admire him for doing something rather than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it wasn't Riordan's idea in the first place, said Rae Franklin 
James, deputy mayor of housing and transportation. Application was made for a 
HUD grant to help the homeless back in Tom Bradley's Administration. When the 
$20-million grant came through last January, a coalition of advocacy groups for 
the homeless came up with "the plan," loudly publicized when it was announced 
in November. Since then, all 133 pages have been quietly scrapped because of 
the controversy it caused. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the question of the lawn is moot. "We're going back to square one," 
James said. The outcry was so great "that we have decided to rethink the entire 
homeless initiative, of which the lawn was just a part." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rethinking won't be easy. The word homeless is so overused that the people it 
describes have fused in the public's mind into a faceless mass. And the meaning 
of home , for someone who has none, is even more difficult for experts to 
discover. 
</P>
<P>
 "A home?" asked Schwartz in surprise. "I can define homeless but not home ." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Blasi had to think for a while: "A home is somewhere you can come back 
to. It's the place to which families attach significance. It's where your stuff 
is, if you have any stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Does it have to be four walls and a roof? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Blasi said: "That's what evolved over hundreds of years to meet 
human needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not, said Norman Millar, architect and teacher at Southern 
California Institute of Architecture. "A home is someplace you have control 
over. It doesn't have to be much -- just some sort of a realm. A small box, a 
room, a corner where you have dominion and control of how the space is used." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the dictionary is vague. The word home is rooted in ancient Greek, 
meaning "to rest" -- with all the security that implies. In modern usage, it's 
defined as "the place where one lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to say you can't live in a cardboard box, or a covered wagon, or between 
two painted lines that define your private territory -- as long as you have the 
necessary conditions to call it your home? As long as you feel safe and 
comfortable enough to achieve true rest? 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds too bizarre to contemplate, it isn't. In Orlando, Fla., a 
homeless shelter proposal included lines painted on a grid. Each homeless 
person could stake out a space between the lines, where he or she could sleep 
without fear of harm or intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York artist built a prototype two-wheel covered wagon -- to give 
privacy, shelter and storage space to those with no place to call home. It 
could be pulled around by day and set up for sleeping in a safe space at night. 
</P>
<P>
 A local architect has proposed a series of four-foot-high block walls under 
the freeways, to give homeless people a private space in which to sleep and 
store their belongings. The homeless person would provide a removable roof made 
of plastic, cardboard or whatever material is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are just a few ideas meant to help those at the low end of society's 
urban spectrum, many of whom are out of the loop due to mental illness or 
substance abuse. If cities cannot offer safe shelters and medical care for such 
helpless people, the innovators say, why not try to provide some private space 
in which they can at least safely lay their heads? 
</P>
<P>
 For those who can help themselves if only given a leg up, dozens of low-cost 
shelter ideas are afloat. Many have a do-it-yourself thrust because people 
without homes are not without strength and talent, the architects say. 
</P>
<P>
 Out in Hesperia, architect Nader Khalili (who used to build skyscrapers in Los 
Angeles), now devotes his life to a new kind of "earth structure" that can be 
built "by the more than one billion homeless people of the world." He said his 
homes, which are easily put together out of sandbags and barbed wire, are 
impervious to earthquake, flood, hurricane, fire, extremes of heat and cold. 
They can be fitted with plumbing, electricity, water, gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but are they attractive and livable? 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can tell you is that with the very earth beneath your feet, you can 
build the most beautiful structures in the world," Khalili said. "In fact, the 
city of Hesperia, which was totally skeptical about my project when I first 
came here, has now given me the contract to build its natural history museum -- 
using sandbags and wire. It will be a handsome building, I assure you," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding suitable structures is the easy part. Far thornier are the problems of 
where to place them, who will fund them (the government or private groups) -- 
and how to fill them with individuals who want to live in them. All homeless 
people are not necessarily candidates for all homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes' Downtown dome village, for example, has not turned out to be the utopia 
he'd hoped for. In addition to financial problems that plague the project, 
Hayes said some of the residents simply weren't ready for the responsibilities 
of community life. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Lucie White, teaching at Harvard University this year, 
agrees that providing shelter isn't necessarily the answer. It is "misleading 
and dangerous to equate the world of homelessness with the world of innovative 
homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Far better, she thinks, to "find ways in which people can provide houses for 
themselves." In many other countries, she said, the homeless create communities 
by and for themselves -- on land they settle at the outskirts of towns. In 
South Africa, she saw whole villages created by people who had grouped together 
and built "wonderful dwellings for themselves from used milk cartons." 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts cite economically viable villages in South America, built and 
inhabited by formerly homeless families. Using discarded tires stuffed with 
earth and straw, they have built homes, markets and schools as the population 
grows and solidifies into a more formal "city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this country, experts say, brand-new towns and villages will blossom -- and 
abandoned towns can be brought back to life -- if the homeless and their 
organizers are allowed to use arable land and are given a chance to fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 On U.S. Highway 1, near Orland, Me., the unbelievable has already been 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Poulin, a former Carmelite nun, shepherds a large, economically viable 
and peaceful community. It was built by and for its inhabitants -- 75% of whom 
were once homeless. Almost all are under-educated and have no formal skills, 
Poulin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Poulin took over an abandoned 23-acre farm to give poor craftspeople 
a place to sell their wares. The farm, called HOME, has since expanded into a 
700-acre multiuse town with what Poulin calls "beautiful Cape Cod-style homes 
on big lots," built from scratch "by our own residents with wood growing on our 
property." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the property, built and staffed by HOME residents, are a sawmill, 
shingle factory, woodworking shop, crafts shop, flea market, cobblers' shop, 
school, day-care center, food banks, four emergency shelters for homeless women 
and children, a men's shelter, a brand-new single-room-occupancy building and 
some new duplexes for single parents and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's self-development economics," Poulin said by phone the other day. "People 
have needs for housing. So we get land, put it in a land trust. On that land, 
trees are growing. We harvest the trees, bring them to the sawmill and the 
shingle mill, and then we build houses with it. We create employment, fill a 
local need with a local resource." 
</P>
<P>
 Poulin, who is plain-spoken and didn't finish high school, said, "Everybody 
has a skill of some sort. We help find it and ask that they use it. If you're 
willing to work, you're accepted here." 
</P>
<P>
 She believes that many homeless people have fewer problems and more talent 
than society gives them credit for. "We have this man who lived in a truck out 
on a deserted hill, who wouldn't look anyone in the eye, couldn't read or 
write, who talked to walls and was totally off in his own world," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to live in our shelter, improved his psychology, went to school here, 
got married here, and recently joined with a group of volunteers to build his 
own beautiful Cape Cod home, where he lives with his wife. In fact the three 
key men in our building crew are talented people who used to be homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 She believes that "more than half of what is called mental illness in the 
homeless population isn't mental illness at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the result of isolation, which destroys a person. The more you're 
shunned, the dirtier and lonelier you become, the more strangely you behave," 
she said. "I'm no professional, but I believe the solution is to employ the 
unemployed and unemployable. That's what works here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's what works anywhere, said Marjorie Bard, who got her doctorate at UCLA 
with a thesis on the hidden homeless -- people once employed and well-housed 
but who have slipped into poverty through job loss or other hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no help offered these people," Bard said. "Once they've used most of 
their savings, they have to start living in their cars. The car is mobility, 
shelter, storage and relative safety compared to what life would be like as a 
street person." 
</P>
<P>
 Bard helps these people to retro-fit cars for more comfortable sleeping and 
storage. In many instances, she arranges a swap: the classy car is traded for a 
larger van, wagon or recreational vehicle, which can be more comfortable and 
home-like until the real thing comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term, however, she believes in Lucy Poulin's approach. To heck with the 
city, the bureaucracy and the demeaning handouts, she said: Find abandoned 
towns, farms or vacant arable land on which to build innovative, low-cost 
housing. Use the barter system to get what you need and start your own 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people chip in to help each other toward a common goal, miracles can be 
accomplished."

'90S FAMILY; THE DATING DILEMMA; IT WAS NEVER EASY BEING A SINGLE PARENT -- AND 
THINGS JUST GOT A LITTLE HARDER. NEW STUDIES SHOW THAT MOM OR DAD'S COURTSHIP 
HABITS DIRECTLY INFLUENCE A CHILD'S OUTLOOK ON SEX AND LOVE.

 An honest smile. An "I love you, Mommy." A hug. A kiss. Pause. "What's a slut? 
Mommy, are you a slut?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nausea rocked Mommy's body. She pulled her only child closer, wondering what 
had provoked her 8-year-old daughter, but too terrified to know. Hours later, 
she did. Apologies sputtered from the neighbor whose son had taunted the girl 
for having a mom he called a slut. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears stung the raw cheeks of the 28-year-old single mother from Santa Monica. 
Her mind dizzied with confusion, with thoughts about ruining her daughter's 
life because she dates about three times a week, because she enjoys inviting 
men to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I don't know what I'm doing," she said, recounting that recent 
day in whining whispers. "I love my (daughter), but I need my adult life too. 
How do I do that without being a bad parent?" 
</P>
<P>
 With balance, experts answered. Communicate. Be patient. Organize. Set 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 If only it were that simple for the nation's increasing single-parent 
population. Two recent studies confirmed what most single-parents already 
suspected: Erratic dating can speed children's sexual development and warp 
their approach to romantic love as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 A UC Davis study, published in September, showed that environment, rather than 
genetics, influences an adult's style when it comes to romantic relationships; 
for example, a preference for multiple partners or valuing friendship more than 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 And a study from Iowa State University found that a single mother's dating 
behavior can sway teen sons into early sexual experimentation and relax teen 
daughters' attitudes about promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the studies' bleakness, experts said there is good news: It's 
important for single parents to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might even say it's crucial," said Les B. Whitbeck, associate professor of 
sociology at Iowa State and co-researcher of the second study, released last 
summer. It's crucial because half of the country's marriages end in divorce and 
almost three-quarters of teen-agers have sex, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children "need to see a (single) parent model caring and responsible 
relationships," Whitbeck said, acknowledging that this is also true in 
two-parent households. "This is how (children) learn to become caring and 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of physical intimacy, Whitbeck said the responsibility is greater on 
a single parent. "Most children are not aware of their parents' sexuality. A 
lot of times, it's hard for them to imagine that their parents have sex. But 
when Mom (or Dad) dates, it becomes more observable." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything becomes more noticeable, said psychologist Michael Schulman, 
co-author of "Bringing Up a Moral Child: A New Approach for Teaching Your Child 
to Be Kind, Just and Responsible" (Doubleday, 1994). As early as age 4, 
children scrutinize -- and do they ever -- the date and how their parents 
interact with the date, including the most mundane verbal or body 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for parents to remember that, foremost, they're parents, and 
that's how they should act," said Schulman, also chairman of Columbia 
University's Seminar on Moral Education. "Most children eventually lose respect 
for (dating) parents who act like teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 Moms and dads who are single because of divorce or a spouse's death are the 
most prone to acting this way, said lawyer David L. Levy, president of 
Children's Rights Council, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all new to them. Parents who've always been single have had a longer 
time to get used to it," said Levy, editor of "The Best Parent Is Both Parents: 
A Guide to Shared Parenting in the 21st Century" (Hampton Roads Publishing, 
1994). "But for any adult, parenting and dating can be overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds intimidating when experts explain possible negative effects. For 
example, a dating parent can stunt children's development, trapping them in 
perpetual immaturity. A mother who's giddy around her mate is teaching her 
daughter to build a personality facade before going on a date. A man who 
publicly ogles his love-interest's body or BMW is encouraging his son to pursue 
a plastic lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also pointed to the potential positives of parental dating: for 
instance, another role model for the child, increased financial support and a 
happier parent, who would be miserable without adult companionship and 
intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The pros and the cons of dating constantly swirl inside Mark Tomaino's head. 
"Some days, I want to find a partner," said the 33-year-old Anaheim resident, a 
single father to Crystal, 8. "Other days, I think it's easier to keep things as 
they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he hears Crystal's delight as she quizzed Tomaino about -- and in front 
of -- one of his recent dates. "She ran up to me and said, 'Daddy do you like 
her? Are you going to marry her? She's pretty, Daddy. Don't you think she's 
pretty?' Crystal was so happy," Tomaino recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he thinks about all the women who dislike dating a man with a kid. "So I 
first have to find someone and then figure out how she feels about kids. I'd 
like to meet a single mother but it's so hard to find them, except at Chuck E. 
Cheese's and, oh, what a pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard to find balance that dating sometimes seems more like work than 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should enjoy dating, said Iowa State's Whitbeck, "as long as they 
remember their responsibility to their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when it comes to sex. A 1987 study found that recently divorced 
mothers, adjusting from married to single life, are at their peak in 
promiscuity; consequently, so are their teen daughters. Experts speculated that 
this would also be true for fathers and sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When parents date, it is the one area in human development where the parent 
and the child are going through the same process," Whitbeck said. "Both feel 
anxiety. Both study each other," although children are more impressionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, keeping lips sealed about sex can be difficult for parents who 
matured during and after the sexual revolution, added Stuart Greenberg, a 
forensic psychologist and a clinical faculty member at the University of 
Washington in Seattle. "Society now says it's OK to be open." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly Vanterpool, 34, is "never" shy. Ask the Long Beach nurse intimate 
details about her personal life and, most likely, she'll tell you. "I've always 
been an open person," she said. "Very open." 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes her children -- Ayla, 7, and German, 5 -- will continue to be open, 
especially with her. But since she became a mother, Vanterpool decided to 
shroud her love relationships in privacy. "When I dated, I never let my kids 
see me in bed with a man. I wanted to teach them that friendship and love are 
more important than sex. I also didn't want them to hear other people talking 
about my sex life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured that it's up to me to set a good example for my kids," said 
Vanterpool, newly wed to Curtis Vanterpool, whom she dated for two years. 
</P>

 But even as adults, children often squirm when a parent starts talking about 
sex with a significant other, said Gloria S. Murphy, co-author of "Grown-up 
Children, Grown-up Parents: Opening the Door to Healthy Relationships Between 
Parents and Adult Children" (Birch Lane Press, 1994). And even as adults, 
children can still struggle when talking casually about a parent's love 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always your parent's child," she said. "Seeing a parent with someone 
else can leave an adult child feeling confused and dislodged." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Copeland, 26, knows this is true for children of all ages. Ever since her 
mom divorced two decades ago and eventually began dating, Copeland said she 
grapples with "the same territorial feelings, like he's taken over my spot in 
my mom's life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember being totally rude" to the man in her mom's life, Copeland said. 
"I always hoped that would make him go away. Later, I'd feel so guilty about 
being so rude." 
</P>
<P>
 Copeland's attitude didn't thrill her mom, Myra. "But I understood how Jill 
felt," said Myra, 58, whose mother married four times. "I always made sure Jill 
knew that dating wouldn't change my love for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Copeland's feelings have simmered -- mostly they've disappeared 
-- in the last six out of seven years that Myra has been married to Elden 
Pauling. Copeland attributed this to sharing a Culver City home with them. "You 
have no choice but to get to know a person you're living with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also like Elden, he's a good person and . . , " said the single mother of 
7-year-old Jasmine. She paused. And then laughed. "I now know what it was like 
for Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Jasmine also giggles as she explained her position on parent dating: "If I get 
to sleep in Mom's bed then it's OK for her to go out."

'90S FAMILY; TODAY'S BEAVER CLEAVER HAS A LOT MORE ON HIS MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the American family in unprecedented flux, the '90s may be the toughest 
decade ever for children, according to a recent Rand study. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong study by the Santa Monica research institute distilled the 
results of 200 studies of the American family by major researchers, and matched 
their results with Census figures from 1960 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion: June and Ward Cleaver are long gone, and the '90s Beaver 
Cleaver has a lot more to worry about than whether he's gotten his brother, 
Wally, mad at him for some prank. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from Harvard University, M. Omar Rahman, visiting 
professor and co-author of the comprehensive study, said the 1992 Murphy Brown 
debate over single parents piqued his curiosity, as well as that of Rand 
co-researcher Julie DaVanzo. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people seemed to think that the American family was worse off today 
than it had been," he said. "We wanted to know whether this was just nostalgia, 
or whether this was rooted in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also wanted to know whether children from single-parent families are 
actually worse off than children from conventional, two-parent families." 
</P>
<P>
 Their findings, Rahman admitted, surprised them. 
</P>
<P>
 They concluded that the traditional American family, while still alive, is no 
longer the single predominant social institution. Rather, it has become one of 
several common household models. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this trend, and the aging of America, "It's harder than ever to be 
a kid today," Rahman said. "Above all, we need to redefine who we really are, 
and see how we can make society a more hospitable place for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although the average American is better off today than in 1960, the average 
family's median income has fallen substantially. This is because the number of 
households headed by women has tripled, with nearly half of those households 
existing at or below the poverty line and receiving federal help. 
</P>
<P>
 * The median annual income of a married couple with children under 18 is 
$43,000. The median annual income of a comparable household headed solely by 
the mother is $13,000. Fatherless families have increased to account for a 
quarter of all American families. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle ground prevalent in the '60s is disappearing, leaving more children 
growing up in either have or have-not homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The majority of American children do not have Mom or Dad waiting at home 
after school. Even most infants 6 months and under don't see Mom most of the 
day. Instead, 60% of their mothers work -- three times the rate in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not only is Mom more likely to work, Dad, too, is increasingly absent. The 
American divorce rate also has tripled since 1960 to its current 60% level, and 
for many divorced dads, out of sight is often out of mind. Only half the 
country's kids have seen their divorced dads even once in the last year. And 
only one in three divorced dads sends full child-support payments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Because of longer commutes and work weeks, even married dads are spending 
less time at home. The average parent in a two-parent household spends just 
seven hours a week with the child -- a third of the time spent in 1960. Thus, 
even kids in two-parent families are increasingly growing up on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Today's children are also more likely to grow up without siblings. The 
average family today has 1.8 children, compared with 2.2 children in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * One-quarter of today's children are born out of wedlock -- five times the 
rate in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1960, children made up more than a third of the population, while the 
elderly constituted a mere 10%. Today, kids make up just a quarter of the 
population, while the elderly have shot up to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 * The next-door neighbor is not only likely to be older, he is also twice as 
likely to be single; that's because the rate of "non-family" households has 
doubled, from 15% in 1960 to 30% today. This is due largely to the rise in 
divorces, and in adults living together. In 1960, only 10% of American adults 
lived together as an experimental prelude to marriage; today, 50% do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Should current trends continue, in 30 years the country will have more 
senior citizens than children. Thus, today's kids, who have grown up largely on 
their own, will probably be strapped with ever higher taxes to help support the 
parents who neglected them, the authors concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kids whose parents divorce will most likely see them split up within the 
marriage's first seven years -- before the kid is mature enough to deal with 
it. Half of all children will spend some time in a single-parent household, 
often before the parent remarries. A sixth of all children will at least 
partially grow up in families with one non-biological parent. 
</P>
<P>
 * On a more positive note, because people of color constitute a growing 
segment of the American population, children in the '90s are increasingly 
learning to deal with multiethnic groups. Whereas their '60s counterparts wore 
Native American headbands and grew long hair to dramatize their diversity, '90s 
children are more diverse to begin with, and are more likely to come from mixed 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahman said he and DaVanzo were surprised by some of their findings, which fly 
in the face of popular myths. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular current myth, he said, is that a typical single mother has 
more children today than in 1960. In reality, she will have about the same 
number of children. But because there are more single mothers, and because 
married couples are having fewer kids, single mothers appear relatively more 
prolific. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahman said many factors have joined together to help dissolve the traditional 
'60s family. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Higher incomes for both men and women have made it easier for them to live 
independently of one another. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rising earnings by women have made it relatively more "costly" for them to 
stay at home with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * An escalating divorce rate has made prospective parenting a less-attractive 
option. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Social Security and similar 
programs have reduced economic gains to marriage for the poor and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 * The sexual revolution has made it increasingly acceptable to bear children 
outside marriage. Thus, only 20% of Americans today believe that parents should 
stay together just for the children. In 1960, half of all Americans believed 
this.
