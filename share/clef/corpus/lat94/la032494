 * Re "Key Element of Clinton's Health Plan Passes First Test" (March 16): 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the first congressional subcommittee to consider health 
legislation reform proposed that employers be required to pay 80% of health 
insurance costs for their workers is not too surprising. Don't taxpayers pay 
roughly 75% of the health insurance costs for federal government employees? 
</P>
<P>
 A 60%/40% employer/employee payment ratio might be more practical, 
particularly for smaller businesses, and better for the business economy in 
general, but then representatives would be proposing higher insurance costs for 
themselves -- and for all state government employees as well.

complaints, would you like them handled by the IRS? Enough said.

ONE FAMILY'S VIEW OF JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Our 21-year-old son is dead. His killer, the driver in a one-car crash, was 
sentenced to 60 days in county jail for taking a human life. Was justice 
served? 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 24, 1993, our son, a senior at Loyola Marymount University, was the 
only passenger in an automobile in which the driver lost control at 71 m.p.h. 
in third gear (from the police report) and crossed four lanes before hitting 
the berm and becoming airborne for 52 feet and then hitting a tree. This all 
happened at the 101/405 interchange. Our son, who was wearing a seat belt, was 
ejected 70 feet from the car and was killed instantly; the driver did not have 
even a bruise. The killer's blood-alcohol level was .11. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 25, we experienced the second worst day of our lives. We attended Van 
Nuys Municipal Court for the sentencing of our son's killer. The judge 
minimalized and trivialized our son's life. This was our first time ever in 
court and we were unprepared for the frustration. We now understand the common 
concern that criminal rights take precedence over victims' rights in our 
judicial system. We witnessed this firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 The only positive of this day was the presence and support of Mothers Against 
Drunk Drivers. A MADD representative was with us throughout the court 
proceedings to guide us and assist us through every aspect of the courtroom 
"sham." 
</P>
<P>
 We had been informed that no sentencing would take place before we had our 
input in court. Both of us had prepared statements. But the judge had decided 
the sentence before anyone had even entered the courtroom. We decided not to 
suffer an emotional upset by baring our souls for naught. The judge used the 
term "creative sentencing," allowing the felon to complete his school semester 
before serving his sentence. Chances are slim that the driver will ever even 
serve his "full" term of 60 days. Probation, some community service and a youth 
program complete what the judge terms "creative sentencing." 
</P>
<P>
 We do not believe that the deputy district attorney represented us, our son or 
the people of the County of Los Angeles in this case. Too much consideration 
was given to this being a "first offense." No one seemed to care that the first 
offense killed our son. We sincerely hope that the driver never kills anyone 
else's child on his "second" offense.

A PRUDENT PERIOD OF DELAY; GIVE FISKE A CLEAR SHOT -- THEN CONGRESS CAN DO ITS 
THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitewater is heating up. In pleading guilty to federal felony counts of 
conspiracy and mail fraud and agreeing to cooperate with Whitewater 
investigators, former Arkansas municipal judge David Hale now becomes a key 
figure in the investigation, and potentially a key accuser against President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. lays great stress on Hale's 
cooperation. Among other things, the onetime operator of a federally backed 
fund to make loans to disadvantaged borrowers alleges that he was pressured in 
the mid-1980s by then-Gov. Bill Clinton to make loans to some of Clinton's 
political pals. Among these was $300,000 to Susan McDougal, at the time the 
wife of the owner of Madisan Guaranty Savings & Loan. Hale's claim could tie 
Clinton to potential criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 An allegation, of course, is not a statement of fact, and much more than 
Hale's word will be needed to back up the claim that Clinton acted improperly. 
Moreover, Hale, facing up to 10 years in prison and hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in fines, has a heavy stake in satisfying the Whitewater investigators. 
Sentencing on his guilty pleas has been delayed for 120 days while he is 
questioned and testifies before a special grand jury. The investigators, if 
they are pleased with his level of cooperation, could recommend that the court 
show leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any allegation the burden of proof rests on the accuser. In the 
absence of corroboration Hale's charges prove nothing. But it's also important 
to note that Fiske, a man who chooses his words very carefully, sees Hale's 
cooperation as "a significant contribution to our investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the special counsel is to lift an investigation above the 
political suspicions that are invited whenever the executive branch 
investigates itself. But sheltering an investigation from the possibly 
wild-charging politics of the executive's opponents in Congress is also a 
reasonable consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has voted to conduct hearings into the Whitewater affair, as it 
should. But the near-unanimous vote in the House, following the Senate's 
earlier unanimous vote, leaves the timing open. What's shaping up is a prudent 
period of delay to allow Fiske to make progress with his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudent, though, doesn't mean indefinite. The White House's extraordinarily 
clumsy handling of the Whitewater affair has, fairly or not, served to feed 
doubts and raise questions that can probably now be answered only by full-scale 
-- and responsible -- public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, who is firm in denying any wrongdoing, ought to see that it's 
in his interests to get those hearings out of the way as soon as possible. At 
his scheduled press conference today, Clinton has the chance to say just that.

TONYA HARDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding's sentence of probation is a failure. Harding's conduct was 
wrong, and her plea bargain allows her to avoid responsibility for her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 16, Harding said, "I am concerned that to skate at (the World 
Championships) now would detract from the attention the other athletes in that 
competition deserve and would not be good, generally, for the sport of figure 
skating." Wouldn't this statement have been equally true for the Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier guilty plea would have removed Harding from Olympic competition. 
Harding should have admitted her wrongdoing prior to then, rather than waiting 
until now. Instead, she chose to engage in a campaign of bad-faith actions and 
frivolous tactics that were solely intended to obstruct justice and keep her on 
the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of her guilty plea, it is now clear that Harding's appearance at the 
Olympics was improper and undeserved. Her utter lack of ethics and denial of 
personal responsibility reflected poorly on the U.S.  
</P>
<P>

 In addition to the fine, probation and community service, Harding should also 
be sentenced to seven appearances on "Geraldo," five on "Hard Copy," three on 
"Current Affair" and a tabloid to be named later.

Harding was the queen of clubs.

PERMANENT JOBLESSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Column Left, "Face Up to Permanent Joblessness," Alexander 
Cockburn, March 15: 
</P>
<P>
 Cockburn at least has the honesty to quote Karl Marx and unabashedly argue 
some nonsense from the same old idiotic Comintern party line. Cockburn still 
has not learned the most elementary things about economics. His understanding 
is still no more sophisticated than that of a Luddite. 
</P>
<P>
 If job losses because of increased productivity produced "permanent 
joblessness," then the Luddites would have been right. When 90% of human beings 
were engaged in subsistence agriculture, the thought of a society where only 3% 
to 6% were engaged in agriculture would have been absolutely horrifying. 
Obviously, we do not have 84% to 87% unemployment. All those extra people found 
jobs because there were new products and new industries. It evidently does not 
occur to Cockburn that any new things might be invented in the future, or that 
many present industries might still be expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are not "found" things. They are not a finite resource existing in a 
fixed quantity, which must be "distributed" in some fair and equitable manner 
(through shorter workweeks and similar manipulations). The growth of human 
wealth and the secular increase in real wages can only occur because of 
increased productivity; and increased productivity inevitably means that at 
some point some people, as with 87% of subsistence farmers, get thrown out of 
work. Marx was talking about the "industrial reserve army" at a time when 
unemployment was often as low as 2% or 3%. It is the Marxist nostrums of people 
like Cockburn that have produced periods of unemployment from 10% to 20%, which 
is now standard in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 KELLY L. ROSS 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 * Cockburn's prophetic commentary on the future of global downsizing and 
corporate irresponsibility trumpets the call that the working man/woman (blue 
collar, white collar or no collar) must heed. What happened in the Balkans with 
regard to geography is now happening to the working community: a breaking up of 
family, communal, civic and economic unity. This Balkanization of the working 
community is not a product of governmental action but the unleashed force of 
crass capitalism without any moral or communal underpinnings. Capitalism for 
capitalism's sake! 
</P>
<P>
 We as a nation have enshrined a new nationalism: not defined as a group under 
philosophical and political ideas, but a hollow structure of economic 
well-being. An economic well-being that in turn is defined by statistics and 
statistical models. Where our schools, towns and cities are subsumed under the 
corporate well-being of what business might exist there. This can manifest with 
the weirdest of logic: Company X buys company Y in a small town Z, where 
company X must either scale back company Y or break up company Y in order to 
pay off the purchase of company Y! The small town Z is economically decimated 
for the well-being of company X. 
</P>
<P>
 So where will this new nationalism lead us? Balkanization of the working 
community will lead to an economic Bosnia where all sides involved are losers.

NO OSCAR FOR REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with great amusement the bit by Jeffrey Lord (Commentary, March 18) 
on Ronald Reagan's slighting by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe as a nation we need to create a very, very special award for former 
President Reagan.Reagan needs, finally, to be recognized as the "Father of 
Homelessness"; under his presidency the ranks of the homeless swelled to exceed 
the populations of many small nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan needs to be singled out for his efforts at containing the AIDS 
epidemic; nearly 250,000 dead Americans and millions at risk today would want 
it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the "Gipper," if I may be so bold, warrants notice for his role as 
the "Education President." It's downright criminal that Reagan has not been 
recognized for his contributions to math and science -- well, trajectories and 
ballistics anyway. Carping liberals just can't see past such trivialities as 
the worst decline in American schools in history, the birth of a nation of 
illiterates, and the banning of books his good buddies of the religious right 
found offensive. 
</P>

 * It's not often I agree with a Republican, but regarding Lord's article on 
Ronald Reagan, I find myself in happy agreement. Reagan certainly deserves this 
recognition and I have the perfect special category in mind: best comedic actor 
in the role as President.

THIS WRONG UNDERMINES THEIR RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angelenos can't believe that their hard-working police officers would resort 
to this. The billboard ads -- 22 of them plastered around town -- as ugly as 
graffiti and dumber than running a red light in front of a black-and-white.They 
depict the stereotypical carjacking -- the hooded thief pointing a gun at the 
terrified woman -- and, in bright red, "WARNING: THIS CAN BE YOU WITHOUT THE 
POLICE DEPARTMENT." 
</P>
<P>
 Why would the police union go this sleazy route? Because the police are 
terribly frustrated and angry. They have been through two years of hell -- from 
the Christopher Commission upbraiding to the Los Angeles riots -- and for two 
years they have been working without a contract. They feel the city gives them 
no respect: No raise for them, but utility workers landed a three-year 9% hike. 
</P>
<P>
 The anger is understandable and the position is incontestable: The police 
deserve a raise, perhaps more than most people. Even Mayor Richard Riordan, 
faced with bone-wearying budget problems, agrees and says officers should make 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The police have every First Amendment right to air their side of a labor 
dispute, but anger is no justification for trashing their own city. The hotel 
and restaurant workers did this by distributing a very negative videotape about 
Los Angeles around the country. Then the teachers union considered that tactic 
-- but in the end dropped the idea. Now the cops, billboards ablaze, are 
threatening to distribute their own trashing-L.A. videotape. This is simply 
wrong.

COLUMN LEFT/ JORGE G. CASTANEDA: THE LEFTISTS WIN ON GOOD CITIZENSHIP; EL 
SALVADOR'S ELECTION, FOR ALL ITS FLAWS, WAS LARGELY DEMOCRATIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a political scientist who teaches 
at Mexican and U.S. universities. His latest book is Utopia Unarmed: The Latin 
American Left After the Cold War. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday's election in El Salvador posed a major challenge to the small Central 
American nation as a whole and to that part of its political spectrum that, for 
want of a better word, can be called the left. For the country, it was the 
first chance after more than 10 years of civil war to choose the leaders, 
parties and programs from among all the competing options in Salvadoran 
society. The elections held since 1982 involved many voters, but the insurgents 
remained outside the process. How things would go when everyone with a 
constituency and a grievance could participate was anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 The electoral test was critical for the left: It implied the left's proving to 
itself that the U.N.-sponsored peace agreements had been worthwhile, to the 
extent that they allowed the insurgents to accomplish the transition from the 
armed struggle in the mountains to electoral competition in the towns and 
cities. More important, it implied proving to the rest of Salvadoran society 
that the war had involved truly representative forces: that the FMLN (the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front) was not just a small group of 
disgruntled leftists backed by Cuba and the Soviet Union, lacking real popular 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the country and the left fared well on both counts. The 
election was by and large a free and fair one. The work of more than 2,000 
international observers and the well-organized presence of the opposition in 
polling places contributed to the absence of egregious irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, reports from San Salvador do indicate that many irregularities 
marred the election proceedings and, if not corrected, may have a highly 
adverse impact in the runoff vote April 24. Apparently a significant number of 
registered voters -- up to 10%, according to the FMLN -- were declared 
ineligible when they showed up to vote. This problem was regarded by U.N. and 
other observers as essentially administrative, but the fact remains that the 
abstention rate was a surprising 45%. Certainly a substantial share would have 
voted for the left's coalition, the Democratic Convergence, and that would have 
made a difference. The government-party presidential candidate, Armando 
Calderon Sol, was forced into the runoff by the coalition when he fell less 
than 1% short of winning; he had been expected to fall short by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The runoff is crucial for the Democratic Convergence, despite its scant chance 
of winning: Both the campaigning and the results can protect the left and the 
country against the reappearance of death squads and the arrogance of Arena 
that have surfaced in the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not easy to hold a clean and meaningful election after a bloody civil 
war in a nation where conflicting interests, aspirations and dreams have 
generally been resolved through violence. Sunday's vote was probably as 
successful as could have been expected. It shows that things have changed in El 
Salvador, and that they are changing throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Convergence came in second to the conservative Arena party by a 
wide margin, but decisively beat the Christian Democrats, its main rival for 
the hearts, minds and votes of the poor and the progressives in the reformist 
slot in the political and ideological debate. Most of all, the left showed its 
own activists that there is life after armed struggle, and that the left can at 
least compete on a relatively level playing field for power through elections. 
This had been a matter of skepticism to many on the left in El Salvador and 
elsewhere in Latin America. Somehow, it was always their voters who were found 
ineligible on election day. And when by some miracle the left did win, the 
supposed defenders of the democratic system quickly became its hangmen: 
Guatemala in 1954, Brazil in 1964, Chile in 1973, Haiti in 1992. The Salvadoran 
left took up arms in the 1970s because time and again, either it had elections 
stolen from it or was not allowed to participate in any meaningful fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 It has now come full circle: If the second round next month is freer and 
fairer, and if the left does as well as it should, given the dynamics of a 
concentrated runoff campaign, a major change in Latin American politics truly 
will have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 El Salvador marks other welcome changes: the crucial role played by the United 
Nations in an internal conflict in a region of nonintervention; the decisive 
role played by the United States in promoting peace after encouraging and 
financing war for a decade; the emergence, in the figure of President Alfredo 
Cristiani, of a "civilized" and democratic right in a hemisphere where the 
right has been notable for its lack of such virtues. For the tiny nation in the 
Central American isthmus, all but lost among the hemisphere's larger, stronger 
nations with much less to show for themselves, these are not minor 
achievements.

 As an 8-year-old in Harlem, I lived around the corner from what was considered 
the most notoriously violent block in New York City (West 146th Street, between 
7th and 8th avenues). The weather permitting, on Saturday nights my 
hoodlum-wannabe friends and I would hang out on 146th Street waiting to see who 
would get killed. We were rarely disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
 The killer was usually arrested, charged with second-degree murder and 
acquitted after a brief trial that revealed he was an average, industrious 
(hard-working) Negro who had lost his temper during a craps game and 
overreacted. Although it was a crime for one Negro to kill another in the 
middle 1940s, it was not a very serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Negro ghettos of the 1940s and 1950s were so rife with violence 
resulting in death and maiming that it was regarded as a normal aspect of 
inner-city life and nothing to become alarmed about unless, of course, the 
victim was a friend or a relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Television, the most addictive drug in America, had not yet been introduced to 
the country's underclass and therefore could not be blamed for inspiring or 
encouraging the violence. Neither could the cause of the bloodletting be 
justifiably attributed to the fact that every three or four weeks the local 
movie houses showed films of Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Errol Flynn and Tyrone 
Power ramming swords through deserving villains. In all probability, the common 
occurrence of violence in black inner-city America of the 1940s had little or 
no connection to the coldblooded movie murders committed by Humphrey Bogart, 
James Cagney, George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, et al. Even we children could 
discern film fantasy from reality. 
</P>
<P>
 When today's outraged and appalled parents condemn the media and filmmakers 
for having spawned or influenced America's current horrifying violence 
epidemic, it is not an utterly false accusation. People under 24 have never 
lived in an America where movie dialogue was not liberally laced with 
profanity. Most filmmakers don't know it, but profanity is the language of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie makers gradually introduced profanity disguised as black dialect during 
the period now referred to as the era of "blaxploitation films" (from 1969 to 
1974). "Cotton Comes to Harlem," "Black Caesar," "Shaft," "Across 110th Street" 
and "Super Fly" -- which was probably the most anti-black film made in America 
since D.W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" -- represent the era. In the early 
1970s, cursing on film accelerated with the popularity of the daring profane 
humor of Richard Pryor's "in concert" films. And later with Eddie Murphy's. 
From there, profanity furtively crept into movie and television scripts as a 
bold and hip embellishment.  
</P>
<P>
 A new movie, "Sugar Hill," is an exception. This is an artistically eloquent 
and powerfully dramatic anti-drugs film about a tragically drug-ravaged family 
struggling desperately to maintain its tenuous grip on life. It is also a 
radical departure from the stereotypical warring drug-gang films. The violence 
is graphic but minimal. There is profanity, but only in sufficient amount to 
give credibility to the characters and their environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1940s and '50s, the Saturday-night knifings and shootings in the black 
ghettos were almost always preceded by outbursts of profanity. Usually, before 
an attacker commenced cursing, he was already reaching for his weapon. It was 
not uncommon for the victim to be dead or dying while the assailant was still 
cursing and cutting him.  
</P>
<P>
 In modern-day America, profanity is used more frequently than conventional 
English by many intermediate, high-school and college students and also by city 
dwellers ages 6 to 60. Profanity appears to be making rapid progress on its way 
to replacing English as the official language of the American people. It has 
been irrefutably established as the official language of hip American 
teen-agers for at least the past five years. Many inner-city high-school and 
intermediate-school students, who comprise a significant faction of New York 
City's bus and subway passengers -- I expect it's the same in Los Angeles -- 
appear to have vocabularies that are pathetically deficient. It is truly 
saddening to hear them punctuate sentences, clauses and even phrases with the 
four-letter word for feces.  
</P>
<P>
 We Americans have become a society of violence addicts, and the media, which 
include the movie and music industries, are our drug dealers. They keep us 
amply supplied with a steady stream of Amy Fisher/Joey Buttafuoco, Lorena/John 
Wayne Bobbitt, Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan real-life horror stories.  
</P>
<P>
 Is it too much to hope that "Sugar Hill" is the beginning of a new genre -- 
the humanized action thriller, short on violence and evoking optimal 
compassion, inspiring triumph over oppressive human conditions?

PASSOVER STORIES / AMERICAN FAMILIES AND AN ANCIENT DINNER; MEMOIR; WHY IS THIS 
NIGHT DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER NIGHTS?

<P>
 While growing up, I found Passover Seders nothing less than mind-bending. 
Theatrical, darkly fascinating, full of strange imagery, these ceremonies (the 
pre-meal portion of which seemed to last for days before you actually got to 
eat) constituted a marked departure from our family's customary modest, 
utilitarian suppers. In arranging and performing the Seder, I felt that my 
parents -- my mother in particular -- had mounted a small private opera 
starring familiar foods cast as characters quite different from their everyday 
identities. Certain foods were transformed at Seder from commodities judged 
solely by how they tasted, smelled or looked, into something like props at a 
magic show. 
</P>
<P>
 According to written directions, my mother prepared specific dishes that were 
displayed like museum artifacts on specially designed platters. These foods 
were presented to us not for nutrition's sake or because they were someone's 
favorite, but as illustrations. Because they were visual aids, we were 
encouraged to touch and examine them. On any other night, this would be 
considered playing with food, grounds for being sent from the table. But the 
Seder ritual forced my parents to turn many of their household rules 
upside-down. Since most children are anarchists at heart, my brother, sister 
and I reveled in this revolutionary aspect of Passover -- religion-endorsed 
subversion of parental law. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps, although I would never have thought so at the time, the momentary 
relaxing of their rules in order to facilitate the unexpected gave my parents 
some secret pleasure too. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first precepts to be discarded at Seder was an edict I often ran 
afoul of while I was a kid: No reading at the table. Passover temporarily 
erased Mom and Dad's notion that reading during meals constituted anti-social, 
borderline criminal behavior. Haggadahs, little 60- or 70-page books, were 
distributed at Seder, as part of the place settings. Not only were there what 
seemed like hours of reading from the Haggadah, but everyone took turns hamming 
it up -- praying aloud, orating question-and-answer sessions, declaiming 
blessings or stories full of drama and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seder was my first conscious introduction to the powerful notion of food as 
metaphor. This was a concept that would continue to reverberate in some useful 
-- and other rather regrettable -- ways throughout my life. But that's another 
story. Usually the meaning of the Seder's symbolic foods related to a 
literalization of some aspect of the lives of the biblical Israelites, or the 
story of their flight from Egypt under hotheaded, tongue-tied Moses' 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 At Seder, we learned that the ancient Jews baked matzo-like bread because they 
were in a terrible hurry to escape once they were finally given permission to 
leave Egypt. Our ancestors, we read in the Haggadah, couldn't hang around and 
wait for the dough they'd made to rise. Fleeing for their lives before the 
wicked Pharaoh might change his mind, they made do with unleavened bread. Soft, 
spongy, fragrant loaves were their last concern.  
</P>
<P>
 And when I was young, matzo did seem like a prisoner's version of bread -- 
big, dry, flat sheets too brittle for making proper sandwiches. Although I 
enjoy it now, matzo then looked and tasted to me more like some antique form of 
paper than an acceptable substitute for fresh, seeded corn, rye, or any other 
kind of bread. 
</P>
<P>
 But I knew I was being crass. My personal freedom was vast, circumscribed only 
by things like the fact that my parents limited my dessert intake and told me 
when to go to bed. I was utterly unfamiliar with the kind of oppression we were 
reading about.  
</P>
<P>
 My mother would get tears in her eyes when we got to the parts about 
conditions endured under slavery. She'd say over and over again "We have so 
much to be thankful for, living here in America." I listened, and I knew I 
should pay attention, but her intense emotion at the table made me squirm. I 
concentrated on hoping it wouldn't be much longer before we could dig into the 
dinner that I'd been smelling since late afternoon, now being kept warm in the 
oven. 
</P>
<P>
 Matzo was certainly central. Before and after it, we were presented with a 
parade of cryptic ceremonial foods. A little custard cup on the Seder table 
contained not the usual pale, friendly blob of my mother's 
chocolate-chip-studded tapioca, but salted water, meant to represent enslaved 
ancestors' sorrowful tears. We dipped lettuce or parsley in the salt water and 
took a bite in order to taste those tears.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A mysterious roasted egg and lamb shank sat in their respective depressions in 
the serving dish, lying on top of marks that looked like broken matchsticks but 
actually spelled out their names in Hebrew. The egg had a dichotomous symbology 
-- eternal life, but also mourning, an odd duality I came to regard later as 
characteristic of Jewish temper or thought and maybe even my own, sometimes 
uncomfortable, darkish cast of mind. The lamb shank stood for the lamb 
sacrificed by the ancients on this holiday.  
</P>
<P>
 Poor, shriveled lamb leg and cracked, blackened egg! No one ever, ever ate 
them. They were picked up, spoken about, set down, as though they were plastic 
models. They were not even offered to our dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 We turned another page in the Haggadah and regarded the more palatable 
haroset: diced-up apple, cinnamon, nuts and wine, intended to recall the mortar 
the Jews used as they worked at forced labor. Amazing, I thought, to create a 
food meant to resemble cement, and then to eat it voluntarily! Due to my severe 
allergy to nuts, I was excused from tasting the haroset and did not much regret 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 A dollop of pink or white horseradish called "bitter herbs" conveyed the 
slaves' bitter sufferings. We children made stupid jokes about how the burning 
throat and watery eyes caused by even the tiniest lick of this "herb" was 
indeed a form of torture. 
</P>
<P>
 There were occasionally arguments at the table, although not very heated ones, 
during which our parents would urge one reluctant child or another to taste one 
of these delicacies for the sake of the spirit of the evening, regardless of 
whether our youthful culinary analysis yielded the opinion that the food in 
question tasted "gross." But it made sense that these "foods" were not really 
to be relished. When you took such a morsel in your mouth, it was not to 
satisfy physical hunger, or to get pleasure, but to eat meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the outcome of eating meaning be the growth of belief, I wondered later, 
as an adolescent? Was I chewing and swallowing ideology that would then enter 
my bloodstream? Did my cautious bites of these edible symbols imply some level 
of religious commitment? As I got older, these seemed to become weightier 
questions. I fretted when Catholic friends explained the seriousness of taking 
Communion, worrying about whether I should be participating in the Seder at 
all, since I was unsure about my relationship to Judaism and to God. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Seder, stage directions in the Haggadah continued to instruct 
us to indulge in a host of behaviors my parents would never otherwise have 
permitted or participated in, even beyond reading at the table, or prodding 
food without eating it. For example, the man of the family is bidden to jump up 
from the table and go wash his hands several times during the service. This my 
father did, though during any other dinner his actions would have seemed 
absurd, if not pathological.  
</P>
<P>
 Equally unusual for our teetotaling home was the fact that everyone at the 
Seder table except infants was supposed to imbibe four cups of wine. By my dry 
family's standards, this was a bacchanal. Kosher wine is so sweet it tastes 
like it should be poured over vanilla ice cream. Many children who don't 
usually like the fume-y flavor of liquor gladly drain all requisite glasses of 
this grape-y syrup and whimper for more. I've heard numerous people raised as 
Jews recount tales of the Seder as a night crowned by their first inebriation 
-- a semi-public drunkenness perversely taking place under their parents' 
direction. I've even heard claims that this is how certain persons feel they 
learned to hold their liquor, whatever that means. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another Seder departure from normalcy also had to do with "the fruit of the 
vine" -- the wine set aside for Elijah. A beautifully inlaid metal cup was 
filled to the brim, and the front door of the house was opened to admit the 
spirit of the ancient biblical prophet. Elijah was supposed to visit all houses 
observing Passover and take a token "sip" at each stop.  
</P>
<P>
 My siblings and I stared at the surface of this wine, mesmerized. Every time 
the liquid trembled, we gave ourselves chills of terror thinking about the 
bodiless wanderer who might be trying to slake his ageless thirst right under 
our noses. Whenever my cousin Alan was invited to Seder, he'd invariably 
attempt to jiggle the table leg with his foot without my knowing. Then he'd 
point wide-eyed at Elijah's cup, exclaiming "Look! He's really drinking it 
now!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Elijah factor ran counter to our parents' constant admonitions not to 
waste a crumb or drop of food or drink. It also seriously undermined their 
efforts to steer three children with overactive imaginations and night fears 
away from their natural tendencies to believe in ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Passover story haunted me, like pieces of an intense, 
half-remembered dream. I couldn't stop thinking about the baby Moses set adrift 
on a river in a basket woven of rushes -- or the moment, much later in his 
life, when he tried to impress the Pharaoh's court by having Aaron turn a 
wooden staff into a snake. When was I going to acquire powers like that? I'm 
still waiting, I'm afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as my mother used to get weepy during the sections on slavery, I 
invariably get teary when I think about the 10 Plagues. I don't know why the 
litany of plagues was so moving and scary to me. I did like the idea of 
everything being covered with frogs, especially during certain years when I was 
fond of amphibians and kept them as pets. But the rest of the plagues sounded 
unimaginably horrible, though I obsessively spent an awful lot of time 
imagining that I was experiencing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I've come to realize that the Haggadah's text is part biblical 
primer, part songbook, part storyboard for an evening-length piece of 
interactive performance art, both morbid and joyous. Our Seder ceremony, or 
performance, was always followed by an extraordinary dinner, during which it 
was universally acknowledged that my mother, an excellent and adventurous cook, 
had outdone herself once again. That lovely meal seemed, especially after 
waiting so long with stomachs rumbling, like something to be thankful for.

PASSOVER STORIES / AMERICAN FAMILIES AND AN ANCIENT DINNER; FICTION; LORD GOD, 
KING OF UNIVERSE AND PRESIDENT OF THE MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DORIS SILVERTON, Silverton, who has published several short stories, is 
currently a television writer. This story is an excerpt of a longer piece of 
fiction published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1968.

<TEXT>
<P>
 My mother and father arrived in Los Angeles one afternoon in early September, 
1968. They got off the plane, and it was just as I imagined: My father came out 
the front door -- my mother, the rear. As if they were not related. Then, like 
two lines converging to a center point, they moved toward us. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 65, after a lifetime of uncompromising and dedicated service in 
the world of hardware, my father had sold out. The news of his defection spread 
through the Jewish community of Rushmore Rapids, S.D. Max Weiss, the traitor, 
was moving to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I need sunshine," he explained, as though he were a plant that had been 
living in darkness all these years, reaching out at last for a little light. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother begged and pleaded for him to stay put. A person should think twice 
before making such a drastic change. 
</P>
<P>
 So my father thought twice and then said it was final. He was leaving Rushmore 
Rapids. He was going to retire to California. Then, shyly, and careful not to 
overdo it, he said my mother could come along if she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We waited for my parents behind the wire fence: My sister Phyllis, her husband 
(whose father was president of a small but flourishing movie company), their 
child and I, Harold Weiss. We hugged and kissed and told my mother and father 
that it was wonderful they had come. Then we stood back and looked them over 
and did not admit even to ourselves that they were smaller than we had 
remembered. Small and gray and alien in the bright Southern California day.  
</P>
<P>
 Then my brother-in-law, Mark Berle, Jr., put little Mark Berle III into the 
Mark II Continental with its Mark IV air-conditioner, and soon we were out of 
the airport and onto the freeway, shivering a little in the artificial comfort 
of the big car. 
</P>
<P>
 Fade in, as my brother-in-law would say when he tells me the plots of those 
Grade-Z movies that he and his father produce. Fade in, pan your camera and 
know that it is eight months later and already April. I have been in Berkeley 
all this time trying to turn 10,000 index cards full of anthropological 
observations into a dissertation that goes by the catchy title of "Derivation 
of Personality Variables in a Rice-Growing Village in Northern Thailand." 
</P>
<P>
 But how can I pursue this when I see in my supermarket that the Easter Bunny 
is holding a giant-sized box of Passover matzo? That the exotic-food section 
now displays a Mother Feldman's Frozen Seder that features three pieces of 
chicken, two matzo-balls-with-soup-in-a-plastic-bag, half a shank bone, a sprig 
of pre-salted parsley, and a mimeographed prayer book? 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of sentiment rolls up and breaks into foam within me. With a silent 
apology to Mrs. Feldman and a promise to take a rain check, I put the frozen 
package back and decide that it is time to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I think I am in the wrong apartment. But the lady in the bare feet and purple 
muumuu -- frying a taco shell at the kitchen stove -- assures me that she is my 
mother. I can't believe it. I drop my suitcase and kiss her anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is the novel going?" she says, giving me a big hug. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no time to educate her about what I have been doing for the past eight 
months. She is too primitive in her flowing garment and silver-painted 
toenails. She is all sunshine and summer. Two months early. Even her hair is 
now a remarkable shade of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the corner of my eye, I catch a glimpse of winter. There at the kitchen 
table my father sits in a sweater buttoned up to the neck. Otherwise, he seems 
to be wearing pajamas. It is 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Either he is ready for 
bed or has just gotten up. One way or the other he must be sick. Or is it only 
that he has taken on the 10 years that my mother seems to have shed? 
</P>
<P>
 He is surrounded by newspapers. All from Rushmore Rapids. They are two weeks, 
three weeks, a month old. He is reading them aloud and hardly stops to greet 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let me interrupt," I say, pulling up a chair to join him. 
</P>
<P>
 He grunts, finds his place on the page and continues: 
</P>
<P>
 "Arlo Swenson, age 73, passed away February 10, please omit flowers . . . La 
Verne Hanson, 69, mother of Gracie, Shirley, Warren, Sigmund, sister of Twilah, 
Earl . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 My mother is listening to him with one ear. With the other, she is tuned to 
"The Dating Game" on a small portable television set that sits on top of the 
kitchen counter along with the sugar, flour and other staples. As my father 
approaches the end of the alphabet of the dead, she moves back to the stove and 
transfers the television to the warming shelf along with the salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes me only 24 hours to discover the derivation of personality variables 
in an efficiency apartment in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My father can be summed up on a single index card. Max Weiss: 
once-in-hardware-now-retired-pusher-of-market-basket-reader-of-old-newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother is a longer story: Within eight months of her arrival in Los 
Angeles, she is on a first-name basis with all of the important figures of show 
business. For how can one live in the same place, breathe the same air, tan 
under the same sun, and continue to call them Mister Lancaster or Miss Day, 
Mister Peck or Miss Garland? And especially when she steps on their star-shaped 
faces as she does her errands on Hollywood Boulevard day after day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each morning, while my father stirs his oatmeal into boiling water, my mother 
has been walking down that great street, planting the soles of her straw clogs 
smack on those golden names. Clop! Julie Andrews. She stood next to her at the 
cash register at the Farmer's Market last Thursday. Clop! Clop! Natalie Wood. 
That was who was eating a hamburger at the next table the Saturday before. 
Clop! Clop! Clop! Clark Gable, who is dead but his wife is a lovely person. My 
mother knows this because the real estate man who uses the same accountant as 
Mrs. Gable's lawyer's stockbroker plays tennis with a friend of Mark's. His 
ears were not so big as my mother thought. Mark's ears? No, Clark's ears. He 
feels like a son to her. Clark? No, Mark. And speaking of Mark, he is the soul 
of generosity. Thanks to him and his father, she has seen practically 
everything that is being taped, shot, previewed or sneaked. There is nothing 
like seeing life firsthand. She never realized it all those years in Rushmore 
Rapids.  
</P>
<P>
 She wishes my father would be more interested in these things.  
</P>
<P>
 But my father does not hear. He is already asleep and dreaming. In ordinary 
black and white. On a grainy screen. The way it used to be at the Dakota 
Theater, 35 cents and the kids for a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother is sorry but she cannot make dinner for us tonight. Would we mind if 
she opened a can of chow mein or a carton of cottage cheese? She has to make it 
to a 6 o'clock taping of a show at Channel 11. The master of ceremonies is a 
friend of Mark's. He's very nice but his wife is in a mental hospital. She 
feels very sorry for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have just five minutes," she urges. "Shall I open the chow mein or the 
cottage cheese? I recommend the chow mein." 
</P>
<P>
 Her hat is already on. Her pocketbook waits by the automatic can opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cottage cheese," says my father without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The chow mein is tempting me. But somehow, in some way, I feel I must join 
forces with my father. "Cottage cheese," I declare at last. 
</P>
<P>
 I remind myself that tomorrow is Passover. The reason I came home. Things will 
be in order again for a little while. Tomorrow night my father will not be only 
Weiss-once-in-hardware. But man of the house, head of the table, blesser of 
wine, hider of matzo, donor of the dollar. The way I remember. The way I want 
it to be.  
</P>
<P>
 You see, I am right. My father is up already this morning and dressed for the 
evening ahead. His navy-blue gabardine suit is a little shiny. And his neck 
does not quite fill out the collar of his starched white shirt.  
</P>
<P>
 But his perforated shoes are shined to perfection and he bounces into the 
kitchen humming a rather current tune. He envelops us in a marvelous vapor of 
shaving lotion, pine scent, talcum powder and Merthiolate. All of which combine 
now with the steam of the soup, the scent of the chicken livers, the traces of 
everything that my mother has mashed, mixed, grated and chopped. In this one 
moment, in this two-by-four kitchen of their exile, my mother and father have 
come home.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is a fleeting impression. It fades in the time it takes my father to 
pick up the morning paper, and my mother to switch on the radio news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight . . .," reads my father with great pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight . . .," says the announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . all Southland Jewry will gather at sundown . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . all Hollywood will convene . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . for the traditional ceremony . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . for the traditional ceremony . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . of the Passover Seder . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . of the Academy Awards." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My God!" cries my mother. She claps one hand to her heart as if it had been 
split in two. One part Southland Jewry, one part All Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the matter?" says my father, who looks up, startled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," says my mother, already picking up the phone and dialing what I 
know is Phyllis' number. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whom are you calling'?" says my father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody," she answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go on reading," I urge my father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phyllis!" gasps my mother, cupping her hand over the telephone like a secret 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . which recalls the flight of the Hebrews from the bondage of the 
Pharaoh . . .," continues my father, oblivious, as my mother slowly moves with 
the phone out of the kitchen, down the hallways, and into the bedroom, leaving 
behind her the plastic length of extension cord that connects her like an 
umbilical cord to my sister in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so it finally came to pass that the Academy Awards fell on the same night 
as the first Seder. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, to put it another way, the Seder falls on the same night as the Academy 
Awards. It all depends on where one sits, and the way one looks at it. As it 
turns out, we are going to sit in both places and look at it both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark and his parents are going to the Academy Awards since it is a tradition 
in their family. Phyllis and her 4-year-old are coming to the Seder out of 
deference to my father. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother says that this could happen only once in a 100 years. Phyllis says 
that somebody up there should have prevented it. I have no heart to tell my 
father the truth.  
</P>
<P>
 "How come Mark is not coming?" he asks for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I told you," says my mother, as she removes three place settings from the 
table. "He had to go somewhere with his parents." 
</P>
<P>
 "And where did Mr. and Mrs. Berle have to go?" he presses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to go somewhere with Mark," explains Phyllis. 
</P>
<P>
 We are lined up on the living-room couch, waiting for the sun to sink -- like 
the enemy of old -- into the red sea of the horizon. But the sun refuses. My 
sister chain-smokes and looks poignantly remote. As if she is at the wrong 
place, at the wrong time. My mother keeps looking at her wristwatch and 
complains that the sun sets much earlier in Rushmore Rapids.  
</P>
<P>
 My father informs her that it is the same sun. Also, that there is no hurry 
since we have all night for the Seder. He does not seem to notice that RCA 
Victor is sitting at the table in the place usually reserved for Elijah. That 
the remote-control switch waits on Phyllis' napkin along with the dinner fork. 
Or that the TV Guide lies open on my mother's plate like a supplementary 
haggadah. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the sun sets, and we take our places at the table. In the dark of the 
unlit dining area my father draws himself up to full size and begins the 
prayers. As he does, a pinpoint of white begins to grow in the eye of the 
television. My father raises his arms. He prays in that voice that brings me 
back to my childhood when I was suspended between fear and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ' Boruch atto adonoy elohenu . . . praised be Thou, O Lord our God, King of 
the Universe . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . and president of the Motion Picture Academy . . .," says Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mistake," says my mother. "I didn't mean to have the sound turned on yet. 
Only the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 My father raises his glass of wine. " Boruch atto adonoy elohenu . . .," he 
begins, as the president of the Motion Picture Academy moves his lips in 
perfect synchronization. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little louder?" asks Phyllis. 
</P>
<P>
 " Bore p'ri ha-gofen . . .," booms my father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not you," says my mother. Click! Up goes the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Praised be Thou, O Lord our God . . . who gives us . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Reynolds!" says Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . the fruit of the vine . . .," says my father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still can't hear," complains my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 " Boruch atto adonoy elohenu . . . bore p'ri ho-adomo ," continues my father, 
dipping parsley into salt water and passing it on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only the preliminaries," says Phyllis, speeding the parsley to my 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . who creates the fruit of the earth," says my father. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technical stuff," agrees my mother. "Start the horseradish, Harold." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the table go the technicalities. The parsley, the salt water, the bitter 
herbs. The tears and bricks of 6,000 years that we are going to dispose of in 
three minutes. In order to honor Charlton Heston. 
</P>
<P>
 It is my turn to sing. " Ma nish-ta-no, ha-lai-lo ha-ze . . ." as Joan 
Crawford nominates the first song from a motion picture of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't win," predicts my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joan Crawford has aged," observes Phyllis. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look, I tell myself. My heart is pumping painfully. The vein at the side 
of my head is popping. My father and Bob Hope are swapping stories now and I 
can't tune out. Or stop looking. I am peeking with the eyes in back of my head. 
I am listening with the extra pair of ears I have just sprouted.  
</P>
<P>
 The golden idols are irresistible and I am struck by the childish feeling that 
God knows it. He will come down through the antenna, send holy sparks flying, 
explode the television. Strike us dead! What is the matter with my father? I am 
furious to see how he bends over the table singing and reading and talking only 
to himself. His voice is no more than the static from a competing station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Max . . .," I say, leaning forward to let him know that I, for one, am 
listening to him. That for me, he should speak louder. Take a stand. But his 
eyes are shut tight against me. They are locked, like double doors closing me 
out. Behind them, he is running. He abandons us all. He is not in Los Angeles. 
Not even in Rushmore Rapids. He is across some ocean. Sixty-five years away. He 
is his own father, and father before him. He knows nothing of television, of my 
mother, of Phyllis. Or Harold. He denies us all. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to kick him. It would bring him back. Furious, I slap down the napkin, 
shove back my chair, reach for the television plug. I am God's emissary on 
earth!  
</P>
<P>
 When suddenly I feel my father's hand on my arm. Without a word or a glance in 
my direction, he grips my arm and holds it in place. I know what he is saying 
with his hand. He needs no help, no Harold-to-the-rescue. He knows everything 
that I know.  
</P>
<P>
 And maybe more. His blunt, hairy fingers are humorous on my own hand. They 
telegraph that the world is a funny place, so smile. His thumb is a botch of 
his 40 years at the knife-sharpener. His index finger wags -- for shame -- at 
my own presumptions. The ring finger curls under, squeezed in its circle of old 
gold.  
</P>
<P>
 It allows my mother to reach for her crazy stars another day. As long as it 
takes her. He will survive. She will be all right. Phyllis is not so bad. And 
you, Harold, are not so great. Sit at the head of your own table and do what 
you have to do some day. Don't ask me. Don't need me. Find your own answers. 
Take a wife, produce a child. Then laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 I relax, and after a while my father's head begins to nod and droops toward 
the table. If I don't remove his plate, he will be face down in the salad 
course. I remove the plate, smooth the cloth, wad up the napkin for a pillow.  
</P>
<P>
 His face is turned sideways on the table, his hand has fallen away from mine. 
He smiles to himself at the thought that at least we are sitting at the same 
table. Maybe he is right. At least he is not wrong.

 Before Kevin Costner and Michael Roberts opened their Pasadena restaurant, 
Twin Palms, they invited 480 of their closest and dearest friends to a dinner 
party. The guests admired the resort-like decor. They checked out the two old 
namesake palm trees. And then they helped themselves to a huge buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did they know that they were mere guinea pigs, in attendance to try out 
recipes and give the staff a chance to rehearse. After all, you can't just open 
a 450-seat restaurant without practicing on somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 You certainly couldn't tell it was a rehearsal from the food. Mayor Richard 
Riordan and Nancy Daly, former Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates, actress 
Mitzi Gaynor, actor Esai Morales and the rest of the guests gobbled up platters 
full of grilled sausages with flageolet beans and sauteed apples, rotisserie 
chicken, cassoulet, salt cod mixed with mashed potatoes, and smoked duck 
straight off the grill.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Roberts noticed a few arched eyebrows in the gathering. "It's part of 
the restaurant-opening process," he says. "Not everyone is going to understand 
the cassoulet." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts made his reputation at the former Trumps in West Hollywood with 
outrageous combinations such as roast duck with black beans and pickled 
pumpkin, Brie-and-grape quesadillas with sweet pea guacamole, and plantains 
with caviar. Now he's trying to get people used to his peasant-rustic Southern 
French cooking. "Some criticized my beef shank for not being New York steak," 
he says. "They just don't know a whole lot. This food is not about chef's 
creativity, but about doing things simply and correctly without the attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These deep-fried artichokes were eaten by the handful as if they were popcorn. 
Roberts serves this appetizer with shavings of Parmesan cheese, Kalamata olives 
and caper berries. Baby artichokes -- they range in size from one inch to three 
inches -- are available in most markets now. Buy the smallest you can find.  
</P>
<P>
 DEEP-FRIED BABY ARTICHOKES WITH AIOLI 50 baby artichokes Oil Salt Aioli

</P>
<P>
 Discard stems and tough outer leaves of artichokes. Trim 1/4 inch off top of 
artichokes. Cut into quarters. Heat oil for deep-frying in saucepan. Place 
artichokes in hot oil and deep-fry quickly in batches until crisp and golden. 
Drain on paper towels.  
</P>
<P>
 Place on serving platter. Season to taste with salt. Serve immediately with 
Aioli Dipping Sauce. Makes about 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving, including all dipping sauce, contains about: 365 calories; 264 
mg sodium; 34 mg cholesterol; 34 grams fat; 14 grams carbohydrates; 5 grams 
protein; 1.47 grams fiber.

<P>
 Puree garlic in food processor or blender. Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, salt 
and pepper in bowl of food processor and process until smooth. Add pureed 
garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 With processor running, slowly pour in steady stream of oil. Continue 
processing until sauce is thick, shiny and firm. Cover and refrigerate until 
ready to use. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.  
</P>
<P>
 Note : Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes that 
have been pasturized may be used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. 
Check egg substitute package for applications.

WINE: PASSOVER; KOSHER WINE FOR WINE LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kosher wine has improved dramatically in the last decade, and now the best of 
it can take its place beside the best non-kosher wine. These days, makers of 
kosher wine insist their wines aren't just for Passover anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, kosher wine has not been fine wine. Most of the Jews fleeing 
Eastern Europe 100 years ago came here by way of Ellis Island. And the only 
kosher wine made on the East Coast was a syrupy dessert wine based on Concord 
grapes. As a result, "kosher wine" came to mean something sickly sweet that did 
not go well with any food, but had to be consumed by Seder edict. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Passover Seder is a generally happy meal in which children are an 
essential part of the service. So the children and grandchildren of Eastern 
European Jews grew up with this kind of kosher wine. And though many of these 
second- and third-generation Jews drink only dry table wine the rest of the 
year, they continue to endure the "Tradition of the Square Bottle" (i.e., 
Manischewitz Concord) during the Seder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a saying that if it's kosher it can't be any good," says Peter Stern, 
consulting winemaker for the Baron Herzog line of kosher wines. "It happens all 
the time. I guess the only way (to gain respect) is to have blind tastings." 
</P>
<P>
 A blind tasting proved the point a few weeks ago. At the New World 
International Wine Competition in San Bernardino, a kosher wine proved best in 
its category. The 1993 Baron Herzog Chenin Blanc won a gold medal and the award 
for the best Chenin Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
 Other kosher gold-medal winners at the event were 1993 Herzog White Zinfandel, 
1993 Weinstock White Zinfandel and 1992 Weinstock Chardonnay. A silver medal 
went to Hagafen's 1993 White Table Wine, a blend of Chardonnay and Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Weir, president of Hagafen, admits that he started the winery (with 
former partners Zach Berkowitz, Norm Miller and Rene di Rosa) in 1979 because 
of the dearth of kosher wine made in the United States and the generally woeful 
state of kosher wine made elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt there was an element of cultural pride that could be encouraged," he 
says. But as time went on and he explored the various ways wine could be made 
and certified kosher, he came to believe he could make wine that was the equal 
of any non-kosher wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a few arcane rules about cleanliness and who can do what with the 
grapes and the wine, one key rule is that for a wine to be mevushal, or 
universally kosher (so it doesn't lose its kosher status if a non-Orthodox 
person serves it), it must be heated during production -- a technique that in 
the past would have ruined the aroma of any fine wine. Such wines were more 
broadly marketable than kosher wines that were not pasteurized, but some 
producers, Hagafen among them, felt the heating process too deleterious and 
they rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, within the last few years, it has become possible to make a mevushal 
wine by using a bit of high-tech wizardry. This technique, approved by the 
Union of Orthodox Rabbis of New York. calls for the white wine grape juice, 
before fermentation, to be flash-heated to 175 degrees, pasteurizing the 
liquid. The juice is then quickly re-chilled and a traditional fermentation 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The process seems to actually improve some wines, says Baron Herzog's Stern, 
the top kosher-wine consultant in the business (he also helped make excellent 
kosher wines for three Israeli brands, Yarden, Golan and Gamla). 
</P>
<P>
 Weir was also convinced. He began flash-pasteurizing Hagafen wines in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another California producer of kosher wines, Gan Eden in Sonoma County, makes 
only non- mevushal wines. Since these wines will not retain their kosher status 
if served by a non-Orthodox Jew, the wines are not used in catering events such 
as weddings or bar mitzvahs if the servers are not Orthodox.  
</P>
<P>
 Kosher wine from Israel has had a spotty track record, but Stern says great 
strides has been made in Israeli kosher wine during the last six to eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evolution starts with the grapes," he says. "After the Golan Heights were 
taken in the 1967 war, grapes were planted there, but the only buyer was (the 
large cooperative winery) Carmel." All wines were mevushal , but the technology 
was still primitive, so many wines were ruined before they were even bottled.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, says Stern, the grapes weren't always planted in the right regions 
or grown for fine wine. Then in the late '70s, Cornelius Ough of the University 
of California at Davis visited the Golan Heights and advised growers on 
planting. By 1983, Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon were planted, and the 
Yarden, Golan and Galil brands were developed to compete with Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in 1988, a rare cooperative effort by several producers of kosher 
wine helped sponsor the research of an orthodox enology student at UC Davis, an 
Israeli by the name of Shlomo Rauschberger, who continued to develop methods to 
make mevushal wines more palatable than they had been, and that research became 
widely used by the 1992 harvest.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the leading producer of kosher wines is Baron Herzog, with more than 
130,000 cases being made annually -- more than half sold specifically for 
Passover use, Stern says.  
</P>
<P>
 Hagafen, which focuses on high-quality Napa Valley grapes and ages its best 
wines (Cabernet and Chardonnay) in expensive French oak barrels, now sells just 
6,500 cases of wine, most of it aimed at a more upscale crowd than Herzog. Gan 
Eden, with half of Hagafen's production, also is an upscale brand. Wine of the 
Week 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Hess Select Cabernet Sauvignon ($9.50) -- From the Hess Collection 
winery's second label, winemaker Randall Johnson was able to coax real quality 
from modestly priced grapes through careful blending. This superb vintage has 
an earthy, herbal/cherry aroma with hints of anise and pine. An excellent 
value.

PASSOVER; TASTING NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tradition means a lot in wine, but the results of technology can be exciting, 
and the array of California dry kosher wines I tasted last week proved the 
point convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the phrase "kosher wine" meant a wine that lacked freshness. That 
notion may be completely discarded. The use of flash pasteurization in the last 
few years has meant wines that are so fresh and sprightly in taste that I 
actually feel that some need to age a bit before reaching a peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the kosher wines of the past didn't use the best fruit. Today's 
kosher winemakers are more carefully choosing the vineyards from which they get 
fruit, and the wines I had were not only substantially better than anything I 
had tasted in the past, but were indistinguishable from any other wine. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true for almost all the California kosher wines I tasted, but the 
technology and use of top-quality grapes seems not to have reached other parts 
of the world. The French, Italian and Israeli kosher wines I tasted were not as 
interesting and not as good a value. 
</P>
<P>
 The following wines are highly recommended and will shock those whose only 
previous experience with kosher white wine has been disappointing. They are 
listed in order of overall quality.  
</P>
<P>
 1993 Baron Herzog Chenin Blanc ($6) -- Remarkable taste of leaves and melons, 
a soft entry and crisp finish, a stunning achievement. This is a wine no one 
will dislike and it will match with a huge array of foods. One of the more 
amazing wines I have tasted since it was pasteurized to make it mevushal and 
thus kosher for all occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Baron Herzog White Zinfandel ($6) -- Loads of fruit and berries, a tangy 
aftertaste, and a taste that was not as sweet as I expected. Lovely wine, and a 
lot better than a typical aperitif. 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Gan Eden Winery Sauvignon Blanc ($8.50) -- Spices, green beans and green 
herbs make this a perfectly delightful example of the Sauvignon character. The 
wine is lean and crisp and most appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Mount Madrona Chardonnay ($14) -- Excellent fruit that implies citrus and 
pears with just a bare hint of oak. A superb dry finish with just enough 
richness to expand with richer foods. A marvelous value. Produced as a "second 
label" by St. Supery Winery of the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Hagafen Cellars White Table Wine ($9) -- A profusion of flowers and 
apples, and a racy taste that is slightly sweet and still well balanced. 
Hagafen used to make a Riesling. This appears to be it in disguise, and it's 
better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The following wines are excellent and represent good value for kosher wine 
buyers.  
</P>
<P>
 1992 Herzog Chardonnay ($14) -- Complex scents of butter and fig make this 
wine a little heavier and richer than the Mount Madrona, and may be preferred 
by those who like a more complex wine. However, the fruit is a bit understated. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Baron Herzog Chardonnay ($12) -- Less expensive than the similarly named 
wine above, it offers a little more fruit, but the oak appears a tad obvious. 
Still, an attractive wine worth trying. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 J. Furst Chardonnay ($9) -- This wine nearly hides its kosher statement, 
but it is made by Herzog and it has a good balance of fruit and oak. A wine 
that will be better in a year, but a good value now. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 Hagafen Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon ($18) -- Rich, ripe fruit of black 
cherry and a hint of plum and cedar. The taste is mainly ripe fruit and a trace 
of herbs, far more rewarding than most past efforts with kosher red wine. This 
wine will age nicely, but decanted will be very rewarding now. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Baron Herzog Sauvignon Blanc ($8) -- Not very grassy, but a delicate 
melon and pear aroma and a very dry entry. The wine is nicely balanced and a 
good match with seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 Gan Eden also makes two sweeter wines -- an excellent Black Muscat and a very 
sweet Late Harvest Gewurztraminer -- for those who prefer more sweetness in 
their kosher wines. DAN BERGER

PASSOVER; A MARRIAGE OF TWO SEDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN NATHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Passover Seder, which begins Saturday evening, commemorates the exodus of 
the Jews from Egypt, an event that is still being celebrated in much the same 
way it was more than 2,000 years ago. Jews today still eat the unleavened bread 
(matzo), taste the bitter herbs, ask the four ritual questions, drink four cups 
of wine and open the door for Elijah the prophet to come in and take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are significant differences in contemporary observances of Passover. 
Indeed, the way each family observes the Seder reflects its particular 
background, family history, preservation of traditions and adaptation to 
change. But not until I attended the Seder of my husband's family more than 20 
years ago did I fully realize how different those observances could be. 
</P>
<P>
 Our Seder in Providence, R.I., included the immediate family, invited students 
from nearby Brown University and, often, Christian friends. My parents' Seder 
never began with the meal itself. Cocktails and hors d'oeuvres came first -- a 
startling aberration, I learned later, from Jewish tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came matzo with pickled herring, chopped liver and gefilte fish balls. I 
preferred the herring; the only good thing about the gefilte fish seemed to be 
the horseradish around it. (Years later, when I tasted my mother-in-law's 
homemade gefilte fish, I realized it could be delicious.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Seder began. Our mahogany dining table was set with symbolic 
foods placed on a flat cut-glass plate in the center, my father's silver bar 
mitzvah cup from his native Germany alongside it for the Kiddush (the blessing 
over the wine) and a copy of the Haggadah, the narration of the exodus, on each 
plate. Our Haggadah was invariably a children's version -- short, slightly 
food-stained from Seders past and, most important, in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting next to my father also had its disadvantages. Even though Dad had been 
leading a Seder for 40 years, he was never comfortable with that role and took 
on an exaggerated seriousness that often provoked my laughter. It seemed to me 
that at least every other Seder I was temporarily excused from the table, 
overwhelmed by giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 My late father did not grow up with a Seder. His mother, Grandmother Lina, 
would explain, "My religion is in my heart." Grandpa Rudolph refused even to 
participate in the ritual. But my American-born mother, a woman of Hungarian 
and Polish origin who has always maintained she brought fresh ideas into her 
husband's German family, insisted upon starting married life with a family 
Seder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A deal was made. If Dad would lead an annual Seder, she would learn how to 
make chremselach , a deep-fried fritter filled with raisins and almonds served 
during Passover at his grandmother's home in Germany. Dad carefully planned the 
service -- straight out of the children's Haggadah, his only model. 
</P>
<P>
 For a child, not only the flavors but the rituals make the Seder different 
from every other meal. One tradition was the beautiful Seder plate my mother 
prepared. The roasted egg and the shank bone recall the sacrifices performed in 
the temple in Jerusalem. The chopped apple and nut haroset symbolize the bricks 
and mortar used by the Jewish slaves for Pharaoh's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, the most poignant part of the Passover food ritual was the lifting of 
the parsley, symbol of spring, and then dipping it into salted water in 
recollection of the tears shed by the Israelites during their Egyptian exile. 
</P>
<P>
 After drinking the second of the four cups of wine required by ritual, we were 
ready to eat. Our meal was always an abbreviated version of a menu from "The 
Settlement Cook Book." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The meal began with clear chicken broth in which two light matzo balls and a 
sprig of parsley floated. 
</P>
<P>
 "How delicately light the matzo balls are," Dad would exclaim after his first 
bite. Mom would beam with a sigh of relief. For my mother, an otherwise 
eclectic cook, the lightness of her matzo balls indicated her success as a 
Jewish mother, cook and wife. Thank goodness my husband, Allan, approved of 
light matzo balls as well. Some Jews prefer matzo balls that plummet like 
cannonballs, and marriages have been shattered over less. 
</P>
<P>
 Our main course was a crusty leg of lamb with new potatoes, fresh asparagus 
and green salad. 
</P>
<P>
 "How shocking," a conservative friend once burst out when I described this 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's in the Bible," I insisted. " 'And they shall eat the flesh in that 
night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall 
eat it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Meat may not be roasted for Passover until the Temple is rebuilt in 
Jerusalem," she replied, "since roasted meat symbolizes the sacrifices 
performed in the Temple." Moreover, she added, leg of lamb is not a kosher cut. 
And anyway, a proper Passover meal requires three kinds of meat: a brisket, 
baked chicken and a chicken-veal-beef meat loaf. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother's response to such quibbling was firm. If leg of lamb was good 
enough for "The Settlement Cookbook," it was good enough for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert was chremselach and a kiss torte, a meringue shell with strawberries 
and topped with whipped cream. As far as Mom was concerned, the meringue met 
the Passover requirement that no flour be used. She was not concerned about the 
whipped cream, as we did not observe the separation of milk and meat. 
</P>
<P>
 We rarely finished drinking the third and fourth cups of wine, but Elijah the 
prophet was ceremoniously welcomed each year. The Seder ended when we began 
singing Passover songs, mostly off-key. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband was, however, taken aback by other features of my family's Seder. 
Traditionally and -- perhaps equally important -- according to his mother's 
way, the matzo ball soup should have been preceded by hard-cooked eggs in 
salted water and by gefilte fish. For my part, I was shocked when I learned 
that my in-laws did not consider the kosher Israeli dry Cabernet Sauvignon a 
suitable substitute for Manischewitz sweet. (To the Gersons, wine was not wine 
if it was not sweet.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Gerson family Seder, when I first encountered it, was profoundly different 
with the one I'd grown up with. The story was the same and the matzos were 
still square, but that about sums up the similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 As we entered Allan's parents' apartment in the Bronx, we were welcomed by the 
aroma of chicken soup and a barrage of introductions to his entire family. The 
tiny living room was crammed with borrowed tables and chairs to seat about 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan's mother, Peshka, secretly delighted, moaned over the number of 
relatives attending, all from the same small town in Poland. For weeks she had 
been preparing the gefilte fish (although aunts Ruchsa and Chuma insisted 
behind her back that Peshka's lacked the right amount of almonds and salt). No 
one would think of missing the Seder, even aunts and uncles who had not spoken 
to each other for years. Seating was therefore arranged accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allan's late father, Mottel, conducted the Seder in perfect Hebrew and Yiddish 
and halting English. The men listened, the women hovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Mottel had learned how to conduct a Seder from his father, and Allan learned 
by watching and listening to Mottel. Mottel, a Holocaust survivor, always made 
his annual heartfelt speech in hesitant English, reminding us of the World War 
II Warsaw ghetto uprising as an analogy to the flight for freedom long ago in 
Egypt. He wanted his children to remember their Jewish roots and the horrors 
that befell his family before the Gersons migrated to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Allan and I alternated between attending Seders at his parents' and 
my parents' homes until we had our own children. His father has passed away. My 
father has passed away. Now we create our own traditions, a combination of both 
the cultural and culinary backgrounds of two similar yet very different 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Our three children look forward to our annual Passover celebration the way 
Allan and I did when we were young, although I tend toward a more traditional 
Seder than that of my childhood. The service is left up to Allan, while I focus 
on choosing and preparing special foods. With the help of my mother-in-law, I 
make the light matzo balls and her gefilte fish. Each year, I try different 
kinds of harosets and make sure there are asparagus and strawberries, symbolic 
of spring, as well as my mother's chremselach , as delectable as I remember it 
from my own childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 And each year, Allan searches for just the right words, the special message, 
to make his Seder as meaningful to his children as his father did for him. MY 
FAVORITE BRISKET 1 (5-pound) brisket of beef, shoulder roast of beef, chuck 
roast or end of steak 2 teaspoons salt Freshly ground pepper 1 clove garlic, 
cut in half 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 onions, diced 1 (10-ounce) can 
tomatoes with juice 2 cups red wine 2 stalks celery with leaves, chopped 1 bay 
leaf 1 sprig thyme 1 sprig rosemary 1/4 cup chopped parsley 6 to 8 carrots, 
sliced on diagonal 
</P>
<P>
 Season brisket to taste with salt and pepper. Rub brisket with garlic. Heat 
oil in pan and sear brisket. Place brisket, fat-side-up, on top of onions in 
large oven-proof casserole. Cover with tomatoes and juice, wine, celery, bay 
leaf, thyme and rosemary. Bake, covered, at 325 degrees about 3 hours, basting 
often with pan juices. 
</P>
<P>
 Add parsley and carrots. Bake, uncovered, until carrots are cooked, about 30 
minutes longer. To test for doneness, pierce flat of brisket (thinner or leaner 
end) with fork. When there is light pull on fork as it is removed from meat, it 
is fork-tender. Remove bay leaf, thyme and rosemary sprigs. 
</P>
<P>
 This dish is best prepared in advance and refrigerated so that fat can be 
easily skimmed from surface of "gravy" or cooking juices. Trim off all visible 
fat from cold brisket. Then place brisket, on what was fat side, down on 
cutting board. Look for grain (muscle lines of brisket) and with sharp knife, 
cut across grain. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to serve, reheat gravy either in oven or on stove top. Place sliced 
brisket in roasting pan. Pour hot gravy over meat, cover and reheat at 350 
degrees 45 minutes, adding carrots during last 15 minutes. Makes 8 to 10 
servings.

 The following recipes, from Nathan's just-released "Jewish Cooking in America" 
(Knopf, 1994; 466 pp.; $30) show that Passover foods vary not only from family 
to family, but from culture to culture. Nathan's book demonstrates that Jewish 
cuisine can come from Turkey, Italy, or even from the sophisticated world of 
contemporary American restaurants.

 The dessert fritters called bunuelos are a medieval Spanish heritage of 
Sephardic Jews. "In New Mexico today," she writes, "(bunuelos) are sometimes 
made with a rosette iron, fried and later dipped in a sugar-cinnamon 
combination. In Istanbul, a Jewish recipe that came to Turkey with the 
Inquisition is a matzo bunuelo, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar."

 Nathan writes, "This matzo salad, created at the now defunct Quilted Giraffe

 Nathan got this recipe from cookbook writer Carol Field. "Field's description 
of the food served at a Roman Seder meal," Nathan writes, "which the Italians 
call Pasqua Ebraica (Jewish Easter), is mouth-watering. The Roman feast itself 
includes such dishes as bresaola (air-dried beef served with hard-boiled eggs) 
and carciofi alla giudea (artichokes cooked the Jewish way), and risotto 
containing asparagus, artichokes or fresh peas. Scacchi, a Sephardic layered 
dish like lasagna, called mina in Turkey, with layers of meat and sauteed 
vegetables alternating with matzo, takes the place of pasta and is served at 
the Seder Field attends in Berkeley (Field comes from a fifth-generation San 
Francisco family that arrived with the Gold Rush). Try this dish with or 
without the meat. For garlic lovers who like a lemony taste to their 
vegetables, this is a real winner. " SCACCHI (Roman Layered Vegetable Dish) 2 
pounds spinach, rinsed and stemmed 4 artichoke hearts, cleaned, chokes and 
fibrous leaves removed Juice 1 lemon 12 standard matzos 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon 
olive oil 1 pound chopped ground beef, optional Salt Freshly ground pepper 1 
1/2 pounds onions, thinly sliced 6 cloves garlic, minced 3/4 teaspoon minced 
rosemary 3/4 teaspoon minced sage 1 peperoncino (dried red chile), seeded and 
minced 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 pound mushrooms, sliced 6 large 
eggs 1/2 cup lemon juice 1 cup beef broth or water 
</P>
<P>
 Cook artichokes about 20 minutes in pot with water and juice of 1 lemon. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook spinach 4 to 5 minutes in pot with only water left on leaves. Squeeze 
dry. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover matzos with water in bowl and let sit until wet and almost crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet if using beef. Saute ground beef, 
stirring until no longer red. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Saute onions in large skillet with 1/4 cup olive oil. Drain. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Saute artichokes in medium skillet with 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, 
rosemary and sage. Season to taste with salt. Drain. Set aside. (If using 
canned hearts, cut in half.) 
</P>
<P>
 Saute spinach in skillet with 1/4 cup of olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, 
peperoncino, nutmeg and salt to taste. Drain. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Saute mushrooms in skillet with 1/4 cup olive oil and remaining 2 cloves 
garlic, 3 to 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Grease 13x9-inch baking dish. Add sauteed ground meat. Cover with 1 layer of 3 
matzos. Matzos may fall apart. Cover with layer of onions. Layer 3 more matzos 
on top, alternating with artichokes, spinach and mushrooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Beat eggs together in bowl and add remaining 1/2 cup lemon juice. Pour over 
top of dish. Add enough broth to moisten well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 400 degrees about 30 minutes or until mixture is set and cooked 
through. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

PASSOVER; SATURDAY NIGHT SEDER: PLAN AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY ZEIDLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passover, my favorite of all the Jewish holidays, celebrates the liberation of 
the Jewish people from slavery in Egypt. During the eight-day observance, many 
foods may not be eaten -- such as grains, flour and beans. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Passover with the traditional Seder meal begins on Saturday 
evening, which may present a bigger challenge than normal, since many Jewish 
families do not cook from sundown Friday to sundown on Saturday. This means 
that most of the Seder preparations will have to be made in advance and 
completed before sundown on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 My own planning begins weeks in advance of the holiday since our family 
participates in two complete Seders. Two weeks before Passover the guest list 
is made; usually 25 family members and friends are invited for each evening. I 
plan the menu and make a complete shopping list, including when and where to 
buy everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The first task is to prepare the kitchen, removing all the "forbidden" foods. 
Then it's time to begin shopping for fresh vegetables and fruit. For a Saturday 
Passover, today is a good time to buy a variety of fish to make gefilte fish, 
and to pick up meat and poultry from the butcher. I always include Schmura 
matzo, usually handmade and imported from Israel; it is a must for our Seder. 
Next, a stop at a local wine shop for an assortment of Kosher Passover wines 
from different countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking begins with foods that will keep in the refrigerator until the 
Saturday-night Seder. I grate the horseradish, hard-boil the eggs and make the 
haroset (a mixture of fruit, nuts and raisins), along with the other ceremonial 
foods. Gefilte fish and horseradish sauce keep well and so can be prepared in 
advance.  
</P>
<P>
 This year I will serve a roasted turkey and turkey soup, which can also be 
cooked a couple of days ahead. A good dessert idea is non-dairy chocolate ice. 
Amazingly, it tastes almost like ice cream. Cookies are a perfect 
accompaniment. The cookie dough can be prepared today and the cookies baked 
Friday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 The day before Passover, especially this year, will be a very busy day. The 
table must be set with the special Passover ceremonial plate, the cover for 
holding the matzo and the wine-stained prayer books from Seders past. Passover 
silverware, dishes, napkins, wine glasses and holiday candles should be placed 
on the table. Finally, after a look at my checklist, I will finish the cooking 
and baking. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the preparations completed, just before the Seder begins, I will 
reheat the soup and turkey and, of course, enjoy the holiday with family and 
friends.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: OH, YOU KID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Birrieria Guadalajara is a sweet little place in Long Beach's Wrigley 
District, a Mexican goat restaurant amid a stretch of laundries and diners and 
bars without big-screen TV, in a patch of the South Bay that seems more like a 
small Midwestern downtown than it does like a part of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalajara is split-level and well scrubbed; its customers range from 
stroller-intensive family crowds on weekend mornings to the sort of late-night 
folks who enjoy many, many cans of Modelo with their goat. This is the kind of 
idiosyncratic neighborhood Mexican restaurant we tend to take for granted in 
Los Angeles but miss to distraction when we move: a place with reliable 
carnitas tacos and steak burritos and chips with blender-whirred hot salsa; 
with a banda -stocked jukebox that occasionally roars loud as a Megadeth show; 
with menudo and with home-style tongue in spicy tomato sauce; with ultra-long 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a destination birrieria -- both Birrieria Tepechi in Wilmington and 
El Parian in the Pico-Union area are lots better, but this is a good 
neighborhood place. And it may not be the restaurant for seafood: Ceviche 
tostadas and seafood cocktails have had the funk of iodine about them. A dish 
intriguingly named camarones levante muertos -- shrimp to make the dead rise -- 
involved a half-dozen or so flaccid marinated crustaceans, ghostly white, in a 
chop of tomatoes and chiles and onions and citrus. 
</P>
<P>
 Birria' s always the thing to get in a birria specialty restaurant -- entree 
and supposed hangover cure rolled into one. Here, the goat stew is gamy and 
chile-red, sweet, a little fatty, stripped from the bone, served in a shallow 
puddle of its amplified pan drippings. ( Birria drippings are so delicious that 
certain other restaurants actually serve jugo de birria as a separate course.) 
You season the birria to taste with chopped onions and cilantro and lime; you 
amplify the chile heat with fiery homemade chile vinegar served in a cruet. 
Barbacoa , a similar braise of beef rather than goat, is fine, but somehow too 
bland: Stick to the goat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Birrieria Guadalajara 2336 Pacific Ave., Long Beach, (310) 424-3016. Open 
Monday-Thursday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday, 10 a.m. to 3 a.m., 
Saturday-Sunday, 8 a.m. to 3 a.m. Cash only. Beer and wine. Street parking.

HOME COOK: SPRING IN A BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spirit of spring is here with acres of yellow flowering mustard 
brightening vineyards, orchards and roadsides. Mustard is a valuable friend to 
farmland, planted to nourish the soil with necessary nitrogen. Not only does 
mustard feed the soil and its flowers beautify the landscape, but the tender 
young mustard leaves make a fine spring special -- mustard green soup. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a child growing up in Southern California, my Italian grandmother, 
mother and I would often gather enough mustard greens to prepare the leaves, 
tempered with broth, beans, olive oil, a few aromatic vegetables and the 
intrepid turnip -- a very good soup. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could be the main course of a simple spring meal. Serve it with rustic 
bread, fontina cheese and, for dessert, semolina pudding with strawberry puree. 
The semolina pudding is a lovely old dessert that is seldom remembered, is 
thought to be Italian and is unusual with its delicate cream-of-wheat texture 
and gentle flavor. MUSTARD GREEN SOUP 4 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon 
finely chopped garlic 1 cup chopped leeks or onions 2 cups cooked, diced turnip 
2 cups cooked navy beans 1/2 pound mustard greens or any bitter greens, washed, 
coarsely chopped 6 cups chicken broth Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in soup kettle or pot. Add garlic and leeks and cook over 
medium-low heat, stirring often, until garlic and leeks are tender but not 
browned. Stir in turnip, beans, mustard greens and broth. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Simmer about 15 minutes. Serve hot. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
 Each serving contains about: 354 calories; 1294 mg sodium; 2 mg cholesterol;

SEMOLINA PUDDING 1/4 cup cold water 1 package unflavored gelatin 2 cups milk 
1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup semolina or cream of wheat 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon 
Grand Marnier or any orange-flavored liqueur 1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 Place cold water in bowl and stir in gelatin. Let soften 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Place milk and salt in saucepan. Heat to boiling and slowly stir in semolina. 
Cook, stirring constantly, 5 minutes, or until mixture is thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat and stir in softened gelatin and sugar. Add Grand Marnier and 
beat until smooth and blended. Stir occasionally and let cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat cream in mixing bowl until tender peaks hold. (Do not beat until stiff or 
pudding won't have soft delicate texture.) Fold whipped cream into semolina 
mixture. Cover and chill until set. Makes 6 servings.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hearty breakfasts don't have to be heavy and fat-laden. Consider the following 
recipes. Start with a fresh fruit compote of orange segments, kiwi slivers and 
strawberries in an orange syrup. A frittata of turkey hash is full of flavor 
with a restrained ratio of two egg whites to one egg yolk. The muffins are 
moist with an abundance of diced apples and have a light batter. Serve them 
with steaming cups of coffee.  
</P>
<P>
 The recipes for the compote and the frittata can be easily doubled for a 
crowd; for the frittata, it would be best to cook each recipe in its own 
skillet, making it easier to remove and serve. FRESH FRUIT COMPOTE 2 large 
Navel oranges 4 kiwi Orange Syrup 1 pint strawberries Mint leaves, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Cut flat ends on oranges and stand on cutting board. Remove rind down to flesh 
with sharp serrated knife. Holding orange in hand, cut between membranes to 
release segments. Transfer to mixing bowl. Squeeze membranes over segments to 
release all juice, then discard. 
</P>
<P>
 Peel kiwi and cut into sixths lengthwise. Add to orange. Pour Orange Syrup 
over fruit. Can be prepared to this point 1 day ahead and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse, drain and dry strawberries on paper towels. Remove hulls. Cut in half 
lengthwise, if large. Chill until serving time. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, add strawberries to fruit. Gently toss to mix. Can be mixed up to 2 
hours ahead and chilled. Serve chilled, garnished with mint leaves. Makes 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 109 calories; 2 mg sodium; 0 mg cholesterol; 1 
grams fat; 27 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams protein; 1.45 grams fiber. Orange 
Syrup 1 tablespoon orange zest, removed with zester or fine grater 1/2 cup 
orange juice 1/4 cup water 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 Bring zest, juice, water and sugar to boil in small non-aluminum saucepan. 
Simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. Let cool. Stir in vanilla. Can be made up to 1 
week ahead and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from tasting great, this frittata has the advantage of being ready to 
cook with very little last-minute preparation since the hash can be made a day 
ahead. As with many potato dishes, ketchup is the perfect sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 TURKEY SAUSAGE HASH FRITTATA 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 tablespoons oil 2 
large Idaho potatoes, about 10-ounces each, peeled, cooked al dente and chilled 
2 large cloves garlic, minced 1 medium onion, about 5 ounces, minced 1 celery 
rib, cut into small dice 1/4 large sweet red pepper, cut into small dice 1 
(8-ounce) piece turkey sausage, skin removed, split vertically and thinly 
sliced to equal about 1 cup 1/2 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper 1 egg 1 egg 
white Ketchup, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1/2 tablespoon oil in 10-inch non-stick skillet 
over medium-high heat. Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch dice. When oil is very hot, 
add potatoes. Cook until crisp and golden, about 7 minutes, stirring only 
occasionally to allow potatoes to brown. Transfer to mixing bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Add 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1/2 tablespoon oil to same skillet. When oil is 
hot, add garlic, onion and celery. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until 
vegetables are tender and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add sweet red pepper and 
sausage. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add to potatoes. Toss with 
salt and pepper to taste. Can be made to this point 1 day ahead and 
refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to serve, use fork to froth egg and egg white together in small 
dish. Combine with hash mixture. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy 
stove-to-broiler 8-inch iron skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is very 
hot, add potato-egg mixture, spreading evenly. Cook until underside of frittata 
is medium-brown, about 5 minutes, shaking skillet toward end of cooking to 
release frittata from bottom of skillet. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer skillet to broiler rack about 5 inches from heat source. Broil on 
medium-high, turning as necessary, until lightly browned all over, about 4 
minutes. Slide frittata out of skillet onto warm serving platter. Serve hot, 
cut into 4 wedges. Pass ketchup separately. Makes 4 servings.

 Sprinkled with powdered sugar, these muffins make a good option for tea or 
dessert. Any extra muffins can be successfully frozen, placed single-layer on a 
baking sheet after they have cooled. Once frozen solid, pile the muffins into a 
plastic food bag, securely tied. Then pop this bag inside another food bag 
(also securely tied) to keep the muffins fresh - tasting and to eliminate any 
freezer odors. Thaw in the bag before reheating.  
</P>
<P>
 CHUNKY APPLE MUFFINS 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup oil 1/2 cup low-fat buttermilk 1 
large egg 2 large egg whites 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 medium Granny Smith apples, 
peeled, cored, cut into 1/3-inch dice to equal about 2 cups diced apples 1 1/2 
cups flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon 
cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Place sugar and oil in bowl and combine until smooth, using electric mixer. 
Add buttermilk, egg, egg whites and vanilla to sugar mixture. Mix until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Put apples in separate bowl. Add 1/2 cup flour. Toss apples with flour to 
coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Add remaining 1 cup flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt to 
buttermilk-egg mixture. Combine well. Stir floured apples into batter with 
wooden spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon batter into 15 greased muffin tins or muffin tins lined with muffin 
cups, filling each about 2/3 full.  
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 375 degrees until golden brown and wood pick inserted in center comes 
out clean, about 28 minutes. Let cool in pan set on cooling rack. Muffins can 
be served immediately. Alternately, once cooled, muffins can be frozen up to 3 
months. Serve warm. Muffins can be reheated in 300-degree oven until warm, 
about 10 minutes. Makes 15 medium muffins.

THE BEEF WITH CHICKEN; REGULATION: DO CHICKEN PRODUCERS HAVE AN EASIER TIME 
THAN MEAT PRODUCERS UNDER CLINTON'S USDA? A USDA- COMMISSIONED STUDY SAYS YES; 
A USDA SPOKESPERSON SAYS NO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal slaughter and processing regulations give preferential treatment -- 
and a potential economic advantage -- to chicken producers over beef 
processors, according to a study commissioned by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture last year. The study was never released to the public, but The 
Times has acquired an analysis and summary of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious discrepancy found by the Research Triangle Institute involves 
rules for dealing with visible contamination on carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
 If poultry is contaminated with feces as a result of improper evisceration or 
other errors, then it can be remedied by washing the bird or trimming off the 
problem section. In reality, poultry companies usually opt to wash the fecal 
matter because it is more cost effective. By comparison, red meat similarly 
contaminated must be trimmed; there is no option of washing. The study says 
that this leads to loss of product and time for red meat processors. 
</P>
<P>
 While the disparity has been institutionalized for years, it has caused a 
great deal of controversy at the USDA in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several news reports have suggested that the department is overly sensitive to 
the interests of chicken producers because of President Clinton's close 
relationship to Don Tyson, owner of Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc., the 
nation's largest chicken processor. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA officials deny favoring the poultry industry and say they inherited the 
differing regulations from previous presidential administrations. But critics 
charge that USDA has been slow to institute changes that would equalize the way 
both the red meat and poultry industries deal with fecal contamination of 
carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago the USDA, under recently confirmed Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, 
was grappling with a food poisoning outbreak linked to contaminated, 
undercooked ground beef. As part of its response, a memo was circulated 
throughout the department instructing meat inspectors to strictly enforce a 
"zero tolerance" regulation for any fecal matter on beef carcasses. In other 
words, inspectors were told to cut away any such visible contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in March, 1993, officials at USDA's Food Safety and Inspection System 
were instructed to discontinue formulating a similar zero tolerance policy for 
poultry, according to H. Russell Cross, FSIS administrator at the time and now 
a Texas A&M animal science professor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an April, 1993 memo acquired by The Times, Cross wrote to Kim Schnoor, USDA 
chief counsel, stating, "You and Ron (Blackley, USDA chief of staff at the 
time) requested that (FSIS) take no further action on a policy for fecal 
tolerance for poultry until you had time to review this background 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross, in an interview with The Times, said his agency did not receive 
authority from Secretary Espy's office to proceed with the zero tolerance 
regulations for poultry until December, 1993. It was not until just two weeks 
ago that even a preliminary proposal was announced by USDA.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were never given an explanation for this (delay)," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA spokeswoman Mary Dixon said there were neither official nor unofficial 
attempts to delay formulation of a zero tolerance policy for poultry in 1993 
and that FSIS employees were working on the regulation throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to the issue of zero tolerance, Russell Cross and (former FSIS 
Deputy Administrator) Wilson Horne have zero credibility," Dixon said. "We had 
to force (them) to implement the zero tolerance policy for red meat, a policy 
that had been law for years." 
</P>
<P>
 (Cross left FSIS in February after completing a two-year contract with the 
agency. Horne, who has also been outspoken on the issue, recently retired.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way did any of the aides to Secretary Espy slow down a zero tolerance 
policy for poultry," Dixon continued. "As a matter of fact, when we came into 
office there was no zero tolerance policy for poultry. We had to develop one 
and one was developed and announced on March 9, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly believe we inherited a (meat inspection) system that was left to 
stagnate and facts show that we are trying to move it forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between meat and poultry inspections dates back to 1978 when 
USDA officials allowed chicken processors the option of trimming, washing or 
vacuuming fecal matter from carcasses rather than forcing inspectors to simply 
remove all visible contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The zero tolerance for trimming beef carcasses was always law but not strictly 
enforced until the outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 in hamburgers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As reported last week, USDA announced earlier this month that it would alter, 
but not completely change, the more lenient 1978 regulation for chicken. Under 
the preliminary proposal, federal inspectors will have the authority to send 
birds with visible fecal contamination back for a separate washing or 
reprocessing prior to continuing down the production line. After each carcass 
is rewashed, USDA personnel will determine whether the extra rinse was 
effective in removing fecal matter. If ineffective, then the bird is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The rewashing, critics complain, amounts to a second chance for poultry plants 
to properly process a bird. They argue that the same zero tolerance regulation 
for beef should apply to chicken as well. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA's Dixon said the zero tolerance for chicken proposal will be completed in 
"the near future," though with time for public comment and USDA review, the 
entire process can take more than six months.

 DEAR SOS: To me, the green corn tamales served at El Cholo in Los Angeles 
render other tamales inedible. Can you persuade El Cholo to release the recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- TONY 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR TONY: El Cholo chef Roberto Juarez sent us the recipe, which we first 
printed in 1991. EL CHOLO GREEN CORN TAMALES 12 ears yellow corn 1/4 pound 
cornmeal 1/4 cup shortening 1/4 cup butter 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup half and half

CITY HALL NEWS; 7 ASIAN AMERICANS ON APRIL BALLOT STRESS MAINSTREAM ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her bid to become the first Asian American elected to the Rosemead City 
Council, businesswoman Dolly Leong has spent much of the last few months 
registering more than 1,000 Asian American residents to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of seven candidates from San Gabriel Valley's growing Asian 
American community seeking election April 12 in what could be a political 
coming of age. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Asian community is a third of this city, and it's about time we had a 
voice," said Leong, 57. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the 1990 U.S. Census, almost 17% of the entire valley was of 
Asian descent, and that population is believed to have grown substantially 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese community leaders say they hope to build on successes in last 
November's school board races, when five Chinese Americans were elected across 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Marino, Dr. Allan K. Yung and Alex Tse are bidding to be the first 
minority City Council members. In neighboring Arcadia, Dr. Sheng Chang is 
attempting to become the first minority and Asian American council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park could get California's first Asian American council majority, 
with Judy Chu already on the council, and incumbent Sam Kiang and two other 
Chinese Americans among the six running for two open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian candidates are emphasizing mainstream concerns. "The majority of voters 
are ready to elect a good candidate with a strong stand on the issues who just 
happens to be Asian," said Yung, who lost a council bid in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the elections at stake: 
</P>
<P>
 SAN MARINO: Yung, 53, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, faces Tse, incumbent 
Paul Crowley and contractor Vince Filutze for two seats in a city where one in 
three residents is of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yung, 53, is a 19-year resident of the city and a former Navy commander. He 
said he has become better acquainted with City Hall after attending hundreds of 
meetings and initiating a Neighborhood Watch program. "I've paid dues," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yung says his highest priority is to find ways to boost the city budget to 
insure money for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As of the end of January, Yung had raised the smallest campaign chest -- 
$2,834, compared with Tse's $7,809, Filutze's $3,770 and Crowley's $8,238. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting crime also is the top priority for Tse, 63, a businessman who owns an 
import-export firm. Tse said he would create a citizens crime prevention 
committee to advise the council. In addition, he said, earthquake preparedness 
and traffic problems need to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: Dr. Sheng Chang, 51, faces a steep challenge as one of 11 candidates 
-- including two incumbents -- competing for three seats.  
</P>
<P>
 Chang, a family doctor who plans to raise $26,000 for the campaign, wants to 
save tax money by contracting out more city services and giving his council 
salary to the Police Department. Chang at the last filing date in February was 
the top fund-raiser with $12,687. Ruth Gilb raised $11,763; Celia Kalm, $8,970, 
and incumbent Joseph C. Ciraulo, $5,689. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city is 23% Asian American, retiring Councilman Bob Harbicht said 
that most are newcomers not eligible to vote and that Chang must get support 
across the community to succeed.  
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are incumbent George Fasching, Mary B. Young, Barbara Kuhn, 
Chuck Chivetta, Johanna Hofer, David L. Sheridan and Karen E. Towner. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTEREY PARK: Three of the six candidates -- incumbent Sam Kiang, 44, a 
lawyer and unofficial leader in the Chinese American community; accountant 
Peter Chan, 45, and banker Mitchell Ing, 30 -- are Chinese American. 
Competition in this race for three seats is strong, including incumbents Marie 
T. Purvis and Fred Balderrama and Library Board Trustee Francisco Alonso. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Chinese American candidates say issues are more important than race. 
"Where you stand on redevelopment or the assessment district is (the) more 
important factor," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The large amounts of money in some candidates' campaign chests has become an 
issue. "It's destroying grass-roots politics. It will be interesting to see if 
an election can be bought this time," said Purvis, who plans to spend about 
$10,000. Chan expects to spend more than $30,000; Kang more than $50,000, and 
Ing about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderrama, a Latino, has stayed competitive, netting $36,675 in contributions 
by the start of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSEMEAD -- Leong said she's the candidate for change in a field of five 
running for two council seats. Other candidates include 20-year incumbent Gary 
Taylor and ex-Councilman Jay Imperial.

FORMER CITY WORKER WINS $585,000 IN DISCRIMINATION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Pasadena City Hall and its pocketbook took a stiff blow this week when a jury 
returned a $585,000 verdict against the city in a discrimination lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County Superior Court jury on Tuesday found the city had 
discriminated against a former black administrator, agreeing with his 
assertions that he was unfairly denied a promotion, suffered retaliation for 
advocating employees' rights and was left with no recourse but to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found that the discrimination was the result of city policy. The 
award included $300,000 for pain and suffering, $200,000 for lost wages and 
$85,000 for future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiff Eugene Stevenson, who quit his city job in 1990, called on other 
city employees to stand up for their rights. Stevenson said he is working in 
health administration but declined to provide details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope employees will understand that it might be hard and difficult to take 
this kind of road," Stevenson, 55, of Altadena said in an interview. "But if 
they feel they're unjustly treated there is recourse." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Philip A. Hawkey declined to comment on the case, saying he had 
not been briefed by the city's lawyer. But Hawkey said affirmative action 
reforms and other changes, such as diversity training for managers and minority 
training for promotions, had taken care of problems the city may have had. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have moved aggressively to implement numerous programs that have 
dramatically improved our record . . . in hiring, promotion and training of 
minorities and females," said Hawkey, who became city manager in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey said 61% of people hired by the city last year were minorities and 68% 
of employees promoted were minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, who filed the lawsuit against the city in 1990, claimed racial 
discrimination by the city forced him to resign after working for Pasadena for 
12 years.  
</P>
<P>
 He was acting director of the city's Health Department for 18 months when he 
was passed over for a similar, permanent administrative position. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson quit after he was demoted to supervisor at the Jackie Robinson 
Community Center, a position he had held previously. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson alleged that the retaliation began in the mid-1980s after he founded 
the Pasadena Municipal Black Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's lawyer, Jeffrey Freedman, said he will determine whether there are 
grounds for an appeal.

CLAREMONT LOBBIES TO BAR RELEASE OF RAPIST; PRISONS: AFTER MOBILIZING RALLIES 
OUTSIDE CHRISTOPHER HUBBART'S FAMILY HOME, RESIDENTS ARE MEETING WITH GOV. 
WILSON AND LEGISLATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Claremont residents who swiftly organized last week to protest the parole of 
convicted serial rapist Christopher Hubbart are working to prevent his future 
release in their town. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and community activists met Wednesday with Gov. Pete Wilson, 
who briefed them on California's parole system. His visit followed a two-day 
round of talks in Sacramento between state legislators and Claremont officials, 
headed by Mayor Diann Ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a public seminar is planned next month, featuring speakers from the 
state parole division, the district attorney's office and psychiatric experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to learn about the (parole) system, what we need to know about it, 
instead of knee-jerking around," said Ellen Taylor, president of the League of 
Women Voters, the group sponsoring the seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week, we were into sound bites," Ring said. "I'm into (finding out 
about) real change this week." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The community activity comes days after residents of the quiet college town 
mobilized within 24 hours of discovering that Hubbart, a 43-year-old sex 
offender, was to be released to his parents' home on the Claremont border. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesting his scheduled release March 15, residents quickly prepared signs 
and flyers, got speakers and staged a rally of 250 people outside City Hall. A 
second group of about 60 broke away the next day to picket in front of 
Hubbart's family home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Hubbart committed up to 50 rapes, beginning with 23 in the 
1970s in the San Gabriel Valley and Orange and San Bernardino counties. He is 
also believed to be responsible for a series of sexual assaults and robberies 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted four times of sexual crimes, he was originally scheduled for release 
in Santa Clara County after serving 2 1/2 years of a five-year sentence. 
Instead, he requested a return to his family home in Claremont and was released 
to a parole officer last week amid community uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 But his freedom was short-lived. A psychiatric exam given at the parole office 
revealed that he is still mentally disturbed and he was returned to state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Perry, who heads the parole unit in Claremont, said Hubbart faces a 
hearing within the next 30 days to decide if he should remain in prison for 
another year. Under state law, Hubbart's three-year parole could include up to 
a year in state prison each time a psychiatric exam shows no improvement in his 
mental condition, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state will lose all oversight over Hubbart in January, 1996, when he 
must be released without supervision regardless of his mental condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the way the law works," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is precisely what needs correction, Ring said. "It's like a microwave 
oven. The timer goes off and, bingo, you're out, with nobody there with the 
authority to say, 'I don't think so.' "

STUDENTS STAGE WALKOUT TO PROTEST DRESS CODE; SCHOOLS: MORE THAN 200 MARCH TO 
DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS TO SAY THE RESTRICTIONS INFRINGE ON THEIR RIGHTS. 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP TEEN-AGERS SAFE. 
</P>

<P>
 Wearing baggy pants, crop tops, flannel shirts and hats, Monrovia High School 
students marched to the district office Tuesday morning to protest a dress code 
that bans such clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Monrovia are prohibited from wearing clothes associated with 
gangs, including oversized pants, belt buckles with initials, wool shirts over 
white T-shirts, jackets with sports team logos, blue or red shoelaces and all 
hats. Also banned are T-shirts advertising cigarettes and alcohol, and sexually 
provocative clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dress code has been part of district policy for four years, the 
school recently apprised teachers of it and prepared pamphlets explaining the 
rule to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Before those flyers were even sent out, students staged a protest. More than 
200 of them walked out of class around 9 a.m. Tuesday, gathering at the 
district office about a mile away until buses arrived an hour later to return 
them to school. 
</P>
<P>
 While the California Education Code states that "gang-related apparel shall 
not be considered a protected form of speech," students say Monrovia 
administrators have taken that too far, defined gang-related clothes too 
broadly and failed to include students in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to inflict a dress code on us, and they didn't discuss it with 
us, they just imposed it on us," said Faith Del Regno, a senior wearing a white 
crop top and peace symbol necklace. "They're taking away our freedom of 
expression, and that's in the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Others resent the suggestion that they are involved in gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're mad because they say that because we wear baggy clothes we hide weapons 
in them," freshman Brian Lee said. "Why would we want to bring guns?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Marigrace Fahey, director of pupil services, said the dress code is not 
intended to punish suspected gang members, but to protect students from actual 
gangs who may target them for their clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is not that they're members of gangs, but this is gang attire and we 
don't want them to become victims," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Morlock, whose son Keith participated in the walkout, thinks energy 
devoted to dress code enforcement would be better spent on academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you say they can't wear red and blue, they'll change the color tomorrow," 
she said. "What are they going to do, strip them of clothes and send them to 
school naked? They need to worry about how these kids are being educated." 
</P>
<P>
 Students also take issue with the way dress code infractions are handled. To 
test whether pants are too big, they said, school officials remove the belt. If 
the pants drop, the student flunks the test. 
</P>
<P>
 And some say the code is enforced unfairly, with Latino students disciplined 
more strictly than white students in the same apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not true, said assistant principal Casey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not single kids out by race," he said. "We have to look at kids in 
terms of what they wear. . . . Kids have lost a sense of what's appropriate, 
and most parents don't hassle their kids about what they wear. We've got to 
look at what keeps kids safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Subtle variations in teen attire sometimes escape the adult eye, he conceded. 
Walkout participants said the blanket prohibitions in the code should have been 
negotiated with students.  
</P>
<P>
 Students and administrators met Tuesday afternoon to try to reach a 
compromise.

BRADBURY MAN GUILTY OF MURDERING WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 47-year-old Bradbury man with a history of mental disorders was found guilty 
Monday of murdering his psychiatrist wife. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pasadena Superior Court jury found Corwin Larson guilty of second-degree 
murder in the Aug. 15, 1992, death of Agnes Larson-Kulcsar, 44.The woman was 
strangled and her body dumped in a back-yard trash can at the couple's home on 
Mount Olive Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson, who will be sentenced April 12, could draw 16 years to life in state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 3 1/2-day trial, Larson's attorney, Terry Foster, argued that 
Larson-Kulcsar's death was brought about in part from her husband's worsening 
mental condition. Larson, a former gift-shop owner, suffers from bipolar 
disease, which is also known as manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But deputy Dist. Atty. Nancy Naftel countered that the disease did not prevent 
Larson from recognizing that killing his wife was wrong. As proof, she pointed 
out that Larson initially denied to Sheriff's Department deputies that he knew 
the whereabouts of his slain wife. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Naftel played a 45-minute audiotape in which Larson told 
sheriff's investigators that he followed his wife into the bathroom to prevent 
her escape, pulled out a straight razor, and fought with her as she tried to 
ward him off. Finally, he told police, he grabbed his wife around the neck and 
squeezed until she sank to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Married for 13 years, the couple were in the midst of divorcing at the time of 
Larson-Kulcsar's death. Larson was unemployed. His wife was a Hungarian native 
who once headed the adolescent ward at County-USC Medical Center, taught at USC 
School of Medicine and had a private practice in South Pasadena.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; KILL FREEWAY EXTENSION, PRESERVATIONIST URGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed extension of the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena, 
Pasadena and the El Sereno neighborhood of Los Angeles should be rejected, the 
president of National Trust for Historic Preservation told Los Angeles business 
and community leaders last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Moe, head of the Washington-based organization, called for a shift in 
transportation dollars from cars to mass transit at a Los Angeles Town Hall 
meeting last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed extension from the Foothill Freeway to the San Bernardino Freeway 
would reportedly destroy nearly 1,000 homes, including a number of historic 
buildings. For the last four years, South Pasadena has appeared on the trust's 
list of the most endangered places in America.

TOPICS / EDUCATION; ELECTION CREATING SCHOOL DISTRICT INVALIDATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1992 election that created the San Gabriel Unified School District was 
ruled invalid this week, leaving the fledgling district's future in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane L. Wayne tentatively ruled Tuesday that 
the state Board of Education should have allowed Alhambra voters to participate 
in the election that resulted in the secession of San Gabriel from the Alhambra 
City And High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the San Gabriel district unified two years ago, it still enrolls its 
1,300 high-school students in the Alhambra schools. Ninth-grade students are 
scheduled to attend San Gabriel Unified's new Gabrielino High School in 
September, at what used to be Jefferson Intermediate School. San Gabriel has 
always had its own district for kindergartners through 8th-graders; the 1992 
vote added high school education. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the conversion, a $29-million bond issue is on the ballot April 12. 
A similar bond measure failed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any plans for a San Gabriel Unified high school can't go forward," said Mia 
E. Montpas, an O'Melveny & Myers attorney handling the case for the Alhambra 
district against the state. "If San Gabriel wants another unification vote, it 
must include the people in the Alhambra district." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's tentative ruling held that it was unconstitutional to deny Alhambra 
voters a say in unification when the secession would significantly affect their 
district through loss of students and state revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel's unification would cost Alhambra $1.8 million in state money tied 
to the 1,300 high-schoolers it gets from San Gabriel. State board officials 
were unavailable for comment Tuesday. But an attorney for San Gabriel Unified 
said Wayne's tentative ruling was issued before oral arguments Tuesday and the 
judge had promised to reconsider the issue before a final decision this week. 
Pete Carton said Wayne made the promise after learning this is the first time a 
unification vote has been challenged afterward and that the invalidation of the 
district would leave no school agency in San Gabriel because the elementary 
district was dissolved as part of the unification vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Wayne) issues this tentative decision, it will cause five elected 
officials to be thrown out of office and a whole bunch of people to be 
unemployed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carton said if the ruling stands and the state does not appeal, Joseph 
Crawford, the district's assistant superintendent for business services who has 
joined the suit, would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel officials said next month's ballot measure would be unaffected by 
the legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra school board and district officials heralded the tentative victory 
Tuesday. "This is a very favorable decision if she keeps to the tentative 
ruling, which is practice," said Dora Padilla, an Alhambra school board member.

TOPICS / ENTERTAINMENT; LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE TO GET EIGHT-SCREEN MOVIE COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, La Canada Flintridge residents will be able to go to the 
movies without leaving the city. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-screen cinema complex will be built near the intersection of the 
Foothill (210) and Glendale (2) freeways, thanks to an agreement reached last 
Thursday between United Artists Circuit Inc. and developer Gary Zentmyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the $5-million multiplex, which will seat 2,218 people, is 
scheduled to begin next month on the site of an old Chevrolet dealership in the 
400 block of Verdugo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition crews began clearing the site this week for the 30,000-square-foot 
facility, which is expected to open for the Christmas movie rush this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest commercial development in the city for 30 years," 
Zentmyer said. In addition to the multiplex, the seven-acre project will 
include small fast-food restaurants, retailers and a Park-and-Ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project fills such a need (that) three different movie chains made 
offers," Zentmyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council and Caltrans, which owns the land, approved the project last 
spring. Zentmyer has a 55-year lease on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada will use state transportation funds to help pay for the 
Park-and-Ride lot. The site will be served by RTD downtown express buses and 
possibly a Glendale shuttle bus.

TOPICS / BUSINESS; MONROVIA SEES WORLD VISION LOSS AS OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a silver lining to Monrovia's loss of 525 jobs in the announced 
departure of World Vision U.S. -- the city will probably get property taxes 
from the tax-exempt charity's nine buildings, totaling $180,000 a year, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, World Vision's departure will open up a piece of prime property -- a 
30,000-square-foot building along the Foothill Freeway near West Huntington 
Drive. City officials have high hopes for the corridor, which includes plans 
for an ice skating arena, Claim Jumper restaurant and Smith's Food and Drug 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very saddened that they're going," Mayor Robert Bartlett said. "But I 
think they also have some of the prime real estate in Monrovia. It won't be 
hard to market those properties for future development and put them on the tax 
rolls." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 15, World Vision officials announced plans to sell its buildings and 
leave the area for Seattle, citing the high cost of doing business in Southern 
California. World Vision, the third-largest employer in Monrovia, expects about 
260 employees to make the move to Seattle. World Vision also owns a building in 
Pasadena and one in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they mourn the loss of the internationally known charity 
but look forward to getting tax-paying businesses in the nine World Vision 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That allows us to bring in another high-quality employer who provides 
high-quality jobs to our residents," said City Manager Rod Gould. "That 
stimulates the local economy and generates substantial tax revenue. It could be 
we look back in five years and say, 'That wasn't such a loss but an opportunity 
we just realized.' " 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision officials said more than 30 callers already have expressed 
interest in some of the nine buildings. World Vision hopes to get as much as 
$14 million for all of the buildings by January, 1996.

COVER STORY; A MAN AND HIS MISSION; THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NEVER THOUGHT A DEVOUT 
PARISHIONER WOULD STAND UP TO ITS PLANS TO REACH OUT TO THE ASIAN COMMUNITY -- 
UNTIL EDDIE RAMIREZ CAME ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each morning, Eddie Ramirez slides a well-worn holy card into the left pocket 
of his shirt, snugly over his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The card depicts El Santo Nino de Atocha, the Mexican Child Jesus, whom 
Ramirez credits with saving his life when as a teen-ager he was given six 
months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 72, Ramirez isn't shy about whom to thank for his recovery from 
tuberculosis or the success that once seemed elusive to the son of immigrant 
cannery workers. Phrases such as "Praise Jesus" and "Thank the Lord" issue from 
him in loud, continual exclamations. In his dining room stands a makeshift 
altar complete with Bible, rosary and lighted candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everyone who knows him, including his pastor at St. Thomas Aquinas 
Church in Monterey Park, thought until recently that Ramirez would have sooner 
missed Sunday Mass than challenge the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the past six weeks, Ramirez has metamorphosed from pious parishioner to 
strident critic. He led the fight against the Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles' plans to turn his parish into a center for evangelical outreach to the 
Chinese community -- and wrung apologies and concessions from church leadership 
that at first flatly refused to change its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos, who dominate the membership at St. Thomas Aquinas, saw the outreach 
plan as an effort to take their church away from them, despite vows to the 
contrary by the archdiocese. The Latino parishioners were especially concerned 
because the plans called for transferring Father Brian Cavanagh, the one priest 
who spoke some Spanish, to bring in two Chinese-speaking priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fighting this takeover," Ramirez said. "It makes us feel that we're not 
important, that we've been denied representation as Spanish-speaking people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is still fighting, despite several compromises made by Cardinal Roger 
Mahony 11 days ago during a surprise visit to St. Thomas Aquinas: Cavanagh 
would stay on temporarily, the cardinal said, and parishioners would be 
involved in the outreach plan. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mahony's visit, some opponents pledged to work with the new priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Ramirez. That Sunday, he walked up to Mahony and called him a Pharisee, 
invoking a Biblical parable about hypocrites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus is on our side, and the Cardinal is not being righteous," Ramirez said 
one morning last week, sipping coffee in his home. "This is only buying more 
time, and it's a lot of rhetoric. I don't see anything of substance." 
</P>
<P>
 he archdiocese has had equally harsh words for Ramirez, whom it accuses of 
inflaming passions and spreading rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reading I get is that most of the parishioners are quite happy," said 
Father Gregory Coiro, director of public affairs for the archdiocese. "But 
there is this core group with Eddie Ramirez as their spokesman who are 
determined to get their own way." 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting Friday with Mahony, Ramirez softened his words. He won't stop 
fighting for his people's rights, he said, but he will watch to see what the 
church has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's fight against the archdiocese isn't as out of character as it might 
seem for a devout Catholic. In 1970, long before affirmative action became a 
household phrase, Ramirez ran for governor in the Democratic primary against 
Jesse Unruh, who lost to Ronald Reagan in the general election. Although 
Ramirez knew he would not win, he entered the election to draw attention to the 
plight of Latinos, whom he believed were not adequately represented in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing 6-foot-1, with blue eyes and brown hair combed straight back, Ramirez 
cuts a striking figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has charisma, he can convince and motivate people," said Monty Villajin, a 
fellow parishioner at St. Thomas Aquinas. "We really appreciate what he did for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is used to beating back obstacles to achieve his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Sacramento to Mexican immigrants who worked in canneries, Ramirez was 
the only one of 11 siblings to receive a formal education. When the family 
moved to Los Angeles, Ramirez enrolled at Roosevelt High School, where he read 
so fast that teachers sent him to the library during reading lessons so he 
could plunge ahead on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said he was one of about five Latinos to enroll at UCLA in 1940. 
Always good in math and science, he decided to become a pharmacist. To make 
ends meet, he sold fruits and vegetables door-to-door in East Los Angeles, 
lugging wooden crates filled with produce. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943 he developed tuberculosis and was sent to a Sylmar sanitarium, where 
doctors saw abscesses the size of silver dollars on each lung and gave him six 
months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 But "our heavenly father had other plans for me," Ramirez said. His pious 
mother brought him a novena of the Santo Nino de Atocha, the Child Jesus. He 
said the prayers for nine days and sensed the tide turning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the presence of Jesus," Ramirez recalled. "I cried like a baby. I knew 
I was going to get well." Six months later the doctors told him his lungs were 
completely healed. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later he tried to return to college -- this time USC -- to finish 
his degree. When he was told there was no room for new students because the GIs 
returning from World War II had priority, Ramirez went back to his car and 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
 God spoke to him again, he said, as always at pivotal moments throughout his 
life: "The Lord lightened me up. He said, 'You're not a new student, you're a 
re-entering student.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez got out of his car, marched to the front of the line and told the 
clerk he was a re-entering student. He got priority over the GIs. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning his degree in 1951, Ramirez worked for others for two years, 
then decided to buy the drugstore where he had shined shoes as a child. He 
married a friend of his sister. He and his wife, Delores, have six sons and a 
daughter. All but one work as health professionals -- doctors, nurses, 
pharmacists. The youngest studies creative writing at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, the family moved to a newly built home on a Monterey Park bluff. It 
was mainly white and Latino then; today most of their neighbors are Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said Catholic clerics often visited his Boyle Heights pharmacy for 
free medicine, including the nuns from St. Vibiana parish Downtown, where 
Cardinal Mahony lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would tell my staff, 'Don't you charge my nuns,' " Ramirez recalled. "We 
took care of the priests for a long time too, but now they have insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) remembers the Ramirez pharmacy as the 
hub of neighborhood life. "It was the place where people would congregate and 
talk," Torres said. "He really had his finger on the pulse of what was going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, whose friendship with Ramirez goes back decades, called the pharmacist 
"a man of conscience, of deep faith and compassion" and said he is not 
surprised at Ramirez's full-bore attack on the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he feels there's a problem to be remedied, he seeks a solution to it," 
Torres said. "I have always admired that of him; he is an inspiration to young 
people to never give up a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's activities in Democratic politics go way back. In 1949, he 
campaigned for Edward R. Roybal, the first Latino elected in this century to 
serve on the Los Angeles City Council and later the House of Representatives. 
At the time, ignorance about Mexican Americans ran so high that another 
councilman reportedly introduced Roybal as "our new Mexican councilman who also 
speaks Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez helped rally the Latino vote for President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 
election campaign and was rewarded with an invitation to the LBJ ranch, where 
he met Johnson and shook hands with the president of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Ramirez ran for Congress. Then in 1970 came his run for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexican Americans will no longer sit silently and idly by while being 
bypassed by calculating and manipulating politicians," Ramirez told a local 
newspaper that year. 
</P>
<P>
 In campaign speeches, he railed against the gerrymandering of political 
districts that split the Latino vote among Los Angeles County districts and 
diluted their political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez now jokes ruefully that he was 20 years too early. In 1990, a U.S. 
District Court judge ruled that Los Angeles County supervisors had 
discriminated against the county's 3 million Latinos in drawing district 
boundaries that fragmented Latino neighborhoods. Redrawn boundaries created a 
new, predominantly Latino 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Ramirez nearly died from a hematoma of the lumbar plexus that put 
him in a wheelchair until he could learn to walk again. But his usual willpower 
and belief in God pulled him through. 
</P>
<P>
 "You resign yourself, you say, 'Jesus, I love you, I'm ready,' but it wasn't 
my time yet. The Lord had something else for me to do. And now I know what it 
is," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said that during his recovery, Father Cavanagh visited him at least 
three times a week at home. The two grew closer, but Cavanagh never dreamed 
that Ramirez would one day rise up against the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never a rabble-rouser," Cavanagh said this week. "He'd be the last one 
you'd think would do that. Eddie has always had a reputation for being an 
ultra-religious man. The only outspoken thing he had was religious language . . 
. People joked that he was trying to take the priest's job away, using all 
those religious metaphors." 
</P>
<P>
 The church's announcement about its plans for Chinese outreach brought 
Ramirez's dormant rabble-rousing instincts back to the fore. Close to 75% of 
the church's 1,200 families are Latino; about 20 families are Chinese American. 
Yet, Latinos and several Asian Americans complained, the church was 
transferring a beloved priest who could minister to members in Spanish and 
erecting a Chinese Community Center on the church grounds that few in the 
congregation would use. 
</P>
<P>
 The church reassured the parish that all Latino-oriented ministries, such as a 
Spanish Mass and Spanish prayer groups, would continue and that the move was 
meant to add to the parish, not push Latinos away. One of the new priests also 
speaks a little Spanish, the archdiocese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez emerged almost overnight as leader of the parish unity group 
protesting the changes, even though he had little experience in church politics 
and had only recently joined the parish council, a group of lay people who 
advise the pastor on issues that concern the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't sit down and vote him into office; it just came out that way," said 
Alfred Valdez, a parishioner who has long been active in church affairs. "He's 
a very devoted man. He's the most outspoken of all of us and has very good 
experience in how to get through to the media." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ramirez continues to wage his fight, his phone rings all day long and he 
switches fluidly from English to Spanish as he updates parishioners on the 
effort to thwart the archdiocese's plans. Most evenings are spent in prayer 
meetings or strategy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In CNN sound bites, Ramirez argued in his forceful, staccato style that it was 
ridiculous to remove a priest who could say Mass, preach and minister to the 
people in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped organize demonstrations in which hundreds of angry congregants 
marched in front of St. Vibiana Cathedral, carrying signs that read: "Why our 
parish, we want answers" and "How much will it cost to buy our church back?" 
</P>
<P>
 He framed the issue in political terms, accusing the church of bullying 
Latinos because it believed they wouldn't dare challenge the authority of their 
religious leaders. He said archdiocese attempts to reach out to the Chinese 
were having the opposite effect, as several prominent Chinese American 
parishioners vowed to leave the church over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters did their best to illustrate that St. Thomas Aquinas was already a 
multicultural church, where people of Filipino, Mexican, Chinese and Italian 
heritage worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the archdiocese stood firm, saying the church was not a democracy 
and the outreach plan was needed. But the controversy refused to die; it 
reached ever higher as local politicians, including Chinese Americans, offered 
support. In the past six weeks, Ramirez said his group has bombarded Mahony's 
office with 500 letters and hundreds of phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony, during his surprise visit to St. Thomas Aquinas earlier this month, 
apologized for not bringing parishioners into the decision-making process. In a 
letter read in English, Spanish and Chinese, the archdiocese agreed to back off 
its initial plan and create a planning committee to be chaired by Bishop Gabino 
Zavala, the new regional bishop for the San Gabriel Valley. Zavala will appoint 
nine parishioners -- three Latinos, three whites and three Chinese Americans -- 
to plan outreach to the Chinese community. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanagh will stay on as co-pastor until June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, however, wants a Spanish-speaking priest full time at St. Thomas 
Aquinas instead of a priest who visits each Sunday for Spanish Mass. 
Ironically, Ramirez now wants someone fluent in Spanish, unlike Cavanagh, who 
can minister to Latinos in their own language but considers himself far from 
fluent. And he wants to make sure any community center built on the church 
grounds would be open to all parishioners.  
</P>
<P>
 The man who took on the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and won at least a partial 
victory has no doubts he will succeed. Failure is not a word that exists in his 
vocabulary. And besides, he says, the Lord is on his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never felt we were going to lose," Ramirez said. "I've always felt, 
I'm going to do this and I'm going to give it my best shot."

 MINOR EVENT? Who is better on the baseball diamond, football players or 
basketball players? Wednesday, the football player was smiling. Damon Allen, 
former Cal State Fullerton quarterback and a veteran star of the Canadian 
Football League, struck out Michael Jordan in a minor league game in Sarasota, 
Fla. . . . Allen is giving baseball two months before deciding whether to go 
back to football. He says he didn't even know his victim was Jordan until he 
returned to the dugout.

 OLD BATTLE: About everybody in Orange agrees they can point with pride to the

signs. Councilman Fred L. Barrera says of the proposed new name: "It has a 
certain pizazz, but I think we have a lot more important things to worry 
about."

 NAME CALLING: Former Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) is accusing 
acting Secretary of State Tony Miller of using his duties "as a partisan 
sledgehammer to harass Republicans." He even suggested the governor should 
replace him. . . . What was the heinous crime? Miller denied McClintock's 
request to be called "taxpayer advocate" on the ballot in the race for state 
controller. The ballot designation is supposed to reflect a candidate's 
principal profession, and Miller routinely rejects "taxpayer advocate," except 
for tax lawyers. McClintock, who now works for an anti-tax group, vows to sue.

 AND THEY'RE OFF: The off-track betting facility at the Ventura County

longtime horse racing fans from 11 a.m. to noon tomorrow. . . . Now 87, Longden 
retired in 1966 as history's winningest race-rider with 6,032 victories. He led 
most of his 32,000 races and other jockeys joked they didn't know what he 
looked like from the front. "Pound for pound, he was the greatest athlete that 
ever lived," said historian Biff Lowry.

VENTURA HIGH PRINCIPAL AND AIDES REASSIGNED; SCHOOLS: OFFICIALS HOPING TO 
IMPROVE IMAGE OF THE CAMPUS WANT A TEAM SKILLED AT DEALING WITH THE MEDIA. BUT 
SOME TEACHERS AND STUDENTS CRITICIZE THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Concerned about Ventura High School's image problems, school officials 
announced Wednesday they are reassigning the principal and some of his deputies 
to other posts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move is drawing criticism from some teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Jerry Barshay will transfer next fall to a newly created position in 
Ventura's adult education program. He will be replaced by Balboa Middle School 
Principal Hank Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Assistant Principal Diane M. Wootton, who has been at Ventura High 
School 28 years, is scheduled to go to the local continuation high school. 
</P>
<P>
 And Helena Torrez-Reaves, another assistant principal who is a favorite among 
Ventura High students, is the top candidate to replace Robertson at Balboa 
Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole reason for the shake-up, Ventura Unified School District Supt. Joseph 
Spirito said, is to bring Ventura High a management team skilled at dealing 
with the media and able to improve the public perception of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you want a change in direction, you change leadership," Spirito said. 
"What I need at Ventura High School right now is somebody who can go in there 
and deal with the perception of the school and be open to the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High School has had to struggle against the perception that it is 
inferior to its cross-town rival, Buena High, ever since Buena was built in the 
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura High's longstanding image problem has been aggravated by a spate 
of recent, highly publicized incidents that included the stabbing death last 
year of school football player Jesse Strobel near the school on a Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the slaying occurred off campus and after school, it fueled community 
fears that the school was not safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last year, Ventura High's longtime football coach, Harvey Kochel, was 
convicted of having sex with a 15-year-old student. And this year, swim coach 
Dale Hahn was suspended without pay because of similar allegations involving 
sex with students. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more recently, a small group of Ventura High students has been involved 
in racial fights, mostly at after-school basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this string of problems, some teachers and students said Ventura High 
administrators should not suffer the consequences for the school's poor image. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some incredibly bad luck," said David Hess, a Ventura High history 
teacher and student-government adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number of teachers believe the shake-up will benefit the school, 
Hess said, "There are some people that feel the administration is being 
scapegoated." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students also agreed that Ventura High administrators should not take the 
heat for the recent incidents. "I don't think they should blame them for the 
school's problems," said 16-year-old Alexis Pate, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Student morale at Ventura High was low last year after Strobel's slaying, 
Alexis and other students said. But they said the mood on campus has improved 
significantly this year. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the changes are not intended to punish Ventura High 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito said he believes Robertson will be better than Barshay at improving 
the school's public image because he is well-known in the community and skilled 
at dealing with the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Affable and well-liked by his colleagues, the 58-year-old Robertson taught 
chemistry and math for 12 years at Buena High before becoming assistant 
principal and then principal at Balboa in 1977. He has three sons who all 
graduated from Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Barshay has a similar number of years in education, including some in 
adult education, he came to Ventura only three years ago from the San Gabriel 
Valley, where he was also a high school principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito said Barshay and the rest of the school administration have not done 
enough to counteract bad publicity over the suspension of Hahn or other recent 
incidents. "I felt that there should be more open communication," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barshay said state privacy laws had constrained him from talking publicly 
about the Hahn and Kochel cases. "There's been some very difficult personnel 
situations at this school that I've had to deal with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite school officials' contention that the shake-up at Ventura High is 
needed to spruce up the school's image, some parents said they could not care 
less what the general public thinks about the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care that we have a bad image because I know the school is doing 
good," said Paula Ward, who has had three children attend the school. Ward 
added that she believes one reason for the school's poor image is it has more 
minority and low-income students than Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Ward said, perhaps changing the administration will help change 
public perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we won't know till we try it," she said.

FILLMORE MAY HAVE TO DEMOLISH RESERVOIR; WATER: A STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF THE 
QUAKE DAMAGE CAN BE REPAIRED. CITY IS HOPING FOR EMERGENCY FEDERAL FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1.5-million-gallon reservoir in Fillmore is in such precarious condition 
after the January earthquake that the city may have to demolish it, officials 
have learned. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the financially strapped city must go forward with a study to 
determine if the reservoir can be repaired, there is no guarantee Fillmore will 
receive emergency federal funds to pay for the repair work or for the study, 
staff members told the City Council Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the risks, the council unanimously approved a $12,000 study that will 
determine whether the reservoir can be retrofitted at a cost of $140,000 or 
replaced at a cost of $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The study should be finished within a month, city staff said. Then, unless the 
council approves more extensive studies, the city will send the results to the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, and wait. 
</P>
<P>
 And wait. The funding process can last up to two years, staff members said, 
during which time the city may be without one of its three reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, Fillmore may have to do without two reservoirs, since the 
city's oldest reservoir also requires repairs that will shut it down for at 
least a month, said Bert Rapp, the city's engineer.  
</P>
<P>
 With one reservoir out of commission, the city's water supply could face a 
serious shortfall in the event of a devastating fire or a major power outage, 
Rapp said. With two of the three reservoirs empty, residents might be required 
to temporarily scale back water use until at least two were operational, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But until FEMA mails those checks, there's not much the city can do.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's out of our hands," Rapp told the council. "Our application's in, along 
with every other city affected by the disaster, and we're waiting for them to 
fund us."  
</P>
<P>
 The city's reservoirs, known as Reservoirs 1, 2 and 3, hold 5.5 million 
gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoir 1, burrowed deep in the earth, is made of concrete and was built in 
1917. The Jan. 17 earthquake opened cracks in the reservoir's walls and now its 
1 million gallons of water are seeping into the surrounding structure, slowly 
corroding the structure's steel reinforcements, Rapp said. The reservoir's roof 
also sustained about $2 of damage per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because of the problems with Reservoir 2 -- the one in immediate 
crisis -- the city cannot risk draining the older storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoir 2, built in 1967 to the 1959 engineering codes, was deemed so 
unstable after the January quake that it was completely drained. It now sits, 
like an upside down metal can, on a hill at the north end of Central Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Reservoir 3, which was constructed in 1991 and holds 3 million gallons of 
water, weathered the earthquake with no major structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members say they are reasonably sure FEMA will give them about 
$700,000 toward the repair and retrofitting of Reservoir 1. Some of that money 
should arrive in the next few weeks and could go toward repair of basic 
damages, Rapp said.  
</P>
<P>
 But $560,000 of the $700,000 may not be available for two years, Rapp said. 
When the check does arrive, city staff has suggested that the council could use 
that money toward replacing the 75-year-old facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A city report states that, if Reservoir 2 is filled and another major 
earthquake occurs, 1.5 million gallons of water could course down the hillside 
and into the heart of town, endangering lives and property. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir has several structural problems, including a leaking service 
line and a foundation whose downhill rim has dropped five inches lower than its 
uphill rim. Even the empty structure may not be stable, engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Scott Lee said he found that possibility disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we in danger now of it falling over?" he asked Glen Hille, an engineer 
retained by the city to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're in less danger now than you were" before the water was drained, Hille 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will keep the reservoir shut down until the study is done, Rapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapp said he hopes the study finds that the city can do some initial repairs 
on the facility so that it will be functional while officials wait for FEMA 
funds. However, he said there is a good chance the reservoir is beyond even 
interim repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is the case, Rapp said, city officials hope the study makes the 
situation so dire that FEMA speeds the money as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a black hole," Rapp said. "You just throw your applications in 
there."

A FRESH START; NEW SALVATION ARMY SHELTER OFFERS MORE THAN A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emmett and Patricia Wade's one-room apartment at the Salvation Army's new 
shelter for homeless families in downtown Ventura is tiny, but that doesn't 
matter to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmett Wade recently landed a job as a teacher's aide and his wife is getting 
help kicking her drug habit so she can care for their 14-month-old son, Emmett 
Jr.  
</P>
<P>
 They are saving money toward a deposit on permanent housing and getting mental 
health counseling. With the help of workers at the shelter, their lives are 
moving from the chaos of homelessness to a more stable environment, Emmett Wade 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to keep optimistic," he said. "There are good people still out there to 
help you toward your goal." The Wades are one of eight families who have 
quickly filled the Salvation Army's shelter in the six weeks since it opened. 
All eight apartments reserved for families and a dormitory that can house up to 
nine women are full, said Anthoula Sullivan, the program's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41 beds have become a precious commodity in a county where housing for the 
homeless -- particularly families -- has becoming increasingly rare. Besides 
offering private space for families, the program provides an array of services 
to residents: child care, psychological counseling, job training and meals 
served family style three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were amazed," said Patricia Wade, a recovering heroin addict who is 
getting counseling and methadone treatments as part of the shelter's program. 
"It was, like, "Wow, this is wonderful.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Word-of-mouth communication about the shelter's bright, modern facilities, 
private apartments and generous services has spread quickly among the homeless 
and in the social services community, said Joyce Jenkin, case manager for the 
transitional housing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkin has been taking up to 20 inquiries a week about available space and has 
started compiling a folder of applications from prospective tenants, she said. 
The demand has forced Jenkin to be picky about who she will admit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look to see if a person is tired enough of what they have been doing to 
change," she said. "Sometimes people are not willing to give up the destructive 
behaviors in their life." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents pay 30% of whatever income they are receiving toward rent and agree 
to set aside any extra money toward a deposit on permanent housing in a trust 
fund set up by the Salvation Army. There are other rules: no smoking, no 
drinking and a 10 p.m. curfew on weeknights. 
</P>
<P>
 For those willing to abide by the restrictions, the shelter represents a 
chance to concentrate on pulling their lives together, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our residents come from all over," she said. "They were living in the 
streets, in their cars, along the river, in motels and with family and 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army approached the city in 1991 with the idea of transforming 
the charity's aging headquarters at 155 Oak St. into a shelter for homeless 
single women and families. Then it took two years to raise the $628,000 needed 
to modernize the 6,000-square-foot building, Salvation Army officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura agreed to give the Salvation Army a $200,000 grant for the 
expansion project; the remaining money came from state grants and donations. A 
onetime, $1.3-million federal housing grant will cover operating costs through 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation Army officials and Ventura Mayor Tom Buford are scheduled to 
formally celebrate the opening of the shelter at a dedication beginning at 3 
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 4,000 homeless people live in Ventura County. But the Ventura 
shelter is the only center for homeless families to open anywhere in the county 
since the Zoe Christian Center in Oxnard closed last year. It is one of two 
shelters for homeless families -- including one run by Project Understanding -- 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army's goal is to give homeless people job training and 
counseling while they are at the center so they can become self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents can stay about six months, enough time to become stable, learn 
budgeting and save some money for a deposit on housing, she said. The Wades are 
well on their way to reaching that goal, said case manager Jenkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're one of our 'look-good' couples," she said. "Emmett has a job now and 
they are working on their personal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Emmett Wade, 39, said his family became homeless after he lost a job at a 
group rehabilitation home in May, 1993. Wade, his wife and their infant son 
bounced around different shelters, stayed with friends and even lived in their 
car for a short time before coming to the Salvation Army shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after moving in, Wade got a part-time job as a teacher's aide at 
Cabrillo Middle School in Ventura. With two years of college already completed, 
he is now taking courses at an adult school to get his teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 Living at the shelter "alleviates some of the stress," Wade said. "It makes it 
easier for me to pursue my goal so I never end up in this situation again." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Wade, also 39, said the counseling she has received at the shelter 
gave her the courage to give up her heroin habit. She is now receiving 
methadone treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary coming off drugs," she said. "But I know at least here I have a 
chance to do it. Out there (on the streets), I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Child-care workers at the center also help her take care of Emmett Jr., 
Patricia Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never trusted anyone with my baby before," she said. "But it's kind of like 
a family here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkin acknowledges that not all shelter residents are success stories. Many 
of the homeless struggle with long-term problems involving alcohol or drugs and 
come from troubled families, she said. Center officials have asked one resident 
to leave because he would not abide by the shelter's rules, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking them to change their entire way of being," she said. "That is 
incredibly hard."

CITY PLEDGES UP TO $400,000 FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fillmore City Council has pledged up to $400,000 toward development of a 
60-unit, low-income housing project -- the largest low-income development the 
city has ever helped finance, Fillmore's city manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex is intended to house former residents of the Fillmore Hotel left 
homeless when the earthquake-shattered building was demolished last month.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the residents have received federal housing vouchers that expire after 
18 months. The planned completion date for the townhouse project is October, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. which has built low-income housing 
projects across Ventura County, would develop the complex in conjunction with 
Del Investments, a development firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's vote Tuesday night "is a giant, positive step," said Ernie 
Morales, a former Fillmore City Council member who is president of Cabrillo's 
board of directors. "This has been a big void for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said because of the extreme lack of low-income housing in Fillmore, 
some landlords neglect their properties, secure in the belief that no matter 
how rundown their properties may become, their tenants have little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are living in unsafe, unhealthy, illegal conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council originally considered the project at its meeting two weeks 
ago. At that time, however, Councilman Roger Campbell raised concerns about 
committing so much money to the project when other earthquake-ravaged buildings 
downtown need repairs. Council members postponed a vote on the project while 
city staff put together a preliminary list of quake-related expenses to help 
the council set spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, with the new list on the table and Campbell having gone home early 
to nurse an ankle he broke the week before, the council approved the 
expenditure by a vote of 4 to 0. The council had already agreed informally 
about a year ago to commit $300,000 for construction of 13 low-income housing 
units in an 88-unit complex to be built by Del Investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Del officials say in light of residents' urgent need for low-income 
housing since the earthquake, they will shelve the 88-unit complex and work 
with Cabrillo on the 60-unit townhouse project. The city will contribute 
$100,000 more because some of the cost will be picked up by federal grants and 
special bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's money will be leveraging approximately $20 on the dollar," said 
Jesse Ornelas, Cabrillo's manager for the project. "That in and of itself is a 
tremendous investment in the community."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HEAVY RAINS EXPECTED TO REACH AREA TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A slow-moving Pacific storm is expected to hit Ventura County late today, 
packing 2 to 4 inches of rain and sending temperatures dipping into the 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm, which is creeping slowly down the coast and expected to hover over 
the county until mid-day Saturday, may help salvage what county officials said 
has been an off year for rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good storm this size could help what has been a pretty dismal situation," 
said John Weikel, senior engineer at the Ventura County Flood Control 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has received only 68% of the normal rainfall for this point in 
the rainy season, which runs from October to the end of April, Weikel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said today's storm, while not expected to be the largest of the 
year, is unusually potent for so late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major storm which is going to bring thundershowers and a 
significant amount of snow to the mountain areas," said Dion Hamilton, a 
meteorologist at the National Weather Service. "We usually don't have storms 
this large this late in the rainfall year." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to heavy rain, snow is expected at elevations as low as 3,000 
feet, and temperatures should drop from the low 60s early today into the upper 
50s Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton warned that the cold weather and low snow levels could hamper visits 
to the mountain areas and that people planning to drive at higher elevations 
should be prepared for the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast prompted the American Red Cross to open its emergency warming 
shelter at the National Guard Armory in Ventura. The shelter has already been 
open 102 nights this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm is not expected to cause any major flooding, Weikel said, but 
thunderstorms could cause problems in areas hit by the November wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Weikel said sandbags and other flood control measures taken by the Ventura 
County Fire Department are still in place in burn areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher temperatures and dry weather are expected to return Sunday, Hamilton 
said. MATTHEW MOSK

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; CATS' HERO, WITH ALL THE 
TRAPPINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elyse Mayberry is perched in a van in a near-empty Chatsworth parking lot, 
staring ahead at a row of chain link fences and inhaling the wet, warm scent of 
cat food that fills the van. 
</P>
<P>
 She is waiting, as she has for many evenings in the past 25 years, to hear the 
metal snap of a cage spring shut behind one of the thousands of feral cats that 
roam Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since she banded together a small group dedicated to helping the 
wild cat, Mayberry and her volunteers have trapped at least 700 cats to be 
spayed, neutered, vaccinated and relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayberry, who had always thought of herself as a "dog person," started feeding 
wild cats on the studio lot when she worked for 20th Century Fox in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, when Mayberry worked on the Warner Bros./Columbia Picture lots, a 
studio colleague showed her how to trap cats so they could be neutered and 
vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, C.A.T.S. Inc., or Cats At The Studios, received its state 
and federal nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, Mayberry figured, if anyone wanted to give donations they could 
write it off on their taxes. Until then, volunteers had been paying for all the 
cats' food and medical treatment from their own pockets. They still pay for 
much of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips to the veterinarian are predicated on having enough money to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayberry, a small woman with close cropped gray hair and black framed glasses, 
retired in August from her marketing research job at the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 C.A.T.S. has branched out as well, trapping unwanted cats at industrial and 
business parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they trap, they trap in a humane manner," said Gary Olsen, general 
manager of the city Department of Animal Regulation. "They take the animal out 
of a pretty serious environment. They inoculate the animal for disease, care 
for the animal and relocate the animal into a better environment -- better not 
only for the cat but for the community, for the human population." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Chatsworth complex, Mayberry and colleagues have trapped 27 cats and 16 
kittens in eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't that many left now," Mayberry says as she lifted a plastic water 
bottle to her mouth. "There are only about seven.' 
</P>
<P>
 But those seven are only remotely interested in the traps containing a buffet 
of cat treats on this weeknight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we have to resort to Pioneer Chicken Strips. It has to smell really 
different. They won't go into the trap for dry food," Mayberry says. "Sometimes 
we resort to catnip and they get so carried away, they roll in the trap and 
spring it." 
</P>
<P>
 But tonight even Chicken McNuggets aren't working. Mayberry's two traps are 
silent. Sherri Robinson, a volunteer sitting on the other side of the complex, 
is also having a slow night. 
</P>
<P>
 A dark cat that has been loitering near the cage stretches his body to nearly 
twice its length and munches from the cage, his feet still inches from the 
spring that would ensnare him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get in there you little sucker," Mayberry hisses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cat backs away, his mouth full of chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Another trapper had offered to catch the unwanted cats, but Mayberry believed 
the trapper would have killed them. "Some people think it's kinder to kill. But 
if you asked the cats, I think they'd opt for freedom," Mayberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapped kittens are tamed and given to adoptive families. But after five 
months in the wild, most cats are truly feral. Mayberry tries to find these 
cats homes at stables, where they can put their rat-catching abilities to use 
and where they don't need to be tamed. 
</P>
<P>
 But no cats are signing on tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're going to have to do is get mean and not feed them one night," says 
Mayberry, who, with Robinson, makes sure the cats eat every night. "It breaks 
your heart to do that."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK PARK; STUDENTS' PLAY DRAMATIZES THE PAIN OF LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for the sound of muffled crying, the audience was quiet as Oak Park 
High School students depicted the sorrow of AIDS, made worse by the abandonment 
of friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 During the performance -- one segment in an hourlong "psychodrama" dealing 
with death and other emotional loss -- the AIDS patient reacts to the 
loneliness of isolation with a plea for understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at me, I'm a person," says the character, portrayed by Oak Park 
sophomore Erin Rogers. "See me for who I am, not what this disease has made me 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, her friends return to her side, expressing and then disposing of the 
fears that made them run away unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 One friend asks, "I want to help her, but is it OK if I touch her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Through the performance, about a dozen Oak Park High School students brought 
their roles as peer counselors to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The play provided a vehicle for the peer counselors to address loss, through 
death, divorce, relationship breakups or diminished self-esteem. In one 
segment, the actors use interpretive dance to express the loss of innocence to 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 High school junior Sara Carmona, one of the dozen students who helped write 
the drama, said she wanted to ease loneliness after loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I want people to know they're not alone in that everyone has losses," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Audience reaction to the Tuesday night performance at Oak Hills Elementary 
School attended by about 250 parents and students revealed that the drama was 
successful in depicting the universal nature of loss and grieving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was incredible," said junior Mita Padhi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exactly what I've been feeling," said junior Jennifer Nelson as she 
wiped away tears after the performance. "It hit the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final skit, the students acted out the five stages of grief: denial, 
anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am just in awe of their capacity to feel -- to the depths they do and with 
the sensitivity they do -- the emotions surrounding this topic," Wilkoff said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SCHAEFER TRAILS ROBINGS IN FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidate Madge L. Schaefer has raised $5,848 
since the beginning of the year, while opponent H. Jere Robings reported a cash 
total of $13,770, including a $10,000 personal loan, according to recent 
finance statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were among several Ventura County candidates whose campaign finance 
statements were received Wednesday by the county elections office.Other 
candidates' reports were available earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer's single largest contribution of $1,800 came from the Public 
Employees Assn. of Ventura County. The former supervisor also loaned her 
campaign $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his $10,000 loan, Robings received contributions of $500 from 
various individuals and property management firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery, who is seeking the 
supervisor's seat being vacated by Vicky Howard, reported a single personal 
loan of $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial statements from two candidates for county auditor-controller also 
were received Wednesday. Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, who reported $2,256 
cash on hand at the beginning of the year, showed no new contributions, and 
accountant Clifford Wigen reported a single personal loan of $5,027. A 
financial report from accountant Richard Morrisset had not been received by the 
elections office. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, County Clerk Richard Dean, who is seeking reelection, reported 
a single personal loan of $7,943, while his opponent, Daniel Schmidt, raised 
less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for county tax assessor, incumbent Glenn E. Gray loaned his 
campaign $5,889 and reported no other contributions. His opponent, Jack 
Tingstrom, raised less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White, who is competing for the judicial 
seat left vacant by retired Superior Court Judge Edwin M. Osborne, reported 
total cash contributions of $4,150. The finance report of defense attorney 
James M. Farley, White's only opponent, was not immediately available. CARLOS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STATE VFW HONORS POLICE DETECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year's Simi Valley Police Officer of the Year has become this year's 
California Outstanding Law Enforcement Officer of the Year in the eyes of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
 The VFW named Simi Valley Detective Gene Hostetler winner of the statewide 
honor, putting him in contention for the J. Edgar Hoover Gold Medal in a 
nationwide competition that will be concluded this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great honor; I'm really happy about it," said Hostetler, 45, a 22-year 
veteran who joined the Simi Valley department in 1982. "It's something to be 
proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler will travel to the statewide VFW convention in Riverside in June to 
receive his award, which carries a $500 cash prize, said Dick Hlebasko, 
chairman of VFW Post 10049 in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler and 19 other contestants from around California submitted scrapbooks 
to the VFW containing copies of their resumes, training certificates, 
commendations and newspaper clippings detailing their careers, said Chuck 
Holden, the group's state chairman for honoring law officers and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had everything going for him," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said the VFW judges were impressed by Hostetler's detective work and by 
the breadth of his career, which began in 1972 with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said judges were also impressed that Hostetler organized baseball games 
between Simi Valley officers and residents of South-Central Los Angeles after 
the 1992 riots, which followed the acquittal of four white Los Angeles police 
officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney G. King. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; DISPUTE ERUPTS OVER MINUTES OF 
MEETINGS

<P>
 Tensions between Thousand Oaks' feuding politicians and top city officials 
have flared up again, in a dispute over how council meetings should be recorded 
for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
 During a heated debate late Tuesday night, Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman 
Jaime Zukowski argued that the city clerk should include brief summaries of the 
reasons behind each vote, instead of merely reporting the action taken. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo denounced that proposal as a 
waste of time, insisting that the minutes should be concise records of policy 
decisions. Anybody interested in tracking the debate, they said, could use 
other sources. The city keeps audio tapes of council meetings for a decade and 
stores videotapes for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the argument was City Clerk Nancy Dillon, who has worked in 
that post for a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an ongoing fight about the record of a Feb. 1 meeting, the council 
has not approved any minutes in more than two months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon acknowledged that the minutes have fluctuated over the past several 
months, sometimes listing the reasons for each vote and sometimes simply 
recording the final tally. She said the different approaches reflect the 
writing styles of the three employees who take turns preparing the minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo distributed to the council, Dillon asked that the city clerk "not be 
placed in the difficult position of selectively including or omitting council 
member comments, or subjectively interpreting" the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics aside, she noted that preparing condensed minutes takes 15 hours of 
uninterrupted staff time. Typing up a verbatim transcript could nearly double 
that workload, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Tuesday night meeting stretched toward midnight, the council members 
agreed to leave control of the minutes in Dillon's hands. She said she would 
review the contested record of Feb. 1, but otherwise would continue to submit 
minutes that could vary depending on the writer. STEPHANIE SIMON

SCOTT HARRIS: A SMALL FILM FEST WITHOUT THE 'F-WORD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Hollywood had made "Seasons of the Heart," the villain would have been more 
vivid. Jed and Martha Richards, pioneers trekking across the Old West, would 
have lost their little girls to outlaws or "Injuns," not illness. And the old 
preacher who matches the grieving couple with an orphan boy, he'd be a rascal 
-- an Elmer Gantry type, perhaps, with an eye on the pretty young wife. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deborah G. Hofstedt, the minivan-driving Mormon mother of three who wrote 
the screenplay, never felt pressured to put sex or shootouts into this tale. 
Feature Films for Families, a budget-conscious studio based in Utah, doesn't do 
it Hollywood's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seasons of the Heart," then, was an apt beginning for a new film festival set 
in Santa Clarita, a suburban haven beyond the north rim of the San Fernando 
Valley that prides itself as a great place to raise the kids. The Santa Clarita 
Valley International Film Festival, which closes today, has no film racier than 
PG. As organizer Chris Shoemaker puts it, you might hear a "damn" here and a 
"hell" there, but you won't hear "the F-word." 
</P>
<P>
 But please, please, don't think this is a conclave of prudes and Puritans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," Shoemaker confides, "I thought 'The Crying Game' was great." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker is wise to be diplomatic. The Bible Belt and Hollywood have long 
been at odds, and now a Democratic Administration is telling the film and TV 
industry to clean up its act. But if Santa Clarita's film festival is to 
achieve its aim -- to promote the production of quality family entertainment -- 
it needs to win over the movie makers, not the moralists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to proselytize," Shoemaker says. "We're trying to open up a 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with "family values," of course, is defining the terms. Whose 
values? Whose family? Shoemaker and his wife, Suzanne, who make their living 
producing live entertainment, say the idea is to explore those questions. A 
family film, they suggest, could feature a gay couple who want to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shoemakers conceived the idea for a film festival in August with Mitch 
Matovich and his wife, Patty Dee. Matovich, 66, had a career in aerospace 
before embarking on his celluloid dreams. His first production was "I Don't Buy 
Kisses Anymore," a G-rated love story. 
</P>
<P>
 They share the conviction that movie makers are letting down a huge audience 
that wants more and better films that parents would feel comfortable sharing 
with their children. Why is there so much profanity, violence and sex? Why 
doesn't Hollywood take more of a cue from the huge box office of such films as 
"Aladdin" and "E.T."? How about another "Field of Dreams"? 
</P>
<P>
 This being Oscar week, it seems safe to say that much of Hollywood was utterly 
unaware of Santa Clarita's answer to Cannes -- and, no, there aren't topless 
beaches up here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Stone and Steven Seagal didn't make it to this festival, but directors 
from as far as China and Poland came to showcase their works. Friz Freleng, the 
creator of Bugs Bunny, was honored for lifetime achievement. Jerry Mathers, the 
erstwhile "Beav," presided over a panel on child actors. Dean Jones, who used 
to drive "The Love Bug," participated on the "Morality and the Movies" panel. 
</P>
<P>
 This panel also provided a platform for film critic Michael Medved, whose book 
"Hollywood Versus America" takes The Biz to task for exploiting the dark side 
of human character. Other panelists included advocates of more descriptive 
ratings to inform parents of a movie's content, such as L for profane language 
and N for nudity. To them, it's a matter of truth in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 After a screening of "Seasons of the Heart," actress Leigh Lombardi agreed 
that wholesome sometimes seems like a dirty word in Hollywood. "I don't see 
enough roles like this," said Lombardi, who played the grieving Martha. The 
actress admits to a sci-fi flick she hopes her mother never sees. "But this one 
she's showing to her church." 
</P>
<P>
 "Seasons," with its strong Christian theme, was made for video and is sold by 
mail order. Alas, it didn't get much exposure here. Only six people attended 
the 5:30 p.m. screening.  
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter Hofstedt, who happens to live in Santa Clarita, brought her 
9-year-old daughter, Bonnie. I'm pretty sure that Hofstedt and Chris Shoemaker 
would disagree about "The Crying Game." But both long for a day when the local 
video store features a wall devoted to quality films they could pick up with 
peace of mind -- and not just kids' fare, but movies that parents would enjoy 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, it's easier to find a section labeled "adult," most of which is 
produced just down the quake-damaged freeway in the big, bad Valley. Utah, it 
ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least truth in advertising isn't a problem. Just look at the video 
boxes.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CLASS' SPANISH PLAY CAN CREDIT FIRM 
DIRECTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, parent Gretchen Milligan realized with panic that the student 
play she was directing at Mound School in Ventura might not come off. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-grade students in the play were goofing off during rehearsals and 
had not memorized their lines, Milligan said. So, she and teacher Virginia 
Barrison did what theater directors often do to whip their casts into shape: 
"We yelled at them." 
</P>
<P>
 It apparently worked. When the cast of more than 30 fourth-graders in 
Barrison's class performed their play before parents and students Wednesday, 
they not only knew their lines but delivered them with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorizing the dialogue was particularly difficult in this case because the 
play was a Spanish-language version of the Cinderella story. And most of the 
students began learning Spanish only last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Cinderella" production, performed Wednesday evening at the school along 
with two other plays by fourth-grade classes, marked the first time that Mound 
students have acted in a Spanish-language play, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficulty of memorizing their lines in Spanish, some of the 
student cast members said there are certain advantages to performing a play in 
a language that most of your audience can't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we made a mistake, it wouldn't matter," said 10-year-old Alyson Schuster, 
who played Cinderella's wicked stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Alyson and other students in Barrison's class have been learning Spanish since 
last fall, when Milligan, whose daughter is in the class, began volunteering as 
a language instructor for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the benefits of knowing a second language, Milligan and 
Barrison said Spanish instruction helps children to better understand 
California history, a subject taught to all of the state's fourth-grade 
students. "The Spanish were here first," Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Spanish came, however, there were Native Americans. And one of 
the other two plays performed Wednesday at Mound touched on this aspect of 
California history. Carol Aulich's class acted out a Native American legend 
called "Guasuita and the Gift of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Another class performed a shortened version of the musical, "Peter and the 
Wolf," which, of course, has no connection to the state's history. But teacher 
Mary Spirito, who directed her class in this play, said students benefit from 
acting in any type of school production. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the idea of getting on stage and performing and feeling they can do 
it," she said. "They remember it more than anything in their whole school 
days." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; SAFETY CAMPAIGN TO FOCUS ON HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-mile stretch of Pacific Coast Highway in Ventura County that has been the 
scene of many fatal traffic accidents and hundreds of collisions is the focus 
of a regional driver safety campaign to be kicked off Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal, state, county and private agency representatives will hold a news 
conference at 10 a.m. Friday at Vista Point next to Mugu Rock to unveil a 
television, print, radio and billboard campaign, said Staci Morse, a 
spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol's Ventura station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything we can do to reduce the number of fatals and overall accidents out 
there is obviously a good thing," Morse said, referring to the stretch of the 
highway from the Los Angeles County line north to Point Mugu. "If we can 
prevent even one fatal then we have done good work." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 people have died on that stretch of the road since 1989, with the 
most recent fatal accidents occurring Jan. 7 and Feb. 12 when motorists' cars 
careened off the road near Mugu Rock, CHP statistics show. There have also been 
more than 1,400 collisions and more than 1,100 injuries on the curvy, undivided 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The media campaign, organized by a consortium of federal, state, county and 
private agencies and groups, is financed in part by a $280,000 grant from the 
National Transportation Safety Administration, said Rick Holland, a spokesman 
for the California Department of Transportation. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; LOCAL AGENCIES LIKELY TO GET GRANT MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai-area-based agencies should receive the bulk of $95,268 in federal funds 
promised to the city after the Jan. 17 earthquake, the City Council said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen nonprofit groups and agencies have applied to share Ojai's 
Community Development Block Grant money, but only a few of the requests will be 
funded, City Council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just not enough money to go all the way around," Mayor Steve Olsen 
said after a public hearing at a City Council meeting late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley said the city should award the funds to nonprofit 
agencies that serve Ojai-area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to make some really hard decisions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the money already is earmarked for various projects, including up to 
$28,000 to administer the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups applying for the funds include countywide service organizations such as 
the Salvation Army, Ventura County Mental Health Services and the Assn. for 
Retarded Citizens. But local agencies more likely to be funded include 
Interface, The CREW and Help of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 After the public hearing Tuesday night, the city staff was directed to draw up 
recommendations for a final decision next month. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DISTRICT EMPLOYEES RECEIVE PAY RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura school board has approved a 1% pay raise and 4% bonus for 
teachers, in addition to boosting the salaries of all non-teaching employees, 
including the district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises will be retroactive to the beginning of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 For most teachers, the 1% raise will amount to only a few hundred dollars, 
boosting the annual base pay for beginning teachers from about $22,890 to 
$23,120 and the salaries for more experiences teachers from about $47,500 to 
$47,970. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime 4% bonus will amount to between $900 and $1,900 for most teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also granted a 2% raise to all non-teaching employees, from bus 
drivers to assistant superintendents. Also, non-teaching employees who are not 
in management will get a onetime 1% bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 And the salary of Supt. Joseph Spirito will rise by nearly 12% over the next 
three years, going up by $3,255 each year for a total increase of $9,765. With 
the boost, Spirito's base salary will rise from $84,091 to $93,856 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he will earn $9,886 in stipends. Like other district employees, 
he gets a $500 stipend for his doctorate and additional pay for length of 
service. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN TO BE ARRAIGNED OVER WIFE'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old Ventura man who was arrested for allegedly shooting his wife in 
the hand as she tried to call 911 for help will be arraigned in Ventura County 
Municipal Court Friday morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police arrested Robert Velasquez on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon and spousal abuse late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez and his wife, Regina Velasquez, 23, were arguing at their Ventura 
home when Robert Velasquez grabbed his loaded handgun and followed his wife 
into their bedroom where she was attempting to make a 911 call, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair struggled over the telephone and the gun went off, hitting Regina 
Velasquez in the right hand. "The shot entered near the knuckle of her little 
finger," said Sgt. Gary McCaskill. Regina Velasquez was taken to Community 
Memorial Hospital, where she underwent surgery Monday, McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Steve Bowman said Robert Velasquez had been drinking and was apparently 
jealous and angry with his wife. "It sounds like it was a continuing problem," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaskill said the couple's 5-year-old child, who was asleep at the time of 
the shooting and did not witness the fight, was taken in by a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Velasquez was arrested without a struggle and his gun seized by the 
police. He was booked at Ventura County Main Jail Sunday, and posted $5,000 
bail Monday. He will be arraigned at 8:30 a.m. Friday. TRACY WILSON

SUSPECT IN BRAWL WILL STAND TRIAL AS AN ADULT; VIOLENCE: BOY, 17, FACES TWO 
COUNTS OF ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON IN MELEE. TWO WESTLAKE HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENTS WERE WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Wednesday ordered a Thousand Oaks 17-year-old to be tried as an adult 
on charges connected to an off-campus brawl that left two Westlake High School 
students hospitalized with gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath's decision came after a 
full day of hearings that for the first time gave a detailed account of how the 
high-profile brawl came about. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision to try 17-year-old James Lee as an adult surprised the 
attorney for the defendant described by prosecutors as a main instigator of the 
melee. Lee, one of two Westlake High School students charged in the incident, 
faces two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and three other Asian teen-agers were charged with various crimes relating 
to the Feb. 3 melee that began after Lee and a school football player agreed to 
engage in a fistfight at North Ranch Park near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Two supporters of the football player -- Curtis Simmons -- have been released 
from the hospital and are recovering after being shot in the back and the head, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the circumstances of the offense certainly explain why he is fit to 
be tried as a minor. We will plead not guilty and defend" against the charges, 
Lee's attorney, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., said after McGrath's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the objections of a prosecutor, McGrath set Lee's bail at $5,000 and 
scheduled the defendant's initial appearance in adult court for 9 a.m. this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a prosecutor said that an arrest warrant has been issued for Lee's 
19-year-old brother, Frank Lee, in connection with the case. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
John U. Vanarelli would not say what charges Frank Lee faces in the warrant, 
although in court Vanarelli accused the older Lee of arranging for the weapons 
used at the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli said authorities are searching for Frank Lee, but have been unable 
to find him since the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's hearing for James Lee was the first of four such dates scheduled 
to determine whether the juveniles charged in the case will be tried in adult 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very happy," said Danny Simmons, the father of Curtis Simmons, who was 
clubbed with blunt objects during the brawl. "I think it's a win for us." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing Wednesday, five police investigators testified that James and 
Frank Lee planned at least a week in advance to have their friends show up at 
the park for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, they said that Simmons recruited at least two football teammates 
for the brawl. He also showed up at the park with about 40 other supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators said on the witness stand that the agreement by James Lee 
and Curtis Simmons to fight was preceded by another fight they had months 
earlier. In that first fight, the much-larger Simmons broke Lee's nose with a 
single punch. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing feud died down for several months after the first fight. But it 
resumed for no known reasons when the two exchanged threats, Lee vowing to 
shoot Simmons and Simmons promising to "break Lee's back," one investigator 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 About a week before the brawl, James Lee phoned a Rowland Heights teen-ager 
and enlisted him as backup in the planned park fight, testified Deputy Jeffrey 
D. Allaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "James Lee had called him about a week before the fight," Allaire said. "He 
said there was going to be a fight, and he needed his help." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rowland Heights youth, who is Laotian-American, has been charged with two 
counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Prosecutors said the call to the 
Rowland Heights teen-ager -- identified in court testimony as a member of an 
Asian gang -- proves James Lee had a role in planning the brawl and thus the 
two shooting injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 As James Lee prepared for the park showdown, so did his brother Frank, who is 
not a student, investigators testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Randy Pentis said another teen-ager from Rowland Heights told 
investigators he and several other Asian-American youths were asked to the 
fight by Frank Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were going up to Thousand Oaks to fight a football player who was going 
to fight Frank's brother," Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators said on the day of the incident, as Simmons himself was 
lining up football players to join him at the park, James Lee's friends met at 
a grocery store on Westlake Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were out of school, but others, still school-aged, skipped classes to go 
to the fight that day. But James Lee was at school. So his friends left the 
grocery store and picked him up from Westlake High before returning to near the 
store for a brief planning session on how they were going to approach Curtis 
Simmons, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, they went to the park, where Frank Lee was first to emerge from a 
car and take a swing at Curtis Simmons, investigators said. Simmons blocked 
Frank Lee's punch and threw Lee to the ground, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when James Lee pounded Simmons in the back with a wooden board, 
investigators testified. A group of Asian youths then surrounded Simmons and 
began swinging boards, baseball bats and metal anti-car theft devices at the 
football player, described as more than 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight broke up after other football players joined in, and then gunfire 
erupted. 
</P>

 Investigators said an Asian-American youth from Brea, who is charged with two 
counts of assault with a firearm, pulled out a gun and pointed it at one of the 
white football players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pointed the gun at him, and I was thinking, 'Should I fire?' " the Brea 
youth told investigators. "I pulled the trigger and he fell to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentis said the youth then "saw another large white guy beating up one of his 
homies, so he fired at him also." 
</P>
<P>
 That bullet missed, investigators said.

<P>
 For James Lee's defense, two pastors and a psychologist testified that the 
teen-ager is remorseful over his role in the brawl and for the humiliation it 
has caused his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Jerry Bokoles said a lengthy interview he had with James Lee 
revealed that Lee agreed to the fight because he thought he had no other 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he felt kind of trapped and didn't know what to do, very harassed by 
this fellow (Curtis Simmons)," Bokoles said. ". . . I think he saw almost no 
other options. He didn't feel like he was being protected by the principals at 
the school."

GOODBY TO ALL THAT: THE SAD LESSONS OF SOMALIA; AS THE LAST OF THE U.S TROOPS 
LEAVE, WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last American troops are scheduled to leave Somalia Friday, in advance of 
President Clinton's March 31 deadline. They will leave that nation as they 
found it: a poor and bitterly divided East African country, one that probably 
will erupt in violence again. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, the ravages of Somalia are no longer America's problem. 
They are Somalia's. We have kept our part of the bargain: U.S. troops stopped 
the starvation, as President George Bush promised when he sent them on a 
humanitarian mission 16 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 American troops -- in a U.N. operation with thousands of soldiers from other 
Western nations, Asia and Africa -- had to start the rebuilding process without 
disarming Somalia's contending factions. Not so easy. An abundance of weapons 
and munitions -- the legacy of misguided Cold War largess from the Soviet Union 
and the United States -- had made possible a violent escalation of ancient clan 
rivalries, and the already grim situation was exacerbated by the 
patronage-plagued dictatorship of Mohamed Siad Barre. 
</P>
<P>
 AMERICAN FUTILITY: U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali tried to turn 
the peacekeeping mission into a peace-enforcement mission when the shooting 
resumed. However, enforcing the peace in Mogadishu, which had become the Horn 
of Africa's Dodge City, was impossible without disarming the Somalis. The 
Clinton Administration was reluctant to commit U.S. lives to the dangerous 
mission of ferreting out caches of weapons. Although understandable, that 
reluctance made all the difference, as the futile U.S. effort to capture one 
major warlord, Mohammed Farah Aidid, sadly proved. 
</P>
<P>
 Aidid's October attack on American troops turned the tide among the American 
public; news photos of snarling mobs dragging a dead American serviceman 
through the streets of Mogadishu heightened popular demand to bring U.S. troops 
home. In response, Clinton set a deadline that provided ample time for Somali 
leaders to return to the table and negotiate. But the stubborn power-mongers, 
particularly Aidid, would not be prodded -- and the opportunity to take away 
their guns had been missed. 
</P>
<P>
 THIRD-WORLD SOLUTION: Now, as the United States exits Somalia, the Americans 
leave behind a U.N. peacekeeping force dominated by Third World troops, 
including Pakistanis, Indians and Egyptians. They offer, at least in theory, 
advantages that may make their attempts to mediate more acceptable to Somalis: 
Some religious beliefs and cultural ways are shared. If they succeed, the 
precedent could get the United Nations off the hook in other regional 
conflicts. If the major powers are reluctant to commit troops to peacekeeping 
operations, Boutros-Ghali may be able to persuade smaller, neighboring nations 
to volunteer forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the United Nations will have to pick and choose where to send 
peacekeeping forces; options will be very limited without the resources that 
the United States can bring to bear. By the same token if the United States 
always hesitates, that could lead to widespread international instability. As 
in Bosnia, local conflicts could become terrible and intractable problems with 
huge death tolls -- and far-ranging implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the United States cannot afford to return to trying to be the world's 
policeman. America cannot intervene everywhere. But neither should the Clinton 
Administration always sit on the sidelines. When and where and how to intervene 
must be determined the hard way -- on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Was U.S. intervention worthwhile in Somalia? The outlook for the African 
nation is mixed. Farming has resumed -- a huge gain. On the other hand, the 
winter crop is not as good as expected and the yield will be lost if fighting 
flares again and farmers must flee. Also, talks between Somali leaders, 
including Aidid and a major rival, Mohammed Ali Mahdi, collapsed Wednesday. The 
failure of the negotiations -- held under U.N. auspices in Kenya -- raises the 
question of whether Somalis are ready to agree to any deal that returns a 
semblance of government and stability to Mogadishu. Their salvation is now up 
to them.

ARTS PLAZA WILL ALLOW RAP BANDS; THOUSAND OAKS: FANS' APPEALS PERSUADE 
COMMISSIONERS NOT TO BAN ALL FORMS OF HEAVY METAL AND LOUD MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' new auditorium -- designed as an elegant concert hall -- will 
host some rappers and heavy-metal bands, the city's theater commissioners 
decided Wednesday after appeals from several young fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of the rowdy crowds that such concerts might draw, the panel's 
programming committee had recommended banning ear-splitting heavy metal or 
dance-party rap from the plush 1,800-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 With its state-of-the-art acoustics, designed by a laser system that 
calculates how sound waves bounce off walls, the auditorium "is conducive to 
really high artistic standards," Executive Director Tom Mitze said before the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But after hearing pleas from fans of trendy '90s music, the commissioners 
changed their minds and said they would evaluate each band on a case-by-case 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child of the '60s, I have absolutely no interest in banning any 
classification of music," said Commissioner Larry Janss, who had earlier 
supported excluding rap and hard-rock artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Several commissioners and concert-goers pointed out that modern bands often 
blend elements of rap with traditional rock 'n' roll sounds. They described the 
auditorium as a public building that should book acts for audiences of all 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a taxpayer, a law-abiding citizen and a contributing member of society, I 
should have the same rights to enjoy the Civic Arts Plaza as people who like 
the symphony or ballet," said rock 'n' roll fan Grahame Watts. "Banning any 
music is an insult to people young and old. I'm concerned about providing 
diversity for all ages as opposed to just catering to politically correct Plaza 
supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 While focusing on future programming issues, the theater commissioners took 
time out briefly Wednesday night to celebrate the inking of a contract with 
actress and singer Bernadette Peters, who will perform two shows for the Civic 
Arts Plaza's grand opening next October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday approved the $60,000 contract and 
endorsed a host of other plans for the grand opening celebration, which 
coincides with the city's 30th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they made plans for a star-studded, three-day grand opening, however, 
council members heard a disabled woman and her husband announce plans to stage 
a protest during the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Phyllis and John Ellis have complained that the Civic Arts Plaza's 
design discriminates against wheelchair-bound visitors, because of sloping 
floors, inadequate chairlifts and other issues. They have also protested 
because disabled residents cannot take tours of the construction site, which is 
inaccessible for wheelchairs and walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't realize how bad it is out there until you get in one of these 
critters," Phyllis Ellis said, gesturing toward her motorized wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and two outside consultants defended the design of the Civic 
Arts Plaza, saying it fully met -- and often exceeded -- federal guidelines 
outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater-goers in wheelchairs have a choice of seats sprinkled throughout the 
auditorium, every restroom has stalls designed for disabled people, and every 
workplace from the orchestra pit to the lighting controls is accessible, said 
Barry Branagan, the city's building and safety director. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've thought of everything and have been very innovative," said Mike 
Taylor, the chairman of the city's Disabled Access Appeals Board, who uses a 
wheelchair himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Ellises' claim, consultant Mike Gibbens said: "It's total fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 But John and Phyllis Ellis repeatedly warned the council Tuesday that they had 
submitted complaints to the Justice Department calling for a federal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 And John Ellis asked the city to notify guest artist Peters that "anything 
that happens outside the theater during the grand opening is not directed at 
her . . .. It's specifically directed at local bigots." 
</P>
<P>
 While he declined to discuss their plans in detail, John Ellis said they might 
hold signs claiming discrimination against disabled residents during the 
black-tie party or other grand-opening events.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES P. PINKERTON: A CLINTON DEAL WILL LET CHINA OFF THE HOOK; 
MONEY COMES FIRST. REMEMBER THE VIETNAM EMBARGO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES P. PINKERTON, James P. Pinkerton, based in Washington, is a senior 
fellow at the Manhattan Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher's trip to Beijing was the most 
disastrous expedition to Asia by an American since William Westmoreland went to 
Vietnam. The Clinton Administration's stated policy is that China's 
most-favored-nation trading status will not be renewed this June unless China 
shows progress on human rights. Yet when Christopher nudged the Chinese, they 
shoved him right back. 
</P>
<P>
 So what will happen -- trade war? Nope. This is what will happen: President 
Clinton will make a deal. He'll seek to save face, of course, so White House 
aides will heap as much blame as they can on poor Christopher for misadvising 
the President, short of provoking his resignation or blowing their own 
anonymity. But in the end, Clinton, the man who promised a tax cut to the 
middle class and easy entry to Haitian boat people, will find a way to switch 
off what could otherwise escalate into a systemwide crash of the planet's 
economic hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 What of the Chinese dissidents? Will Clinton abandon his commitment to them? 
In Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass," the Walrus and the Carpenter 
are gobbling up oysters. The Walrus says to his bivalve breakfast food: "I weep 
for you." And then, with "sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest 
size." 
</P>
<P>
 A 19th-Century diplomat once said that nations don't have permanent friends or 
allies, just permanent interests. Sometimes, for reasons of state, the big 
interests must swallow the smaller ones. Clinton has already demonstrated his 
appetite for Realpolitik. Last month, he lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam, 
even though there is strong evidence, unearthed by John Corry in an 8,000-word 
piece in the February American Spectator, that not only did we leave U.S. 
servicemen behind in Southeast Asia, but also that the American and Vietnamese 
governments have been conspiring to suborn the truth. Corry concludes that this 
two-decade cover-up is "an ever-widening moral stain" on our national honor.  
</P>
<P>
 The fate of POW-MIAs has never been as fashionable a cause celebre as Chinese 
intellectuals, but even the trendiest dissident chic goes to the back of the 
bus when jobs, jobs, jobs are at stake. Today, U.S. exports to China employ 
200,000 Americans, but that's just a fraction of what could come tomorrow. Last 
Friday, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen traveled to Los Angeles to underline 
that point. Reminding Californians that two-thirds of their exports go to the 
trillion-dollar Asian market, Bentsen's point was unmistakable: Pushing exports 
is more important than pushing human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 China-MFN is reminiscent of last year's NAFTA struggle. Clinton endorsed NAFTA 
during the campaign but let it languish once he got to the White House. It 
wasn't until the fall that Clinton realized that if he let NAFTA fail, he would 
go down as the worst international-trade President since Herbert Hoover and his 
Depression-deepening Smoot-Hawley tariff. Clinton got to work, dealing away 
every bridge but the Brooklyn to pork-minded members of Congress in return for 
their yes-on-NAFTA votes. 
</P>
<P>
 One thinks of the climactic scene in the 1976 movie "Network." Ned Beatty 
plays a global mogul alarmed at the populist antics of TV showman Howard ("I'm 
mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more") Beale. Such rabble-rousing 
could disrupt the smooth flow of monopoly capital, so Beatty calls Beale into a 
darkened room to deliver a stern message. "There is only one holistic system of 
systems," Beatty roars, "one vast and interwoven interactive multivariate 
multinational dominion of dollars." Calling down the wrath of the overarching 
financial empyrean, Beatty thunders: "You have meddled with the primal forces 
of nature. And you will atone!" Like Saul on the road to Damascus, Beale is 
transformed. Big money does that to people. 
</P>
<P>
 The new world order is not military or diplomatic but financial and 
technological. And it is extending even unto the heavens. This week, Microsoft 
and McCaw Cellular announced a $9-billion joint venture to bring 
telecommunications to the entire planet. In a rich irony, the consortium will 
use "Star-Wars" technology to send 840 satellites aloft; the information 
superhighway will become the info-astrodome. Leave it to capitalism to beat 
swords into profitable plowshares. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's path has zigged and zagged since he moved away from Hope as a young 
boy. He is a survivor. Clinton's threat to MFN was an affront to the great 
system of systems. But now, as with NAFTA, he will atone.

HOSPITAL NURSES AUTHORIZE STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nurses at the county hospital, in the midst of heated and lengthy contract 
negotiations, voted late Wednesday to authorize a strike if negotiations with 
the county do not resolve a dispute over working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-five percent of Ventura County Medical Center nurses who attended a 
meeting Wednesday agreed to walk off the job if county negotiators do not back 
down from some of their demands, said nurse Judith Overmyer, co-chair of the 
hospital chapter of the California Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't want to strike. We're prepared to if we exhaust every other 
possibility, but we're hoping to get back to the bargaining table," said 
Overmyer, who said contract talks have been stalled since April, 1993. Overmyer 
would not say how many of the union's 200 members voted to authorize a strike, 
except to say that there was a "strong turnout" at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Overmyer said she did not know when a strike might occur. No new negotiating 
sessions are scheduled with county officials, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Phillipp K. Wessels, the Ventura County Health Care Agency director, 
nor hospital administrator Pierre Durand were available for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overmyer said the county has insisted on a series of unfair agreements that 
would undermine the seniority of many nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county wants the ability to call off nurses in situations where there is 
a low-patient census," Overmyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the union's members have been denied breaks and harassed in other ways 
by managers throughout the negotiations, Overmyer said. A mediator has been 
working for two months to bring the two sides together.

CITY OKS RENOVATION PLAN FOR JANSS EXPANSION; THOUSAND OAKS: SOME MALL TENANTS 
FEAR HIGHER RENTS COMBINED WITH THE NOISE AND TUMULT OF A LONG CONSTRUCTION 
PERIOD WILL DRIVE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By next spring, shoppers strolling through the Janss Marketplace will be able 
to take in a movie at an eight-screen cinema, grab dinner in a neon-lit 
courtyard, and gaze at sculptures inspired by Chumash Indian icons. 
</P>
<P>
 But they might have trouble finding some of the mom-and-pop stores that have 
served Thousand Oaks for years -- such as the Brown Bag Deli, Yogurt Plus and 
the Sewing and Vacuum Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A $50-million renovation plan approved by the City Council late Tuesday will 
expand the mall by adding a four-story parking garage plus new fashion, 
electronics, video and book stores. To update the drab, earth-tone shopping 
center, developers plan colorful wall murals and intricate tile mosaics. 
</P>
<P>
 With the council's enthusiastic OK, developers can now go ahead with plans to 
begin reconstruction in June and open the spruced-up mall by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, they must negotiate with the tenants who will be affected by 
the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 While they support the mall face lift, some tenants fear that higher rents 
combined with the noise and tumult of a months-long construction project will 
drive them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's three-hour public hearing, several store owners pleaded with 
the City Council to intervene in their negotiations with the mall's landlord, 
developer Bill Janss. Some are asking for hefty compensation to make up for 
their loss of business during construction, while others are complaining that 
the renovation will eliminate parking near their shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about my store and my livelihood," said Bruce Markowitz, who 
has owned Yogurt Plus for seven years and has six years remaining on his lease. 
"They say we're in the same ballpark but we're not even in the same city, we're 
so far away." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members refused to get involved in the landlord-tenant dispute. But 
they urged Janss to help business owners survive the construction period by 
relocating them to untouched areas of the mall and by providing signs to direct 
confused customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants will also be allowed to review the developer's detailed renovation 
plans, which will explain the order and timing of all construction, Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leases provide that the tenants must have quiet enjoyment of the space 
they rent, and we have every intention of respecting that," Janss told the 
council. "It's not in anyone's interest to have those businesses do poorly." 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants' concerns, expressed even before the hearing in letters and calls 
to city staff members, prompted Councilman Frank Schillo to call last week for 
an economic impact report assessing the expansion's impact on small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that such a study could take months, Schillo on Tuesday withdrew 
his request for a formal report, but said the council should make a policy 
decision on whether to require economic analysis on future development. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his fears that small business might suffer, Schillo heartily endorsed 
the renovation plans. So did his colleagues, who approved the program on a 4-0 
vote. Councilman Alex Fiore was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to compliment the architects for proving that in Thousand Oaks, 
it's possible to create something that enhances our beautiful area without 
having a red tile roof or brown, squat buildings," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's unanimity was tested only during a brief debate on signs. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 2-2 vote, the council rejected a proposal to scatter the mall's exterior 
with free-standing signs, including some advertising new anchor tenant 
Mervyn's. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo supported Mervyn's request for 
high-profile signs, but Mayor Elois Zeanah and Zukowski voted no. To resolve 
the deadlock, the council granted permission for three decorative monument 
signs listing only the Janss Marketplace name. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski did offer the Mervyn's representative hope for more visibility when 
she told him of a city committee reviewing the sign ordinance with an eye 
toward allowing directory boards. If such signs are approved, she said, the 
department store could install its name on the Janss Marketplace monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, Mervyn's representative, Ignacio Gomez, said he would have to 
persuade his bosses to move in despite the lack of signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very difficult for me to sell this to management," Gomez said. But 
despite his tough talk, Gomez accepted handshakes and welcomes from City 
Council members, and noted that Mervyn's has long sought a site in Thousand 
Oaks.

CONDO DEVELOPER SEEKS SIMI LOAN; HOUSING: BUILDER OFFERS TO LOWER PRICES ON 
UNITS IN EXCHANGE FOR $1 MILLION WITH NO INTEREST. OFFICIALS EXPRESS 
RESERVATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Simi Valley developer has offered to drop the price of nearly 100 
condominiums in a development it is planning for the city's west end with a 
substantial hitch -- a $1-million interest-free loan from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city leaders said they would not be willing to sink city dollars into 
the project unless it goes further in helping the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin Industries, which wants to build 600 houses in an area called Simi 
Village, would reserve 96 condominiums for low-income buyers if the city agrees 
to the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Affordable Housing Subcommittee, made up of City Council members 
Bill Davis and Judy Mikels, will consider the request at its meeting today. 
Davis and Mikels have expressed reservations about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rick Niec, vice president of Griffin Industries, said the company would be 
willing to alter its proposal to address the city's apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin wants to purchase a 45-acre parcel in the Simi Village area south of 
Los Angeles Avenue between Sinaloa Road and 1st Street to build 600 houses. In 
exchange for a $1-million, interest-free loan, the developer is offering to 
drop the price of 96 condominiums to about $91,000 apiece, nearly $35,000 below 
market value.  
</P>
<P>
 Davis criticized the project for not addressing the housing needs of poor 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a single parent or somebody who is really in need, this is not that great 
of a deal," Davis said. "Those are the people we really need to be helping, if 
we're going to be using city money." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she would be reluctant to grant an interest-free loan to the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look at what we're getting," Mikels said. "Frankly, I'm not sure 
there are enough units at enough of a reduction to really have an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Niec said his company is willing to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meeting may not do anything other than help us focus on the concerns the 
city has and give us some redirection," Niec said. "But we want to continue to 
work toward an affordable agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the city has contributed more than $1.6 million to two 
housing developments for low-income residents, said Dulce Conde-Sierra, Simi 
Valley's deputy director of housing and special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Requests by developers for city assistance are not unusual these days," 
Conde-Sierra said. "In the last few years, we have come to expect large 
requests." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the city-subsidized projects, the recently opened Heywood Gardens 
apartment complex for senior citizens, is entirely for low-income residents. 
Monthly rent on its 75 units ranges from $500 to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 The other project, a 22-townhouse development being built by Cabrillo Economic 
Development Corp., is designed to cater to residents who earn 75% or less of 
the county median income, about $39,700 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Niec said his company's project differed from the other two because Griffin is 
asking the city for a loan, not a grant. He acknowledged, however, that the 
city could lose up to $180,000 or more in interest if it loaned Griffin $1 
million interest-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Griffin proposal, the city would lend the developer $1 million to 
help pay for the purchase of the 45-acre plot. The developer would then build 
on the land and pay the loan back as housing units were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidized units, which would be spread throughout the development, would 
be available to low-income buyers for 30 years, Niec said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for the city to provide, at a very minimal cost, 
affordable housing for its residents," Niec said. "We're willing to be flexible 
to make that happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he would be more willing to fund the Griffin project if it were 
planned entirely for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this project were split between rental and low-cost homes for sale, I 
would look at it a little more sympathetically," Davis said. "As it is right 
now, I would say it's not an outstanding project." 
</P>
<P>
 If the subcommittee approves a proposal, it will be sent to the full City 
Council for consideration. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Affordable Housing Subcommittee meets today at 5:30 p.m. at Simi 
Valley City Hall, 2929 Tapo Canyon Road.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A VOTE FOR DARKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first rule of elected officials should be to conduct public business in 
public. That may sound obvious, but too often agencies and boards seem to use 
any excuse to retreat behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District trustees this week censured one of their 
own, trustee Rosemarie Avila, for allegedly leaking confidential documents 
related to district plans to purchase land for schools. The censure move was a 
bad one. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a good deal of politics involved in the action. Avila has irritated 
her colleagues on a number of issues, and she has not always been right. But in 
this case, she appears to have been chastised for airing a topic that needs 
public debate than for allegedly disclosing material that was truly 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 The approximate price the district would probably pay was hardly a state 
secret; many knew the figure before Avila objected that the district was paying 
too much. State law allows closed-door meetings to discuss personnel or 
litigation, and there is a case for not disclosing a school district's top 
price for land or material. But the cat was already out of the bag, and the 
issue of whether the district was going to pay too much was of substantial 
public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of elected officials is not to keep taxpayers in the dark; it is to 
explain and enlighten. That's why Avila did the right thing.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Magic Johnson was a great coach on the court. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now the question is what kind of a coach he will be on the bench. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For sure, his fire will be a welcome change of pace from the laid-back 
approach of Randy Pfund. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's basketball smarts were second to none during his 12-year playing 
career. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But being a star Laker player is no guarantee that someone will become a star 
Laker coach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 George Mikan was 9-30 at the start of the 1957-58 season before Minneapolis 
rehired John Kundla. Jerry West's Los Angeles teams were 145-101 from 1976-77 
through 1978-79, but only 8-14 in the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, "Nothing But Net," written by Bill Walton with Gene 
Wojciechowski, Walton says West, Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor and even Wilt 
Chamberlain of San Diego Conquistador infamy arguably were among the worst 
coaches. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't comprehend why every player wasn't great, or why every player 
didn't share their love of the game," Walton said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The year after West was elevated from coach to general manager, the Lakers won 
the NBA championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The drafting of Magic Johnson had something to do with it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 These Lakers won't be able to pick anyone resembling a potential franchise 
player unless they overcome enormous odds in the draft lottery. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is a shame that they probably don't have enough trade bait to make a deal 
that would enable them to draft Jason Kidd. Just imagine, the ultimate point 
guard, Magic, tutoring the next great point guard. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, they are eligible to sign a quality free agent, such as Horace Grant 
or Danny Manning, who could help to turn a young team around quickly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the Johnson hiring seems curious, but wouldn't the Dallas 
Mavericks be better off today if they had brought in Quinn Buckner late last 
season? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Magic's presence will boost season-ticket renewals and sell some seats the 
remainder of the season, particularly for his debut Sunday at the Forum against 
the Milwaukee Bucks and his last NBA coach, Mike Dunleavy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the long run, coaches don't sell tickets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Winning time does. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is safe to assume that Magic has a brighter future as a coach than as an 
interview show host.His special last week on the Fox Network, "One on One With 
Magic Johnson," finished last among 94 shows in the national Nielsen ratings. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 This nearly became the first NBA season since 1970-71 not to have a coaching 
change. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 During the NCAA West Regional semifinals at the Sports Arena today, the focus 
will be on coaches with established ties. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Stewart has been at Missouri for 27 years, Denny Crum at Louisville for 
23, Jim Boeheim at Syracuse for 18, and Lute Olson at Arizona for 11. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville, which won the Metro, is the only conference tournament champion 
among the Sweet 16. Missouri, Syracuse, Arkansas, Tulsa, Maryland, Boston 
College, Florida, Connecticut, Marquette, Duke and Kansas were also-rans. 
Arizona, Michigan, Indiana and Purdue didn't play in conference tournaments. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri has a deeper bench than Syracuse, but Boeheim thinks it might not 
make a difference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Substituting is something you almost don't have to do anymore," Boeheim said. 
"You used to have to give players some two-minute rests. Now they get them 
every five minutes because of the TV timeouts." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the last time the Sports Arena, which is smaller and older than 
Anaheim Arena, is host of a postseason tournament. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Regional final tickets always are easier to buy from brokers than semifinal 
tickets because the losers leave town. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse forward Lucious Jackson, on why he doesn't play one-on-one with his 
father, Luke, a member of the 1967 Philadelphia 76er title team that many 
consider the best ever: "He's 6-9 and he weighs 330 pounds. He's finished." . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Three potential NCAA championship game rematches remain: Michigan vs. Indiana 
from 1976, Louisville vs. Duke from 1986, and Indiana vs. Syracuse from 1987. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 It is strange how many teams are so adept at the three-point shot and so lousy 
at the one-point shot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, I hope that Magic's health allows him to have a long, successful 
run as Laker coach.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; ONLY SURE THING ABOUT BIG EAST IS ITS 
UNCERTAINTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mike Tranghese arrives in Miami this week with a conference that still works, 
three league teams that are still playing and one disturbing jinx that could 
spell doom for Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the kind of week the Big East commissioner can live with. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, as the league's university presidents argued about 
expansion and expulsion, Tranghese, 50, wasn't quite sure where the quirky Big 
East was headed. Oblivion was one possibility, what with several of the school 
presidents adamantly opposed to adding two more members--West Virginia and 
Rutgers--to the 10-team league. In turn, the pro-expansion forces, such as 
Miami, were threatening to bolt if they didn't get their way. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing was a mess, but that's what you get when some of your teams 
are basketball-only members, while others play both hoops and football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried immensely," Tranghese said. "I thought the chances of us 
breaking up . . . . it was very possible. If the presidents hadn't compromised, 
there's no doubt that we would have broken up." 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise, which begins in 1996: West Virginia and Rutgers in, Temple and 
Virginia Tech out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had football schools that pushed as hard as you can imagine to go to 14, 
and we had basketball schools who pushed to stay at 10," Tranghese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had a deal not been struck, Tranghese soon would have been proprietor of the 
Wee East. Instead, his conference remains intact. Temple and Virginia Tech 
aren't too thrilled with the arrangement, but that's how it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came right down to it, a school such as Syracuse, which recruits 
heavily in the east for football and basketball, didn't want to risk losing 
prime talent locations as Washington D.C. (Georgetown), Philadelphia 
(Villanova) and New York (Seton Hall, St. John's). So they supported the 
compromise and the pseudo-expansion that came with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now then, what do the other major conferences do? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tranghese, not a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I look at the landscape now, I don't know if there's anything out there 
that could motivate expansion," he said. "All of us have contracts through the 
year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
 Contract, shmontract. Where there's a will, there's a loophole, which is why 
further movement isn't out of the question. But the way Tranghese sees it, 
there is a distinct difference in the Big East situation and those of the 
Pacific 10 or Big Ten or Southeastern conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our moves were based on survival and existence," he said. "Other 
conferences have chosen to expand, the SEC and the Big Ten, under the 
assumption that bigger is better. I don't agree with the theory of bigger is 
better. Yes, you become more powerful in that you control more markets, but you 
have to pay more people." 
</P>
<P>
 Tranghese said he thinks the Pac-10, which pursued Texas and Texas A&M, and 
the Big Ten, which was looking at Rutgers and possibly Missouri, "tend to feed 
off each other." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, no expansion for expansion's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the two-time zone issue was a monster issue (for the Pac-10)," 
Tranghese said. "I think once we did what we did . . . . (the Pac-10 and Big 
Ten) were only looking at expansion in the defensive stance." 
</P>
<P>
 Still available, in a basketball-only status, however, is Notre Dame. Irish 
Coach John MacLeod wants to join a conference and Tranghese has said that any 
league would be foolish not to consider Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's hard for me to even conceive of us, based on what we've been 
through, doing anything," he said. "We've been through four months of wear and 
tear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could venture down the road without the permission of our 
presidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is another way of saying they haven't ruled it out. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the dawning of superconferences, Tranghese isn't holding his breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to see a lot more movement," Tranghese said. "I 
think things are going to stay fairly quiet. But I've been wrong before." BIG 
EAST RULES 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. But compared to recent years, when the league's NCAA 
tournament teams were sucking air like a chain smoker trying to run a marathon, 
life is good. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College, seeded No. 9 in the East, is three games deep into the 
tournament because of victories against No. 8 Washington State and No. 1 North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse, No. 4 in the West, is here because of wins against No. 13 Hawaii and 
No. 12 Wisconsin Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut, No. 2 in the East, remains alive because of victories against No. 
15 Rider and No. 10 George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, six Big East teams were invited, with only Seton Hall and Providence 
not making it past the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Big East bashers (such as ourselves) have had to press the mute button on our 
rips. Worse yet, Arizona is the lone remaining west representative, which is 
about as comforting as wearing underwear dipped in Atomic Balm. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, before jumping entirely on the Big East bandwagon, remember this: 
</P>
<P>
 The last Big East team to win the championship was Villanova in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Big East team to advance to the Final Four was Seton Hall in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Big East teams to earn Final Eight appearances were St. John's and 
Seton Hall in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 And before this season, the last Big East team to reach the Sweet 16 was Seton 
Hall in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Big East chances to reach the Final Eight this week aren't good--at least, if 
you believe in the Tranghese Factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tranghese attended the Southeast Regional first-round games in St. Petersburg, 
Fla., and Lexington, Ky. Sure enough, Seton Hall and Providence both lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tranghese is in Miami for Friday's game between Boston College and 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might sit in a corner and hide," he said. "I don't want to jinx anybody." 
GOOD GUY, BAD IDEA 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody can accuse USC Coach George Raveling of not stretching the envelope 
when it comes to new ideas. But one of his latest suggestions is a borderline 
example of protectionism, one that would do the Pac-10 more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling wants league members to think twice before scheduling non-conference 
schools that recruit heavily on the West Coast. USC had a chance to play Kansas 
in what would have been a televised game, but Raveling chose not to pursue the 
opportunity because he thought it helped the Jayhawks more than it helped the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 His reasoning: Kansas (as do other schools, such as Duke) tells its recruits 
that it will try to schedule at least one game during their careers in or near 
their hometowns. Had USC played Kansas at the Sports Arena, Raveling would have 
been helping the Jayhawks "pay their debt" to a recruit, in this case, guard 
Jacque Vaughn, who played high school ball at Pasadena Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 We understand Raveling's point, but we think he has to think Big Picture. 
Recruits want to be on TV. They want to play against big-time programs. Rather 
than see a game against Kansas as a threat, the Pac-10 should see it as a 
golden opportunity. After all, what if USC won? 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, didn't Raveling sign Washington D.C. star guard Claude Green last 
year and then add D.C.-based Howard University to the Trojan schedule? WHERE'S 
THE PACIFIER? 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's Dean Smith is still three, probably four seasons away from 
becoming the all-time winningest coach in Division I basketball history. After 
Sunday's performance at the East Regional in Landover, Md., it is apparent he 
is already the whiningest. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't question Smith's integrity, his devotion to the game or his concern 
for his players, but enough already with the Saint Dean stuff and the constant 
whimpering. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's loss to Boston College, Smith suffered a courtside meltdown when 
Eagle freshman Danya Abrams rammed Tar Heel Derrick Phelps from behind, 
knocking the senior point guard out of the game. Smith had a right to be 
upset--it was a blatant cheap shot by Abrams--but he didn't have a right to 
storm the court, point fingers and go after a befuddled freshman who forgot 
about the laws of physics (that his 270 pounds can knock the bejabbers out of 
Phelps' 181 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
 And talk about your poor loser . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Smith offered a less-than-heartfelt congratulations to the Eagles. 
He did, however, mention that in the pregame preparation he had told his 
players about a certain Boston College starter who was a bit of a thug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably shouldn't say that," said Smith, moments before identifying 
"24"--Abrams--as the guilty party. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Abrams didn't play well with the other children. But we didn't hear Smith 
mention the time Tar Heel forward Brian Reese purposely pushed Abrams in the 
small of the back as the Eagle forward went up for a shot. Foul. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe Smith didn't notice when 7-0, 275-pound Eric Montross threw a wicked 
elbow in the general direction of Bill Curley's cranium. Foul. Or when Montross 
went after 169-pound Gerrod Abram, who had the audacity to make a three-pointer 
over his outstretched hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the end of the play," Abram said, "he kind of hit me in the throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Not advancing to the Sweet 16 is bad enough for a team that features three 
future NBA first-rounders (Montross, Jerry Stackhouse and Rasheed Wallace), but 
what Smith did after the upset was worse. Forget about Abrams. Smith took the 
real cheap shot. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get this straight: Clem Haskins' underachieving Minnesota team blows a 
lead and eventually a second-round game against Louisville Sunday and he blasts 
whom afterward? Not himself and not his players, but the officials and media. 
"I think Bobby Knight has the best philosophy with the media--treat them like 
dogs, because most of them deserve it," Haskins told the Minneapolis Star 
Tribune. Haskins issued an apology a day later. To which we reply: "Woof" . . . 
. Just wondering if President Bubba will wear one of those red plastic 
Razorback hats if he attends Friday night's Arkansas-Tulsa game at Dallas . . . 
. The tournament MVP after two rounds: Michigan center Juwan Howard, who is 
averaging 31 points and 13.5 rebounds . . . . Take it for what it's worth, but 
a computer-generated NCAA tournament program run 1.6 million times rates Purdue

NBA ROUNDUP; ATLANTA GETS SATISFACTION FROM GETTING THERE FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Lenny Wilkens, the Atlanta Hawks being the first Eastern Conference team 
to clinch a playoff berth is the culmination of a season of upsets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great accomplishment by this team, considering we were picked anywhere 
from last to the middle of the pack by most people," Wilkens, the Hawk coach, 
said Wednesday night after they secured a spot with a 100-92 victory over the 
Charlotte Hornets at Atlanta."No one, including myself, anticipated that we'd 
do this well." 
</P>
<P>
 For Kevin Willis, whose 32 points and 16 rebounds were keys, it brought the 
satisfaction of offering skeptics a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows all the disbelievers that if they want to, they can jump on the 
bandwagon," Willis said. "We have worked hard and listened and we've come a 
long way as a team. If feels great for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 99, Philadelphia 87 -- Scottie Pippen scored 31 points on 14-for-19 
shooting as the Bulls handed the 76ers their eighth consecutive home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 20th loss in the 76ers' last 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 78, Cleveland 77 -- Dale Davis put back an offensive rebound with 0.8 
seconds remaining, lifting the Pacers over the Cavaliers in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana's victory came one night after Cleveland embarrassed the Pacers, 
93-61, a franchise low for Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 98, Utah 93 -- Scott Skiles scored nine of his 11 points in the fourth 
quarter, including a 17-foot jump shot with 11 seconds to play to help the 
Magic beat the Jazz at Salt Lake City.

CLIPPERS LOSE AGAIN; FLU SIDELINES WILKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins was missing because of flu and the Clippers' offense also 
virtually disappeared Wednesday night in the final quarter of a 111-107 loss to 
the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Hunter and Pete Chilcutt led the way as Detroit outscored the 
Clippers, 29-15, in the fourth quarter.The Pistons' reserves also outscored 
their Clipper counterparts, 53-23, in Detroit's sixth victory in eight games 
after it had lost 32 of 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper guard Ron Harper led all scorers with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams were missing their leading scorer. Detroit's Joe Dumars also sat 
out with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Isiah Thomas became only the fourth player in NBA history to reach the 9,000 
assist mark early in the first quarter. He joins Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson 
and John Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Mills led the Pistons with 21 points and 14 rebounds, while Hunter had 
19 and Chilcutt 12  
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss didn't believe his team was ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We approached this game thinking it was a lock, and when we had a chance to 
put them away, we didn't it do it," he said. "We had a lot of intensity, but we 
made way too many mental mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 92-82, after three quarters, Detroit took control in the fourth, 
thanks to reserves Chilcutt, Mark Macon and Charles Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three scored nine consecutive Piston points, pulling them to 96-93 with 
7:26 to go. Detroit took the lead, 99-96, with 5:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers came back to lead, 105-104, before Mills' jump shot with 1:51 to 
play put Detroit ahead for good.

PREP TENNIS ROUNDUP; NO. 2 PENINSULA TAKES DOWN NO. 3 UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 University boys' tennis Coach Josh Davis had been excited about the prospects 
of playing undefeated Palos Verdes Peninsula all week. But Davis' excitement 
lasted all of 30 minutes Wednesday as his third-ranked team was ambushed by 
second-ranked Peninsula, 13-8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (5-2) actually took two of the first four sets and had Peninsula 
Coach Tom Cox pacing. But in a key first-round set, Peninsula's No. 2 doubles 
team of Jeff Chang and Dave Pyun turned a 3-2 deficit against University's Raja 
Kapadia and Ross Ellis into a 6-3 victory and the match was never close again. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula (9-0) won five of six second-round sets and jumped out to an 
insurmountable 10 2/3-3 1/3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our confidence level dropped after that first round," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cox: "I was fretting in that first round, but we just kind of blew them 
out in the second round. I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 So was University's Jason Meyers, who was taking care of business on Courts 1 
and 3, winning 6-0 over No. 1 Kyle Rasmussen and 6-2 over No. 3 Chris Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened?" Meyers asked. "It thought it was a tight match." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers did what he could to make the score respectable as he won his last set 
over nationally ranked Dennis Chang, 6-0. In three sets, Meyers dropped only 
two games and spent maybe 45 minutes on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough," Meyers said. "That's the tough thing about a team. You have to 
pull through and hope that your teammates can do it too. I really thought we 
could win." DAVE McKIBBEN

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; MATER DEI SHUTS DOWN COUGARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Hessman admittedly has a problem concentrating late in games, and the 
Mater Dei pitcher has suffered because of this shortcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Hessman, however, has few other failings -- just ask Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore right-hander pitched an excellent game in leading Mater Dei to a 
7-1 victory over the top-ranked and previously undefeated Cougars in a South 
Coast League game Wednesday at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Mater Dei improved to 5-2-1, 2-0 in league play. Capistrano Valley is 
6-1, 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Hessman, mixing a sharp breaking ball and moving fastball, pitched a 
four-hitter with six strikeouts. Hessman (3-0) lost his shutout in the top of 
the seventh inning when Capistrano Valley senior Levi Roquemore drove in senior 
Paul Day, who doubled to open the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second shutout Hessman has lost in the seventh inning this 
season. Still, Hessman has allowed only two earned runs in 21 innings for a 
0.66 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why that happens," Hessman said of his late-inning letdowns. "I 
guess I just eased up a little bit late in the game . . . I didn't come out 
like I should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Cougar Coach Bob Zamora was impressed with Hessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I've ever seen a more polished performance from a sophomore," 
Zamora said. "It seemed like he was ahead of the count on every batter." 
</P>
<P>
 Hessman outperformed UCLA-bound left-hander Pete Zamora (3-1), Bob's son, who 
was forced to leave in the fourth inning because of soreness in his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 3-0, entering the sixth inning, the Monarchs scored four runs to put 
the game out of reach. Junior Dave Sanchez (one for three, two runs batted in) 
hit his second home run of the season in the third inning for the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 In another South Coast League game: 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 4, Mission Viejo 0 -- Brandon Hendrikx had two hits, scored once, 
stole two bases and struck out six in four-hit shutout for El Toro (6-4, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Freeway League: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 6, La Habra 3 -- Craig Freeman's two-run double gave Fullerton (7-1, 
2-0) a 6-1 lead. Ryan Golisano earned his fifth victory, striking out five in 
six innings and Keith Ginter struck out two in the seventh to earn his second 
save for the host Indians. Josh Woolf and Donny Cisneros hit home runs for La 
Habra (2-3, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills 10, Buena Park 7 -- Carlos Herrera was four for five with two RBIs 
and three stolen bases and Scott Monson had two hits, three RBIs and three 
stolen bases for Sunny Hills (3-6, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Troy 8, Sonora 4 -- Brian Logan had one hit and three RBIs and Rick Parmenter 
had three hits and two RBIs to lead Troy (7-0, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Garden Grove League: 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta 8, Bolsa Grande 4 -- C.J. Livernois and Charlie Tuggle each had two 
hits and two RBIs to lead La Quinta (6-2, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos 3, Rancho Alamitos 2 -- Adam Elsaesser struck out seven and allowed 
one earned run in seven innings, Michael Garcia had two hits and two RBIs and 
Miguel Dorado had three hits for Los Amigos (2-7, 1-0). Rancho Alamitos is 2-7, 
1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica 10, Garden Grove 0 -- Chad Brown had two home runs and four RBIs and 
Zack Allen pitched a three-hitter for Pacifica (4-5, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago 1, Kennedy 0 -- Robert Wiemann had a two-out single to score 
Christian Cortez, who had reached first on a dropped third strike, to win the 
game for Santiago (2-4, 1-0). Cortez also got the victory by pitching a hitless 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange League: 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna 4, Magnolia 3 -- Joe Monzon pitched a five-hitter and Jeremy Klemp had 
two hits for Savanna (4-6, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Western 3, Brea-Olinda 1 -- Nick Swanson had a double and a home run to lead 
Western (2-0 in league). Mike Brambilla had a triple for Brea-Olinda (6-2, 
0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Redlands Calvary Chapel tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Christian 8, Liberty Christian 5 -- Keith Ridgeway had two 
hits and three RBIs and pitched five innings, striking out five, to earn his 
first victory for host Southern California Christian (6-1-1) in the consolation 
final. Tim St. Clair struck out four and allowed one hit in two innings of 
relief to earn his first save. Paul Malcom had a double and two runs scored for 
Liberty Christian (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague play: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran 7, Montebello Cantwell 1 -- Ryan McGreevy, Adam Cavaness and 
Tom Howard combined on a four-hitter and Nick Odenath had two hits and an RBI 
for Orange Lutheran (2-5).

NHL ROUNDUP; ESSENSA STILL NOT THE ANSWER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Detroit Red Wings were just a player short, and they got him -- goaltender 
Bob Essensa -- in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
 He has lost four games since, including a 5-4 decision at Ottawa on Wednesday 
in which he faced only 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Alexei Yashin completed a three-goal Senator comeback that brought 
victory in the Senators' first game home since an 18-day trip in which they 
lost seven of eight games and were outscored, 44-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings fell a point behind Toronto for first place in the NHL's Western 
Conference by losing to the league's worst team. It was only the 12th victory 
in 74 games for Ottawa, which dressed six new players and at one point had four 
of them on the ice at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Olympian Derek Mayer scored his first two NHL goals for the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg 3, Montreal 1 -- Tim Cheveldae, for whom Essensa was traded, ended 
the Canadiens' 11-game unbeaten streak, stopping 39 shots at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 1, Toronto 1 -- Stu Barnes scored a first-period goal at Hamilton, 
Canada, and the Panthers increased their lead over Philadelphia and the New 
York Islanders for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot to four points. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Buffalo 2 -- Curtis Joseph stopped 27 shots and Igor Korolev 
scored the game-winning goal for the Blues at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 5, Edmonton 3 -- Adam Graves set a club record with his 50th 
and 51st goals and Mike Richter made 28 saves for the Rangers at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves broke Vic Hadfield's team record of 50 goals, set in the 1971-72 
season.

SOUTH WINS GIRLS' SOCCER ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Hills goalkeeper Sarah Lang shut down a talented front line as the 
South defeated the North, 2-0, in the Orange County girls' soccer all-star game 
Wednesday at Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang played 90 minutes in goal, which was 10 minutes longer than a 
regular-season game, and stopped several excellent scoring chances by the 
North. 
</P>
<P>
 On offense, the South used a pair of unassisted goals on outstanding 
individual efforts by San Clemente's Jaime Greiner and Edison's Christine 
Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
 Greiner gave the South a 1-0 lead 20 minutes into the game when she ran down a 
pass, maneuvered around a North defender and beat El Modena goalkeeper Amy 
Moreno up high. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the half, Lang made the biggest save of the game, diving to her 
left to tip away a shot by Capistrano Valley's Lindsay Light. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang stopped two more open shots in the second half and also used her height 
to foil several North corner kicks late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With a minute to play, the South cushioned its lead when Tyler trapped a goal 
kick from Moreno at midfield and took off on a breakaway. Moreno came toward 
Tyler, but Tyler's shot was too high and hard, skipping off Moreno's hands and 
into the goal. DAN ARRITT

PREP NOTES: FOUNTAIN VALLEY'S BILLINGSLEY CHANGES MIND

 Gordon Billingsley said Wednesday he will remain as the Fountain Valley boys' 
basketball coach. Athletic Director Mike Henigan announced Monday that 
Billingsley had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked with some of the kids . . . Brandon Leimbach told me I was crazy to 
quit," Billingsley said. "But the decision to quit wasn't a spur of the moment 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few weeks ago, I told Mike I would resign. I didn't quit because I was 
tired of coaching, but it was more of a frustration thing. I haven't had anyone 
on campus to help out with the lower-level programs and I think those kids get 
cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I figured I've done this for five years by myself so I'll do it for a 
couple of more years," Billingsley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Billingsley is 64-65 at Fountain Valley, leading the Barons to the Southern 
Section Division I-AA quarterfinals this season, where they lost on a 
last-second shot to eventual-champion Long Beach Poly, 50-48. The Barons won 
their first Sunset League championship in Billingsley's five-year tenure.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; TITANS BEAT WICHITA STATE ON LATE SQUEEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Loyd's bases loaded suicide squeeze with one out in the bottom of the 
13th gave Cal State Fullerton a 5-4 victory over Wichita State Wednesday night 
at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Wichita State led 2-0 going into the bottom of the eighth before Fullerton's 
D.C. Olsen led the inning off with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 2-1, in the bottom of the ninth the Titans were able to tie the 
score on another home run, this one by Tony Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 Wichita State scored twice in the top of the 12th to take a 4-2 lead but 
Fullerton tied it in the bottom of the inning on a two-run single by 
pinch-hitter Robert Matos. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Wagner recorded his fifth victory of the year for the Titans.

seven hits, striking out one with no walks.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: ROGERS ENJOYS THE ELEMENTS OF A 
SUCCESSFUL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynn Rogers of Cal State Fullerton has been around long enough as a gymnastics 
coach that he can find pleasure in something other than simply winning. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't get the wrong idea. The goals for him and his athletes still revolve 
around winning the Big West Conference women's title Sunday at San Jose, doing 
well in the NCAA West Regional in three weeks and qualifying for the NCAA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a young coach, trying to establish yourself and get to the NCAAs, 
you might take someone just because you think they can help get you there," 
Rogers said. "But we don't do that anymore. We've made it our priority to 
recruit gymnasts who we feel will fit together well as team. Talent alone won't 
get you into our program now." 
</P>
<P>
 He is especially pleased by what he calls "the chemistry on this year's team." 
It is his 19th team at Fullerton, including one in 1979 that won a national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about this year's team and last year's, for that matter, is that 
the chemistry has been really positive. Their goals are in line with each 
other's goals and with the goals of the coaching staff," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 That, he says, has made the team particularly enjoyable to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, I've had some teams that were more nationally competitive that 
weren't as much fun to coach," Rogers said. "This is a much more relaxed group. 
Their attitudes have just been great." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans already have reached one of those preseason team goals. Friday's 
victory over UC Santa Barbara (191.675-186.975) assured Fullerton of a spot in 
the West Regional April 9 at Boise, Idaho. The winning team score was the 
ninth-best in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 The top seven teams in the region, based on regular-season scoring, will 
qualify, and it now appears that Fullerton will be seeded fourth. "If we have a 
good score in the Big West meet, we have a chance to be seeded third," Rogers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of winning the conference meet also appears to be within reach. The 
Titans, who finished their tough regular-season schedule with a 6-5 record, 
expect to face their most difficult competition from Idaho State. 
</P>
<P>
 "On paper, Idaho State may be favored," Rogers said, "but we're really looking 
forward to competing with them. We've established a good rivalry. We'll be in a 
neutral gym and I think we'll beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans will be relying on the performances of sophomore Cristi Clifford 
and seniors Celeste Delia and Karena Mills, the team's top three all-around 
performers. Alexis Lott, Heather Fritzsche and Natalie Meyer, all freshmen, 
also have played a significant role. Clifford qualified for the NCAAs as an 
individual last season and finished 28th nationally in the all-around. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers has been pleased by his team's consistency in the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went up to a higher level for the Michigan meet Feb. 25, and our 
performances since then have been almost identical," Rogers said. "That 
consistency is the most important thing to me right now. Our sport is not one, 
such as swimming, when you want to peak at a certain time. We want to get there 
and stay there for the next few weeks now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The win over Santa Barbara will allow us to train for this meet without as 
much pressure, because it will be impossible for Santa Barbara to knock us out 
of the regional now." 
</P>
<P>

 Al Mistri, Titan soccer coach, always welcomes a chance to see his players in 
action; he bubbles with enthusiasm at the mere thought. On Sunday, he will have 
the opportunity to see them go against the national under-20 team. The game is 
scheduled for 4 p.m. at Brea-Olinda High, where the national team will be 
training for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It basically will be our college team for next season playing," Mistri said. 
"It will give us a good look at the new guys on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 The new players expected to strengthen the Titans next season are Adrian 
Cortes, a transfer from Cal State Los Angeles, and Joshua Stringer, who played 
last season at Cal State San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri said he is looking forward to evaluating sophomore Mike Kornock , who 
is in line to replace senior Mike Ammann as the Titan goalkeeper. "We have high 
hopes for him," Mistri said. But Ammann won't be an easy act to follow. He was 
one of the leaders of the team that reached the NCAA semifinals last season and 
has been named to the national B team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll also be taking a look at (Alfred) Partida in his first try as a 
sweeper," Mistri said. "He played most of the time last season as a defensive 
midfielder." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Titan baseball team has fallen in the national rankings following last 
week's loss to Pepperdine. Baseball America has dropped Fullerton from second 
to fourth; USC (20-6) is ranked first, Georgia Tech (15-3) is second and 
Florida State (24-6) third. Collegiate Baseball has dropped Fullerton from 
first to second behind Georgia Tech. Florida State is third. . . . Second 
baseman Jeff Ferguson leads the Titans in hitting with a .368 average. Among 
the pitchers, Matt Wagner has a 4-0 record and 0.77 ERA. . . . Kirk Hagge, a 
shortstop for Crescenta Valley High, has committed to the Titans now that he 
has scored the NCAA-minimum on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Hagge has a 
team-leading .615 batting average.

SIMI VALLEY KNOCKS WESTLAKE OFF STRIDE; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: PIONEERS REPLACE 
OFF-SPEED ACE SCHEFFELS WITH HARD-THROWING KOZLOWSKI, POST 5-1 MARMONTE 
VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley High had to start its ace, Bill Scheffels, in the Marmonte League 
opener Wednesday at Westlake. At least, that's what Warrior Coach Rich Herrera 
figured. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess again, Rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer Coach Mike Scyphers chose No. 2 starter Kary Kozlowski, saving 
Scheffels for Friday's game against arch-rival Royal, and Kozlowski beat an 
off-balance Westlake team, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "All week long we thought we'd see Scheffels," Herrera said, "so we worked on 
hitting off-speed stuff.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were working on hitting the changeup, which is Scheffels' bread and 
butter." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski (3-0), a senior right-hander, came out throwing fastballs and 
sliders. He did not give up a hit in the first three innings, yielding only 
four hits in six. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski's only problem was control, normally his forte. He was consistently 
behind the count and walked four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't hit my spots," Kozlowski said. "I didn't have my good stuff. 
I feel pretty good to get out of here with a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's chance to beat Kozlowski came in the fourth, when the Warriors 
loaded the bases with two out on a single and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 A run scored on Kasey Davis' infield single, but Kozlowski escaped by inducing 
Brandon Zimmerman to hit a routine grounder to shortstop Dan Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (3-3) did not threaten Simi Valley in the remaining three 
innings, with only two batters reaching first and none reaching second against 
Kozlowski and Jeff Weaver, who pitched the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (5-1) scored all the runs it would need in the first inning 
against right-hander Chris Flanagan (2-1), who pitched a complete game.  
</P>
<P>
 With one out, second baseman Tim Nykoluk doubled and scored on a single by 
Ryan Hankins, who was two for two and scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels then walked and he and Hankins advanced on a passed ball. After a 
popup, catcher Brian Kavanagh singled in two runs, giving Simi Valley a 3-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That two-out hit was clutch," Scyphers said. "They didn't get the hit when 
they needed it (in the fourth) and we did. That's the difference in the game."

AFTER CRECION BREAKS HIS NOSE, CHAMINADE TAKES ONE ON CHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having lost five consecutive games to Notre Dame High, Chaminade could have 
used Adam Crecion, one of its best hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Crecion, a senior right fielder, broke his nose in the second inning of 
Friday's game against Harvard-Westlake and will be out for the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Crecion, Chaminade could muster only five hits Wednesday in a 7-4 
Mission League defeat to Notre Dame when the Eagles' sixth-inning rally fell 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (7-1, 3-0 in league play) collected 12 hits and built a five-run 
lead before Chaminade (4-4, 1-2) made its run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've fallen into this pattern where we fall behind and rely on miraculous 
comebacks at the end," Chaminade Coach Dave Desmond said. "We just can't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 With Notre Dame ahead, 6-1, in the sixth, three Chaminade batters went to the 
plate with the bases loaded but couldn't manage a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame starting pitcher Matt Egan (2-0) walked Gabe Crecion to force home 
one run and reliever Juan Montes walked John Gunn to make it 6-3. Montes struck 
out Scot Dey and Scott Shubeck grounded out to end the inning. "They battled 
back and I knew we let up at times," Notre Dame Coach Tom Dill said. "They 
really did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Knights scored an insurance run in the top of the seventh on Rich 
Igou's home run, they called on Igou to prevent a possible comeback in the 
bottom of the inning. He struck out three and gave up one hit. Chaminade's 
Jason Giovannettone, who walked, scored the game's last run on a throwing 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Eddie Romero went two for three with a two-run homer over the 
right-field fence in the third for Notre Dame, which jumped ahead with two runs 
in the first and two in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Joel Orme (2-2) went the distance and took the loss for the Eagles. He 
went two for four and drove in a run with a double.

 Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays is expected to be sidelined for at least a

 Carter, whose three-run homer against Mitch Williams of the Philadelphia 
Phillies last fall in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 6 gave the Blue 
Jays their second consecutive World Series championship, was not believed to be 
seriously injured at first. The break was discovered during postgame X-rays.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: BROWN HAS FREE SPIRIT TICKLED PINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of the Mission College baseball team who attend Free Spirit games in the 
next few days might feel lost in a time warp.  
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit will wear brown jerseys that Coach John Klitsner says were 
last used by Mission, under a different coach, in the late '70s or early '80s. 
It's all part of a plan by Klitsner to get his team moving in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Klitsner dusted off the old jerseys for a nonconference game at Moorpark on 
March 17 and came away with a 3-2 victory in 11 innings. The Free Spirit 
(12-10, 6-6 in Southern California Athletic Conference play) has not played 
since but will be at home today in a nonconference game against Chaffey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit a cold spell," Klitsner said. "We lost five in a row (four in 
conference play) before we played Moorpark. . . . I said, 'Let's try something 
new,' so I brought out the old uniforms. We'll keep wearing them as long as we 
keep doing well. They actually look pretty nice." JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Bombs Away 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley baseball team continues to be involved in slugfests. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the Marauders (9-6, 3-3 in Foothill Conference play) lost to Citrus, 
18-4, in a conference game in Lancaster. It was the 11th game this season in 
which the Marauders or their opponents -- or both -- have scored in double 
digits. 
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable game was a 30-22 nonconference victory over Oxnard on Feb. 
19. A close second was a 21-13 conference loss to San Bernardino Valley on 
March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. CS NORTHRIDGE

<P>
 Huddle Up, Guys 
</P>
<P>
 If James (Scoody) Woods wants to talk football in the Cal State Northridge 
dugout, he won't have far to look for a lively conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a reserve outfielder best known as a defensive back on the Matador 
football team, is one of many former high school football standouts who play 
baseball for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Infielder Keyaan Cook (Montclair Prep), catcher Josh Smaler (Agoura) and 
pitchers Keven Kempton (El Monte), Evan Howland (El Camino Real), Marco 
Contreras (Gladstone) and Rick Orr (Sunny Hills) were Southland high school 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Jonathan Campbell (Poly) was the 1990 City Section 3-A Division 
player of the year as a tailback, first baseman Jason Shanahan (Sentinel of 
Missoula, Mont.) played tight end and outfielder Joey Arnold (Reseda) was a 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is on pace to obliterate its single-season school record for wild 
pitches -- 50 -- set in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matador staff has 40 through 28 games, and Rick Orr and John Najar share 
the school single-game record with four. Najar (5-2) unloaded four in each of 
his first two starts and has a team-high 16. 
</P>
<P>
 What's it all mean? Not much to the two junior right-handers. Najar leads the 
team in victories and Orr has the team's lowest ERA (3.41). Around the Campuses 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge turned 85 double plays in 1993 to lead all NCAA Division I teams. 
So far this season, the Matadors haven't turned more than their opponents -- 
and by a large deficit. The opposition has 32, Northridge 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge opponents have stolen 54 bases in 66 attempts (81.8%). 
</P>
<P>
 * Since hitting rock-bottom in a 14-2 loss to Florida on Feb. 26, the 
Northridge offense raised its batting average 50 points to a season-high .295 
entering play this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Northridge golf team recorded its best finish of the season last week at 
the University of San Diego Ashworth Invitational, finishing second at 895, 15 
shots behind Cal State Stanislaus. Chad Holden and Nolley Adkinson of 
Northridge tied for second individually in the 54-hole event at 220. Tony 
Bordwell, a senior from El Camino Real High, leads the team with a stroke 
average of 76.8. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Northridge men's 1,600-meter relay team of Derek Favorite, Akiem Brown, 
Troy Collins and Chris Brown moved to ninth on the Matadors' all-time list with 
a third-place time of 3 minutes 12.83 seconds in Saturday's Collegiate Classic 
at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 * Point guard Dave Ulloa of Cal Lutheran moved into a tie for 12th on the 
Kingsmen single-season list with 121 assists. With 199 assists in two seasons, 
Ulloa ranks 15th on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Master's (28-5) shot 50% or better from the field in 17 games this 
season, but the Mustangs' 98-86 loss to Georgia Southwestern in the first round 
of the NAIA Division I tournament marked the first time they hit at least half 
their shots and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judging by the results of this year's NAIA championships, seedings counted 
for little. The final four teams were seeded fifth, 16th, 19th and 26th at the 
start of the 32-team tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortstop Jose Offerman's solid spring continued at an accelerated pace 
Wednesday as he scored three runs, drove in three runs and went three for five 
as part of the Dodgers' 21-hit attack in an 18-10 victory over Jim Abbott and 
the New York Yankees at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman also played his 16th spring game without an error and made a sweeping 
slide that avoided catcher Mike Stanley's tag at the plate in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really has changed," Manager Tom Lasorda said of Offerman, who is hitting 
.340 this spring. "His personality has changed, his attitude is changed. I 
think what helped him more than anything was getting the two-year contract."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park and the Dodgers received word Tuesday from the commissioner's 
office that his hesitation-kick delivery has been ruled illegal and that he 
will be called for a balk if he attempts the delivery again. Park, who pitched 
effectively without the pause Monday, said that he will have no problems after 
the ruling. "It really doesn't matter to me," Park said through interpreter Don 
Yi. "It's just one of the many things that I do." . . . Mike Piazza's home run 
against Abbott in the second was his seventh of the spring, breaking Mike 
Marshall's club record set in 1984. . . . Darryl Strawberry, his third, and 
Carlos Hernandez, his second, also homered for the Dodgers. . . . Dodger 
starter Orel Hershiser gave up six runs on six hits before recording an out in 
the first inning, but settled down and gave up only one more run during a 5 
2/3-inning stint. TIM KAWAKAMI

 Cory Snyder, in Los Angeles to treat an inflammation of his lower back, said 
he was feeling better. Before he suffered the back injury, Snyder was expected 
to be the backup not only for the outfield but for Offerman at shortstop. But 
even with Snyder injured, the club is leaning toward Mike Sharperson over 
Rafael Bournigal because Sharperson would give them added depth on the bench.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; RODGERS UNSURE ABOUT YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers, suspicious of New York Met starter Anthony Young's 
injury, is uncertain now whether he wants to trade for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, scratched from his last start because of a strained groin, according to 
Met officials, is scheduled to pitch one or two innings today against the 
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who would trade first baseman J.T. Snow to acquire Young, have 
assigned scouts Moose Stubing and Matt Keough to evaluate Young's performance. 
If Young pitches well, Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi will be left with his 
biggest decision of his two-month tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be they're hiding something," Rodgers said of the Mets. 
"Somebody's hiding something. It's all very mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I know is that the Mets are peddling Young very heavily, they 
don't want to bring him back to New York, and he's not pitching. If they want 
to peddle somebody, you should be running that sucker out there every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who underwent surgery last September to have a spur removed from his 
right elbow, complained of a strained groin last week. Several of his teammates 
privately wondered if Young created an excuse just so he would not be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Young has made no secret that he would prefer to stay in New York, or if he's 
traded, would like to return to his hometown of Houston. Of course, Snow 
doesn't want to be traded, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are skeptical whether he's hurt at all," Rodgers said. "You have 9,000 
different kinds or reports. You don't know if he has a pulled groin, a sore 
arm, or he just doesn't want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why if you ask, 'Are we comfortable with the trade?' I don't think we 
are. Something's not jiving. I've just got a funny feeling about it because of 
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm lukewarm on this whole idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets probably would make available pitchers Eric Hillman or Pete Schourek 
if the Angels do not want Young, but the Angels have shown little interest in 
either.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Mark Langston left camp to attend family matters at home, but is 
still scheduled to start Friday against the Oakland Athletics. . . . Mark 
Leiter pitched for the first time since joining the Angels, but he might have 
only one more outing before the Angels decide on Tuesday whether to keep him. 
Leiter yielded four hits and two runs (one earned) in two innings as the 
Colorado Rockies defeated the Angels, 8-7, in 10 innings. "I'm disappointed I 
gave up the runs because I felt better than that," he said. . . . Starter Joe 
Magrane pitched 10 minutes of batting practice for the first time since his 
arthroscopic elbow surgery last month and reported no discomfort. BOB

OFF THE TICKER: NEXT: VIDEO GAMES THAT GET PHYSICAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You need to exercise, but you'd rather play video games? Do both, says Life 
Fitness Inc., maker of Lifecycle exercise bikes that plans this summer to 
unveil an "Exertainment" version with game maker Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike, expected to retail about $1,000, is for use with a separate Nintendo 
system.Success at the games depend on how consistently riders are able to pedal 
within a target heart rate. 
</P>
<P>
 A system by HeartBeat Corp., a licensee of Sega, already sells a device that 
includes "Outback Joey" video games in which a character sweats profusely and 
falls from dehydration if the exerciser's heart rate gets too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtual reality could crank up the movement, said Justin Hall-Tipping, who 
founded HeartBeat. "I expect we will develop exploratory games, like pedaling 
through . . . France."

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: TESTING CD-ROM DRIVES: MAC AND PC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of the rapid growth in publication of CD-ROM programs, there are more 
reasons every day to install a CD-ROM drive in your computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4.75-inch plastic discs that play in these drives can store more than 600 
megabytes of data, the equivalent of more than 250,000 pages of text or 
thousands of images. They also can store sound, in CD format just like the 
music discs from which the technology was derived, or as digitized audio data. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that capacity, the CD-ROM disc is a natural for everything from 
nationwide telephone directories to encyclopedias to a complete tour of the 
National Gallery in London. 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROM stands for Compact Disc Read-Only Memory, which means the discs can be 
played but you can't add data to them as you can a floppy diskette or a hard 
disk. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are about to buy a PC or a Macintosh, you would be well advised to 
spend a few hundred dollars extra to get one equipped with a CD-ROM drive, a 
stereo audio system and a couple of speakers, so you will be ready to play any 
CD-ROM disc that catches your fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you already own a fast, late-model computer, it's worth adding a CD-ROM 
drive. Although models are available for installation inside the computer, in 
most cases an external CD-ROM drive is the only kind your computer will have 
room for. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like everything concerning computers, speed is an issue in CD-ROM drive 
choice, with so-called double-speed models being the most common these days. 
There are a few triple-speed and quadruple-speed models, and by the end of the 
year, quad-speed units probably will be common. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For typical office and home uses today's double-speed drives work just fine, 
so there's no reason to wait for faster models to proliferate. But be aware 
that various manufacturers measure drive speed in different ways, so their 
specifications may not be directly comparable. If top performance is critical, 
study the comparisons in the leading computer magazines before you choose. 
</P>
<P>
 I tested two external CD-ROM drives, the CDX-535 from Chinon America Inc. and 
the TXM3401E1 from Toshiba American Information Systems Inc. Both work with 
Macintosh and PC computers, but you have to buy them packaged specifically for 
your type of computer to get the right cables, software and, in the case of 
PCs, the right interface card. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical prices for Chinon models range from about $350 to $450. For the 
Toshiba, prices run below $400 for the PC version and under $450 for the Mac 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are suitable for multimedia use. They comply with industry specifications 
such as multimedia PC (MPC), multisession Photo CD, CD audio and CD-ROM XA 
(extended architecture). 
</P>
<P>
 For Macintosh models, all you have to do is plug them into the computer and 
install the software drivers. For PCs, you need at least an interface card 
installed in a slot inside the computer and connected to the CD-ROM drive by a 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
 In a business setting where the CD-ROM discs may contain only data, you don't 
need a sound card in the PC. (Macs have sound built in.) But for home, you've 
got to have sound to get full use of all the reference and entertainment CD-ROM 
programs aimed at that market. That means you need a second card for your PC 
unless you buy a sound card that also has an interface connector for a CD-ROM 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a peculiarity of CD-ROM discs that they may contain two kinds of sound 
recording. CD audio sound can be played by the drive itself, which you can hear 
through earphones plugged into the drive. But digitized sound has to be 
converted by a sound card before it can be heard. In encyclopedia CD-ROMs, for 
instance, digitized sound tracks may accompany a video sequence of a famous 
speech, with CD-audio sound tracks to demonstrate the works of a famous 
composer. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have two slots available in your computer you shouldn't have any 
trouble getting the sound card and the CD-ROM card to coexist, but if you 
expect to have one card handle both sound and the CD-ROM drive, be careful. The 
two devices are not universally compatible, so you need to make sure the 
systems you intend to combine will work together. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Chinon and Toshiba CD-ROM drives tested have similar performance 
specifications: the Chinon drive claims a "sustained" transfer rate of 300 
kilobytes a second and a 280-millisecond seek time; the Toshiba drive claims an 
"average" transfer of 327 kilobytes a second with a "random" seek time of 200 
milliseconds and full-stroke access time of 325 milliseconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In use with a variety of educational, reference and entertainment CD-ROM 
discs, I couldn't discern any performance difference between them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinon is much smaller than the Toshiba, so it fit better on my cramped 
desktop. The Chinon is 6 inches wide, 2 1/4 inches high and 10 inches deep (but 
you need to allow at least another 4 inches for the thick cable and connector). 
</P>
<P>
 The Toshiba 8.75 inches wide, 2 3/4 inches high and 9.5 inches deep, and needs 
the same rear clearance. A major reason for the Toshiba's girth is its internal 
power supply, which means its electrical cord plugs directly into an outlet. 
The Chinon, on the other hand, takes its power from an AC adapter that measures 
about 2 1/2 inches by 2 1/2 inches by 5 inches and gets hot to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinon adapter card was very easy to install and offers 16 alternate 
settings to resolve conflicts with other cards in the computer. The Toshiba 
card has six alternates and none of them worked on my computer until, with help 
from Toshiba's technical service department, I made a fundamental change in my 
computer's system setup instructions. It means that the Toshiba card is less 
forgiving of system aberrations than the Chinon card.

 Kennedy High School in La Palma falls a bit short when it comes to restrooms, 
according to an article in the student newspaper, the Shamrock. 
</P>
<P>
 City code, the paper said, dictates that there be one lavatory for every 40 
students.But the school only has one for every 59 males and one for every 45 
females (and two of those are closed because of security). "There's not enough 
time to go between classes considering the lines," a female student lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 A junior has crusaded to have doors put back on the stalls in the boy's 
restroom, saying, "How would you like it if they took away the girls' doors? 
It's just not right." A teacher agrees: "It's an example of sexual inequality. 
Males have no privacy in the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The crusade brought action. The principal says doors have been ordered. And 
there has been at least one improvement this year. "There's more toilet paper 
now," one student said.

 After more than a decade, the celebrated Air Guitar show at Capistrano Valley 
High School in Mission Viejo has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Only eight groups auditioned, even though the tryout date was extended to 
increase participation.And that wasn't enough to put together a good show, 
according to the student newspaper, the CVHS Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, nine students who had opted to attend the new Aliso Niguel High 
School, touted as a state-of-the-art facility, have decided to return to 
Capistrano Valley after one semester, according to the newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 "The only advanced technology they had was the Dinacom system, which wasn't 
even available to use until after Christmas. I do have to say that the 
skylights were pretty neat, though," one student said.

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; RESURRECTION OF A WOMAN BOTH SCORNED AND BELOVED; RAGE 
AND FIRE: A LIFE OF LOUISE COLET -- PIONEER FEMINIST, LITERARY STAR, FLAUBERT'S

<TEXT>
<P>
 Francine du Plessix Gray begins her resurrection of Louise Colet, a minor 
19th-Century French writer now known mainly as Flaubert's lover and literary 
correspondent, with two dramatic scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first describes their last meeting. Colet furiously berates Flaubert for 
infidelity, kicking him rhythmically in the shins to make her points, while he 
fantasizes about braining her with a fireplace log. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second scene, toward the end of his life, he burns great batches of 
correspondence. One packet of letters contains a slipper, a rose and a lace 
handkerchief; Flaubert kisses them sorrowfully before consigning them to the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Each scene has its source. The first is a friend's account of what Flaubert 
told him; the second, a memoir by Guy de Maupassant, who was present at the 
burning. Each has the flavor of a tale, as well; in different ways, both 
Flaubert and De Maupassant came to regard life mainly as material for literary 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Plessix Gray, another writer, does her own transforming. 
</P>
<P>
 The anonymous rose, slipper, handkerchief and letters, she believes, were 
Louise Colet's. "That is why I have written this book," she tells us. "To 
reinstate a colleague into the annals of her time. To do her justice. To 
resurrect yet another woman whose memory has been erased by the caprices of 
men." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is "Rage and Fire" or (this is the reviewer's own bit of 
transforming) "Louise: The Miniseries." The dramatic parting and the infinite 
regret, years later, are mood-setting shots. Then, in flashback, comes the 
story, punctuated by the surges of Du Plessix Gray's background music. She has 
chosen to write her biography in the style of a flamboyant romantic novel -- 
old-fashioned in its rhetorical sentiment, modern in its insertion of practical 
sexual detail -- perhaps a tribute to Colet's own effusive writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1811 to a conservative but indulgent bourgeois father and a mother 
whose own father was both a minor aristocrat and a revolutionary, Colet was 
encouraged to read books and write poetry. She married a musician with a small 
post at the Paris Conservatory, and arrived in the capital determined to make 
her literary mark. When she sent out a book of poems for blurbs, the writer 
Chateaubriand returned a polite refusal. Colet used the refusal for its 
politeness, and sent copies to prospective patrons. She found one in Victor 
Cousin, president of the Sorbonne and a leading member of the Academy. He 
became her lover and protector, got her a stipend and her husband a promotion, 
and furnished her Thursday salons with other Academicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Large, blond, blue-eyed and expansive, she acquired lovers, friends and 
enemies among all the important literary figures of the day. Flaubert was her 
great passion; he returned the passion sporadically and complained that she was 
excessively demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wrote her remarkable letters telling of his struggles to write "Madame 
Bovary." The tempestuous affair has been much written of; Du Plessix Gray tells 
it with flamboyant partisanship which, nevertheless, allows us to glimpse 
Flaubert's discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Colet was a devout Romantic and political radical, a prominent hostess -- 
though sometimes financially compelled to re-use the tea leaves -- and a 
prolific producer of poetry, novels and journalism. She wrote to support 
herself and to be noticed, and more or less succeeded at both. Contemporaries 
praised or mocked her febrile style approximately in the degree that they liked 
her, or not. Ever since, her writings have alternated between obscurity and an 
occasional mild reappraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Plessix Gray's literary appraisal is mild, as well. Her interest is in 
Colet as a woman who struggled gallantly to fulfill herself -- artistically, 
sexually, socially -- in a time of gross sexual inequality and intellectual 
discrimination; as an early feminist, in other words. Her success is spotty. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, though she respects what facts exist, there are some real gaps. 
Colet seems to have saved the letters of most of the famous people she was 
involved with; not as many seem to have saved hers. Which does, in a way, 
provide a basis for Du Plessix Gray's resurrecting mission: abuse and 
intellectual hostility apart, 19th-Century male French intellectuals simply did 
not take women seriously. On the other hand, there may not have been much to 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast with George Sand -- the two did not get along -- is overwhelming. 
Sand was a far better writer even if, like Colet, she wrote too much. More to 
the point, perhaps, she was a brilliantly perceptive and immensely humane 
figure; her correspondence -- notably with Flaubert -- demonstrates it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colet memoirs and letters that Du Plessix Gray quotes from are vehement, 
angry and exalted by turns, and they can occasionally be moving. Essentially, 
though, they are empty. Little that Colet says in her own right, little that 
anyone else in this book is recorded as saying about her and -- finally -- 
little that Du Plessix Gray writes, can display much beyond need and courage. 
This is a lot, perhaps, but it is not enough to establish a memorable or even 
interesting mind and spirit.

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: 'HOW WE DIE' BECOMES SURPRISE HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, Paul D. Colford is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Sherwin B. Nuland set aside his surgical practice and teaching chores to 
write a book, friends asked what exactly was keeping him from the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would tell them what my book was about -- and that would end the 
conversation," Nuland recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Many others have been far less squeamish. Nuland's "How We Die" (Knopf), a 
graphic but sage reflection on the ways people die from heart attacks, cancer 
and other killers, has become what would seem to be the unlikeliest bestseller 
of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Compelling text, fine reviews and abundant broadcast interest have stirred 
sales so that the initial print run of 50,000 copies last month has since grown 
to 307,000. After a recent TV hour with Oprah Winfrey, who interviewed Nuland 
along with several terminally ill patients, the Waldenbooks chain reported 
selling nearly 2,900 copies last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't say anything that people don't know," Nuland says. Or that people 
don't want to know. "We have been fed a diet of pap about death -- that 
thinking good thoughts can cure cancer, for example -- while people crave the 
truth and reality about death." 
</P>
<P>
 Nuland, 63, draws truth and reality from his four decades as a doctor, 
beginning with the '50s before cardiopulmonary resuscitation, when he once cut 
open a man's chest in a futile bid to jump-start his stricken heart by hand. 
Eyes bulging, fists balled up against his chest, the man soon "roared out to 
the distant heavens a dreadful rasping whoop that sounded like the hounds of 
heaven were barking," Nuland writes. "Only later did I realize that what I had 
heard was the man's version of the death rattle, a sound made by spasm in the 
muscles of the voice box." 
</P>
<P>
 Nuland began to write "How We Die" two years ago. This was before Betty J. 
Eadie's "Embraced by the Light" (Gold Leaf Press), a Christian account of her 
near-death experience, began its appearances atop bestseller lists and spawned 
other death-minded titles. The latest, Dannion Brinkley's "Saved by the Light" 
(Villard), which tells of the author's two near-death encounters, recently went 
back to press for an additional 5,000 copies that raise its in-print total to 
40,000 after two weeks on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuland, whose effort breaks down one of publishing's last taboos with its 
candor, does not claim credit for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary agent Glen Hartley, of Writers' Representatives in New York, 
envisioned the market for such a book and conceived of the attention-grabbing 
title, despite the assurance of several physicians that people would not want 
to know the nitty-gritty of how we die. Hartley eventually phoned Nuland in 
hopes of enlisting him to write "How We Die," but the surgeon had other 
representation at the time and was working on another book. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that night I found myself thinking about my adolescence," Nuland 
recalled. "My mother died when I was 11, which was a central event of my life, 
and in years of practice I had treated numerous patients who died from terminal 
illnesses. I thought, 'Why am I saying no to this idea?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nuland called Hartley back and became a client. Nuland's proposal earned him a 
six-figure advance from Knopf and enabled the publisher to sell publication 
rights in 14 other countries. Knopf last year sent the first chapter to 
booksellers -- a tease usually reserved for upcoming novels -- to help generate 
the orders that now far exceed Nuland's expectations.

 On the Racks: Combine Binney & Smith, the maker of Crayola crayons, and 
Meredith Corp., the publisher of Ladies' Home Journal and other publications, 
and you get Crayola Kids magazine, which premiered on newsstands this week. To 
be published six times a year and aimed at youngsters 3 to 8, Crayola Kids is a 
happy, interactive magazine that invites readers to color or cut up pages and 
showcases stories plucked from children's books. Example: "The Day Jimmy's Boa 
Ate the Wash" is followed by a page containing a coiled boa ready for crayons 
and scissors. . . .

 A birthday-suited Joie Susannah Lee, Spike Lee's actress sister, adorns the

Sheryl E. Huggins defines the mission, "Shade is about covering New World 
Afrikan culture with guts, intelligence and style." First-person articles 
include Kim Lightfoot's look back at the city's now-departed underground clubs, 
such as Paradise Garage and the Shelter.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; CHOICE ABOUT DRUGS IS STILL INDIVIDUAL'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found your articles on teens and drugs in the Feb. 24 edition to be very 
accurate and truthful. Rather than showing only negative arguments, the article 
had real students tell why they do or don't do drugs and how widespread drug 
use is in Orange County high schools.I myself have never done drugs but have 
friends who do and have considered trying drugs on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 High school students and young adults will most always respect the opinions of 
their friends and peers rather than authority figures or anti-drug speakers. I 
have repeatedly heard from my friends, regarding LSD and marijuana, statements 
like: "You just have to try it at least once," or "It's not addictive; you can 
stop whenever you want." I accept these statements much more quickly than any 
"say-no-to-drugs" slogans because I know the people personally. 
</P>
<P>
 I think anti-drug campaigns and such are still needed because they may help 
persuade some people, and simply hearing nothing from the adult community about 
the bad side of drugs would almost advocate their use. However, drugs will 
always be available, and there will always be someone using them. 
</P>
<P>
 Like anything, people must decide for themselves whether drugs are for them. 
Even though we are kids, it is our decision because drugs are available to us.  
</P>
<P>
 As for myself, I turn the question over and over in my mind and eventually 
come to one conclusion. No matter what, I'll just be better off if I never try 
them.

ALBUM REVIEW; SUCH BAD MATERIAL OUGHT TO BE OUTLAWED

 * 1/2 Tim McGraw "Not a Moment Too Soon" 
</P>
<P>
 Curb * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's only a fine line separating benign insensitivity and outright 
stupidity, but McGraw oversteps that line by a country mile on this album, his 
second. And because he does it more than once, he relinquishes any right to any 
benefit of any doubt for something as embarrassing as his current hit, "Indian 
Outlaw." 
</P>
<P>
 A Randy Newman might be able to salvage something illuminating from the 
number's premise of a guy who boasts "I'm an Indian outlaw / half Cherokee and 
Choctaw / My baby's she's a Chippewa." But if the song's writers (Tommy Barnes 
and Gene Simmons) were aiming for satire by invoking every bad media stereotype 
of Native Americans imaginable, nobody let McGraw in on the joke. 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case you think the song is as lunkheaded as they come, keep 
listening. "Indian Outlaw" is followed by a poor Jimmy Buffett knockoff called 
"Refried Dreams" in which a heartbroken cowpoke finds himself "messed up in 
Mexico and livin' on refried dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Other songs may be less offensive ethnically, but they are every bit as bereft 
of believable characters and situations. In fact, nearly every one depends 
exclusively on cliches pertaining to whatever it is McGraw is singing about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Louisiana-born musician -- the son of ex-Philadelphia Phillies pitching 
great Tug McGraw -- has a moderately effective voice that strikes a middle 
ground between Garth Brooks' and John Anderson's. But he has given himself 
precious little worth singing about. It's this sophomoric effort that ends "not 
a moment too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings range from * (pathetic) to **** (miraculous). Three stars denote a 
solid recommendation.

 Healing Arts: Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," a collage of 
monologues about the Los Angeles riots and their aftermath that opened last 
summer at the Mark Taper Forum, has its official New York premiere today at the 
Joseph Papp Public Theater. After closing there April 3, the show then moves to 
Broadway's Cort Theatre for an April 17 opening. According to New York Newsday 
theater critic and columnist Linda Winer, the George C. Wolfe-directed N.Y. 
show is radically different from the Emily Mann-directed L.A. version, 
including only a handful of the characters seen here. It now focuses less on 
the specific events of the riots, and turns instead to the events before and 
afterward.

celebrates the highlights of stage productions performed by the precision dance 
team over the years. The show is directed and choreographed by Tony and Emmy

 Just a 'Normal 11-Year-Old': Young Oscar-winner Anna Paquin won't have much 
time to celebrate when she returns to her New Zealand home next week -- she's 
off to school camp. "She will take it in her stride," said Paul Drummond, 
Paquin's headmaster. "She will get back to school and get back to normal. Her 
classmates will be thrilled to see her again. She's just a normal 11-year-old 
girl." Drummond said his Hutt Intermediate School erupted at the news of 
Paquin's best supporting actress win for "The Piano": "I heard it first down a 
corridor. I could hear teachers still working screaming from the other end of 
the building. Then the phone calls started coming in." Paquin, who charmed TV 
viewers with her breathless gulps after winning her Academy Award Monday, was 
selected from among 5,000 girls to play in "The Piano." To prepare, she had to 
learn a Scottish accent as well as sign language to communicate with her mute 
mother in the film. Friends said that Paquin would probably have a future film 
career, but that school would have to come first. TV & RADIO

 Limbaugh Watch: Florida lawmakers are putting the squeeze on the citrus 
commissioners who hired Rush Limbaugh as Florida orange juice's new pitchman. A 
state Senate committee showed its displeasure with the conservative 
commentator's $1-million contract by holding up the confirmation of three 
appointees to the Florida Citrus Commission. "We're looking for people who will 
present the best possible image for Florida citrus -- not people who will 
engender hate, disregard for minorities, or represent any political 
philosophy," Sen. Peter Weinstein said. "I just wonder what prompted them to 
hire someone so unbelievably controversial, rather than a spokesperson who more 
accurately reflects the mainstream thinking in this country." Senate 
Agriculture Chairman Mark Foley defended the choice as good business, based on 
the ratings of Limbaugh's syndicated talk show.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: THEIR HUMOR COMES OUT IN JEST MEASURE; THREE LOCAL BANDS 
HAVE THEIR FUN GETTING SILLY, FUNNY AND SOMETIMES MANIC IN NEW RELEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM

<TEXT>
<P>
 With April 1 approaching, we turn our attention to recent releases by local 
bands with a sense of humor. There's the crude punk-rock comedy of the Vandals, 
the often silly but sometimes illuminating pop-rock ditties of the Ziggens, and 
the manic, absurdist antics of the artsy Vitamin L. Ratings range from * 
(pathetic) to **** (miraculous). Three stars denote a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 *** The Ziggens "Rusty Never Sleeps" 
</P>
<P>
 Skunk Records (cassette) 
</P>
<P>
 With their second album, the Ziggens delight once more in the sillier aspects 
of mundane living. They drop tacky pop references as if they were dimes, 
invoking in passing the likes of Kenny Rogers, Gomer Pyle, Crystal Gayle and 
Lawrence Welk. Gilligan and the Skipper get an entire song to themselves. Other 
cuts discuss such downers as dandruff and datelessness, or proclaim the 
delights of grocery shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're getting the idea that these guys are too innocuous and simple-minded 
to merit your attention in these troubled times of ours, hold on for a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, the Ziggens are a sharp little trio that reminds us how rewarding 
it is to hear a band rock with zip and dexterity, just for the fun of it. 
There's a bit of the spirit (if not the virtuosity and sophistication) of NRBQ 
and the Turtles at play as Bert Ziggen, Brad Ziggen and Jon Ziggen go at it. 
</P>
<P>
 The album is a deftly woven patchwork of exuberant, Buddy Holly-style roots 
rock, surf music, Beach Boys-inspired harmony, folk-pop balladry, kitschy 
country twanging and lean, muscular garage-punk. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the silly stuff, there are flashes of poignancy and even insight. 
"Call It Quits," by guitarist and main songwriter Bert Susanka, is a collection 
of disconnected, seemingly slapdash images scattered around a core of sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 One could dismiss it as an example of unfocused songwriting, but it is far 
more meaningful to take this romantic breakup song as a portrait of how a mind 
in pain tries to wander away from the thing it doesn't want to face. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Brad Conyers is the band's bard of childhood, wistfully exploring the 
workings of fragmentary memory in "On the Way" and, in the robust "Dickie Built 
a Halfpipe," evoking the wonder that can be implicit in the small, everyday 
things that happen in suburban back yards and kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 In songs like these, the Ziggens come off as cousins to Jonathan Richman, 
another playful but insightful rocker whom some dismiss as softheaded because 
of his innocent stance and almost boundless capacity for silliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of "Rusty Never Sleeps" is straightforward. Susanka confronts his 
mortality in the sweet acoustic strum "When I Die." Playing the part of an 
onlooker at his own funeral, he laments that the one thing missing from his 
life was spiritual awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Tryin,' " a fine, surging rocker, also has a serious, questing 
undercurrent. In the deeply felt anthem "Carry Your Cross," Susanka strives to 
find meaning in suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, and Gilligan, too. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available at Bionic Records, Zed Records, and from the Ziggens, (714) 
848-7711, or P.O. Box 2354, Buena Park, CA 90621-2354.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Ziggens play April 9 at Club 5902 in Huntington Beach, with Sublime. (714) 
840-6118. ** Vitamin L "Uno Dos" 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin L has the uno-dos of rhythm down reasonably well on this frantically 
wailing debut album, in which metallic guitars scream, bass and drums hammer 
out thrash tempos or boom with frenzied funk, and a trombone brays at strategic 
moments and adds to the avant-garde, jazz-tinged flavor of the whole thing. 
What's missing is some of that do-re-mi, boys. When it comes to melody, Vitamin 
L is a washout. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the good ingredients at its disposal, including strong musicianship, a 
surplus of energy, and an extroverted front man, Vitamin L generates enough 
interesting material to fill out a solid half-hour EP. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the band carries on for 70 wearing, hyperactive minutes. By the 
end, you find yourself wishing you could grab the players and stuff a megadose 
of Ritalin down Vitamin L's collective gullet. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's sonic collage recalls such punk-funk-metal style-mixers as Faith No 
More and, closer to home, the 1980s Orange County band, El Grupo Sexo. The 
influence of such fringy rockers as Frank Zappa and Pere Ubu's David Thomas 
also crops up in numbers like "467 Lb. Wife," a willfully artsy number full of 
zany colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer David Leon is a musical actor who possesses some of the theatricality 
of Thomas, Faith No More's Mike Patton, or Chad Jasmine of National People's 
Gang. But all three of them can carry a tune; Leon, from the evidence here, 
cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the band applies its out-there means to everyday situations. 
"Nels" portrays the downside of doing manual labor and working in a family 
business. "Swimming," probably the most accessible number, envisions life as an 
aquatic obstacle course of whirlpools and treacherous currents. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fanciful side, the cinematic, martial-cadenced "I King Roach" offers a 
big-screen view of hidden bug life. Claw Hammer's distinctive singer, Jon Wahl, 
lends wired, yelping assistance on "Some Call Me Gabby," one of several tracks 
that is impressive for the sheer mania of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The only relatively calm departures are the loungy "Vegas," a character study 
of a high-roller with a preference for prostitutes, and "Clarabone," a 
too-brief, traditional jazz interlude for clarinet and trombone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This song may not be as sweet as 'Strawberry Fields,' but it cuts right 
through to the truth," Vitamin L boasts in "Some Call Me Gabby." Maybe so, but 
here is one case where it would not hurt to embellish the truth with something 
hummable. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available from Vitamin L, P.O. Box 9291, Anaheim, CA 92812-7291.) 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin L plays April 1 at the Roxy in West Hollywood. (310) 276-2222. ** The 
Vandals "Sweatin' to the Oldies: The Vandals Live" 
</P>
<P>
 Triple X Some bands might be tempted to pad a live album with canned applause 
to give the impression that things were more exciting on the night in question 
than they actually were. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vandals, being perverse by nature, appear to have inserted extra boos and 
abuse to give this album the desired plot line, in which a satiric punk outfit 
uses quick wits and loud amplification to fight off a less-than-welcoming 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 I was there, sweatin' along with everyone else at the ironically named Ice 
House in Fullerton when this album was recorded on Jan. 2, 1993. I don't 
remember the resistance to the Vandals being quite so loud or persistent as the 
recording would suggest, although the give-and-take between band members and 
hecklers recorded here is no doubt genuine. ("There's no warm fuzzies here, 
everyone's a cold prickly," guitarist Warren Fitzgerald observes at one point.) 
</P>
<P>
 As satirists and comic chroniclers of O.C. punk since their debut in the early 
1980s, the Vandals probably feel it isn't fun if they aren't rubbing some 
people the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 There is enough crude talk on "Sweatin' to the Oldies" to rile the 
right-minded. It's dismaying that the Vandals included the profanely 
misogynistic "H.B. Hotel," and discomfiting that singer Dave Quackenbush 
delivers it with more relish and intensity than most of the other songs here. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald's sexual commentary in a long digression during "Teenage Idol" 
keeps up the band's reputation for outrageousness.  
</P>
<P>
 This Vandals' lineup (bassist Joey Escalante is the only holdover from the 
early days) does best when sticking to the musical business at hand. 
Fitzgerald's metal-tinged guitar keeps up a razory buzz, and drummer Josh 
Freese adorns thrashing beats with propulsive, fast-rolling fills. Escalante's 
bass is simple and punchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 16 tracks, seven aren't really oldies, but were culled from "Fear of a 
Punk Planet," the 1991 album that ushered in the current lineup. Maybe that's 
why fans out for an evening's punk nostalgia can be heard cussing and booing. 
</P>
<P>
 The set does include good versions of such Vandals staples as "The Legend of 
Pat Brown," "Lady Killer" and "Urban Struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 One hates to be a cold prickly, but "Sweatin' to the Oldies" isn't exactly an 
essential document. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 'FLING' HAS SOME AGE-OLD PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television sitcom-guru-turned-playwright Bernard Slade dealt with marital 
infidelity that worked out just dandy in his first play, "Same Time Next Year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In "Fling," at Concordia University's Studio Theatre, he examines the other 
side of the coin, the possibility of infidelity that tempts but doesn't 
captivate happily married Michael Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael is a one-woman guy who has, in 18 years of marriage, never cheated on 
his wife, Kate. Even Kate finds that a bit curious. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Kate finds out that Michael slept with her maid-of-honor, Hilary, three 
days before their wedding, and 19 years after the fact she goes into a snit, 
leaving said maid-of-honor plenty of opportunity to prove that Michael is 
certainly capable of more than just lusting in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a heavyweight play, but it does have a couple of moments of honest 
marital tenderness, and it has an unmistakable moral. In a program note, 
director Mark Manning frankly admits that moral was the reason he chose this 
play to direct. 
</P>
<P>
 The production is not as admirable as his intentions -- for reasons he could 
not avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his staging is interestingly choreographed on Rich Westphal's 
realistically comfortable New York apartment setting, though Manning has a 
cogent sense of comic timing and where the core of each scene is, and though he 
is sure in his highlighting of the play's emotional peaks, the age of his cast, 
with one exception, works against both his lucid direction and the inner life 
of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael and Kate are in their late 30s; Hilary and her husband, Joe, are 
older. Although the young usually don't buy this fact, people do pick up 
baggage as they age. And that baggage is full of neat things: the 
million-and-one data bytes called experience. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes them vastly different than they were when they were in their teens. 
That baggage is necessary in a comedy of manners informed by two decades of 
marriage, raising children, being out in the real world making it all work. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast's notable exception is Derek Scally, who, in spite of his youth, has 
a good deal of the inner weight required by Michael's confusion and eventual 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Scally had the same success playing Dr. Treves last fall in Concordia's 
production of "The Elephant Man." Somewhere he's picked up an attractive sense 
of maturity that enriches his acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Canfield has moments that work as Hilary, but she hasn't been able to 
give her performance the solid foundation it needs.  
</P>
<P>
 Meredith McConnell has none of the maturity she should have as Kate. Her anger 
becomes pouting, her seductiveness becomes kittenish, her intellectual 
stability is nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathon Ruehs plays Hilary's husband like a high-school jock who has never 
grown up, but there's more to Joe than that. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hilary and Joe's 19-year-old son Grant, David Warmbier is in the right age 
range, as is Joanna Rosenberg as his 22-year-old friend, Stephanie. They acquit 
themselves well. 
</P>
<P>
 Having college actors stretch by playing older roles is not always a mistake. 
In this case, the writing and the moral sound empty without the deep, rich 
patina of maturity to fill them out. 
</P>
<P>

ART REVIEW; A MESMERIZING DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Napoleon conquered Egypt in 1789, annexing a lot of real estate and some 40 
centuries of history. He opened the ancient civilization to the amenities of 
imperialist Europe, its arrogant self-assurance and casual cultural plundering. 
The news was not all bad. Science and scholarship arrived in due course. Soon 
they were armed with a curious new gadget that only shot people in the 
figurative sense. The camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Santa Barbara Museum of Art is presenting a mesmerizing record of that 
encounter. "Excursions Along the Nile: The Photographic Discovery of Ancient 
Egypt" includes more than 100 pictures recording the look of the land during 
the second half of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Subjects range from ghostly specters of native people like Pierre Tremaux's 
"Nubian Woman" and Francis Frith's crisply classic glass negative panoramas to 
an anonymous portrait of the mummified head of Ramses II. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just studying the images induces an aesthetic sensation that makes this 
ensemble a collective artwork in itself. To us, a 150-year-old photograph seems 
an ancient artifact. When that artifact records a stone sphinx carved nearly 
5,000 years ago or the remains of a 2,000-year-old pharaoh, one's sense of time 
dissolves into absurdity. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley waxed ironic over the vanity and futility of the pharaoh's lust for 
power and immortality in his poem "Ozymandias," inspired by the image of one of 
these ancient ruins. We are obliged to realize that the ruin will outlast its 
photographic record, our form of cultural mummification. Theirs was better but 
these pictures seem to say neither matters except as part of the magnificently 
silly spectacle of human striving. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally these images, taken together, broadcast a kind of empty cosmic calm. 
They invite a state of permanent meditation. Since that's anathema in this 
culture it's probably a good thing we have the exhibition's catalogue to snap 
us out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The show originated at the museum, organized by curator Karen Sinsheimer, and 
derives entirely from the collection of Michael G. Wilson. It is scheduled to 
travel to museums in Baltimore, Ottawa and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara museum has particular reason to be proud of it, the fully 
illustrated catalogue and an especially fine essay by Kathleen Stewart Howe. 
Scholarly and readable, informative and ironically amused even at its own 
whiffs of political correctness, it's a model of good humored detachment. 
</P>
<P>
 It traces these images and the 30 photographers represented through two large 
phases. The first found Maxime Du Camp, John Beasley Greene and Felix Teynard 
making salt prints from paper negatives. Slightly soft in focus and printed in 
subtle tints, they give an eerie stillness to subjects like the Temple of 
Karnak at Thebes. 
</P>
<P>
 Early practitioners were likely to be gentleman amateurs with authentic 
archeological curiosity. French explorers, including Gustave Flaubert, tended 
to be romantics in search of the kind of exoticism they'd seen in the 
imaginings of salon painters like Gerome. 
</P>
<P>
 British pilgrims, affected by a revivalist trend back home, came in search of 
biblical associations. Frith was the prime example. At 32, he'd cornered the 
market in Greek raisins and retired to a life of leisure. Some leisure. He 
tramped around Egypt with three huge cameras and a stuffed crocodile making his 
carefully staged glass negatives in heat up to 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Publications resulting from these adventures were a huge success back home 
among Victorian burghers who could ill afford the pricey and often arduous 
trip. They were enchanted by images of a narrow Cairo street and mosque by 
James Robertson and Felix Beato or the mysterious and massive columns of the 
temple at Edfu as seen by Louis de Clercq. Stereopticon versions were even more 
thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Egypt craze was under way. Photography leaned away from the 
scientific and toward the touristy. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 
coincided with the first package tour offered by Thomas Cook. A high-minded 
temperance operation, the travel bureau made it possible for middle-class 
citizens -- including single women -- to see the enchanted land, all to the 
profound annoyance of the carriage trade. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing cadre of commercial photographers didn't mind a bit. There was gold 
in them there rubes. Lensmen like J. Pascal Sebah, Carlo Naya and Otto Schoefft 
staged pictures of Egyptians to appeal to tourists' stereotypes -- veiled women 
to evoke fantasies of harems, a glassy-eyed smoker suggesting a hashish addict. 
The yarn-spinners, dung-sellers and rug merchants were all paid models. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the tourists notice the disparity between their real experience and these 
trumped-up pictures? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently not. Apparently then as now tourists wanted to see their dreams, 
not messy reality. Real life in Egypt was so distasteful to most Europeans that 
Cook and colleagues soon cushioned and herded their clients into a pattern as 
artificial as a theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the tourists' Egypt remained as fictional as the photographs they 
so eagerly collected.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; TORI AMOS: TOO MUCH DRAMA, NOT ENOUGH SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "There are too many stars and not enough sky," sang Tori Amos during her show 
on Tuesday at the Wadsworth Theater. The line is from "The Waitress," a sketchy 
song about fighting the urge toward vengeful anger, but it could be a 
description of the maddening nature of Amos' own artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, as she sat alone at a grand piano, it was impossible not to 
be captivated by the boldness of her personal, confessional songs, the 
sometimes striking imagery and her impressive command of musical dramatics and 
vocal gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, she spent so much time and effort drawing attention to 
those very qualities -- an exaggerated convulsion to underscore the drama here, 
a little lip-smack to punctuate her diary-like poetics there -- that the effect 
was spoiled. She tells us there are too many stars . . . and then makes us 
count every one. 
</P>
<P>
 Her confessions do offer her fans a vicarious liberation and unburdening -- 
men and women alike Tuesday responded with knowing appreciation to her 
observations. Too often, though, they seem designed solely to get attention. 
The best moments were the most relaxed and least calculated. A chatty, spoken 
introduction to "Icicle," a song about physical self-discovery in the face of 
her repressive childhood, made the point with more ease than the song itself 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why must I crucify myself?" she asks in the song "Crucify," from her 1991 
solo debut album. The answer in much of this show was simply: Because she can.

ALBUM REVIEW; PLEASANT, PLIANT AND FORGETTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * 1/2 Tim McGraw, "Not a Moment Too Soon," Curb. So you think McGraw's hit 
single "Indian Outlaw" is as lunkheaded as they come? Keep listening -- that 
affront to Native Americans gives way to a song in which a heartbroke cowpoke 
finds himself "messed up in Mexico and livin' on refried dreams."A pleasant, 
pliant voice is the one thing McGraw has going for him, but it finds little 
worth singing in this sophomore outing. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

CLUB REVIEW; SINGIN' THE BLUES FOR THE LADIES AT CICADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Millie Kaiserman may sing the blues to a wide variety of enthusiastic 
listeners, but her strong, soulful voice and song selection are clearly aimed 
at the ladies. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiserman -- singing on Thursday nights in Cicada restaurant's 100-capacity 
Backroom club with a smile on her face and pain in her heart -- can make any 
woman's heart skip a beat with her tales of cheating and defeating. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Thursday, while Dolly Parton, George Michael and Gore Vidal dined 
separately in Cicada's adjacent restaurant, Kaiserman belted out the lyrics, 
"You can have my husband, but pleeeease don't mess with my man," and every 
well-heeled woman in the place howled with delight. 
</P>
<P>
 After anything-but-standard renditions of "Low Down Dirty Blues" and "I Can't 
Stand the Rain," she nearly brought down the house with a number that included 
the line, "You don't know me, but I'm in love with your man / I don't see him 
often, but I see him as often as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations for her show are required, and unless you're having dinner, 
they're not easy to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations will be a little easier as the weather warms up. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do the proprietors -- songwriter Bernie Taupin and his wife, 
Stephanie Haymes -- pop out the windows of the Backroom's domed ceiling, but 
they also open a series of French doors, adding half-a-dozen tables outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Backroom at Cicada, 8478 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood . $5 cover . 
Reservations: (213) 655-5559.

WESTSIDE WATCH: 'QUEEN OF ANGELS' ALIGHTS, DELIGHTS NAMESAKE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We spotted an angel recently. She weighs almost 900 pounds, stands 9 feet tall 
and sits in front of a new condominium on West Hollywood's majestic North 
Harper Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists Peter Dudar and Sally Marr tell us "Reina de Los Angeles" (Queen of 
Angels) is one of the few monumental angel sculptures in the City of Angels 
(yeah, we know, West Hollywood is a separate city, but municipal boundaries 
blur in the name of art). 
</P>
<P>
 So the West Hollywood artists want to pepper L.A. with big angel statutes 
reflecting the area's cultural diversity. The recently installed "Reina" is 
modeled on a deceased friend of Marr's, who was of French and Indian descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudar and Marr hope word about the statue will prompt demand from developers 
for more such monuments. Meanwhile, they -- and passers-by -- contemplate their 
handiwork. Said Marr: "We are the proud parents of a 900-pound baby." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF STATUES: Along with the statuettes came this civics lesson from 
the Academy Awards people: Democracy is no match for Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Hollywood City Council has learned this well. So many residents had 
other Oscar night plans Monday that officials had to postpone a public hearing 
on a housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at a nearly empty auditorium, past the cable television cameras 
broadcasting the meeting live, Councilwoman Babette Lang acknowledged the 
obvious. "We're losing our television audience," she said. "No one is going to 
listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The few residents who did show up were allowed to speak on the development, an 
apartment complex for people with AIDS. Then the room really emptied -- in time 
to catch the headliner awards at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're setting a ratings record, but the wrong way," said Councilman Paul 
Koretz. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed to avoid meeting on Oscar night. Maybe all they needed 
was a new emcee. Say, Billy Crystal? 
</P>

<P>
 FIELD OF DREAMS: Gina Satriano is close to realizing a dream that as recently 
as November she never thought could come true. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu resident is in Orlando, one of 30 players seeking 20 spots on the 
Colorado Silver Bullets, the first women's professional baseball team in 40 
years. The Silver Bullets also have a second Westside hopeful, Michelle McAnany 
of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 In December the Silver Bullets were recognized by the National Assn. of 
Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body for minor league baseball, 
and were made an affiliate member of the Northern League, which operates in 
several Midwest and prairie states. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two weeks here have been like a whirlwind," said Satriano, a 
28-year-old pitcher. "Getting on the field and looking back at the stands I 
think to myself, 'Wow, how did I get here?' I can't believe it."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: CALIFORNIA'S GRUNION HAVE VOYEURS RUNNING TO THE BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SEX IN THE SURF: Forget Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr's famous roll in the 
sand. Grunions are once again flinging themselves on California beaches to 
reproduce -- to the delight of voyeurs on shore. 
</P>
<P>
 This week marked the first run of the grunion season, which lasts roughly from 
March through July, said Dan Zambrano, a biologist with the Cabrillo Marine 
Aquarium in San Pedro. For a few days at roughly two-week intervals, the small 
silvery fish surf onto beaches, mate in the sand and then return to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The grunion come ashore on virtually any sandy beach. But in San Pedro they 
seem to be attracting particularly close attention. About 1,000 people turned 
out on a recent Sunday night for a grunion-watching session organized by the 
Cabrillo Aquarium, Zambrano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Has grunion mating become L.A.'s newest spectator sport? Said Zambrano: "One 
guy said that this might be sex in the '90s -- watching other creatures do it." 
</P>

 CHEKHOV ON DECK: About 100 travel agents and several reporters gathered at the 
Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro recently to get a closer look at the Ukrainian 
cruise ship Odessa, which was making a brief inaugural visit to the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship, on its way from Hawaii to Ensenada, had most of the features you 
might expect -- lounge chairs on the sun deck, a swimming pool and plenty of 
shuffleboard courts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Odessa, which is expected to make Los Angeles a yearly stop on its 
itinerary, also carried its share of creature comforts from Eastern Europe for 
the 450 tourists on board, most of whom were German-speaking retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ship's library, wedged between the American-style romance novels, were 
several volumes by Chekhov, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. The gift shop carried 
matroshka nesting dolls next to the Christian Dior perfume. And the five bars 
on board served 18 types of cocktails made with Russian vodka. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Julie Zirbel, a spokeswoman for the cruise organizers: "It's the 
Ukrainian way to sail." 
</P>

<P>
 BEE SWARM: If you're going to open a new business and you want a unique name, 
don't call it the Busy Bee. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the catchy name is popular the world over, says Jimmy Lehr, co-owner 
of the Busy Bee cafe on Catalina Island.  
</P>
<P>
 Ever since he took over the cafe (established in 1923) with Victor Kreis 
nearly eight years ago, the most common comment from tourists has been: "Did 
you know we've got a Busy Bee in our hometown?" 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out there's even a Busy Bee Airlines in Norway. The comments have led 
to a flurry of souvenir and tall-tale swapping among patrons and owners of Busy 
Bees from San Pedro and Ventura to Oxford, Miss., and England.  
</P>
<P>
 So far none of them involve killer bees.  
</P>

 PRIMARY PICK: Congresswoman Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) has no challengers 
in the June 7 Democratic primary, but she's trying to boost the fortunes of one 
in another race. 
</P>
<P>
 She's backing Torrance Councilman George Nakano in his bid to unseat state 
Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), whose Sacramento career dates back to the 1930s, 
in the redrawn 28th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "George brings a new vision and would be the first Asian American ever in the 
state Senate," she said. "I thought it was something that I believed in and 
wanted to help with." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills' team, however, calls it a risky move for Harman, who in the fall will 
have to shore up both Democratic and Republican support in a congressional 
district that leans GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't help her," said Tim Mock, Dills' local campaign manager and 
coordinator. "This is politics. Obviously she owed George and gave him her 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano, one of Mock's colleagues when both were on the City Council, is Dills' 
strongest primary challenge in two decades. He plans to spend more than 
$200,000 on the race. 
</P>
<P>
 But the California Democratic Council already is backing Dills, Mock said. If 
he wins, "the Democratic activists won't be as enthusiastic in support" of 
Harman come fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harman: "I'm prepared to stand up where I should . . . I have supported 
people in contested races before. I don't do it all the time, but I will do it 
when I think I should." 
</P>
<P>
 QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "I touched a whale! With this hand right here, I touched it! I can die happy 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marydith Piepenbrink, 70, a San Pedro nurse, on her close encounter with a 
gray whale in San Ignacio Lagoon in Baja California.

A SLICE OF LIFE AT A BARBERSHOP THAT'S NOT ON THE CUTTING EDGE; AMERICANA: 
LOUIS VALENCIA STILL OFFERS THE BUTCH, IVY-LEAGUE OR FLATTOP WITH FENDERS -- 
BUT DON'T ASK FOR ANYTHING FANCIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Valencia snips a few hairs and glances out the window of the Manhattan 
Barber Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed from the day he bought the shop in 1954. Giant condos stand 
where once were small beach cottages. A blue-tile sidewalk, not slab concrete, 
now leads beach-goers along Manhattan Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Change has marched by outside, but time hasn't stepped in for a trim. The shop 
looks the same as it did when it was opened 60 years ago, from the metal 
waiting chairs with lime-green upholstery to the weathered, 1930s cash 
register. 
</P>
<P>
 And sure as your hair will grow back after a bad cut, Valencia still offers a 
butch, an ivy-league or a flattop with fenders at one of the better rates in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The usual?" Valencia, 59, asked as he placed a clean white smock over Reese 
Gothie, a Northrop administrator who, except for a couple of years during the 
Korean War, hasn't missed a monthly visit since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 "The usual, Lou," Gothie said, relaxing back into one of the shop's three 
aging barber chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 More than just a place to get your hair cut, Valencia's shop represents a 
world of ritual and tradition for generations of South Bay men. Many were 
reluctant toddlers when their fathers first dragged them to the shop at 1203 
Manhattan Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 Each has inevitably undergone the adolescent's rite of passage, when Valencia 
first lathers warm shaving cream across the back of the youth's neck and takes 
a straight edge to the hairs that an electric razor just won't cut. 
</P>
<P>
 And many raised under Valenica's able shears will wait more than an hour until 
his chair is empty, while Tony Di Nardi, a barber Valencia employs, sits idly 
by polishing his shears. 
</P>
<P>
 But shops like these are on the verge of extinction. The ever-spinning red, 
white and blue barber poles are disappearing from California communities as 
changing hairstyles and competition from hair salons have cut into the 
barbering business. The number of barbershops statewide has dwindled to 4,000, 
half the number 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't make sense to Steve Mitchell, 42, who sipped coffee for 45 
minutes on a recent afternoon waiting until Valencia was available.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to those hairstylists," he said. "It all comes out the same either 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia went to work on Mitchell's hair. Pursing his lips and furrowing his 
brow, he carefully wrapped a handkerchief around Mitchell's neck and began 
combing his hair. 
</P>
<P>
 He grabbed the electric razor from behind the counter, flipped the switch, and 
slowly dragged its edge up the back of Mitchell's head until the bulk of the 
hair was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 As snippets floated to the ground, Valencia began trimming the front of 
Mitchell's hair with long, shiny shears. Forty minutes later, Valencia held up 
a small mirror as Mitchell studied the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "How's that for you, sir?" Valencia asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "I almost look respectable." 
</P>
<P>
 The routine instills confidence in Valencia's patrons, who read bruised and 
battered copies of the daily paper as they await their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Webber, 46, has gone regularly to Valencia's shop for nearly 20 years. 
The Redondo Beach resident left work early on a recent afternoon to get a trim 
with his sons, Sy, 15, and Saul, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Sy got his first flattop from Valencia at age 4. He's since moved on to a 
straight trim, tapered up the back. His father approves, pointing to an 
illustrated chart of short, crew-cut hairstyles of the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's on the chart, it's OK," the elder Webber said. "But a big departure 
from the chart would require executive input from mom." That hasn't been 
necessary yet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Valencia's customers prefer one of the short, clean-cut styles on the 
chart or a slight variation. Most require a shave down the back and above the 
ears and a shave or trim across the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't ask about anything fancier -- these are the styles Valencia likes to 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 But even he needs a change now and then. Valencia plans to retire in several 
years and pass his shears on to another barber.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he will miss his customers of 40 years, but he thinks their hair can 
survive without him.

EPA OFFICIALS UNDER FIRE IN CONTAMINATED NEIGHBORHOOD; ENVIRONMENT: RESIDENTS 
POSE TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT DDT AND OTHER CHEMICALS FOUND IN AND AROUND YARDS 
NEAR TORRANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angered by news of back-yard DDT contamination, neighbors of two toxic waste 
sites near Torrance pelted environmental officials Tuesday with dozens of 
questions about what chemicals might lurk near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some blasted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for what they called 
poor communication and inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not brain-dead down here. We realize you're not doing anything," Jessie 
Frame snapped at EPA officials during the public meeting, which drew more than 
120 people to the Halldale Avenue School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the agency provided a lengthy accounting of years of testing of 
ground water, soil and air in and around the two sites: the former Montrose 
Chemical Corp. facility, a federal Superfund site, and the nearby Del Amo 
proposed Superfund site. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those tests showed chemical levels at safe limits in the neighborhood 
south of the two sites, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the most recent tests, which turned up mysteriously high levels of 
DDT in two back yards along West 204th Street in an unincorporated area east of 
Torrance, that residents asked about again and again. They were told that the 
yards of up to 100 homes would be tested to make sure the DDT is not 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the meeting ended with many questions unanswered, officials promised to 
return soon for another meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you're frustrated. Bear with us. We are trying to do something," said 
John Blevins, the EPA section chief who oversees cleanup at both Montrose and 
Del Amo, which are southwest of the intersection of the Harbor and San Diego 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Any assessment of potential health effects is complicated by the West 204th 
Street neighborhood lying alongside not one but two toxic waste sites, each 
with its own set of chemicals and problems. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT was manufactured from 1947 to 1982 at the Montrose site, northwest of the 
intersection of Normandie Avenue and Del Amo Boulevard. Based on surface soil 
tests in nearby residential areas in the mid-1980s, environmental officials 
concluded that DDT levels did not pose a threat to public health. 
</P>
<P>
 The new soil tests this winter uncovered DDT concentrations of 245 parts per 
million in one back yard and 606 parts per million in another, considerably 
higher than the 100 parts per million considered safe. In response, the EPA 
plans to excavate about 8,000 cubic feet of tainted soil from the two yards 
early next month and says it will relocate four families for up to two weeks 
while the work is done. The source of the DDT is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Once used widely as a pesticide, DDT was banned for most uses in the United 
States in 1972. DDT exposure can affect the nervous system and is suspected of 
causing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second property stirring concern, the 280-acre Del Amo site, is bounded 
roughly by 190th Street at the north, the Harbor Freeway at the east, 204th 
Street at the south and Normandie Avenue at the west. The site was once home to 
a World War II-era synthetic rubber manufacturing plant, built by the U.S. 
government and operated by Shell Oil Co., Dow Chemical Co. and other companies. 
Shell bought the plant and operated it from 1955 to 1969. It was then shut 
down, sold and dismantled, and the land has been developed commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 The Del Amo Pits area, part of the larger site, was used for dumping waste 
materials and sits directly north of houses on West 204th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Benzene, a known carcinogen, has been found deep in the waste pits and in 
shallow ground water 60 to 90 feet beneath the Del Amo site. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA official Tom Dunkelman, saying the tainted water is not a source of 
drinking water, told residents Tuesday, "The drinking water in your home is 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is preparing to release a cleanup plan for the Del Amo Pits area 
sometime this spring. The six alternatives being considered include placing a 
protective covering over the waste, at an estimated cost of $3.7 million, or 
completely excavating the waste, at a cost of $83 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Babich, organizer of a community group called the Del Amo Action 
Committee, said residents want the waste removed completely and are collecting 
signatures on petitions supporting excavation. She lambasted EPA officials for 
what she called their insensitivity to concerns about possible health effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is much more serious than they let us believe," she said.

INGLEWOOD SHOOTS DOWN MOVE TO BLOCK GUN CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMANTHA DUNN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting cries that a proposed firing range in Inglewood will let gangbangers 
sharpen their skills and teach children that guns are OK, the City Council 
voted 3 to 2 to deny a last-minute appeal to keep the gun club from opening.  
</P>
<P>
 By the same margin, the council had voted in December to allow businessman Sam 
Kash to open a firing range and gun club on Manchester Boulevard near the San 
Diego Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 But in late February, Inglewood resident Albert Harris paid a $300 fee to 
bring the measure before the council again for a public hearing in the hopes 
that the proposal would be rejected the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need a place where people can go sharpen their skills and then go 
back on the street to harm our citizens," Harris told the council and the 
standing-room-only crowd of about 70 on Tuesday night. "There are too many 
families right now planning a funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 The gun club is expected to open next month. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two hours of comment on the issue often sounded like a debate on the 
2nd Amendment or a Sunday sermon from the many church leaders on both sides of 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents feared the gun club would encourage citizens to take the law into 
their own hands, that youths might be able to use the range and that it would 
increase the city's crime rate.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need computer clubs, reading clubs, cultural awareness, not a gun club," 
resident Harold Turner said. "I find this ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents emphasized that the firing range would allow gun owners to 
learn safe use of their firearms and would be a magnet not for thugs but for 
police officers and security guards who have no other nearby place to practice. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The gun club's special permit requires responsible operation, Councilman 
Garland Hardeman said. The business must have a secured weapons check and 
record all serial numbers of firearms used and report them to police. The club 
will be able to rent weapons for firing practice but not sell them, he added.  
</P>
<P>
 "Business people should be able to come to the city and expect a resolution of 
a problem without going through hearing after hearing, and then have to go 
through the whole thing over again," said businessman Ken Gossett, adding that 
people who own guns have the right to use them in a legal, safe way. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jackson, a pastor at Resurrection Ministries in Inglewood, told the 
council to support the gun club because it would be a place for education. "No 
one has taught African American people how to use guns except the Army," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do we have drive-by shootings where people come and spray, and everybody 
gets killed but the intended victim? Because nobody really ever taught them how 
to use a gun or what the purpose is of a gun," the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Edward Vincent, who voted for the club along with councilmen Hardeman 
and Jose Fernandez, told the audience to remember that the club is a private 
enterprise and not a city project. "Let's be realistic," he said. "People own 
guns. That's not going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Judith L. Dunlap and Curren D. Price Jr. remained opposed 
to the club and the use and transportation of firearms within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the use of guns sends the wrong message to youths and others," Price 
said. "Guns are extraordinarily dangerous things even in the hands of those who 
are well-trained, careful and responsible."

ONE STEP AT A TIME; EMPLOYMENT: A PROGRAM BRINGS TOGETHER TROUBLED YOUNG 
PEOPLE, BUSINESSES AND THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE WORK FOR THOSE WHOSE 
ALTERNATIVE MIGHT BE SELLING CRACK. 
</P>

<P>
 On this morning, like on most others, there are not enough jobs to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 So 20 young adults, most of them runaways struggling to support themselves, 
will select, lottery style, a small strip of paper that tells them whether 
they'll work today. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, whose average age is 18, are part of a day-labor program called 
Project Step operated by the nonprofit Hollywood-based L.A. Free Clinic, which 
provides medical and social services to people ages 12 to 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its third year, Project Step has been enlisting the commitment of 
companies such as auto dealerships and law firms to provide the youths with a 
transition from temporary jobs to longer-term employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five are enrolled in Project Step, with an equal number more on its 
waiting list. Approximately 20 kids show up regularly for work and three are 
usually turned away daily because of a lack of jobs, Project Step director 
Stephen Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the majority of Project Step's jobs are low-skilled, low-paying jobs, 
Knight said that for the youths any job is "a lot better than going out on the 
street and selling crack." 
</P>
<P>
 The day labor jobs have included planting trees in Hollywood and helping the 
Los Angeles Conservation Corps' recycling efforts. The corps hired 15 Project 
Step youths after the January earthquake to work 12-hour days cleaning up 
Hollywood and helping residents move out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Project Step began trying to try to find longer-term jobs for the 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 After working for four months in day-labor jobs, those youths whose lives have 
become more stable move on to a six-month training program at one of six 
companies participating in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths working day labor jobs are paid the minimum wage; those working in 
the six-month training programs can make more money depending upon the kind of 
job and their work performance. The L.A. Free Clinic pays the employee's wages 
and Social Security taxes and also provides free medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Nissan of North Hollywood last July became the first of six 
companies to agree to hire workers full time after the youths complete the 
six-month training phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths are often living in troubled households, close to running away, Knight 
said. Most Project Step workers, moreover, have few jobs skills or little 
experience and have not completed high school, Knight added. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, who has worked for the federal Job Training Partnership Act in Los 
Angeles, said Project Step seeks to help the youths who he believes have fallen 
through the cracks of government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was that we (at JTPA) were finding jobs for the more skilled 
workers, and the kids who were homeless that needed the jobs were falling 
through the cracks," Knight said. "These kids have day-to-day survival needs 
and they don't have the time to wait two to three weeks or months for work. 
They'll have to resort to illegal activities if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case with Chris DeCaprio, 19, who, before joining Project Step 
was caught up in a world of drugs and survival sex. DeCaprio says he left his 
Eureka home six months ago after his alcoholic stepfather knocked out his front 
tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 When DeCaprio got off the bus at Hollywood and Vine, he called the 9-Line, a 
national referral agency for runaway youths, which referred him to Covenant 
House, a shelter for homeless teens. 
</P>
<P>
 DeCaprio left Covenant House after a disagreement with officials there and 
spent several weeks on the street before moving into another youth shelter. In 
between shelters and before working for Project Step, DeCaprio says he 
sometimes bartered sex for a place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 For four months, DeCaprio has worked in Project Step's day labor program as a 
receptionist at the L.A. Free Clinic's Hollywood and Beverly boulevards 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 655 youths have worked for Project Step since its inception. 
Since July, when Project Step changed its focus from temporary to long-term 
employment, 15 young people have found such jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight says far more youths must be placed in long-term jobs before Project 
Step can be called a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where we've been unsuccessful is when, after four months of the program, a 
lot of kids have to be let go because we're not able to find them a more 
permanent job," says Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Universal Nissan, the six businesses include Stroock & Stroock & 
Levan, a Century City law firm; Silverstein and Schiffer, a Beverly Hills 
accounting firm; Dean Witter in Santa Monica; Audio Rents in Hollywood, and 
Who's on Third restaurant in Los Angeles. Many more are needed, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Step, which has a paid staff of three and two volunteers, bills 
administrative costs to those companies that hire workers. Project Step also 
receives funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other federal 
agencies as well as money from private donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight is seeking funding to start a business that would be owned and operated 
by Project Step to allow the youths to learn more advanced job skills. He is 
proposing either a restaurant or a moving company that will be operated by 
Project Step youth in all phases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be able to have all different levels of jobs and we don't have that 
now," Knight said. "In the restaurant for example, they would start out as 
dishwashers, move up to cashier, then waiter, then supervisor, then payroll, 
thus teaching them all aspects of running a business." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight says he hopes to set up such a business within two years. In the 
meantime, he says, Project Step continues meeting the immediate needs of the 
troubled youths.

CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS DEMANDED; RIGHTS: RESIDENTS WANT TO TIGHTEN RESTRICTIONS 
ON PANHANDLING AND PARK USE. THEY TELL THE CITY COUNCIL THAT SANTA MONICA'S 
QUALITY OF LIFE IS AT STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dozens of besieged Santa Monica residents bombarded the City Council this week 
with a litany of complaints about homeless-related problems, demanding a 
crackdown on what they said were intolerable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm living in Sarajevo," said David Brown, one of many residents 
who spoke at a council meeting Tuesday. "I'm living (under) siege." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents turned out to support a plan by council members Asha Greenberg 
and Robert T. Holbrook to tighten restrictions on the homeless and track the 
progress of those who use the city's extensive social service network. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a public safety crisis in our city," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg and Holbrook's proposal calls for measures that would prohibit 
panhandling after 7 p.m., require confiscation of stolen shopping carts and ban 
scavenging through trash bins. In addition, the council members want to repeal 
a section of the law closing parks from midnight to 5 a.m. that exempts those 
who are asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After four hours of discussion and a public hearing, action was postponed 
until a special meeting, scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A large contingent of speakers at the hearing consisted of parents from 
Roosevelt grade school, where a homeless woman recently defecated and urinated 
on the front lawn in full view of students. A vagrant also wandered into the 
school's first-grade bathroom recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frightening," said Matthew Goldenberg, 10, who saw the woman. 
Roosevelt parent Clare Osowsky, called the woman "menacing," and "a symbol of a 
city decaying." 
</P>
<P>
 Many speakers said they blamed the council for being more mindful of the 
rights of the homeless than the safety and comfort of the city's other 
residents. There were also suggestions that an initiative campaign might be 
launched if the council fails to address residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "By God, you're failing in your duty," Brown said. "You're insulting every 
working man and woman in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He complained of shopping carts rattling down his alley throughout the night 
and having to clean up human waste. Others spoke of "Skid Row" conditions in 
the parks, aggressive panhandling and being driven out of the library by the 
stench of body odor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insane to let the least fortunate members of society . . . dictate your 
lifestyle," Adriana Shaw told council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the actions of homeless people determined what time she got up, 
where she shopped and whether she could exercise in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 A lengthy effort by Councilman Ken Genser to point out that the city already 
is taking many of the steps proposed by Greenberg and Holbrook drew derisive 
laughter from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not suggesting we're doing them well or that the problems are solved," 
Genser hastily replied. "On paper we are dealing with the problem. It's a 
different matter on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 That admission didn't stop the speakers from questioning the council 
majority's grasp of the city's homeless problem. "What city are you talking 
about?" said resident Suzanne Brewer. "The city you're describing is not the 
city I'm living in." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar effort to urge residents to call police about their problems with 
the homeless did not go over well either. "All this discussion about calling 
the police is a sham because they're not allowed to do their job," said 
resident Ruth Ebner, who was one of five finalists for the city attorney's job 
given in December to Marsha Jones Moutrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Police Chief James T. Butts said one-third of all calls to police 
concern homeless issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other council debates on the subject over the years, advocates for the 
homeless were in short supply Tuesday night, but those who spoke pleaded for 
tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to eat," said activist Ron Taylor, a formerly homeless man. 
"People have to have a place to sleep."

COUNTY TO DECIDE ON SCHOOL SECESSION; * EDUCATION: PETITION TO REMOVE LOMITA 
STUDENTS FROM LOS ANGELES UNIFIED GAINS ENOUGH SIGNATURES TO FORCE RESOLUTION 
OF THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The group working to see Lomita secede from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and manage its own schools has submitted a petition to county 
officials with enough signatures to require the county to either reject or 
endorse the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee to Unify Lomita's Schools delivered a petition with 3,099 
signatures to Los Angeles County officials last week. At least 2,400 signatures 
were required as a first step toward gaining educational autonomy for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have 20 days to verify the signatures and another 60 days to 
have a public hearing on the issue. After the hearing, the county has 120 days 
to determine whether it will advance Lomita's effort to the State Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is very anxious," said Cindy Grant, one of three chief 
organizers of the petition drive. "If we could have (our own) district 
tomorrow, we'd be delighted." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's main complaint is that Los Angeles Unified is too big and unwieldy 
to address the needs of Lomita, a community of 19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so big and we're a small, teeny-tiny part of it, that there's really no 
need for us to be there," Grant said. "If we have a problem, we want to be able 
to get it acted on immediately. We want our neighbors to be our school board 
members. Just like our City Council -- I know all five of them -- and if I have 
a problem, I can call anyone of them at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign marks the second time in eight years that Lomita has tried to 
secede from Los Angeles Unified. Its previous attempt reached the state level 
but died because state officials determined that by withdrawing its mostly 
white students, Lomita would undermine Los Angeles Unified's desegregation 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial makeup of Lomita, however, has changed in the past few years from 
almost entirely white to about 60% white and 40% minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not just a minority issue," said Erin LaMonte, who helped spearhead 
the signature drive. "The whole environment is so different now." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagerness to leave Los Angeles Unified is almost palpable, said LaMonte, who 
walked Lomita neighborhoods for eight months collecting signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say out of the hundreds of signatures I collected, I may have had to give 
reasons (for seceding) to maybe half a dozen people. It's ridiculous how 
automatic it was." 
</P>
<P>
 If the state board again denies the petition, the secession drive will stop 
there. If the proposal is approved, it will be put to a public referendum in a 
geographical area including Lomita and adjacent communities that might be 
affected by Lomita's withdrawal from Los Angeles Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 If the effort is successful, Lomita would create a new school district of 
about 2,000 students. The district would include Eshelman Avenue Elementary and 
Lomita Elementary, a magnet school. Fleming Middle School would become a 
combined junior and senior high school.

TEMPERS FLARE OVER HOMELESS PLAN; HEARINGS: RESIDENTS SHOUT DOWN OFFICIALS OF 
ORGANIZATION THAT WANTS TO TURN SURPLUS NAVY HOUSING INTO A SHELTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of angry residents turned out this week to grill the officials of an 
organization that wants to open a homeless shelter in surplus Navy housing in a 
San Pedro neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight representatives from Turner's Technical Institute, an organization based 
in South-Central Los Angeles that plans to run the homeless program for up to 
120 families, faced a hostile crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute representatives who addressed the crowd were often shouted down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to ask questions, not for you to tell us stories!" one resident 
yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute has the approval of the federal Department of Health and Human 
Services to open the homeless shelter in 144 dwellings on 27 acres on Taper 
Avenue. Enlisted personnel and their families from Long Beach Naval Station 
will live in the housing until summer, when they are expected to be 
transferred. The naval station is scheduled to close in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Most questions from the public went unanswered by the institute panel, 
prompting Los Angeles Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro, 
to say: "I've been up in City Hall for the past 7 1/2 months and I've seen some 
songs and I've seen some dances, but this is the most unorganized stage show 
I've ever seen in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments were met with thunderous applause from residents, who wore baby 
blue ribbons as a symbol of support for their neighborhoods and of their anger 
at not being included in the federal decision to approve the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnathon Marzet, deputy director of the technical institute, assured the 
crowd that no alcoholics or drug users would be allowed in the program and that 
applicants would be screened thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first month of operation, he said, only 30 families would be admitted 
to the shelter. Every 60 to 90 days, more families would be allowed in, so it 
would take nine to 12 months to fill the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people held up signs at the meeting whenever the audience got rowdy, 
warning them the institute was "not the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd shouted questions, Marzet and other panel members asked that the 
questions be written down, so they could answer them during the next meeting 
and provide the documentation that was requested. When this drew an angry 
response from the crowd, Marzet said it was a good time to end the meeting, and 
the panel left. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaflets and signs told the crowd that the goal was to force the federal 
government to amend legislation that gives homeless advocacy groups first 
priority for surplus federal property without the consent of local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 has been criticized by 
the California League of Cities and the state Office of Planning and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Both agencies are studying a task force's recommendations to Gov. Pete Wilson, 
which released a report in February on the use of closed California military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the report calls the McKinney Act a significant barrier to 
economic growth and says local plans should be given priority over shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Williams, deputy director of the Office of Planning and Development 
agrees, saying the McKinney Act was a concern throughout California when public 
meetings on base closures were held last year.  
</P>
<P>
 "The locals (should) have the option to offer comparable property at a 
different location from the specific location that was required by the homeless 
group," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue also will be considered April 5 by the Los Angeles City Council 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time the council has looked at how the federal law overrides 
any local decisions made on use of surplus military land, said Tom Kruesopon, 
spokesman for Svorinich. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (federal) government can make laws like this, then what's next?," 
Kruesopon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The full council is expected to vote April 8 on a proposal to urge Secretary 
of the Navy John H. Dalton to suspend a decision on the Taper Avenue housing 
until there is a full public hearing and an environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich will hold a hearing at 7 p.m. Tuesday at San Pedro High School, 1001 
West 15th Street.

RELIGION; AEROBICS FOR THE SOUL AS WELL AS THE BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aliza Dubin is not your run-of-the-mill aerobics instructor. She teaches 
"frumaerobics," Yiddish for pious aerobics. That means leading women through 
step workouts and sit-ups in a way that does not conflict with Orthodox Jewish 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream aerobics classes focus almost exclusively on achieving weight 
reduction and a Twiggy-like body, says Dubin, a West Los Angeles resident. 
"Their attention is completely on the physical," she says. "But we say there's 
something more to us than just our bodies. We believe the body is the temple of 
the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 To nurture that soul, she says, the body must be fit -- but not flaunted. So, 
observing Orthodox Jewish custom, many of the women in Dubin's classes expose 
only their faces and necks, wearing sweat suits and, in some cases, head 
scarves. 
</P>
<P>
 The students appreciate Dubin's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Elissa Lorber, a 40-year-old medical researcher, said she signed up after 
tiring of gyms "where everyone is always showing off their buns of steel, 
looking in mirrors, and rippling their muscles." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubin, a 29-year-old mother of two, sees her occupation as the culmination of 
a spiritual journey that began seven years ago in Toronto. There, while 
studying for a nursing career she didn't really want, she decided to apply for 
a six-week fellowship to study religion and spirituality at Aish Hatorah, a 
Jewish outreach program in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 After the program ended, Dubin settled in Jerusalem, began living an Orthodox 
Jewish lifestyle and married a rabbinical student from New Jersey. Soon, 
however, she again began feeling depressed. She didn't speak the language; her 
parents, she said, were "shocked" at her Orthodox ways; and she felt too 
restless to settle down to life as a wife and mother. 
</P>
<P>
 But just over two years ago, when her husband, Chaim, accepted a rabbinical 
position in Los Angeles, she moved to California. Within weeks, Dubin joined a 
small, conventional aerobics class in West Los Angeles run by Deana Martin, 
daughter of actor Dean Martin, and found herself rapidly rising from wallflower 
to top student. 
</P>
<P>
 When Martin bowed out of teaching last year, Dubin started her own classes, 
offering them at her apartment near Pico and Doheny. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the classes reflected her Orthodox beliefs and those of her 
neighborhood's predominantly Jewish population. While the aerobic exercises 
themselves remained largely the same, the students' dress became more 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Orthodox Jewish tradition, women in mixed company may expose only their 
faces and necks; arms beneath the elbows, and legs beneath the knees. Stricter 
interpretations require married women to cover their hair, except when they are 
alone or with their husbands. Thus, Dubin -- like some of her students -- 
exercises wearing a wig or a head scarf. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubin now leads nine classes a week, with each of the hour-plus sessions 
consisting of four to 10 Jewish women doing step aerobics and sit-ups on her 
hardwood floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Dubin's students are not Orthodox Jews but nevertheless enjoy working 
out with other Jewish women. Lorber, for instance, says the classes do not 
serve a spiritual purpose for her but the religious bond she shares with other 
students "makes me feel more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubin says she has at last discovered her forte -- helping Jewish women feel 
good about themselves, helping them to become "whole." Meanwhile, she's saving 
up class fees to help her and her husband buy a house when they eventually 
transfer back to Jerusalem. There, she says, she hopes to continue teaching 
"frumaerobics."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven residents of Palos Verdes Estates have been chosen to help honor two 
city police officers who were killed in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents will work with City Council staff to develop a plan to refurbish 
Palos Verdes Memorial Garden on Palos Verdes Drive West to include a memorial 
for Capt. Michael W. Tracy and Sgt. Vernon (Tom) Vanderpool. The officers were 
shot to death by a robber during a business meeting at the Holiday Inn in 
Torrance on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 A design will be presented to the Planning Commission and Parklands Committee 
on May 31, City Clerk Barbara Culver said. The council will have a dedication 
ceremony on Veterans Day, Nov. 11.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The John Wayne Cancer Institute will honor its founding medical director and 
president, Dr. Donald Morton, with the Special Service Award for his work in 
cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton will receive the award at the Santa Monica institute's 10th anniversary 
ball April 9 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton's recent accomplishments include the development of a vaccine for 
malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer. The vaccine has extended the life 
expectancy of some patients from eight months to more than 23 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton received his medical training at the University of California at San 
Francisco. He held senior posts with the National Cancer Institute and, in 
1971, established the division of surgical oncology at UCLA, which brought 
together an international team of cancer researchers and surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 The John Wayne Cancer Center was founded in 1981. Because of Morton's 
friendship with the late actor, it was located at UCLA. In 1991, the center 
moved to Saint John's Hospital and Medical Center in Santa Monica, where it 
became the John Wayne Cancer Institute. It is regarded as one of the country's 
foremost comprehensive cancer research and treatment centers.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; DISTRICT TO HELP CITIES PAY FOR LIFEGUARDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Beach Cities Health District has pledged to help three South Bay cities 
keep lifeguards on area beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of directors agreed to offer financial help to Manhattan 
Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach at a special meeting Monday.No amount 
was set.  
</P>
<P>
 The three cities are among seven coastal communities under pressure from the 
County Board of Supervisors to contribute more money to pay for lifeguards and 
beach grooming. The county had threatened to stop funding the lifeguards June 
30.  
</P>
<P>
 The health district offered to help because of the importance of lifeguards to 
the health of district residents, administrative officer Peggy Trobaugh said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was made clear that there was no way we could pay for all the funding for 
the lifeguards," Trobaugh said, and the offer is just for one year.  
</P>
<P>
 The three cities will work together to determine how they can best use the 
health district's offer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Director Ray Koke of Redondo Beach said the cities also may discuss 
forming their own district to provide combined lifeguard services. SUSAN

MAE DEDRICK PRELOW, 99, MOTHER TO HUNDREDS, DIES

<P>
 Mae Dedrick Prelow of Carson, who cared for hundreds of children as a foster 
mother and hospital volunteer, died March 12, less than two months before her 
100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prelow died of heart failure during surgery for cardiac problems, said her 
daughter-in-law, Leona Prelow of Carson.A funeral and musical tribute were held 
Saturday at New Hope Baptist Church in South-Central Los Angeles, where Mae 
Prelow had organized the children's choir and directed it for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Prelow praised her talents in dealing with children. For 20 
years, she ran a South-Central foster home where she cared for more than 70 
youngsters. After closing the home in the early 1970s, she turned her attention 
to the infants at Los Angeles County Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center 
in Willowbrook, where she volunteered as a foster grandparent until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a charisma about her. Little kids just kind of look up to her," New 
Hope Baptist Pastor James S. McKnight said last April, as her family prepared a 
99th-birthday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 At her funeral last weekend, a family friend spotted an unidentified young man 
seated in a pew, weeping. He explained that Mae Prelow had raised him and taken 
him to New Hope Baptist many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Everything they're saying about Mae Prelow is correct,' " Leona 
Prelow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prelow is survived by her daughter-in-law; her son, Clifford Prelow; two 
grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Memorial contributions can be made 
to the Mae Prelow Children's Choir at New Hope Baptist Church or the King/Drew 
Medical Center. DEBORAH SCHOCH

<P>
 Avalon City Council will move to new chambers on Catalina Island next month in 
an attempt to comply with federal law requiring access for disabled people to 
all city buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The council now meets on the second floor of City Hall on Metropole Avenue, 
and the building has no elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is building a $6,500 ramp into the Catalina Justice Court on Sumner 
Avenue, where the council will conduct future meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Shirley Davy said the move is a requirement of the Americans With 
Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the act, the city has until June, 1995, to move all its second-floor 
offices that serve the public to a new location or provide access for people 
with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is moving toward putting in an elevator to accommodate people who 
need assistance getting up and down the stairs," Davy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city does not yet know how much an elevator will cost, she said. SUSAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAWNDALE; MEASURE TO LIMIT NEW LIQUOR LICENSES STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is considering an ordinance to sharply limit the number of 
new liquor licenses issued in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law, which would allow one more bar and two liquor stores in the 
city, is scheduled to go to the Planning Commission next month. The council, 
which unanimously backed a draft of the measure, could vote on it by late 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 City and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officials said alcohol sales 
have contributed to loitering and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to say we have a severe problem," Councilman Norm Lagerquist 
said. "It's really a safeguard measure. The view is that we have enough of 
these types of establishments and don't need many more." 
</P>
<P>
 But managers and owners of several bars and liquor stores said their 
businesses are being unfairly singled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I run a clean operation," said Gary Simmons, manager of McNamara's Liquor. 
"I've been in business since 1978 and have never had a citation. I don't allow 
people to loiter in front of my store." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members emphasized that the proposed law is part of a plan to 
diversify the city's economic base. The council expects to receive a study from 
a private consulting firm later this month on revitalizing Lawndale's 
struggling retail sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not good to have an overabundance of one type of business, no 
matter what it is," Councilwoman Nancy J. Marthens said.  
</P>
<P>
 As of December, Lawndale had 49 businesses with liquor licenses, primarily 
along Hawthorne Boulevard. That number is about average for comparably sized 
cities in Los Angeles County, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law would limit the issuance of liquor licenses based on the 
city's population.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, new liquor stores would have to be at least 600 feet from 
schools, churches, parks and public playgrounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants and supermarkets would be exempt from the proposed law. SCOTT 
SANDELL

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; DRIVE SEEKS TO AID RENT CONTROL ALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley voters may hold the future of Santa Monica's rent control 
law in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the fate of rent control and the fate of state Sen. David 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys) could be one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, a staunch supporter of rent control, is the target of a well-funded 
recall effort led by the gun lobby in his new Valley district. The recall vote 
is scheduled for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 A candidate for state treasurer, Roberti has to leave the Senate in December 
to comply with term limits. But his presence in Sacramento is needed by those 
trying to block a legislative effort to weaken rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Santa Monica rent control advocates are busy phoning Valley 
voters, urging them to keep Roberti in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt that rent control was more threatened than now," said Michael 
Tarbet, a renters-rights activist in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of Santa Monicans for Renters Rights last weekend, Tarbet urged 
members to write state legislators and sought volunteers to work the phones for 
Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill by Assemblymen Jim Costa (D-Fresno) and Bernie Richter (R-Chico) is 
causing alarm because it would allow rents to go to market levels upon vacancy, 
something prohibited in Santa Monica. The legislation would also affect 
hundreds of tenants whose apartments remain under rent control even though 
other units in their buildings have been converted to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation is backed by landlord and real estate interests eager to get 
the bill signed this year by Gov. Pete Wilson in case the Republican is not 
reelected in November. "This is the year if they are ever going to do it," said 
Tony Trendacosta, attorney for the Santa Monica Rent Board. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Roberti has blocked bills to weaken rent control by killing them in 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, preventing the issue from coming to a vote 
before the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The current bill awaits Judiciary Committee action, but a hearing will not be 
set until after Roberti's fate is decided April 12. The bill was sent straight 
to the Senate Judiciary Committee without an Assembly vote so it could be heard 
on a few days notice. The Assembly has previously supported vacancy decontrol, 
so passage there is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has been given an earthquake angle by its authors: Richter says 
the legislation is needed to encourage reconstruction of apartment units, an 
effort made more difficult in places with unusually low rents. Landlords have 
made the same argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides staffing phone banks, Santa Monica rent control forces have sought 
support in Berkeley, West Hollywood and other rent control cities to fight the 
measure. "The situation is grave," said Steve Hopcraft, a political consultant 
hired to work against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state Sen. Bill Lockyer, Roberti's successor as president pro tem of 
the Senate, apparently will oppose the bill, Hopcraft said it is unclear 
whether Lockyer will be as committed to rent control as Roberti has been. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how many committee votes he has lined up, Hopcraft said, "The only head 
count we're worried about is Roberti's head."

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; HOTEL DEVELOPER HASN'T PAID PROPERTY TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sheraton Cerritos hotel, which was built by a Torrance developer, has 
raised eyebrows at Cerritos City Hall because it continues to lose money and 
the developer has not paid property taxes, even though its occupancy rate last 
year reportedly approached 80%, well above the regional average.  
</P>
<P>
 The 203-room hotel, which opened in April, 1990, was conceived as a 
cornerstone of the upscale Towne Center redevelopment project at 183rd Street 
and Bloomfield Avenue.The hotel was considered so crucial to the 
office-commercial development that the city agreed to chip in $750,000 a year 
until the hotel turned a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos officials say they are concerned that the $25-million hotel continues 
to lose money. Officials also say they're perplexed by the failure of the hotel 
developer, Transpacific Development Co., to pay $900,000 in property taxes on 
the site for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The delinquent taxes have prompted city officials to withhold $1.5 million in 
subsidy payments to the hotel the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Irish, chief operating officer of Transpacific, acknowledged that the 
hotel has enjoyed a higher occupancy rate than most of its competitors, but 
said the hotel's overall performance "has not been such that it's allowed us to 
make our property tax payments." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheraton officials hired a new general manager, Hans Altenhoff, last month.

 Heal the Bay, a Santa Monica-based environmental group known for its 
grass-roots efforts at cleaning up local waters, will help launch a program 
next week to educate people about the dangers of dumping hazardous waste in 
storm drains, which empty into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the so-called Gutter Patrol program, conducted in conjunction with the 
Los Angeles city and county public works departments, volunteers will place 
65,000 stenciled signs reading "No Dumping, This Drains to Ocean" on storm 
drains across Los Angeles County.Volunteers will also hand out tip sheets on 
how to recognize hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to be completed in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 volunteers, environmentalists, politicians and celebrities will 
kick off the program March 24 at 11 a.m. at DeLongpre Park in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban storm water runoff contributes the largest amount of pollution to area 
beaches, Heal the Bay Executive Director Adi Liberman said. Rainwater washes 
fertilizers, motor oil, pet droppings and other pollutants into storm drains, 
which flush into the sea. DAMITA J. QUASHIE

TAXES: SVORINICH AND IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There has been an abuse of power, and abuse of due process by Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. These are the facts: On Dec. 15, 1993, when business people were 
the busiest, a hearing was scheduled by the Los Angeles City Council on the 
proposal for a Business Improvement District in San Pedro. The idea was to 
ramrod it through. 
</P>
<P>
 We who opposed it however, had letters from more than 50% of the businesses in 
the district who were opposed. The hearing was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 5, business people again left their stores and offices to go to the 
City Council and register their opposition to the Business Improvement 
District. Again, we had more than 50% of the businesses who were opposed. So, 
what happened? The hearing was postponed again.

<P>
 By what stretch of the imagination does a councilman not respect the will of 
the majority of his constituents? This is not only political suicide, but an 
abuse of office. And it is because of this kind of abuse that Councilman 
Svorinich is now under investigation by the Ethics Commission and the district 
attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 The last postponement was for 60 days to give the supporters of the district 
an opportunity to get business people to withdraw their letters of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious that Councilman Rudy Svorinich was "cooperating" with the few 
property owners on 6th Street who are hellbent on taxing everyone from Third 
Street to 10th Street and from Harbor Boulevard to Pacific Avenue, to raise 
$96,000 annually. And for what purpose? To improve business. How? There is no 
blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporters of district refuse to define how the money will be spent. And 
by whom? And for what? More planters and trash containers, and less parking? 
One more assessment . . . one more tax. Why doesn't the councilman fight to cut 
some of our business taxes, like the wasteful Sidewalk Assessment District tax, 
instead of trying to impose yet another tax burden on everyone unlucky enough 
to be within the Business Improvement District boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Svorinich is using the power of his office to shove an 
ill-conceived proposal down our throats. He was not elected to inflict new 
taxes on his constituents, and yet that is exactly what he is planning to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge all who have businesses or rental property within the boundary of the 
Business Improvement District who have not returned their letters of opposition 
to me to do so right away. Call Councilman Rudy Svorinich and let him know that 
you do not want to be assessed. It's time to stand up and be counted, or remain 
silent and do nothing, and we will be paying $100 or $300 more in taxes . . . 
and that's just for openers. Pasadena has a Business Improvement District. 
Originally, each business was assessed $400 a year. Each year, the assessment 
went up. Now some businesses are paying $4,000 a year. We need to have more 
than 50% of the businesses in the district registering our opposition by April 
5 when the final hearing is to take place.

 By his own admission, Rudy De Leon has an awesome job ahead of him. Last week, 
the 69-year-old Torrance resident and retired police officer became the first 
ombudsman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which patrols several 
Westside communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The position was created in part to help reduce the millions of dollars that 
Los Angeles County must pay each year in liability judgments to victims of 
excessive force, De Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the very nature of law enforcement there will be violent confrontation, 
and there will be lawsuits," he said. "But what you want to do is reduce those 
to the minimum possible and create better conditions in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a $360,000 budget, De Leon hopes to create an office where 
citizens with complaints can get results. He said he wants to establish a 
uniform system for reporting brutality cases, and see those guidelines 
distributed to all stations, including those that patrol West Hollywood, Marina 
Del Rey, Malibu and unincorporated areas of the Westside. De Leon will focus 
primarily on cases that result in hospitalization, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints with merit go from the captain of the station to internal affairs 
to the criminal division and then to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon will follow the cases in his new $60,200-a-year job, and report to 
Sheriff Sherman Block and the Board of Supervisors. He will be responsible for 
making sure complaints are investigated quickly and sent to a retired judge, 
from an approved panel, to be reviewed. He also will provide progress reports 
to the complainant.  
</P>
<P>
 Until De Leon has a chance to sort through the files, though, he will not know 
how many cases await him. "There may be 1,000 complaints floating around," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors selected De Leon because of his "tremendous law 
enforcement experience and his background and knowledge of the county," said 
Dennis Morefield, spokesman for Supervisor Deane Dana. "The hope is that he'll 
bring stability and confidence to law enforcement," he said. "No one man can do 
it all. But (De Leon) can help." 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon has a long history of service to the community and to law enforcement. 
He served with the Los Angeles Police Department for 31 years. In the 
mid-1970s, as captain of the Hollenbeck Division in central Los Angeles, he 
helped transform an abandoned police station into a youth center. After he 
retired, he served on the state Board of Prison Terms and was later special 
assistant to former Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp for eight years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement has been extremely good to me," he said. As ombudsman, he 
said, "I have the opportunity to do some good for the community where I live, 
where I was raised, the community that gave me all the opportunities that I've 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles native, De Leon is the son of Mexican immigrants. When he was a 
student, De Leon read a column by a Herald Examiner sports writer who featured 
athletes who became police officers. "There were famous football players from 
USC and UCLA, there were boxers, they were all LAPD," he said. "All the 
athletes I knew were good guys, so I went for it." 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon was the only Latino in his academy class. By the late 1950s, though, 
more than 200 Latinos served in the Los Angeles Police Department, he said. "I 
saw a lot of discrimination. But I was very fortunate," he said. "I encountered 
very few instances of discrimination. When I did, I addressed it. I tell other 
minorities to do the same. Do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions have improved for minorities, he said, "but the separatism today is 
in some cases worse than a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 That segregation, coupled with youthful frustration and "the anonymity that 
law enforcement officers have in the community," he said, have led to far more 
serious allegations of excessive force today than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most officers do a professional job. Officers that work in volatile areas are 
loved by the people who live there. Officers that walk the beat in the 
projects, they get respect, they have rapport, even with the gang members. 
They're not tough. They're not aggressive. They do their job." 
</P>
<P>
 And when they don't? "Then I do my job," he said. SUSAN PATERNO

POLITICS: LEVELING THE FIELD IN CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a candidate for Torrance City Council who did not seek or accept any 
special interest money, I had the smallest amount of money on hand to run a 
campaign, and as a result I had the smallest amount of votes. For money brings 
exposure and exposure delivers votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of packaging and selling a candidate by political consultants via 
the mails is expensive, and unless one is affluent, one has to appeal to the 
special interests for their financial assistance. Please note that conventional 
wisdom used to be that it would take $10,000 to be considered a credible 
candidate. Once all the costs are in for 1994's City Council election, it will 
be demonstrated that it took up to $20,000 to run a credible campaign. Do the 
voters of Torrance know and want special interests influencing their civic 
leaders? 
</P>
<P>
 So, what is the solution? Campaign reform is a step in the right direction, 
but I will not hold my breath. One has to be realistic of taking away special 
interest influence, especially after their past support of some of the 
successful candidates. Further, do we want to restrict people's ability to give 
money away? The realistic solution is greater exposure of all candidates via 
our cable system. I offer the following considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Televise a minimum of six candidates forums live on primary CitiCable 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Televise the one-on-one interviews sponsored by the League of Woman Voters 
during prime time, not early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Dedicate 30-second public service spots of all the candidates on regular 
commercial cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the even exposure of all candidates expressing their ideas and 
visions, we will suffer as a community, for only the candidates beholden to 
special interests will get the mass exposure that brings results. The high 
costs of running a credible campaign will discourage future candidates unless 
they too are beholden to the power of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 In order for us to move into the 21st Century, we need all the ideas and 
visions of all points of view. Without these ideas, we will not excel to our 
fullest potential as a community. Let's be bold and truly open up democracy for 
all the wonderful opportunities it holds.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; FINAL PUBLIC HEARING ON BEACH RESTORATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles recreation planners are refining plans for a $10-million 
restoration of Venice Beach and will have a public meeting next month to gauge 
community opinion on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, scheduled for April 5, will be the last public session to gather 
suggestions on what to include in the renovation before planners' 
recommendations go before the city's Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners 
on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The April 5 meeting begins at 7 p.m. at the Penmar Recreation Center, 1341 
Lake Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, project supervisors in the Recreation and Parks Department are 
endorsing many of the features contained in a refurbishment plan proposed last 
fall by the Venice Boardwalk Assn. and Venice Action Committee. That proposal 
calls for resurfacing the asphalt boardwalk with brick, rebuilding 
wooden-roofed pagodas, and installing antique lighting to create a 
turn-of-the-century ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups' proposal, which also suggests creating small performance areas for 
street entertainers, has met resistance from some on the boardwalk who say it 
doesn't match the spirit of the original Venice and will detract from the 
tourist strip's rough-edged charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials have suggested further study on one of the more controversial 
parts of the refurbishment plan: whether to repave the boardwalk with bricks. 
That idea has drawn fire from critics who say brick would drive away 
roller-skaters, who have helped make the boardwalk an international icon. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to be the primary battle," project manager Kathleen Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials recommend redesigning the beach bicycle path to remove sharp curves, 
but are leaving open the question of building a second path to relieve 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation planners suggest hiring Venice architects -- the same ones who 
prepared the boardwalk association's refurbishment proposal -- to produce a 
detailed renovation plan and oversee a one-day community workshop to discuss 
the design. The features will include new bathrooms, a new entrance at 
Washington Boulevard and possibly moving bleachers that, many complain, clog 
pedestrian traffic near Muscle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation officials will also seek suggestions for new public uses of a 
former oil-drilling site next to the beach. They recommend that cleanup of the 
facility -- estimated at up to $2.5 million -- be paid with funds other than 
the $10 million Venice Beach bond approved by Los Angeles County voters two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff has declined to make recommendations on the fate of the idle Venice 
Pavilion until officials seek proposals from groups interested in resurrecting 
the 33-year-old former theater. The Planning Department is already moving 
forward on a $3-million renovation of the Venice Pier. KEN ELLINGWOOD

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; EX-ATTORNEY GETS 21 MONTHS, TO PAY $290,000 IN 
TAX EVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Beverly Hills attorney who pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion 
charges has been sentenced to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay $290,000 
in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan S. Rosenblum, 37, had pleaded guilty earlier this year to the tax charge 
and to filing a false income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Alka Sagar said this week that Rosenblum failed to report 
$633,000 in income from 1986 through 1988. Most of that income, she said, was 
derived from personal injury claims filed on behalf of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagar said Rosenblum was suspended by the California State Bar in 1992 after 
he was convicted in Los Angeles Superior Court of conspiracy, preparing a 
fraudulent insurance claim and attempted grand theft. The attorney resigned 
from the Bar last year, she said.

FEELING LIKE THEY'RE AMONG FRIENDS

By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the warm, salty waters of a shallow lagoon on the western coast of Baja 
California last week, Vivian Richman's dream came true. 
</P>
<P>
 She kissed a whale. 
</P>
<P>
 She leaned over the side of a small boat and planted a big kiss on the smooth, 
rubbery nose of a young Pacific gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
 And the strangest part was that the whale seemed to enjoy it too. In fact, it 
was at least partly the whale's idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came right up to the boat and his head came straight out of the water and 
I leaned over and kissed it," said Richman, 55, a retired businesswoman from 
Malibu who was one of several dozen members of a whale-watching expedition 
sponsored by the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just so large, but so gentle. It was just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene of this close encounter between vastly disproportionate mammals -- 
at a little over a hundred pounds, Richman is about one-fiftieth the size of 
the young whale she kissed -- was San Ignacio Lagoon, a narrow, 16-mile-long 
inlet that is virtually teeming with gray whales during the winter and early 
spring. Situated about 600 miles southeast of Los Angeles on the desert shore 
of southern Baja California, San Ignacio Lagoon and other lagoons nearby are 
the mating and birthing grounds of thousands of Pacific gray whales who divide 
their time between Baja and their feeding grounds near Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first few months of every year, the lagoon is so chock-full of 
whales that it's almost impossible to look at any particular patch of water for 
five minutes without seeing one, or three, or a dozen. Sometimes it's just the 
knuckled dorsal curve of their bodies cutting through the surface; other times 
they "blow," spewing a flume of vapor out of their breathing holes, or breach 
(shooting out of the water and falling back with a tremendous splash), or 
perform a curious movement called "spy-hopping," in which the whale sticks its 
head vertically out of the water and eyeballs the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, San Ignacio Lagoon has become the ultimate whale watcher's 
destination, not only because so many whales congregate there, but also because 
while in the lagoon the whales often display behavior that scientists say is 
probably unique in all the world: They actually seek out close physical contact 
with humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The young whales in particular swim right up to small boats, pop their heads 
out of the water, look around with eyes the size of baseballs and then, like 
dogs wanting to be petted, nuzzle up to the boats and the outstretched hands of 
the humans aboard. They seem to enjoy the contact; with the mother keeping a 
watchful eye nearby, some of the young whales will frolic around the boats for 
half an hour or more. Sometimes the mother will even nudge her offspring toward 
the boats, as if eager for the young whale to get a look at the strange 
creatures inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The contact is always the whales' choice. The Mexican government regulates not 
only the number of boats allowed in the lagoons but the activities of the whale 
watchers as well. Boats are restricted to the outer third of the lagoon. 
Chasing or harassing the whales in any way is prohibited, and would be 
counterproductive to whale watching anyway. As it is, the small whale-watching 
skiffs, called pangas , take off from shore or from larger boats and simply 
park themselves in the whales' general area. Then they wait to see if the 
whales will come to them. 
</P>
<P>
 If the weather conditions are right -- no wind and flat water -- and the 
whales are in the mood, it's usually only a short wait before a whale and her 
calf will initiate the contact. 
</P>
<P>
 For Richman and the other members of the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium expedition, 
which sailed to the lagoon aboard the 110-foot fishing boat Royal Polaris out 
of San Diego, the encounters were awe-inspiring. All of them saw gray whales up 
close and personal, from only a few feet away. Almost all actually touched some 
of the whales. And everyone described the experience as being, well, almost 
mystical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I touched a whale! With this hand right here, I touched it!" exclaimed 
Marydith Piepenbrink, 70, a San Pedro nurse. "I can die happy now. To see them 
so close is great, but to actually touch one is . . . well, it's hard to 
explain. It was just a wonderful experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was in church," Ewa Pauker of Topanga Canyon said of her 
whale-touching experience. "It's like nothing I've ever known before." 
</P>
<P>
 What the whales got out of it is anybody's guess. In fact, no one knows why 
the whales in the lagoon behave in the gentle, friendly way they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of theories, but nothing certain," said Larry Fukuhara, 
program director at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and one of the organizers of 
the whale-watching trip. "There seems to be some connection there, between the 
whales and the humans, but we don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The behavior of the so-called "friendlies" is all the more astounding when 
measured against the savage, bloody history of mankind's interaction with the 
Pacific gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray whales leave the Arctic waters in the fall and head south along the 
coast at a swimming speed of 4 to 6 m.p.h. A few months and about 6,000 miles 
later, the whales reach the warm shallow lagoons where they are safe from 
storms and natural predators. Males and females mate; those females will bear 
their young a year later. Already pregnant females give birth to 15- or 
16-foot-long calves that grow rapidly on a diet of mother's milk, which is 
about 50% fat; the calves drink about 200 gallons of milk a day. By early 
March, the males leave the lagoons and head back north; by mid-April the 
mothers and their now-fat calves follow.  
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of years, Native Americans along the West Coast hunted gray 
whales as they passed by on their journeys to and from the Baja lagoons. Since 
gray whales seldom swim out of sight of land, they were an accessible source of 
food, if not necessarily an easy one. Weighing as much as 45 tons, they were 
dangerous prey for aboriginal hunters.  
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans, given their limited numbers and means, didn't make much of a 
dent in the gray whale population. In the mid-1850s, however, a whaling captain 
named Charles Scammon discovered the largest of the gray whales' birthing 
lagoons on the Baja coast. Later Scammon would write that in the lagoon, now 
known as Scammon's Lagoon, the whales were "huddled so thickly that it was 
difficult for a boat to cross the water without coming into contact with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The word of this whale bonanza spread quickly. Soon whaling ships were 
congregating outside the mouth of the lagoon and sending longboats inside to 
hunt the whales. Within four years the whales in Scammon's Lagoon had been 
virtually wiped out, turned into whale oil and other products. 
</P>
<P>
 (One highly sought whale part was the baleen plates, the flexible sieves 
through which whales sift out the small crustaceans on which they feed. Before 
the invention of plastics, the baleen material was used for women's corsets and 
other products requiring strong but flexible material.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although the whales lost the war, the battles between man and gray whales 
weren't always completely one-sided. Scammon wrote that "Hardly a day passes 
but there is upsetting or staving of the boats (by gray whales). . . . Repeated 
incidents have happened in which men have been instantly killed or received 
mortal injury." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, despite its friendly reputation now, the gray whale was known to 
whaling men as the "devil fish" because of its ferocity in attacking when it 
was injured, or when its young were endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 19th Century, Pacific gray whales, which had once numbered 
about 20,000 animals, were so few in number that it was no longer profitable to 
hunt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, the gray whale made a comeback, its numbers increasing steadily 
until once again the Baja lagoons were full of them. In the 1920s and '30s, 
there were so many that whalers once again came after them, killing them by the 
thousands and grinding them up for pet food. For the second time, the gray 
whale was almost wiped off the face of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, however, an international treaty was signed to protect the gray 
whale, and their numbers have been steadily increasing. Although whale censuses 
are difficult to do, experts estimate that there are now about 20,000 Pacific 
gray whales -- the same number that existed in pre-commercial hunting times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was no secret to the local fishermen, who often had " las ballenas 
" approach their small fishing boats, the friendly behavior of the gray whales 
while they're inside the Baja lagoons was first noted by scientists in the 
1970s. (The friendly behavior does not occur outside the lagoons, where the 
whales apparently are too busy migrating or feeding to pay attention to 
people.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists initially speculated that the "friendly whales" of the Baja 
lagoons were actually just one particular whale, a female named Gigi who had 
spent a year in captivity at SeaWorld in San Diego before being released into 
the Pacific, and thus presumably was accustomed to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 But as more and more contacts were documented, it became clear that, for 
reasons of their own, the gray whales of San Ignacio Lagoon and other Baja 
lagoons sometimes enjoyed sidling up to humans in small boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Not always, though. Bill Samaras, a retired Carson High School science teacher 
and gray whale expert who has traveled to the lagoons every year for the past 
two decades, notes that, "When there's mating going on, you can't get anywhere 
close to the whales." 
</P>
<P>
 Samaras discovered this at his peril some years ago, when his boat got a 
little too close to mating whales. The male whale flipped over suddenly and 
Samaras almost got crushed by a 10-foot-long gray whale penis that slammed down 
on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been reported incidents of whale-watching boats being knocked over, 
probably accidentally, by whales in the lagoons. In 1983 in Scammon's Lagoon, a 
whale-watching boat got between a mother and its calf and wound up getting 
whacked by a massive whale fluke, or tail; one elderly passenger died of a 
heart attack, and another was struck and killed by a flying oar. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are aberrations -- flukes, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to San Ignacio Lagoon can be expensive, or difficult, or sometimes 
both. The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (formerly the Cabrillo Marine Museum) has 
been sponsoring annual boat trips there for 15 years; the cost this year for an 
eight-day voyage on the Royal Polaris from San Diego with stops at the lagoon 
and several offshore islands was about $1,800 per person. The trip was booked 
months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips to the lagoon by land are possible, but rugged; the lagoon is connected 
to the nearest town, San Ignacio, only by a 35-mile stretch of deeply rutted, 
washed-out dirt road. At the lagoon, licensed panga drivers and guides take 
whale watchers on day trips into the lagoon for about $25 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom is anyone disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a bad year for whale watching here," says Steve Loomis, 50, 
skipper of the Royal Polaris, which was making its second trip to the lagoon 
this year. "The whales always seem to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 "What an exhilarating feeling!" said Bert Bickel, 69, a retired printing plant 
owner from Sherman Oaks, shortly after his first whale contact. "I've been 
interested in whales for a long time, but this is just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting so close to or touching the whales really seems to change people," 
said Steve Vogel, education curator at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, who has 
made four trips to the Baja lagoons. "I guess you could call it whale magic."

THE ENDLESS SUMMER ENDS; LONGTIME SURFERS FIND THERE'S A MEDICAL PRICE TO PAY 
FOR THE SPORT'S LIFESTYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnny Fain was Malibu's golden boy of surfing in the late 1960s. Known for an 
aggressive surfing style of quick, slashing turns and "hang-ten" riding (10 
toes over the nose of the board), Fain became one of the world's top surfers, 
and was rewarded with endorsements and years of travel on the pro-surf tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The only child of "Lassie" screenwriter Jeanne Bartlett, Fain grew up in 
Malibu Colony and parlayed his blond good looks and surfing prowess into small 
movie and stunt parts in such surf cult classics as "Muscle Beach Party," "How 
to Stuff a Wild Bikini" and "Beach Blanket Bingo." 
</P>
<P>
 But during years of a rough-and-tumble surfer lifestyle and prolonged exposure 
to the natural elements, Fain also racked up a litany of surfing-related 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen cancerous and precancerous skin lesions and moles have been 
removed from his face and body. He has endured three ear operations and four 
surgeries to remove growths from his eyes, and hundreds of stitches from 
surfboard collisions. And now a recent operation to repair a hip eroded from 
years of battering has left Fain on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 The great surfer reluctantly admits he has been temporarily beached. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to believe you're invincible to reach a high level of surf 
expertise," said Fain, 50. "You have to go beyond what a normal person thinks 
of as a human limit. I am paying a price for that attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, are many other surfers, enthusiasts and their doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport of surfing, with an estimated half-million Southern California 
devotees, has always radiated images of fun and good health, of bronzed bodies, 
youthful good looks and pristine beaches. But as the baby-boomer innovators of 
the sport grow older, some of them say a troublesome array of maladies has 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 "As opposed to the blunt trauma of a football injury, many surfers suffer from 
a series of cumulative ailments," said Steve Hoch, editor of Surfer magazine, 
one of the sport's leading journals. Hoch, 38, who has been surfing for more 
than 20 years, has suffered from chronic back, ear and nasal problems. "It's 
almost death from a thousand cuts. Though our engines are still humming, our 
shells are a little nicked." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say it is difficult to determine the extent of surfer 
illnesses and ailments, which enthusiasts attribute to both man-made and 
natural elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have such a file," said Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of the acute 
communicable disease control unit of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services. "Some surfers don't go to a doctor, and if they did, doctors 
have an abysmal rate of reporting routine diseases and illnesses. We would 
really need a special study and we don't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, surfers tend to be a fit bunch with strong muscles and lungs 
derived from hours of grueling paddling against the tides. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many surfers and the doctors who treat them say plenty of anecdotal 
evidence attests to the sport's health consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-aged surfers in particular say they must cope with a growing history of 
skin ulcers, reef cuts, lacerations from surfboard fins and surfer knots and 
craters -- bumps and cuts slow to heal from constant paddling and water 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, San Francisco physician Mark Renneker co-authored a book, 
entitled "Sick Surfers," that outlines a comprehensive list of surfer maladies. 
Renneker founded the Surfer's Medical Assn. in 1986, a Northern 
California-based international organization of roughly 700 members, including 
400 medical professionals, who are dedicated to improving the health of 
surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Renneker has chronicled such surfer ailments as chronic neck and back 
problems, fungal infections from wet suits, fatty growths on the rib cage from 
paddling and so-called "ice-cream headaches" -- migraines brought on by dunking 
under huge waves in frigid water. 
</P>
<P>
 The book also attempts to answer surfer queries about angioedema -- the 
swelling of the extremities in cold water -- and even addresses the 
consequences of ingesting surf wax, which is used to improve the grip on the 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most common maladies, however, is "surfers' ear," or exostosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly afflicting cold-water surfers, it is caused when excess water in the 
ear canal evaporates in windy conditions and chills the ear. The body responds 
by growing extra bone in the ear canal, obstructing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ear specialists in seaside communities are well aware of the affliction, which 
is treated by drilling away the excess bone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must get two to three surfers a month who have to have their ears drilled 
out with a high-speed diamond burr -- it's very painful," said Dr. Justin 
MacCarthy, a partner in a Pacific Palisades practice. "I try to tell them to 
wear ear plugs, but they won't do it. They say it affects their sense of 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers have their own descriptions of the pain of the operation and its 
aftermath. "It's like a cherry bomb going off inside your head, but you're 
still living," Fain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposure to the sun has also taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many dermatologists are reporting increased cases of basal cell and squamous 
cell carcinoma, as well as malignant melanoma. They warn that prolonged 
exposure to the sun can be dangerous as surfers age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each decade of a life in the sun increases the incidents of skin cancer," 
said Dr. Billie Phelps, a Westside dermatologist who has treated many 
lifeguards and surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran surfers also suffer from pterygiums, a tissue growth over the cornea 
of the eye caused by excessive exposure to wind and ultraviolet light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunlight bouncing off the water makes people such as surfers and sailors more 
susceptible," said Dr. Troy Elander, a West Los Angeles ophthalmologist. "I've 
seen dozens of surfers over the years with the problem. Without wearing 
sunglasses you're at an increased risk." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hearne, 45-year-old regional director of the Surfer Foundation, a 
nonprofit environmental organization, now has cataracts on both eyes from sun 
exposure. The longtime surfer says the vision in his right eye is about 70%, 
and declining fast. (His other eye is fine). 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to wear ski-glasses with a leash, but its a hassle in big surf 
when you're duck-diving under waves," he said. "I tell my kids to always wear 
their sunglasses as much as possible and to stay out of the midday sun." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from infirmities caused by the natural elements, many veteran Los 
Angeles-area surfers believe that water pollution is eclipsing the sunny 
elements of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the uncertainty in the scientific world over whether toxins in Santa 
Monica Bay are making people sick, surfers believe they are unwittingly helping 
to establish a link between the water and certain illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we're the canaries in the coal mine -- we've got this young, 
healthy group of people that keeps getting sick," said David Saltman, former 
executive director of the Surfrider Foundation. "It's a shame we're using our 
youth as front-line guinea pigs, in some sort of bizarre test to measure a 
deteriorating environment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rainwater washes large amounts of untreated sewage, trash, debris, animal 
waste, pesticides, motor oil and other substances along a web of concrete 
rivers and storm drains that empty into Santa Monica Bay. In August, 1993, the 
American Oceans Campaign, a nonprofit environmental group, completed a two-year 
study that identified 160 toxic chemicals flowing into the bay from Los Angeles 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gold, a staff scientist at the environmental group Heal the Bay, says his 
organization has received extensive anecdotal evidence from Santa Monica Bay 
surfers suffering from a wide range of illnesses that could be related to the 
pollution, such as stomach flu, skin rashes (surfer's itch), sinus and ear 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
 The level of pollution increases dramatically after storms -- bad news for 
surfers since that is when the waves are best. 
</P>
<P>
 And the prime surfing spots are near storm drains, which dump sediment onto a 
series of points, reefs, and beach breaks. Better shaped waves are produced as 
swells peel over the buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're basically out there surfing these big beautiful waves that look like 
chocolate milk," Hearne said. 
</P>
<P>
 To many medical experts, storm surfing is a horrific combination. 
</P>
<P>
 "When diving under a big wave you're getting worked over pretty good," said 
Dr. Gordon LaBedz, a member of the Surfer's Medical Assn. and a Seal Beach 
resident. "Bacteria-laden water is being forced into your sinuses. (It) sits in 
little hollow areas of your skull, which if it runs down, can cause an upper 
respiratory infection." 
</P>
<P>
 Their heads, many veteran surfers say, act like remarkable sponges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember working in the afternoon as a busboy, hours after I'd gotten out 
of the water," Hoch said. "It was a formal affair and as I bent over to serve 
someone, out of my nose rushed all this water. There's nothing you can do. You 
know it's coming and there it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many veteran surfers agree one of the most unhealthy places to surf has been 
Malibu's Surfrider Beach, considered among the best surfing spots in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Excellent waves are produced when the swells hit a curving line of large 
cobblestones hugging the contour of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But the beach's geology may be its undoing. The cobblestones come from nearby 
bacteria-laden Malibu Creek, which flushes out through the Malibu Lagoon. 
Upstream is the Tapia Water Reclamation Center, which dumps almost 2 million 
gallons a day of treated effluent into the creek and up to 7 million gallons on 
rainy days. The creek also picks up bacteria from septic tank runoff, animal 
waste and refuse from picnickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran surfers say that after years of riding the waves there, many have come 
down with a range of ailments they blame on the water pollution, although 
doctors cannot say for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since surfing there in the early '80s, I've experienced a lot of respiratory 
problems, sinus problems, and I keep cycling in and out of diarrhea," said 44 
year-old Joe Sanders, a member of the Malibu Surfing Assn., a recreational and 
environmental club. "I've heard a lot from other people that parallels my 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, one of Sanders' surfing pals, Jeff Estep, said he came down with 
hepatitis A, shortly after surfing at Malibu. He said his physician told him 
"it was quite possible" he contracted the illness from the ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the bad smell and taste of the water that day," Estep said. "I was 
bedridden for nearly two months. My urine was like Coca-Cola, my stool was like 
white glue and my eyes were yellow. Every surfer should get a gamma globulin 
shot before going out there." The shot boosts the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 A more extreme and controversial case involves surfer Eric Villanueva, 22. In 
May, 1992, Villanueva came down with flu-like symptoms after surfing near 
Malibu Lagoon in the wake of a storm. Within a month he had congestive heart 
failure, and two months later he received a heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors found high levels of antibodies in Villanueva's blood caused by the 
coxsackie B virus,a strain found in human feces that can attack and weaken the 
heart. Public studies have located coxsackie B in the Malibu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go out there after the rains, or after the berm is breached, you're 
gambling with your life," said Villanueva, who had to have a second transplant 
11 months after the first one due to complications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am 99% sure I caught the virus (near the Malibu Lagoon)," Villanueva said. 
"I can't think where else I got it -- I'm not in the habit of licking toilet 
bowls." 
</P>
<P>
 But experts cannot say for sure where he contracted the illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible that someone could get the virus while surfing in the bay," 
said Dr. Michele Hamilton, co-director of the UCLA cardiomyopathy program, 
which is treating Villanueva. "However, this is a common virus, with many 
avenues. It could have been poor hygiene, family contact or a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many surfers are aware of the problems associated with the sport, but 
addiction to the waves overrides their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the 1990 Huntington Beach oil spill," Gold said. "The waves were a 
perfect two to four feet, and guys were out there surfing the slick. Surfers 
will do anything to catch a good wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Estep got sick with hepatitis, he remembers going surfing with his 
sons and walking past a sign warning of possible unsafe water posted on a 
Malibu beach. "I told my boys to check for any open wounds, and to just spit a 
lot, keep spitting. Then out we went." County officials recommend staying out 
of the water when such signs are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch uses cosmic terms to theorize why surfers will travel to distant islands, 
miles from medical care, risking life and limb to ride the perfect wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waves are the unifying constants of the universe, they're everywhere -- sound 
waves, light waves moving across many mediums," Hoch said. "Most waves are 
going at least 700 m.p.h., but only ocean waves are moving at a speed humans 
can ride, really tap into. The waves also travel through a beautiful medium -- 
the ocean. There's something about all that that brings people back over and 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Fain regularly and painfully swims a mile in the Pepperdine University 
swimming pool to rehabilitate his hip -- and get ready for his inevitable 
return to the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a gladiator," he said. "I'll be back out there within eight months."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: IT'S MORE MANHATTAN THAN BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Tony Guidone owned a restaurant and grocery store in Indianapolis, his 
young son Ron enjoyed helping out, especially with the produce. Now, some 40 
years later, their situations are reversed. Early in the morning Tony can be 
found down at the Los Angeles Produce Market, selecting fruits and vegetables 
for his son's three restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The flagship of the Guidone chain, Mangiamo (Italian for "let's eat"), may be 
within 100 yards of the Manhattan Beach Pier, but it doesn't look like a 
typical beach restaurant. This attractive dining room would not be out of place 
in that other Manhattan -- the one Frank Sinatra sings about. Low, dimly 
lighted ceilings and Art Deco light fixtures along a mirrored wall give it an 
urbane feel. Behind the main room and past the kitchen is a cozy, brick-walled 
wine cellar room with an almost cramped feel that adds to its Manhattanish 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, a chopped salad ($5) features a hot Brie crouton and a lively 
balsamic vinaigrette. A more luxurious appetizer, four large lobster and shrimp 
ravioli nestled atop a red bell pepper sauce ($10), would be enough for two 
moderate eaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Seafoods dominate the main course selections. Sea bass Genoa ($17.50) is 
poached in Chardonnay and strewn with mushrooms, tomatoes, baby carrots, 
zucchini and squash, with the welcome zip of capers. Also poached to 
tenderness, this time in champagne, is swordfish ($19.50), sprinkled with 
green, pink and black peppercorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Calamari con linguine ($15.50) features the chewy, mild flavor of squid with 
the pungent tastes of Greek olives and capers. A slew of green-lipped mussels, 
sauteed with butter, garlic, thyme and dry mustard, make another popular 
topping for linguine. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to buying the produce, papa Tony works with Ron on the nightly 
specials, such as fettuccine mixed with chicken sausage, artichoke hearts, 
oregano, cayenne, and cumin, then topped with mascarpone cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangiamo is at 128 Manhattan Beach Blvd., Manhattan Beach; (310) 318-3434. 
Open 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday, 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday 
and Saturday, and 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday and Monday. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

 MILESTONE 
</P>
<P>
 When you've been a baseball coach as long as Harry Jenkins has, you learn to 
take the good with the bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins approaches his 400th career victory with the same outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel good," he said, "and a little old." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 23rd season, Jenkins can get victory No. 400 when his West Torrance 
High team plays Carson at 4 p.m. Saturday in the quarterfinals of the Redondo 
tournament. Reaching the milestone in a game at Redondo would be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins enjoyed his greatest success at Redondo, both as an athlete and a 
coach. He was a standout basketball and baseball player at the school, then 
coached the Sea Hawk baseball team to a 339-179-4 record from 1970-88. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking two years off, he returned to coaching at West in 1990 and has 
guided the Warriors to a 60-31-1 record in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 West is off to a 5-2 start this season and boasts a talented lineup that 
includes five starters batting .400 or higher, and a fast-improving pitching 
staff. The only blemishes on the Warriors' record are one-run losses to Simi 
Valley and Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real good group, a younger group," Jenkins said. "The pitching staff 
was a question mark, but they've been doing an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
 West has gotten a big boost from Kirk Bolling, a junior right-hander who is 
3-0 with a 1.94 earned-run average. In his last game on March 15, Bolling had 
11 strikeouts and no walks in a complete-game victory over Leuzinger, 6-2. An 
all-around athlete -- he was West's quarterback in football -- Bolling plays 
third base when not pitching. ADD WEST 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise that Jenkins says hitting is the Warriors' strength. The team 
returns perhaps the area's finest offensive player in senior infielder Derek 
Nicholson, The Times' 1993 South Bay Player of the Year when he batted .520 and 
led the area with 37 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson picked up where he left off in West's opener March 4, hitting a home 
run in his first at-bat in an 8-6 victory over Pasadena Muir. It came three 
days after he had a cast removed from his right hand for a hairline fracture 
suffered in practice. Nicholson bats left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 After a fast start, Nicholson has one hit in his last six at-bats, bringing 
his average down to .500 (11 for 22). He has two home runs and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Others batting .400 or higher for West are senior designated hitter Joe 
Intermill (.529), who has eight consecutive hits in the past three games; 
Bolling (.480), who leads the team with three home runs and 12 RBIs; freshman 
catcher Tony Cosentino (.412), who has filled in for an injured starter; and 
junior center fielder Jim Yates (.400), a South Bay all-star last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we hit, we can play with anybody," Jenkins said. THE YARDSTICK 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching 400 victories is no small feat, but Jenkins still has a long way to 
go to catch El Segundo Coach John Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
 The dean of South Bay coaches is virtually out of sight with a 35-year record 
of 737-264, the winningest mark in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson and Jenkins will renew their rivalry when El Segundo and West meet 
in Pioneer League games April 27 and 29. And there's a possibility the teams 
could meet before that in the Redondo tournament. WOUNDED EAGLES 
</P>
<P>
 Injury and illness have reduced El Segundo's baseball team to a skeleton crew, 
a handicap that didn't stop the Eagles (6-2) from beating Culver City, 8-4, 
Monday in the first round of the Redondo tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Stevenson said it was difficult to make out a proper lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're down to barely being able to field a lineup without hitting our 
pitchers," Stevenson said. "Every position player was in (Monday's) lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan McCloskey, El Segundo's standout second baseman, is out indefinitely with 
a torn knee ligament, and several other players have been sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Eagles, the pitching staff has remained healthy. The team 
has five capable pitchers in senior left-hander David Reed (2-1), a returning 
All-Southern Section pick; junior left-hander Derek Fowler (2-0), and senior 
right-handers Dan Croxall (1-1), Phil Costello (1-0) and Bill Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rare for a high school team to have that much pitching depth, but 
Stevenson doesn't know how much it will help. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we played (more games) it would really mean something, but we don't have 
the innings for five pitchers," Stevenson said. "I don't know how much better 
it is to have five pitchers than three. We're trying to split the innings as 
much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo's pitching depth could pay off when it plays four games in the San 
Luis Obispo tournament during Easter break. LONG BALL 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming eligible midway through last season, Redondo third baseman 
Steve Rawson has averaged a home run every two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3, 240-pound senior hit his fourth home run of the season Saturday 
in a 6-2 victory over North Torrance in a Redondo tournament opener as the Sea 
Hawks improved to 6-3. He also homered Friday in a 9-8 victory over Beverly 
Hills in an Ocean League opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering Wednesday's game against Morningside, Rawson had nine home runs and 
29 RBIs in 19 games since coming off academic probation in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as impressive as Rawson's two-run homer Saturday that reached the lights 
in right field was his bases-empty triple that bounced off the wall in center 
field, 390 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't drive a golf ball 390 feet," Redondo Coach Tim Ammentorp said. "We 
call that part of the field the boneyard because everything hit out there dies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (Rawson's hit) was going out, but some of the players didn't think 
it would make it. We had enough time to discuss it because the ball was hit so 
high." WILD BUNCH 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount batters set an NCAA Division I record for most hit by pitches 
in a game with seven Friday in an 8-6 West Coast Conference victory over host 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Five San Francisco pitchers contributed to the record, mostly on curveballs 
that failed to find the plate. Loyola's Greg Bergeron and Mike Peters were each 
hit twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, no fights broke out. The Lions apparently understood that the 
Dons' wildness was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (12-15, 4-5 in the WCC) will play the first of four home games this 
week at 2:30 p.m. today against Hawaii-Hilo. The Lions open a three-game WCC 
series against San Diego with a 2:30 p.m. game Friday, followed by a 
doubleheader Saturday starting at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman shortstop Marc Mirizzi, who was named WCC player of the week last 
week, leads Loyola with a .364 batting average. TENNIS RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Oshiro of Loyola Marymount has set the school record for career singles 
victories. The senior from Gardena High is 76-43 over four seasons, eclipsing 
the previous mark of 73 victories set by Kris Anderson in 1986-89. 
</P>
<P>
 Oshiro, who is 20-5 this season, posted an impressive 6-1, 6-1 victory last 
week over Pepperdine's Isabella Petrov, the 46th-ranked player in the nation. 
Seventh-ranked Pepperdine won the match, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Oshiro set the Loyola record for single-season victories with a 28-9 record as 
a freshman. BASKETBALL HONORS 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Jason Pickett of Banning High was named City Section 3-A Division 
player of the year after leading the Pilots to their second consecutive 
division title. Pickett averaged 26 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Other area players named to the 3-A team were forwards Lamarr House of Gardena 
and John Terry of Narbonne, and Banning guard Eric Jett. Carson forward Charles 
Perry was named to the 4-A squad. BRIGHT FUTURES 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Seibel is excited about a group of third- and fourth-grade girls he 
coached in a Redondo Beach youth basketball league this season. He was so 
confident in his players' abilities, he entered them in a boys' tournament last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Seibel's all-star team went 0-3, but he said the girls were competitive and 
not intimidated. He wants to start a club team with the same group of players 
in hopes of developing their skills for high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes girls at that age get totally ignored," Seibel said. "My mission is 
to keep coaching them. By next season, we should be able to play in any boys' 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Standouts on Seibel's team included high-scorers Erin Eubanks and Iris Dulay 
and leading rebounder Jennifer Mardis. THIS AND THAT 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; CIVIC LIGHT 'OKLAHOMA!' IS MORE THAN JUST OK; SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA'S YOUNGEST LIGHT OPERA COMPANY SHOWS ITS MATURITY WITH A BRIGHT 
PERFORMANCE OF THE 51-YEAR-OLD MUSICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To swipe an image from "Oklahoma!," there's a bright, golden haze on stage at 
the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In only its third year, the Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities has mounted 
a supremely mellow, sunny "Oklahoma!," a production that underscores the 
maturity of the youngest civic light opera company in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing from a 2,000-member subscription base in its inaugural season to 9,000 
subscribers today, the organization has made a strong impression in a short 
time and its production of "Oklahoma!" shines light on the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 From the impressive, black-tie, 28-piece pit orchestra to the infectious 
ensemble dancing and the richly cast cowboys and cowgirls, there's a crispness 
about the show that's hard to resist. In addition, it's vocally redolent and 
visually vibrant, splashing you with its hot primary colors, largely from 
dome-like, painted drops of rolling fields and moonlit nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The show itself, the first collaboration between composer Richard Rodgers and 
librettist/lyricist Oscar Hammerstein, reinvented musical theater and remains a 
landmark 51 years after its 1943 premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, with a nudge from the 1927 musical "Showboat," "Oklahoma!" was 
revolutionary because it was the first of a new genre: a musical play that 
seamlessly integrated its story and music. Until "Oklahoma!" came along, 
musical comedies, not musical plays, dominated Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay production, under the direction and choreography of Jon 
Engstrom, encapsulates the most simple of plots. The story of a good and bad 
ranch hand vying for the affection of a farm girl is propelled by one of 
theater's great scores -- including the wind-swept title song, the lilting 
"People Will Say We're in Love," and "Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not all of the lyrics were distinct from the back of the near- 
1,500-seat house packed at last Saturday's matinee, the clarity is pearly 
smooth up front. When ruggedly handsome Perry Stephens as the hero, Curly, 
peels off such lyrics as "There's a bright golden haze on the meadow/The corn 
is as high as a elephant eye," you appreciate why the show is constantly 
revived. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, patches of it have not dated well. The villain, for instance (Dink 
O'Neal's ominously brooding, threatening Jud Fry), keeps risque girlie pictures 
tacked up on the wall of his bunkhouse, which must have seemed a silly moral 
indictment even in the '40s. It's O'Neal, on the other hand, whose powerful 
voice steals the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the Indian Territory just after the turn of the century and ending on 
the day Oklahoma became a state, the show's Protestant, white, Midwestern ethic 
was perfect for the middle of World War II. (In fact, the run streaked unbroken 
all the way into 1961.) Wisely, though, in line with other recent, local 
revivals of "Oklahoma!" cognizant of cultural history, the chorus here includes 
an African-American farm girl (the vividly swirling, energetic Definique 
Juniel). 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the remaining principals lend texture and flavor -- Nora Roque's 
petticoated, smitten romantic heroine Laurey, Danny Roque (Nora Roque's 
real-life husband) as the comical Persian peddler Ali Hakim, Eric Gunhus' 
brash, open-faced hayseed suitor Will Parker, Paula Kay Perry's no-nonsense 
mistress-of-the-ranch Aunt Eller and Jillaine Avery's dim, moony comic foil Ado 
Annie, "jist a girl," as she sings, "who cain't say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting designer Liz Stillwell floods the stage with dreamy, cartoony lights 
and John Feinstein's sound design advances the text. Agnes de Mille's original 
ballet choreography for Laurey's stunning dream sequence (fluidly enacted by 
Laura Maria Crosta, Darick Spaans and K.C. Gussler) brings down the first act 
curtain with panache. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what is a classic American musical? As a primer, this production excels 
at showing you. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Oklahoma!" Redondo Beach Per forming Arts Center, Manhattan Beach and 
Aviation boulevards, Redondo Beach, Tuesday-Saturday, 8 p.m., Saturday-Sunday 
matinees, 2 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Sunday. $20-$35. (310) 372-4477.

EDUCATION: HOW SCHOOLS CAN ADDRESS NEEDS OF GAYS AND LESBIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Educational institutions are often described as ivory towers -- places that 
operate independently of the events, trends, and other realities that surround 
them. More often than not, though, schools actually reflect what happens in 
society at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the growing attention devoted to homosexuality. Not surprisingly, 
public schools nationwide are reviewing how well they address gay and lesbian 
students' needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, clubs and discussion groups for 
gay and lesbian students have been formed on some campuses. In my own school, 
we've begun a Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Student Union, reserved part of the 
general bulletin board for the organization's announcements, and hosted 
speakers on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts are important. According to alarming statistics from the U.S. 
Department of Health, gay and lesbian youths are three times more likely to 
fall victim to suicide, attempted suicide, and substance abuse than their 
heterosexual peers. They're also more likely to drop out of school, to suffer 
social alienation and rejection by family members, and to be kicked out of 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The root of the problem, as with all types of discrimination, is ignorance. To 
combat it on campus, a variety of handbooks and curriculum guides have been 
developed. The materials are typically authored by gay and lesbian 
organizations, health professionals, civil rights groups or educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolwide, there are several oft-mentioned ways to help gay and lesbian 
students succeed and gain acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Educating and sensitizing staff and teachers is a good starting point. It's 
particularly important for school counselors and psychologists to know the 
facts -- not the myths and stereotypes -- about gays and lesbians, and to be 
able to talk and listen to such students. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local gay and lesbian organizations have speakers bureaus, and schools 
should make use of them for assemblies, debates and panel discussions to help 
inform students and staff about gay and lesbian issues. (Making such 
presentations available for parents in the evenings can help cure campus 
homophobia, too.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are also strategies teachers can employ in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 They can stop the use of anti-gay and lesbian slurs. They can discuss why such 
slurs are wrong, just as they should when students make ethnic or religious 
slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Offenders could be required to undergo some kind of appropriate educational 
and sensitivity training. 
</P>
<P>
 They can identify gay and lesbian contributions throughout the curriculum, 
including history, literature, art, science, government and math. In teaching 
about the Holocaust, the decimation of Jews is highlighted, but persecution of 
gays and lesbians is rarely mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it mentioned that a large number of well-loved writers were reputedly 
gay, lesbian or bisexual (Lord Byron, Hans Christian Anderson, Herman Melville, 
Walt Whitman, Oscar Wilde, Willa Cather, Amy Lowell, Gertrude Stein, E.M. 
Forster, Virginia Woolf, Tennessee Williams and James Baldwin, among others). 
</P>
<P>
 It is also helpful to include class discussion of gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
issues along with other minority issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week I'll provide a listing of agencies, support groups, events, 
curriculum guides and classroom materials that schools can use to help battle 
homophobia on campus.

<P>
 The St. Bernard High girls' basketball team went bargain hunting in the Bay 
Area last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Vikings went shopping at a mall in Oakland. Then they picked up a 
few free souvenir cups at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it wasn't a flea market, but the State Division championships. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive season, the Vikings took home the Division IV 
trophy by beating Bear River of Grass Valley, 53-43, Friday in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were real loose, not tense before the game," St. Bernard Coach Lori 
Pawinski said. "We went to a mall and went shopping beforehand. I wanted the 
players as calm as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was close for the first 28 minutes as neither team led by more than 
four points. But with four minutes left, the Vikings went on a 14-0 run to turn 
a four-point deficit into a 10-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the game came when the Vikings (29-4) switched from a 2-3 zone to a 
man-to-man defense and shut down Jenny Shayani, who made Bear River's last 
basket with 4 minutes 9 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their starters had been in the game for 28 minutes," Pawinski said. "We 
figured they were getting tired so we put more pressure on their best shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (30-4) tried to shut down St. Bernard's Olympia Scott and Marte 
Alexander, who each had 14 points, but sophomore Tracie Oaks stepped forward 
with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," Pawinski said. "It's better winning the second time." COLD 
SPELL 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Hills boys' basketball team should have brought jackets when they 
played in the State Division V title game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who enjoyed a hot shooting streak in Southern California, suffered 
through a cold spell in Oakland and lost to Ripon Christian, 60-46. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting 76% in the Southern California Regional final, the Bruins 
(24-9) shot only 27.4% in the state final. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Sterling, who averaged 21 points a game, and Westley Allen (18-point 
average) were held to eight points apiece. Danny Brummel led the team with 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering they finished fourth in the Delphic League and needed upset wins 
over Campbell Hall and Immanuel of Reedley to win the Southern California 
Regional championship, the Bruins were happy about earning a trip to Oakland. 
Getting there was another story. Their plane was delayed three hours and 
eventually redirected to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our offense stayed on the plane and was redirected to Juneau 
(Alaska)," Pacific Hills Coach John Bobich said. "Someone asked me what was the 
weather like. I told him it was 57 degrees and clear, but our shooting 
percentage was 27 degrees, which is well below freezing." BASKETBALL HONORS 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Walker and Ben Sanders of Westchester and Terryl Woolery of Fairfax were 
named to the All-City Section 4-A Division boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The team was selected by a panel of sportswriters in conjunction with the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, a sophomore guard, averaged 19.1 points and four assists a game. 
Sanders, a junior forward, averaged 14.7 points and four assists. Woolery, a 
senior guard, averaged 16 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.1 assists. Walker and 
Woolery were co-most valuable players of the Coastal Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, the State Division I champion, led the team with four selections, 
including player of the year Tremaine Fowlkes. TOP OF THE CHARTS 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Bernard baseball team and Crossroads softball team are ranked No. 1 in 
The Times' Westside poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (5-2) have a team batting average of .371 and are averaging 9.29 
runs a game. They have eight home runs and 19 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Dana Harrison, the leadoff hitter, leads the team with a .476 batting 
average and a .615 on-base percentage. Harrison has signed a letter of intent 
with Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hitting the ball better than I expected," St. Bernard Coach Bob Yarnall 
said. "I thought our pitching and defense would be our strong point." 
</P>
<P>

 With Lisa Longaker and Heather Compton as assistant coaches, it should not 
come as a surprise that Crossroads has an outstanding pitching staff led by 
Stanford-bound Jessica Schulman. Longaker and Compton were two of the nation's 
top collegiate pitchers when they played at UCLA. Longaker pitched from 1987-90 
and Compton played the next three years.

 In 23 innings, Schulman has given up only three hits and one walk and has not

CANDIDATE TO LEAD MEXICO IS SHOT; PRESIDENCY: RULING PARTY'S LUIS DONALDO

DETAINS TWO SUSPECTED ASSAILANTS.

 Two gunmen stepped from a crowd Wednesday and shot and seriously wounded Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling party who was 
campaigning in a poor area of this border city, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the condition of Colosio -- who is 44 and was widely expected to be 
elected president of Mexico during national elections scheduled for Aug. 21 -- 
were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 But he reportedly suffered wounds to the head and chest and was taken from the 
scene bleeding profusely. Mexican radio carried urgent appeals for a rare blood 
type for transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio was rushed to Tijuana's General Hospital, but reports indicated that 
he was to be transported via helicopter to nearby UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate was shot after a campaign speech in the neighborhood of Lomas 
Taurinas, near Tijuana's international airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The furious Tijuana crowd, estimated at 3,000 people, surged around his 
apparent assailants, beating them and detaining them, according to broadcast 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Their identities were not immediately available, but television broadcasts 
from the chaotic scene showed the alleged assailants as mustachioed men who 
appeared to be in their 20s. One of the men appeared bloodied and disheveled as 
a gun-wielding man -- possibly a security guard who was trying to ward off 
further attacks on the assailant -- battled members of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's attack promised to create further turmoil for Mexico's 
Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, as it is known. 
</P>
<P>
 The party, which has ruled Mexico for more than six decades, was badly 
embarrassed earlier this year by an Indian uprising in the southern state of 
Chiapas that left at least 145 people dead. Rebel leaders are now considering 
details of a tentative peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's shooting stunned Mexico, a nation of 92 million that had hardly 
recovered from the shock of the New Year's Day rebellion in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 His shooting came one day after Manuel Camacho Solis, the government peace 
envoy in Chiapas, announced that he would not run for president. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospective candidacy of Camacho Solis -- Colosio's chief rival within the 
PRI -- had threatened to split the ruling party since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension about August's elections has been mounting steadily since the 
insurrection in Chiapas. The rebels have called for broad national reform 
toward true democracy, and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has pledged 
reforms in the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican lawmakers are considering a broad package of reforms. Among other 
things, the proposed changes would make electoral authorities more independent 
of the PRI and other parties, stiffen penalties for voter fraud and modify the 
ballots to prevent ballot-stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, an amiable politician whose open manner contrasted with the stiff 
persona of many Mexican lawmakers, has been controversial ever since he was 
named as the party's candidate Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas, exercising a longstanding prerogative of Mexican presidents, 
personally chose Colosio -- one of his longtime proteges -- as his successor, 
passing over Camacho Solis and other rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complained that Colosio's adherence to free trade and other policies 
too closely mimicked the neo-liberal economic blueprint of Salinas. Since the 
Chiapas rebellion, Colosio -- a native of the border state of Sonora -- had 
been distancing himself somewhat from Salinas' economic plans, stressing the 
need to help the great numbers of poverty-stricken Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Colosio has long had many defenders within the structure of the PRI, which 
has been synonymous with government here since its founding in 1929. Party 
stalwarts favored him for the presidency, confident that he would do nothing to 
erode the PRI's longtime dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being named the PRI's presidential candidate, Colosio headed Mexico's 
vast Social Development secretariat, which included a multibillion-dollar 
anti-poverty initiative called Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Chiapas rebellion, many criticized Solidarity as a program 
that did little to resolve the pressing problems of rural and urban poverty 
that still characterize Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio had served as a PRI senator and chairman of the national party. An 
economist, Colosio is a native of Magdalena del Kino, near the Arizona border. 
He did postgraduate work at the University of Pennsylvania and in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States 
was "horrified by this brutal assassination attempt." 
</P>
<P>
 "We very much hope that he is able to recover fully from this attack and 
resume his distinguished career," McCurry said.

DISPUTES LURK BEHIND UKRAINE AID PACKAGE; ARMS: WASHINGTON HAS PLEDGED MORE 
HELP FOR DISMANTLING NUCLEAR ARSENAL. BUT CRITICS FEAR DANGERS MAY BE IGNORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Diplomatic smiles and champagne toasts greeted the Clinton Administration's 
decision to fatten this nation's nuclear disarmament account by $100 million 
more, as announced during Defense Secretary William J. Perry's visit here this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This financial aid will undoubtedly ease the heavy burden of disarmament on 
the Ukrainian economy," Defense Minister Vitaly Radetsky told reporters Tuesday 
after two days that took Perry from routine meetings in Kiev to unprecedented 
tours of missile bases and rocket factories in the Ukrainian heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 But lurking behind the official pleasantries are simmering disputes over how 
the American money should be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics here say the aid threatens to become a bureaucratic boondoggle that 
could give Ukraine loads of expensive equipment it doesn't need while ignoring 
the country's concerns about some of the most dangerous aspects of dismantling 
the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the total $350-million disarmament aid that Washington has promised 
Ukraine, $185 million has been committed to dismantling the country's Soviet 
"inheritance" of 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles, many of which are 
still aimed at American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest is earmarked for safety and communications equipment, military 
housing and defense conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to conventional wisdom, Ukraine won't receive hundreds of millions of 
dollars to get rid of what is now the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the 
world (after those in America and Russia). Instead it will mostly get equipment 
and expertise to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The largess, courtesy of the American taxpayer, includes computers and cranes, 
tractors and tankers, bulldozers and dump trucks, plus sundry incinerators, 
rail cars and chemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these goods will be made by American companies, and some Ukrainians 
accuse the United States of holding its own business interests above 
expediency, cost and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. aid "will be spent on the needs of American industries," said Tetiana 
Jakheeva, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament's disarmament commission. 
Jakheeva said it would be cheaper and less wasteful to write out a check. "We 
can produce many of these things ourselves," she said. "All we need is money." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashton Carter, assistant defense secretary in charge of nuclear 
non-proliferation, told reporters here that some of the aid will be spent 
directly in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 But another Pentagon official closely involved in the negotiations doubts that 
Ukraine will get a big share. "When we asked the (Ukrainians) what items they 
could produce themselves, it was a very small part," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Premier Valery Shmarov, Ukraine's chief arms negotiator, diplomatically 
hesitates to look gift horses in the mouth. "This is American taxpayers' money, 
and the U.S. decides how to spend it," he conceded in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he thinks that up to half the money could be spent on Ukrainian 
products that are cheaper than their American counterparts, while "the other 
half could be spent on U.S. technologies that we don't have." 
</P>
<P>
 There are technologies the Ukrainians desperately need but aren't getting. 
Instead, Jakheeva charged, "The U.S. is choosing the worst alternative for 
Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
 She was talking about the American plan to dispose of about 2,000 tons of 
liquid rocket fuel, known as heptyl, from the 130 SS-19 ICBMs in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Heptyl is highly toxic, explosive, unstable and probably carcinogenic. At the 
height of the Cold War, the substance was simply poured out of old nuclear 
missiles and poured back into new ones. Now it is a horrific problem to get rid 
of. And Washington and Kiev are at loggerheads over what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington wants Kiev to burn the fuel in customized new incinerators, paid 
for with U.S. aid to Ukraine. But Jakheeva charges that the burning technology 
is only experimental and has never been tested on a large scale. "Only a crazy 
person can propose such a catastrophic method," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 American sources confirm that the experiment to burn heptyl was conducted only 
last December at an Environmental Protection Agency laboratory in Arkansas. The 
test reportedly produced huge amounts of toxic fumes and enough heat to melt 
the incinerator nozzles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pentagon officials deny the dangers and insist that any incinerators sent 
to Ukraine will have the proper safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides having fears about the experimental incinerators, Ukrainians argue 
that there are alternatives to burning. "We want to get something out of the 
heptyl," said Shmarov, who is looking at proposals from American firms to 
reprocess the toxic liquid into benign products, such as an ingredient commonly 
used in shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiev wants the U.S. disarmament aid to Ukraine to cover the costs of 
reprocessing equipment. But Washington, so far, has refused, arguing that 
reprocessing techniques are also experimental and that its products will not be 
profitable enough to justify their cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a choice between the two experimental technologies, Jakheeva and other 
Ukrainian officials prefer reprocessing. And on this point, they are less 
likely to give in. "We will make the decision," Shmarov insisted. "No one can 
pressure us." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the negotiations drag on, time is running out. Now that Ukraine has 
begun retiring the oldest SS-19s and shipping warheads to Russia under the 
trilateral nuclear pact signed by the American, Ukrainian and Russian 
presidents in January, its stockpiles of heptyl are swelling. "I hope there's a 
compromise," said an American defense official. "This stuff is really bad, and 
it must be gotten rid of."

SUIT AGAINST NATO IS FILED BY YUGOSLAVIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The International Court of Justice said Wednesday that Yugoslavia has started 
proceedings against NATO, accusing members of breaching the U.N. Charter by 
threatening to use force in Bosnia-Herzegovina without Security Council 
authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said in a statement that Yugoslavia, now made up of Serbia and 
Montenegro, has filed suit against NATO's member states for issuing an 
ultimatum threatening to bomb Serbian artillery encircling Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslavia says the ultimatum breached U.N. rules because the threat of force 
had not been authorized by the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the ultimatum, NATO officials said the threat of force was 
permissible under previous Security Council resolutions relating to the Bosnian 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Artillery attacks on the Bosnian capital ended when the Serbs withdrew their 
guns from surrounding hills after NATO threatened air strikes if they were not 
removed by midnight Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The international court indicated that Yugoslavia's case may never be heard if 
individual NATO states do not agree to answer the charge.

S. AFRICA TAKES REINS OF CISKEI HOMELAND

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Africa appointed two men to administer the Ciskei homeland Wednesday and 
sent troops to the region's frontier as former military ruler Oupa Gqozo packed 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciskei became the second nominally independent apartheid homeland in two weeks 
to collapse in the face of strikes and civil service protests when Gqozo 
resigned suddenly Tuesday and asked for South Africa's help. 
</P>
<P>
 A Transitional Executive Council spokesman said Gqozo's entire government had 
been dismissed. He said administrators appointed by the multi-party 
transitional council, which is overseeing preparations for South Africa's first 
all-race elections April 26-28, will meet homeland officials today to finalize 
the takeover of power.

S. KOREA TROOPS ON ALERT; NORTH BLASTS U.S. MOVES

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Korea put its armed forces on special alert Wednesday as the north 
warned that U.S. deployment of antimissile batteries in the south will push the 
peninsula to the brink of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions have mounted rapidly in recent days, with North Korea responding 
dramatically to rising Western pressure on the isolated Stalinist state to 
prove that it is not developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In another move likely to inflame the situation, South Korea confirmed that 
this year's "Team Spirit" joint military exercises with U.S. forces will go 
ahead, perhaps as early as next month, and will involve the Patriot missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Seoul and Washington had suspended Team Spirit on condition North Korea allow 
full inspections of its nuclear facilities. But the International Atomic Energy 
Agency says it was barred from making full inspections of a facility. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff issued the alert order covering 650,000 
troops as a precaution against North Korea provoking an armed conflict while 
President Kim Young Sam is abroad, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim leaves today for a weeklong trip to Japan and China. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's Central News Agency called the U.S. decision to deploy Patriot 
missiles in key sites around Seoul "a provocative step to drive the situation 
into extremes."

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK; MAYBE SIREN WOULD HAVE MOVED DONKEYS

<P>
 An ambulance driver must be able to get where he is going quickly, and get 
there safely. Those are the same traits needed for a driver in a marathon 
rally, such as Paris-to-Dakar-to-Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Secoamerica, Inc., a Newport Beach-based holding company 
with interests in ambulance service, entered a three-man team in the 18-day, 
7,500-mile rally that twice crossed the Sahara Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Blevin, 30, an ambulance driver from Anaheim, was selected to drive the 
team's diesel-powered Toyota Landcruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Secoamerica looked at it, if we can't get from point A to point B 
without getting in an accident of our own, we can't help the patient," Blevin 
said after finishing the grueling competition without mishap. "The company will 
use us as an example to all its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words, if I can drive 12,000 kilos without being in a wreck, then 
the rest of them should be able to drive 12-hour shifts safely." 
</P>
<P>
 Secom, Inc., the Japanese parent corporation that owns Secoamerica, Inc., 
entered drivers from Japan in the Paris-Beijing Rally in 1992, and the company 
reported that the resulting focus on safety resulted in an 18% reduction in 
losses from accidents in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Blevin was on the road 62 hours 46 minutes 31 seconds and finished 47th 
overall of 127 entries. It was the only American entry in his class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I'll always remember most about the trip was fatigue," Blevin said. 
"I don't think either Doug (Neal) or I was ready physically for it, even though 
we had trained for more than three months around Barstow, the Glamis sand dunes 
(near the Salton Sea) and in Japan. We were fatigued by the third day out when 
we broke the front end and lost the shocks and had to drive all night to catch 
up. Fatigue was with us all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, who was Blevin's navigator and rode every mile, is an emergency medical 
technician from Seattle. Eric Smith, a paramedic from Key West, Fla., was the 
team manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were chosen from 65 applicants throughout the United States after 
Secoamerica sent a bulletin to its 2,500 employees, asking for volunteers. When 
the list had been pared to eight, the remaining group was given off-road 
training by rally champion Rod Millen before going through a two-day test of 
navigational skills and driving ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only one who had any racing experience of any kind," Blevin said. 
"I had never driven in an off-road race, but I had ridden with Ivan Stewart and 
Mickey Thompson and others in the Baja 1000, Mint 400 and other races. I had 
also worked as a mechanic for Cal Wells on the Toyota racing team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a dream come true, getting this chance. My interest in racing 
began when I was 15. A friend of mine invited me to an off-road race, and his 
dad was working on Jerry Welchel's car. He asked me if I'd like to be the gas 
man for one of the teams, and from that day on, I was hooked. I progressed to 
tire man and then became a mechanic and co-driver." 
</P>
<P>
 The rally started in Paris and crossed Spain to Gibraltar, where the 
contestants were ferried to North Africa. From there, they crossed the Sahara 
to Dakar, Senegal, then back north across the Sahara again to the Mediterranean 
and another ferry trip leading to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leaving Paris was exciting," Blevin said. "It was raining, but people were 
lined up along the streets, waving and hollering and cheering. In Granada, when 
we stopped for a red light, people swarmed around the car and when the light 
changed, they moved just enough for the car to squeeze through. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us that the streets were packed with people at 8 a.m. and the rally 
wasn't due until midnight. People in Spain just seem to love an excuse for a 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the teams were warned about camels in the desert, Blevin said the 
worst problem was with sand crabs and locusts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of days in Morocco, we ran through swarms of locusts. It 
looked like a blizzard. We had to get out and scrape them off the radiator, 
they were making the car overheat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sand crabs were eight to 10 inches in diameter. We also saw a lot of 
donkeys. In fact, in some areas, donkeys were the main mode of transportation. 
It was funny being in a town and not seeing any cars. It was like old 
horse-and-buggy days, except instead of horses, they used donkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were out in the desert, we'd run across wild donkeys. They were a 
nuisance because they wouldn't move. They'd just stand and stare at us." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problems were getting stuck in the sand or lost in the vast 
wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got stuck for five hours, and we didn't make our checkpoint in the 
allotted time. We got penalized 16 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had trained for the desert in Glamis and had learned to read the sand, but 
the sand in parts of the Sahara is like an illusion. It looks hard, but it's 
soft as snow. For every shovelful of sand, three more fall in. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Altar to Nouadhibou (in Mauritania), we drove all day and night trying 
to catch up. All we got was about 20 minutes' sleep in two days. It's worst 
when it gets dark and you have to drive all night, after having driven all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no road signs, most of the time no roads of any kind. You go by the 
route book, charting the course by compass and global satellite positioning." 
</P>
<P>
 Speeds ranged from 5 to 80 m.p.h. in the Landcruiser.

 Horse tales: 
</P>
<P>
 After his retirement, jockey Sammy Renick became one of the first racing 
telecasters, and in the late 1950s he came to California to play a small part 
in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was called "Wind Across the Everglades," and besides Renick there 
could hardly have been a more diverse cast: Burl Ives, Christopher Plummer, 
Gypsy Rose Lee, Two Ton Tony Galento, Emmett Kelly, MacKinlay Kantor and Peter 
Falk, making his film debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days before production started, Budd Schulberg, who wrote and directed 
the film, happened across Renick in the studio barber shop, about to get his 
goatee shaved off. Schulberg believed that the short beard fit Renick 
perfectly, and an argument ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left it on," Renick said. "They paid me an extra $200 a day not to get it 
shaved off." 
</P>
<P>
 Renick's big scene was a mud bath fight with Galento, the former heavyweight 
who outweighed the ex-jockey by more than 2 to 1. At the end of the fight, 
Galento was supposed to pick up Renick and throw him to the left of the camera. 
Off camera, a 6-foot-5 weightlifter-type would catch Renick. 
</P>
<P>
 When time came, Galento lifted Renick and heaved him to the right by mistake. 
Renick bounced off of a fence, crumpled to the ground and came up cursing. 
"You. . . ," he said to Galento. "Why the hell didn't you throw me where you 
were supposed to?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeez," Galento stammered. "I never could tell my left from my right." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well you sure knew the difference when you were getting hit by Joe Louis," 
Renick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Renick is still proud of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't bad," he said. "It got three stars." Two and a half, according to 
critic Leonard Maltin. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Years ago, when Chick Lang was general manager of Pimlico, trainer Bryan Webb 
and a friend came into his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman had one of those big draw-string purses," Lang said. "She turned it 
upside down on my desk and money kept falling out." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb asked Lang if he would keep the cash in the track's safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't trust myself (betting) with all that money," Webb said. "No matter 
what, don't give it to me until the meet's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Lang was reluctant to be Webb's private banker, but finally agreed to secure 
the money. They counted it, about $27,000, mostly in small denominations, and 
packaged it in envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got this to get me through," said Webb, pulling a small bankroll from 
his pants pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days later, Webb came to Lang, asking for the money in the safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not giving it to you," Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I need it, Chick," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care," Lang said. "We made a deal, and I'm not giving it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, Chick." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing doing, Bryan." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chick. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, sir. It stays in the safe." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's where it stayed until the meet ended. This was years ago. Webb has 
never used Lang as a banker again. 
</P>

 Harry Tendler, the 85-year-old press-box steward at Gulfstream Park, buried 
his wife earlier this month. Janice Tendler's ashes were scattered in the 
track's winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to go out a winner, because that's what she was," Tendler said. 
"She left the instructions in her will. I've got the same instructions in my 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that uncommon for horsemen and racing fans to request that their 
ashes be spread over a racetrack. The ashes of Eric Guerin, the Hall of Fame 
jockey, were scattered at Calder Race Course, not far from Gulfstream, last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a well-known track in the Midwest, there have been numerous requests for 
funeral services accompanied by a scattering of the deceased's ashes. So many 
requests, in fact, that the track superintendent noticed that some of the ashes 
were blowing onto the turf course, killing the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still do the services, but there's been one change," the superintendent 
said. "We simulate the ashes with regular dirt, so we can protect the turf 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked where the real ashes go, he said: "We dump them about a mile from here, 
on the highway." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Paseana, two-time Eclipse Award winner and winner of the Santa Margarita 
Handicap in her last start, has suffered a splint-bone injury in her left 
foreleg and will be sidelined for a month. The setback will prevent Paseana 
from trying to become the first three-time winner of the Apple Blossom Handicap 
at Oaklawn Park. With Paseana out, local horses Stalcreek and Southern Truce 
might be headed for the April 22 race. . . . Lakeway has returned to the track 
after bruising a foot while winning the Santa Anita Oaks. Her owner, Mike 
Rutherford, and her trainer, Gary Jones, have not closed the door on running in 
the Kentucky Derby instead of the Kentucky Oaks. To make the filly eligible for 
the Triple Crown, Rutherford would have to pay $6,000 by April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Gryder, who rode only seven winners out of 191 mounts at Santa Anita, is 
returning to the Midwest. Gryder will ride at Oaklawn Park and Keeneland. . . . 
Gary Stevens, who rode three winners Wednesday to move into a tie with Alex 
Solis in the standings, starts a five-day suspension today. . . . Eddie 
Delahoussaye, who rode Argolid to a third-place finish in the Louisiana Derby 
at the Fair Grounds, caught flu in New Orleans and took off his mounts 
Wednesday. . . . Tricky Code, the California shipper who was 9-10 in the Fair 
Grounds Oaks, ran second, three lengths behind Two Altazano. . . . Princely 
Foe, the 69-1 shot that Jorge Tejeira rode to victory Wednesday, hadn't run in 
nine months and outran only one horse in his only start. Tejeira, 45, rode in 
the East for several years before recently returning to California, where he 
won the Santa Anita Derby with Avatar in 1975 and the Santa Anita Handicap with 
Royal Glint in 1976.

TRADING GROUP QUITS EXCHANGE IN HONG KONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hong Kong's oldest colonial trading group, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., 
said Wednesday that it would quit the local stock exchange in a dispute linked 
with the colony's 1997 return to China. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will discontinue the secondary listing of its ordinary 
shares from the Hong Kong bourse on Dec. 31. Its shares will continue to trade 
in London, where they have had their primary listing since 1992, and on other 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Henry Keswick denied that the move indicated a loss of confidence in 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would emphasize that our decision is related to the regulatory position of 
the company and does not signal any lack of confidence in the future of Hong 
Kong itself. Indeed, we hope that one day it will again be possible for our 
shares to be listed in Hong Kong," Keswick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jardine Matheson Group has traded in and with Hong Kong and China for a 
century and a half. Now that a new era is beginning, we are as confident as 
ever in Hong Kong's future as a Special Administrative Region of the People's 
Republic of China," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine, which was already trading on the south China coast before Hong Kong's 
foundation as a British colony in the early 1840s, has fought a long but 
unsuccessful battle to avoid being regulated in the territory after it returns 
to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, whose management is predominantly British, in 1984 shocked a Hong 
Kong already jittery about its political future by moving its legal home to 
Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
 The group now wants to be regulated by a new Bermuda takeover code rather than 
Hong Kong regulations, but has failed to reach agreement with the colony's 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jardine has also long suffered bad relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Beijing blasted the company after London-based director Sir Charles 
Powell, once a close aide of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, 
was quoted as supporting Gov. Chris Patten's drive for democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In its attack, the official New China Xinhua News Agency raised Jardine 
Matheson's origins as an opium trader, a business that which provoked two wars 
between Britain and China leading to the foundation and expansion of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine Group is now involved in a wide range of businesses from property and 
supermarkets automobile dealerships motor dealers and hotels.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: WOODSMAN, SPARE THAT TREE -- OR MAYBE NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trees may be essential to life, but like all important living things -- mom, 
work, the dog, your best friend -- they can also be a pain. 
</P>
<P>
 They provide the air you breathe, while they scatter the leaves you rake; they 
are the roof overhead and the sap stains on your best shoes; they provide 
shade, while they bore through your sewage pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 They can both add to and subtract from the value of your home, which is why 
many homeowners have mixed emotions about the trees on their street. Staff 
writer Jeff Meyers, who wrote today's Centerpiece story on tree troubles in the 
county, is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "While never actually hugging a tree, I have a deep appreciation for their 
existence, especially those lining suburban streets or shading lawns," Meyers 
said. "Aside from giving neighborhoods character and charm, trees convey a 
sense of stability and strength, sentries standing watch over our homes." 
</P>
<P>
 But sentries too can be pests; ask any dog owner. Or ask any city arborist, 
who must choose the trees that line our streets and deal with some of the 
eccentric choices made years ago by his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of those choices, some cities have monstrous sewer-choking 
laurels, high-maintenance corals and diseased Monterey pines. Public works 
crews have ministered to the sick, euthanized the dying and assassinated the 
incorrigible. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which is expensive and ultimately unsatisfactory to budget-conscious 
city leaders, horticulturists and homeowners alike. 
</P>
<P>
 And the trees are none too happy either. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reporting the story, I was told by a few arborists that people have asked 
cities to chop down trees for selfish reasons," Meyers said. "Leaves make a 
mess. Sap drips on cars. If this kind of attitude prevails, we might as well 
plant plastic trees and install Astroturf. Or just pave over everything." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no easy transition from trees to food, so I won't even try. I'll just 
let you know that on today's food page, you will find our new Tidbits column. 
We will be reporting on restaurants, staff changes at local eateries, food 
demonstrations, cookbooks, tastings, special dinners and other food news from 
around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 If you hear about new eating establishments, or if an old favorite closes -- 
or changes management, chefs, hours or menus -- please give columnist Leo Smith 
a call. Or drop him a line. Leo is always out to lunch -- and breakfast and 
dinner -- these days, but he'll get back to you.

THEATER REVIEW; 'DROP DEAD!' BENEFITS FROM BAD ACTING; THE COMEDY INCLUDES A 
PLAY-WITHIN-A-PLAY WITH INCOMPETENT PERFORMERS, A BAD SCRIPT AND BIG EGOS. AS A 
SATIRE, IT WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actors overplay their parts, reading their lines off of notes concealed in 
their costumes and in accents ranging from mediocre to just plain bad. When 
they aren't trying to upstage the other players, they're walking into walls or 
stumbling over the furniture. Cues are missed, and sound effects come in late, 
if at all. Nepotism, politics and egos run rampant. Aah, community theater! 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but this time it's supposed to be that way, in "Drop Dead!," a satire 
written by Billy van Zandt and Jane Milmore that's being performed in Oxnard by 
the Etc., Etc., Etc. theater company. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the group's first production in Heritage Square, a site that will be 
utilized by at least one more local community theater group in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 For this play, the Petit Ranch House's basement has been converted to a small 
but functional theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The enveloping story of "Drop Dead!" finds director Victor Le Pewe trying to 
mount an English-style mystery that's been adapted from a work by Alabama 
Miller, an American. It's the final rehearsal and everything is going wrong, 
much to the distress of producer Sol Weisenheimer, who has cast his, um, 
"protegee," showgirl Candy Apples, as the ingenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the cast incompetent and the script itself a shambles, but egos 
run rampant and one of the leading actors is so hearing-impaired that lines 
have to be read to her via radio over a headset she's wearing. And then, the 
bodies start piling up -- and not just the victims specified in the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Within that framework, the show presents two versions of the "English" play in 
question: a dress rehearsal and the opening night performance, each a failure 
in its own way. Miller objects to what's been done to his original script, 
which is pretentious and no potential prize winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors love to portray bad actors: There's always a bit of a wink involved, as 
though the audience is supposed to know that everybody's kidding other, really 
bad actors. A problem with this production of "Drop Dead!" is that several of 
the actors' performances don't vary enough between playing bad actors and 
regular characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Still (and not to be too patronizing), this is a comedy, and not intended as a 
high-minded intellectual exercise. Director Judy Heiliger keeps it moving 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 And, there are a couple of particularly noteworthy performances. Alan Price, 
always dependable, here plays an actor who wants to change the butler he plays 
from English to French; Kathleen Hobson is delightful as ditzy Candy; and Nita 
Fouhse virtually walks away with the show by underplaying her role as the 
hearing-impaired actress. 
</P>
<P>
 Also appearing are Irv Citron as Le Pewe, Chuck Frankenberg as stage manager 
Philip (both played as flamboyant gays), Hugh Bogan as Weisenheimer, Scott L. 
Johnson as Miller, Glen Heppner as the English play's romantic lead (opposite 
Candy), Kay Digby as grande dame Mona Monet, and Elmer Ferber as a plumber who 
is cast because he's the brother of the "Today" show's film reviewer Gene 
Shalit. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its drawbacks, "Drop Dead!" is a lot of fun, and bodes well for the 
future of Etc., Etc., Etc. in its handsome new home. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Drop Dead!" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. through April 9 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Petit Ranch House, 730 S. B St. (Heritage Square), Oxnard

THEATER REVIEW; AN INVITATION TO CHECK IN FOR LAUGHS; OTTAVIO'S DINNER THEATER 
PERFORMS 'MURDER AT HOWARD JOHNSON'S' AS A SILLY AND SEXY ROMP -- WITHOUT A 
SERIOUS MOMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You've heard of film noir , right? Well, the folks at Dinner Theater at 
Ottavio's are presenting something that can be called "play orange and blue" -- 
after the corporate color scheme of one of America's largest hotel chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran comedy scribes Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick's "Murder at the Howard 
Johnson's" dates to the late '70s, and the laughter resounds today. It's silly, 
it's sexy (sort of), and it's just under two hours of wall-to-wall fun without 
a single serious thought. 
</P>
<P>
 As the play opens, Mitchell Lovell (Damian Gravino) and Arlene Miller (Denice 
Stradling) are holed up in a room at a Howard Johnson hotel, awaiting Arlene's 
husband, Paul (Keith Moreton). When he arrives, Arlene and Mitchell plan to 
kill him so their affair can continue unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 This being a comedy, all immediately goes awry. Mitchell is unspeakably vain 
("I'm a dentist, Arlene; I can have any woman I want!"), Paul is thoroughly 
dull, Arlene is dimwitted and easily distracted -- and all three share a 
characteristic that foils their plans for the rest of the play: They are all 
just too nice to follow through on whatever dire plans they may dream up. 
</P>
<P>
 As the play progresses, Mitchell, Paul and Arlene switch allegiance, with 
uniformly amusing results. The various permutations (all with murder in mind) 
take place in the same Howard Johnson's room over a year's time. 
</P>
<P>
 One of this production's many attributes is the set, designed by Tom Murry and 
furnished courtesy of the Reseda branch of the Johnson chain. In addition to 
the chairs, tables and painting, there's some elaborate construction -- so that 
some of the action can take place on a window ledge. There is also a wooden 
contraption for the last scene, the funniest murder attempt of all. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this would work without good actors or imaginative direction, and 
director Martin Horsey (who played the title role in the Ottavio's production 
of "The Foreigner") is working with a highly capable trio of farceurs . 
</P>
<P>
 Also worthy of note is the work that the Dinner Theater at Ottavio's people 
have put into re-creating a Howard Johnson atmosphere. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Murder at the Howard Johnson's." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Thursday and Friday nights at 7 through April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ottavio's Banquet Facility, 340 Mobil Ave., Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $25 per person, includes show, buffet dinner, nonalcoholic beverage, 
tax and gratuity. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Not recommended for children due to some sexual situations. Doors open 
at 6:30 p.m. Call 484-9909.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: WESTERN RADIO STATION COMES CRACKLING TO LIFE; NEW K-TND

 If you were tuning your radio about 5 p.m. on Tuesday, March 8, you may have 
noticed an oddly quiet spot on the dial followed by crackling and thunder 
sounds. But that wasn't static. It was the dramatic debut of Ventura County's 
new country radio station, K-TND, Thunder Country (105.5-FM). 
</P>
<P>
 As the county's second country radio station, K-TND shares the airwaves with 
K-HAY (100.7-FM). So now you've got the luxury of channel surfing between 
commercials and the zillionth time someone plays the latest Billy Ray Cyrus 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 To introduce listeners to K-TND, on-air personalities Bob Allen and Billy 
Gibson will host an outdoor debut party Sunday in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring the family out to enjoy a free tri-tip barbecue, giveaways, and live 
country music by Platte River Crossing. Rick Henderson will teach "The Thunder 
Thrust," a line dance that he and David Graves choreographed for the occasion. 
</P>

 CLIP & SAVE: Fanfest '94. Until now country music fans had to go to Nashville 
to meet and greet their favorite stars at Music City's annual Fanfair. But with 
a quick drive to Pomona, they can participate in Fanfest '94, expected to be 
country music's largest fan-driven event and the first of its kind on the West 
Coast. Fanfest '94 will take place 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. May 4 through May 7 at 
Fairplex, the Los Angeles County Fair and Exposition Complex in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; MOORPARK'S SWASHBUCKLING SUCCESS; MUSIC THEATER OFFERS 
CONSISTENTLY IMPRESSIVE SINGING AND EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCES OF GILBERT & 
SULLIVAN'S 'PIRATES OF PENZANCE.'

<P>
 There isn't a nicer group of buccaneers to be found plundering the bounding 
mainthan "The Pirates of Penzance." To them, fighting anybody weaker is 
dishonorable; their principles also prohibit causing any harm to orphans. 
Still, young Frederic is anxious to leave the gallant band, to whom he was 
apprenticed as a child when his nurse misheard orders to sign him up as a 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 It's typical Gilbert & Sullivan nonsense; the kind of British comedy -- 
literate but supremely silly -- that came to inspire such modern acts as the 
Monty Python troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College's Music Theater, which has been producing Gilbert & Sullivan 
shows under the direction of Marilyn Anderson for several years, has come up 
with another winning entry; thanks to consistently impressive singing and 
effective performances, it may be their strongest in some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederic is about to marry his nurse, Ruth. Even though she's several years 
older, she's the only woman he remembers ever having seen, assuring him that 
she's beautiful as the pirates snicker behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the pirates' hiding place is invaded by a covey of pretty girls, all 
wards of Major-General Stanley and all much younger than Ruth. Smitten by 
Mabel, Frederic is determined to marry her as soon as his indenture to the 
pirates is fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 The other pirates have their eyes on the remaining girls, much to the 
Major-General's distress ("I object to pirates as sons-in-law!"). 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, this all gets sorted out, with everybody happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several actors familiar to regular fans of the college's musical productions 
appear here, joined by some welcome newcomers. Among the veterans are James 
Kirkland as the resolutely dutiful Frederic, Andrew Krigel as the very model of 
a modern Major-General, Robert Weaver as the police sergeant and Raymond 
Michael Hebel (whose day job is as an Elvis Presley impersonator) as the 
swashbuckling Pirate King. New to the Moorpark stage is soprano Julie Robles, 
wonderful as Mabel, especially on her character's signature "Poor Wand'ring 
One." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has double-cast many of the supporting roles to give exposure to more 
actors, but all performers listed above appear in all shows. In addition, there 
is an unusually large chorus, thrilling on the numbers that feature them. The 
indefatigable Darryl Archibald accompanies the entire show on piano. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Pirates of Penzance." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.; run concludes Sunday at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Forum Theater, Moorpark College, 7075 Campus Road, Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $8 general admission, $7 students and senior citizens, $6 children 
under 12.

SOUNDS: AFTER 24 YEARS, LEE OSKAR TURNS TO POST-WAR LIFE; HARMONICA PLAYER QUIT 
THE R & B GROUP TO PURSUE HIS SOLO CAREER AND BUSINESS. HE BRINGS HIS NEW ACT 
TO WHEELER HOT SPRINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 B group War made a big splash in the '70s, with such hits as "Cisco Kid," 
"World Is A Ghetto" and "Lowrider," and they've been riding the ripples ever 
since. One of the distinguishing features of the their trademark sound was the 
salt 'n' silk timbre of Lee Oskar's harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, anyway, until Jan. 1 of this year. That is when Oskar, long 
disgruntled with the group's management and eager to chase down his own private 
muse, officially called it quits after 24 years of duty with the band. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Danish-born Oskar, the motive for quitting wasn't only to pick up the 
threads of a long-stymied solo career -- he hasn't put out a solo work since 
three well-received albums in the late '70s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1983, Oskar has produced a line of custom harmonicas under the Lee Oskar 
name and has made some strong inroads on the manufacturing side of the music 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In his shoes as a bandleader, Oskar will pass through the area on Sunday, 
returning to Wheeler Hot Springs, where he played last summer. He'll bring 
along a group of accomplished, versatile Los Angelenos: saxophonist is Larry 
Klimas, bassist Bob Mair, drummer Dave Karasony, guitarist Darryl Karrako, 
percussionist Dave Romero and keyboardist Jeff Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to get into something like Weather Report," Oskar 
explained, referring to the jazz fusion ensemble established in the 1970s. "I'd 
love to experience new things and take my music to another plateau. These guys 
I'm performing with are certainly going to help me do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The harmonica-making business also takes Oskar to distant corners. Last week, 
Oskar spoke on the phone from Frankfurt, Germany, where he was holding down a 
booth at the Musik Messe trade show, the largest international convention for 
music manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a major turning point in Oskar's musical career -- life after War. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ends up that there are three things that I had responsibility to: 
manufacturing and marketing harmonicas, the War thing, and my solo career. I 
had to give up one of those, or I would spread myself too thin." 
</P>
<P>
 What you won't hear from Oskar is an easily tagged, homogenous musical 
approach. His material and technique incorporates strains of R & B, pop, blues 
and jazz, eluding easy definitions of his music. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of it all may be a blues tradition, he says. "In a sense, blues is 
not just a 12-bar form or the typical three chords," he said. "It's a way you 
express something. Ray Charles is probably my greatest influence. He could sing 
about toothpaste and make you cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his own music, Oskar said, "I look at it as being different tubes of paint, 
for different paintings. Different things create different moods. I like 
grooves. I like funk, reggae, what you call jazz. I don't know how to 
categorize it all." 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, is Oskar's answer when people ask him what kind of music he plays? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two answers: one is, if someone asks me, 'What kind of music do you 
play?' I say, 'What kind of music do you like?' Whatever they say, I come back 
with, 'Yeah, I play that.' I remember with War, we had a number one hit, 'World 
Is A Ghetto.' It was on three different charts -- on the pop, jazz, and R & B," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of times, people will follow a trend based on image and 
marketing. But the bottom line is, if the music has some depth to it, if it 
doesn't sound like it's painting-by-numbers, then it rings true. The old cliche 
is true, about it being a universal language. It don't matter where you are in 
the world: If the magic is there, it comes across. If I didn't believe that, I 
would be going crazy." THE WORLD AT YOUR DOORSTEP 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us tend to register skepticism whenever culture is presented with 
exclamation points, as if an extra ounce of hype were necessary for 
salesmanship. But in the case of the Ventura County Symphony's "Musics Alive!" 
series, all is forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 As heard at last week's "China Alive!" the second concert in music director 
Boris Brott's three-concert series, the celebration of contemporary and world 
music is proving to be the event of the musical season in the county. Really! 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the program, at Ojai's Rancho Del Rey, was the seductive Chinoiserie 
of British composer Arthur Bliss's 1923 work, "Women of Yueh." Stately soprano 
Kerry Walsh sang with pearly potency, as is her wont. Later, more authentic 
Chinese sonorities were fascinatingly demonstrated by Zhang Yan, performing 
alone on the gu-zheng -- like a giant, ultra-resonant zither -- and with a 
chamber ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the evening, though, was the impressive three-movement 
work, "Music for a Thousand Autumns," written by Chinese-Canadian composer 
Alexina Louie for an ensemble utilizing Western and Eastern instruments and 
techniques. In a piece both enchanting and bracing, Louie smartly explored 
commonality between different traditions under universal culture umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians gathered here, notably pianist Gloria Cheng, delivered a 
consistently high level of sensitivity and clarity in this enriching 
border-crossing adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up: "India Alive!" at the Spanish Hills Country Club in Camarillo on 
April 12. Details

 Larry Chambers lives in Ojai, the tiny city with the peaceful aura, and writes 
books and articles about Wall Street, the frantic hub of the financial 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers settled in Ojai four years ago to "significantly change his life and 
do something that wasn't centered around making money," he says. He decided to 
be a writer and now earns a living producing books specifically about making 
money. Co-authored with Kenn Miller, the new paperback edition of "The First 
Time Investor -- How to Start Safe, Invest Smart and Sleep Well!" was picked as 
a Fortune Magazine selection for the Book of the Month Club's August '94 list. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers and Miller met as soldiers in Vietnam. They use military metaphors in 
the book, comparing finding investments to gathering intelligence on enemy 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers exorcised his Vietnam ghosts in "Recondo," published two years ago by 
Ballantine/Ivy, in which he describes his war experiences in graphic detail. He 
is now working on "The Bank Customer's Guide to Safe and Smart Investing," with 
Jeffrey H. Champlin, and has signed with Irwin Professional Publishing to write 
"Asset Class Investing," a book for the everyday investor. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who wanted to get away from it all is also editor-at-large for 
financial planning at Wall Street magazine and has completed a screenplay 
making the rounds in Hollywood.

 Happy birthday, Port Hueneme, which incorporated March 24, 1948. Wene'mu, the

NIGHT LIFE: ARLO HAS KEPT IN TUNE WITH FAMILY LEGEND; THE SON OF THE LEGENDARY 
WOODY GUTHRIE HAS STUCK TO THE KIND OF MUSIC THAT MADE HIM FAMOUS IN THE '60S.

 Sometimes central casting gets it right. Need a guy who can always get the bad 
guy? Get The Duke. How about someone who can stare down a tank? Get Clint. Need 
an "aging hippie?" There's Arlo. That's the description for Guthrie's 
character, Alan Moon, on the new TV show "Byrds of Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally at home on the boob-tube, in a crossword puzzle or on the road, 
Guthrie will bring his wry folk songs to the venerable Ventura Theatre on 
Friday night. He'll be the hippie-type individual singing about Alice, and 
other things. Beforehand, blues harmonica dude Charlie Musselwhite will blast 
the parsley off the plates of the diners. 
</P>
<P>
 Guthrie's dad, Woody, who chronicled Depression-era America with a keen wit 
and a populist attitude, got Arlo started early in the music biz. Through 
Woody, Arlo met everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Guthrie's career took off after an appearance at the Newport Folk 
Festival in 1967, and he had a couple of hits with "Coming Into Los Angeles" 
and "City of New Orleans." Guthrie was at Woodstock, and his anthem-like 
"Alice's Restaurant" became a movie of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Guthrie purchased the Trinity Church in Great Barrington, 
Mass., of "Alice's Restaurant" fame. It's now the home of Rising Son Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Guthrie's own words from his "oughtabiography" pretty much cover what came 
next: "I married Jackie Hyde (a former Miss Malibu) in 1969, helped raise four 
strange kids and wrote lots of songs on my farm. I continue my mission even 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 From Hawaii, the folk singer discussed the life and times of an infinitely 
patient Red Sox fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know you're a legend to every crossword puzzle fan in America because 
seemingly every day there's a clue that says "Woody's boy"? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, that's one of my more recent accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you on that never-ending tour? 
</P>
<P>
 I was up until November of last year. But right now I'm a recurring character 
on this new ABC show, "The Byrds of Paradise." I used to be on the road nine or 
10 months of the year. Right now, though, things are up to ABC as to how the 
show does. I was just starting to get good on stage, too. It only took me 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people can't wait to get rid of their kids, but you took yours on tour. 
What's up with that? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we did a family tour last summer with my three daughters and my son Abe, 
and his band, Xavier. It was great. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret to surviving on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 Wow, no one's ever asked me that one. Let's see, I'm only on my second cup of 
coffee . . . a sense of humor, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did you start your own record label? 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 years ago, Bonnie Raitt, Gordon Lightfoot, myself and a lot of other 
folk artists got axed by Warner Bros. We didn't really know what to do, but we 
knew we still wanted to make records, so we started our own record company. 
Later, we were able to reacquire all of our old records from Warner Bros. and 
reissue them. The company is doing really well and I'm very happy about it. I'm 
able to make the kind of music I've wanted to make for 20 years. They won't 
sell a million copies and you won't hear them on the radio, but they do well. 
In 1992, we put out a children's album called "Woody's 20 Grow Big Songs." I 
sang along with my dad on some of his old recordings, plus my daughters were on 
it. The record was nominated for a Grammy. Also, I put out an album of old 
cowboy songs and, just this week, we released an album of myself and Pete 
Seeger recorded live last summer called "More Together Again." 
</P>
<P>
 Is folk music getting bigger, smaller or staying the same? 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's kind of staying the same. In every town, there's always a place 
where people can just sit around and play music. Folk music just seems to go on 
and on, and it's kept me working for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Who goes to your shows, old hippies? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I think so, except now they're disguised as normal people. Some of them 
bring their kids, but a lot of younger people just show up on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like being a music star in the '60s? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh man, I was 18; I had a hit, and I wasn't married. It was great. I highly 
recommend it. It was an entirely different world then, very innocent, very fun. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like having a famous father? 
</P>
<P>
 You'll have to ask my kids. Oh, you mean my dad? It was great for me. I got 
into places I was too young to get into. I got to hang around with people that 
were a lot older than me just because I was Woody Guthrie's son. I mean, I got 
to play with Bill Monroe, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. I just had the 
opportunity to learn a lot from a lot of different people. 
</P>
<P>
 You've played with everybody -- anything you haven't done? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, there's a couple of things I'd like to do. I'd like to go on tour with 
the Dead, and I'd like to tour with Dylan. I played a few shows with him a few 
years ago, but never a whole tour. I think in these days where shows are 
costing more and more, it would be an attractive package. 
</P>
<P>
 Can music change the world? 
</P>
<P>
 It did. It does. And it will. 
</P>
<P>
 Who do you listen to when you're just hanging out? 
</P>
<P>
 I listen to everything, even the old guys like Bach and Beethoven, on up to my 
own peers. I also like a lot of the new bands. 
</P>
<P>
 What advice would you give aspiring musicians? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't do it for the money. If you love it, you're gonna do it anyway. Details

KIDS ON FILM; DESPITE WEIRD STUFF, 'GILBERT GRAPE' MAKES A CONNECTION; IN 
"WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE" A YOUNG MAN WHOSE STRONGEST DESIRE IS "TO BE A 
GOOD PERSON" SEES NO ESCAPE FROM THE SMALL TOWN WHERE HE IS TRAPPED CARING FOR 
HIS OBESE MOTHER AND MENTALLY IMPAIRED BROTHER, UNTIL AN EQUALLY GENTLE BUT 
ECCENTRIC YOUNG WOMAN PASSES THROUGH. (RATED PG-13)

<P>
 It takes some maturity to understand, or even be interested in, the deadening 
effects of long-term sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 It also takes a little media savvy to get all this film's nuances and symbols, 
such as cars that won't start and heights that are climbed. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's not surprising that kids' appreciation for this mostly adult, 
lump-in-the-throat drama increased in direct proportion to age. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just was weird. It's not the type of movie I usually see," said 9-year-old 
Heather Peirce, who much preferred "My Girl 2." Heather, who didn't understand 
the title, gave the movie three out of five stars. 
</P>
<P>
 But 16-year-old Ian Davies gave the movie a perfect five out of five stars and 
thought the title fitting. "They have concepts in the film that make you think 
what's eating at him. I think his whole life was bothering him. He was ashamed 
about his family. The girl helped him to see who his mom was and get more 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian went with his two brothers, Carlos, 10, and Jimmy, 13. The brothers 
regularly see a variety of movies, and this one looked interesting to them -- 
although it's still playing in only a few theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The offbeat family members alone were enough to intrigue some young viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, played unsmilingly by Johnny Depp, is one of five children of a 
father who committed suicide and a mother who consequently gained 350 pounds or 
so. He works in a mom-and-pop grocery store and is the main protector of his 
18-year-old, mentally impaired brother, Arnie. Arnie is a trial, a happy boy 
who can't stop climbing the town's water tower ("Some days you want him to 
live," Gilbert says, "some days you don't.") The mother is a town joke -- kids 
dare one another to peek in the window just to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy was particularly impressed by the scene in which Gilbert's mother leaves 
her house for the first time in seven years to rescue Arnie from jail, where he 
has been placed after the latest tower-climbing incident. "The people started 
looking at her like she was really strange and stuff. I thought the person in 
the movie was really brave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing this unusual family from the inside out had a simple message for 
Carlos: "You shouldn't judge people by the way they look."

 Jimmy added: "They were just living their life. They were doing what everybody 
does with their life -- working, helping around the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather was also intrigued in the beginning, before it got too weird. "I just 
wanted to watch and see what happened to the family because I knew Gilbert had 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But her mother thought his problems were too heavy for Heather and ushered her 
out of the theater before the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thoroughly enjoyed the movie," said her mother, Bonnie, a third-grade 
teacher. "But I was uncomfortable with her in there toward the end." Rather 
than language or the few suggested scenes of adultery, Bonnie was concerned 
about the treatment of death. "I was thinking of what was going to happen and 
thought it might be a memory that wouldn't be good." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters agreed the actors were universally splendid. But they singled 
out Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Arnie convincingly. Jimmy applauded 
DiCaprio's Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he deserves it. In some parts, I thought this is really a retarded 
boy."

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; 'CLOCK REPAIRMAN TO STARS' SETS HIS OWN HOURS; 
PETER ARIES OF NEWBURY PARK, WHO RETIRED IN 1980, REMEMBERS GRAND TIMES WORKING 
FOR HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES.

 Clock repairman Peter Aries of Newbury Park has done some terrible things to 
time pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designers have often asked him to gut grandfather clocks and replace 
the mechanical innards with battery movements rather than repair the original 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was murder," he said  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than working as a henchman for foppish decorators, Aries, formerly the 
owner of a Studio City clock shop, preferred the client list of glitterati that 
gave him claim to the title "Clock Repairman to the Stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Lewis, Marlo Thomas, Andy Griffith, "all of them had beautiful clocks," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He ticks off more celebrities: "Joey Bishop has a couple of beautiful clocks. 
Broderick Crawford had a fine Frisian clock. Ted Knight had a clock that I had 
never seen before and that guy, what's his name? Always coming out and killing 
people . . . Charles Bronson. He has a huge grandfather clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Aries has been working on clocks professionally since he immigrated to the 
United States from Holland in 1957. During much of that time he operated his 
own shop before retiring in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-driving Raymond Burr once called Aries to fix a large alarm clock in 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a bell about eight inches wide. It was huge. He asked me to set it to 
ring at 4 p.m. because that's when the guys in the office are always asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Aries said that the next day the writers called and begged him to come back 
and change it. 
</P>
<P>
 At 80 years old, Aries still dabbles in clock repair, but he's given up on 
making house calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "A clockmaker can never quit, but at my age I don't want to work that hard 
again."

 Lusty bedroom dialogue is inadvertently seeping into Oxnard homes as the audio 
portion of an otherwise scrambled adult channel has been discovered sneaking 
through the television sets of 5,000 Jones Intercable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 A viewer discovered the audio portion of the Spice Channel and complained to 
Oxnard officials that minors might be able to hear the explicit language. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people in the community who feel it is urgent and we are trying to 
accommodate them," said Dennis Scala, an Oxnard official who coordinates the 
Jones Intercable contract. "But at 98 it's high enough in the channel band that 
we hope people won't come across it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has been carrying the pay-per-view channel since the beginning of the 
year. For the majority of Jones 37,000 subscribers who do have cable boxes, 
both the audio and video are scrambled unless they order it. 
</P>
<P>
 The offending audio broadcast is available to only 5,000 customers, those who 
don't have cable converter boxes, and Jones said it's impossible to scramble 
the audio for those customers. The only solution would be to put a filter on 
each of the 5,000 lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the city are trying to determine if that's required according to 
FCC law. Meanwhile, Jones used the next best solution; they've turned the 
bedroom talk down to a whisper.

PROFILE / ARTIE SHAW; HIS SOUND OF MUSIC IS AN 'ELECTRONIC ENCYCLOPEDIA'; FAMED 
BANDLEADER OF '40S, ALSO NOTED FOR A BEVY OF BEAUTIFUL WIVES, PLANS TO 
ENCOMPASS ENTIRE HISTORY OF JAZZ IN COMPUTERIZED PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Artie Shaw is writing. At his spacious, book-lined home in Newbury Park, the 
former swing giant, the quondam virtuoso clarinetist who this year celebrates 
his 40th anniversary of not playing music, is as busy as he has ever been, but 
with a marked difference. In the silence of his lonely room, he is free of the 
autograph hungry fans, far from the pressures of fame that drove him in disgust 
and disillusionment from the business that made him rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw today is primarily a writer, simultaneously involved in three 
undertakings -- first, a massive venture to be known as "The Electronic 
Encyclopedia of Recorded Jazz," completion of which he predicts will take at 
least five years; second, his supervision of the reissue of recordings on which 
he played in the late 1940s, and third, continuing work on a trilogy, "The 
Education of Albie Snow," supposedly a work of fiction, although he won't deny 
the autobiographical overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on that trilogy for 15 years on and off," he said the other 
day. "There have been interruptions: I published another book in the meanwhile, 
worked in CD reissues and went out with the orchestra to get it established." 
(Yes, there is an Artie Shaw band today, using some of his music, with Dick 
Johnson as leader and clarinetist.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's contemporaries, even fans a decade or two his junior, have vivid 
recollections of the high and low lights of the years in music: his storming of 
the swing world with the chart-topping record of "Begin the Beguine" in 1938; 
the shock of his sudden retirement in 1939; his return the following year to 
form a larger and equally successful ensemble with such hits as "Frenesi," his 
various large and small groups ending with a final small combo in 1954 and, of 
course, the marriages, which enabled Lana Turner, Ava Gardner, Doris Dowling, 
Evelyn Keyes et al, at one time or another, to call themselves Mrs. Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 This all happened long after Part I of the trilogy, which will be called 
"Sideman." It deals with the early struggling days ("I pick Albie up at age 15, 
at a lake in Wisconsin"), and his aim at fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part II," Shaw said, "will cover the period of the big successes, up to the 
end of World War II. A lot of that ground was covered in 'The Trouble With 
Cinderella.' " (This openly autobiographical book was published in 1952.) 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, he is working on Part III, which he said "deals with the 
difficulties that go with success, with my dislike of celebrity and all the 
b.s. that went with it. I became a celebrity in spite of myself, and hated it, 
so I quit and went to Spain, where I found a lifestyle that made some sense to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ending, though, will be strictly fiction, projecting a dramatic view of 
what could have been the truth. I have to try to winnow it down -- there's so 
much involved here -- it's not just music: it's books, it's science, it's sex, 
it's painting, it's a guy swallowing up the arts trying to find out what life 
is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the all-encompassing interests of Albie/Artie, his interest in jazz 
and its propagation has never flagged, as his "Electronic Encyclopedia of 
Recorded Jazz" makes clear. "It will be designed," Shaw said, "as a 
computerized, user-friendly compendium of information accessible through all 
the digital domain. There'll be histories, biographies, photographs, films, 
videos and, of course, the music itself, all available through CD-ROM or any 
other present or future access source." 
</P>
<P>
 Collaborating in the project is the jazz studies department of the University 
of Arizona. Partial funding has been provided, and various foundations are 
being approached for further support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic aim," Shaw said, "will be to answer the question 'What is jazz?' 
You can't describe jazz any more than you can describe bread to a blind man. So 
we'll have the music plus annotations and commentary by the most authoritative, 
scholarly people we can find. I'll be involved as a steerer, chairing an 
advisory board with people like John Lewis, Whitney Balliett, Lionel Hampton, 
Marian McPartland, Phil Woods, Joe Williams, Quincy Jones. Nobody who hasn't 
had a real history in jazz should be on the letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll wind up with an authoritative research foundation, with a scholarly 
committee to dig up material -- the piano rolls, the records and tapes, 
whatever. We'll have the most important people still around as speakers, and 
we'll deal with the subject by decades; for the 1920s, we can do it every five 
years, but for the later decades, we'll need to do it every one year to cover 
all the changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's original plan called simply for the use of LPs, but the new 
technologies such as CD-ROM will bring new accessibility to the plan. "We'll do 
interviews with whoever's around," he said, "and for those who are gone -- 
people like Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong -- we'll quote from their books 
and early interviews." 
</P>
<P>
 The germ of Shaw's plan has its origins in a meeting 25 years ago with a 
friend who, though not actively involved in jazz, had been asked to do a 
seminar on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was supposed to be one of a bunch of seminars on American folk art. Well, 
of course, jazz is not a folk art any more; it started with the Bessie Smiths 
and the Bunk Johnsons, but today it's very sophisticated. You have to 
understand the structure, the chords, the meter; you've go to listen quite a 
few times, to really know what's going on. But anyhow, they told him to do it 
his own way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed up on the appointed evening with a record player and a box of LPs. 
He said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, jazz is essentially a pre-verbal experience, so 
the rest of this session will be devoted to listening.' He put on one record 
after another, thanked them, said good night and left. That was the best record 
lecture I ever heard. Listen! That's all there is! By the same token, if you 
want to talk about painting -- look! Sure, you can ask some questions 
afterward, but first look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've often thought about that. We use the word jazz all over the world. The 
term is known from Texas to Timbuktu. An Alaskan, an Indian, an Eskimo comes to 
school and one guy says 'What is jazz?' Thorough listening has to come first, 
then an explanation by more knowledgeable people." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw wrote a prospectus more than two decades ago, but was unable in those 
days, when jazz still had relatively limited acceptance on the intellectual 
level, to secure adequate funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Phase I, made up of the feasibility studies and funding exploration, is all 
but complete. Phase II, said Shaw, "will include software development, forming 
a staff -- legal, technical and clerical; marketing and advertising studies and 
public relations development, from June, 1994, through December, 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 "I predict that Phase III, the actual creation and publication of the 
Electronic Encyclopedia, will run through December, 1999; Phase IV, the 
delivery and distribution, along with continual updating and correction, will 
continue into the 21st Century and through the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving a career famous for its fits and starts, marriages and 
divorces, the indomitable Shaw expects to see this vast project through to its 
conclusion. Clearly, it doesn't bother him that on the planned delivery date of 
the encyclopedia, he will be halfway through his 90th year.

JAUNTS; WILDFLOWERS BURST INTO BLOOM FOR FESTIVAL; IT'S ONE OF SANTA BARBARA'S 
MOST COLORFUL EVENTS AND A WONDERFUL CHANCE TO PICK UP SOME HOME-GARDENING 
HINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't have to go far to see a wildflower these days. It's the season of 
the brilliant orange California poppy and a flurry of other colorful 
wildflowers now in bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a real dose of Eschscholzia californica , the high-brow name for 
the poppies, and some of the other wild bloomers, come to the Wildflower 
Festival at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 During the festival, which runs from 10 a.m to 4 p.m., you can see the 
wildflowers in bloom in the 65-acre garden nestled in Mission Canyon above the 
city. Docents will be giving tours, identifying the flowers along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're in a planting mood, the garden will have plants and flowers on sale 
-- including many hard-to-find drought-tolerant native California varieties, 
all grown by a volunteer group called the Garden Growers. 
</P>
<P>
 But if your thumb is less than green, gardening experts will be on hand to 
give advice. (For instance, they might advise that the best time to plant 
wildflowers is in the fall, just before the so-called rainy season, but some 
varieties will thrive with a spring planting.) And, if you have an ailing plant 
or a mystery plant you would like identified, just bring it in and let them 
have a look. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a number of booths set up, including one on how to cook with 
wildflowers. The Men's Garden Club will have a display, along with seed and 
landscape companies, and nurseries. You might pick up some tips on flower 
arranging. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids will have a few things to do during the festival. They can play detective 
and go on a nature treasure hunt in the garden. They can chat with a couple of 
roving talking trees -- people dressed as trees who sing and chat with kids 
about the garden. At an activity table, they can use a microscope to examine 
how the monarch butterfly interacts with the milkweed plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Slide shows on wildflowers will run at scheduled times. And a bluegrass band 
will be playing outside. Plant books will be on sale and a silent auction also 
will be held to benefit the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the festival's second year, some 1,200 to 1,300 people attended and 
this year more are expected, according to Kristin Frascella, the botanic 
garden's public relations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the garden has scant parking, visitors to the festival will be asked 
to take a shuttle bus from the Museum of Natural History, just above the Santa 
Barbara Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is a chance for you to see the rest of the botanic garden, which 
features more than 1,000 kinds of plants and trees native to California. It is 
crisscrossed with five miles of trails that ramble through meadows and canyons 
and along ridge tops where you can scan the Channel Islands. Founded in 1926, 
the grounds also include a historic dam built in 1806 and 1807. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago the botanic garden added a home demonstration garden to give 
visitors a practical guide for their own gardening projects. The model was 
designed with the average home in mind. The idea was to conserve water and use 
plants native to California that require low maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The model was also planned with flowers that bloom at different times of the 
year so that the garden has color at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's a common misconception that wildflowers bloom only in the 
spring, according to Carol Bornstein, director of horticulture at the botanic 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest displays are in spring and early summer," she said. But something 
is blooming all the time. Details 
</P>

FOR THE KIDS; TURNING THE FLUFF INTO A RIGOROUS, DEMANDING SPORT; AS 
CHEERLEADING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE, MORE CLASSES OFFER DANCE, 
TUMBLING AND ADVANCED STUNT SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If your kid is hot to try out for the school cheerleading squad, she (or he) 
might want to brush up on back handsprings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheerleading today is more than pompoms, nice dance moves and hearty vocal 
chords. The sis-boom-bah days are over. Cheerleading is a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Jody Dilgard, owner of the Cheerleader Athletic Training Center in 
Simi Valley, or Janice Kratz, adviser to Simi Valley High School's top-notch 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilgard calls it the "secret sport," because many people don't realize 
cheerleading has evolved into rigorous physical activity where some teams do 
tumbling and tricky stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kratz's 16-member all-girl team competed last weekend at United Spirit Assn.'s 
national competition in Anaheim. They placed eighth out of 24 competitors in 
their division. 
</P>
<P>
 "These girls are great athletes," Kratz said. All of them do back handsprings 
and some even do flips, a complete somersault in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 How did they learn all this? Some were cheerleaders in junior high school, 
Kratz said. Some had gymnastic or dance training. And some simply picked it up 
in high school, honing it through daily workouts that continue through the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, cheerleading classes are opening up for even younger kids. Several 
local park and recreation departments offer classes for children 6 years and 
older. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilgard, who opened her center last June, takes children as young as 6. She 
teaches several levels of cheerleading, which include cheer motions, tumbling, 
dance and the more advanced stunts, pyramid building and spotting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, she put a class of four girls, ages 9 to 11, through their paces, 
beginning with warm-up exercises. They stretched, then cranked out push-ups, 
splits and laps around California Sun Gymnastics, where she operates her 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 They practiced cheers that included splits in the air, back handsprings and 
something called a basket toss, in which one of the girls is thrown into the 
air and caught. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lauren Quick, 11, of Thousand Oaks, her goal was clear: "I just really 
want to be a cheerleader in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 But JoAnn Luce, 11, of Simi Valley had something else in mind. She hopes to go 
into individual competition -- a newly developing area of competitive 
cheerleading. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a whole different cheerleading world than the one Dilgard grew up with. 
Now 49, she was a high school cheerleader in the San Francisco Bay Area. The 
four-member squad must have been pretty good because they were invited to cheer 
for the San Francisco 49ers during the 1961 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the first cheerleaders they ever had," she said. It was all dance and 
pompoms then, no stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Having studied dance from the age of 8, she went on to become a professional 
dancer, performing in television and movies. She also taught dance and 
aerobics. After marriage and two children, cheerleading became a distant memory 
until her daughter, now 24, got into it nearly 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw how much cheerleading had changed, I became involved again," she 
said. She upgraded her skills by going to cheerleading camps, learning safety 
techniques, including how to spot during stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has coached several award-winning youth, high school and 
college squads, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has taken squads to national competitions, but has backed off some from 
the pressure-filled world of competitive cheering, concentrating more on seeing 
that the kids have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the kids want to go to competitions," she said. "I tell them, 'When 
you're ready I'll find something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High School's squad was ready for the national competition in 
Anaheim last weekend, but that, in itself, was quite a feat. Because the Jan. 
17 earthquake badly damaged the school, students were temporarily relocated to 
Royal High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost our gym -- we had no place to practice," Kratz said. But they found a 
church with a high ceiling. Nonetheless, practice dropped from two or three 
hours each day, except Sunday, to about 90 minutes three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other public schools, team members have had to raise the money necessary 
for the group to perform. To cut costs, Kratz doesn't have them buy new 
uniforms each year. And they don't go to cheerleading summer camp every year. 
They attend about every three years so that the cheerleaders get one 
opportunity to go while they're in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that, the squad is one of the top teams in Ventura County. Two 
years ago the girls placed third in the all-girl large squad varsity division 
at the national competition. Last year, they took fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the lack of boys on the team? Is cheerleading a girl thing? Not at 
some other schools. "We would love to have boys," Kratz said. 
</P>
<P>

holding its "Eggstravaganza" on Saturday at the Conejo Creek play fields,

 Consider, for a moment, your quality of life. Has the zest drained away? Do 
you blank out in front of the closet each morning, wishing that there were 
something -- anything -- that could bring back the passion you once knew? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you shudder before racks of limp linen and wimpy wool? Of hopelessly 
mundane paisley and plaid? 
</P>
<P>
 And, once you've finally dressed, just what is your impact on the world? Over 
breakfast, does your spouse even look up from her Wall Street Journal to notice 
whether you are alive? 
</P>
<P>
 On your commute, do the eyes of other drivers take in your outfit, then glaze 
over? Do waiters focus on the air above your head? 
</P>
<P>
 When trapped in a cycle of rejection and hopelessness, many people turn to 
psychotherapy. But the real solution may be as close as the neighborhood mall. 
If you want respect, you've got to dress tough. Take a lesson from some of our 
assertive film idols: John Wayne, Marlon Brando, James Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 What did these stalwarts have in common? It's simple. They all wore leather -- 
and you can too. 
</P>
<P>
 Leather says it all. It's got the look of power, the feel of the frontier, the 
attitude of grit. Wearing it is one of the few ways left to swashbuckle in the 
20th Century. And, it's still largely politically correct -- an authentic food 
byproduct that you can wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it's versatile. If you think that leather clothing is limited to the 
basic vest and bomber jacket, you've been steered wrong. Outside of underwear, 
you can build an entire wardrobe of leather. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, there may not be a two-piece suit; but you can get a black leather blazer 
and slacks, put them together with a brushed suede shirt, and set off the look 
with a slim lambskin tie. 
</P>
<P>
 A single garment can transform your whole demeanor. Make it a cowboy duster -- 
a long, black, nostalgic piece of Americana that real cowpokes still wear, 
according to Lynn Clark, manager of Wilson's Suede & Leather in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusters have been big for several years, and fringe jackets are making a 
comeback, especially in men's styles, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some styles are even made for milder climates, such as the classic bomber 
jacket with a zip-out lining. 
</P>
<P>
 "At our corporate offices in Minnesota," Clark said, "they call it 'California 
cool.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For another level of cool, we recommend checking a location off the beaten 
track. We found it in an industrial park -- Harley-Davidson of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no mall rock playing in the showroom, just the roar of engines revving 
outside the door. And no carpet on the concrete floor. It gets you in the mood 
for the no-nonsense styles that cyclists wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the wide-brimmed border hats -- which don't really seem to go with 
the bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, how about a leather bandanna to set you apart on the golf course, say? Or 
a black touring cap with a chain on the front, teamed with a rivet-encrusted 
vest -- perfect for a vacation cruise. Some of the rivet designs spell out "H 
D," but that might be mistaken for a college logo, as in Harvard Divinity 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 And the bandannas are only $29, complete with rivets and embossed logo. So, 
don't let cost stop you from flaunting the look. 
</P>
<P>
 While in the Harley-Davidson store, think about a new look for work. A nice 
new suit in any decent fabric is going to cost some real bucks, so why not get 
a durable leather ensemble instead, one that will change your life? 
</P>
<P>
 We recommend teaming the Brando-style epaulet jacket with full chaps and 
engineer boots complete with double chains. 
</P>
<P>
 And the convertible trousers have a lot of flair. With these, you can lounge 
at your desk in walking shorts with what look like vulcanized cuffs. Then, when 
a client calls, you quickly roll down the cuffs and zip on leg extensions for a 
more formal look. 
</P>
<P>
 In casual wear, our personal favorite is the USA Vest. (Most of the fashions 
have names, many with a Western theme.) It features a stone-washed denim front 
and natural distressed leather back showing a massive tooled Harley-Davidson 
eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 The total look includes a black biker jacket worn under the vest -- but we can 
picture it over anything. Pajamas, say, if your spouse keeps reading the Wall 
Street Journal late into the evening hours. This should pull her away from its 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 It should make waiters jump, too -- and at a fraction of the cost of 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, to transform your life: Get leather. Who says you can't buy respect?

EARTHWATCH: RIDING INFO HIGHWAY TOWARD CLEARER SKIES; TELECOMMUTING SERVICES 
GIVE EMPLOYEES A NEW WAY TO HOOK UP TO WORK -- CUTTING DOWN ON TRAFFIC AND 
SMOG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Tired of freeway congestion, airport crowding and air pollution? Try Kinko's. 
Say what? The copy shop chain? Are they installing Metrolink or Amtrak stops 
there, you ask? Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 But what they have might work even better, if you like the idea of using a 
picture-telephone to eliminate the effort and environmental cost of physically 
traveling to Ontario, Calif., or Ontario, Canada, to interview for that new 
job, make that court deposition or attend that family reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura-based national retail chain has put a special type of video hookup 
in its East Main Street flagship location -- as well as in a dozen other sites, 
aiming for 100 around the country. I tested the equipment the other day -- in 
an effort to avoid using the freeway, and, of course, avoid ruining my nerves 
and my lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's isn't the only firm offering such a service, by the way. Simi Valley 
Neighborhood Telecommute Center, Management Recruiters International, GTE in 
the West County and Pacific Bell in the East County are some of the places 
countywide offering telecommuting services. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to the newest directory of the International Teleconferencing 
Assn., which will be distributed this summer, there are 4,000 places where 
someone can, with a bit of advanced notice, go to receive a video call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you've tried it you don't want to go back to the old way," says Jack 
Nilles, who coined the phrase telecommuting back in the '70s. The "old way" is 
vehicular travel -- and pollution, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilles, a communications consultant, talked about the various systems that 
businesses and government are using to eliminate employee commuting and 
executive travel, including PictureTel, (the leading hardware maker), Kinko's 
hookup with Sprint and Intel's new rig that plays through home computers. AT&T 
even has a voice phone with a tiny screen which is being sold locally at Good 
Guys. It is designed mostly for family calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, the county Board of Supervisors is looking into various technologies 
to help solve county employee commuting problems. To meet strict air quality 
standards, the county has to get more employees to car-pool, shut down offices 
on more days or get commuters to drive less-polluting cars. According to air 
quality experts, every two days of telecommuting remove one automobile's worth 
of smog from our skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Randolph Ramirez, human resources information manager for the county, is 
studying a report Nilles prepared for the city of Los Angeles. It indicates 
that through electronic commuting, employers such as our county government can 
achieve their mandated smog-reduction goals without having to resort to 
less-pleasant travel restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilles has a prediction for "information workers," a group constituting about 
one-third of the work force: It's only a matter of years before they will be 
equipped with a home version of the Intel desktop video rig or a version of the 
PictureTel gizmo that Kinko's uses. 
</P>
<P>
 One Arizona county is telling employers to get workers telecommuting, at least 
by using voice and data hookups, by the end of this year. Fortunately, prices, 
even for video rigs, are falling 30% a year, easing the burden. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, I'm studying the Kinko's video handbook on "Face-to-Face 
Meetings From Across the Country." Of special interest is the section entitled 
"What to Wear." Oh, what we have to do just to clean up the smog. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Several local facilities provide face-to-face video hookups for job 
interviews, telecommuting, family reunions, legal depositions, etc. Call 
Kinko's at 339-2000, Simi Valley Neighborhood Telecommute Center, 526-3900, 
Management Recruiters International, 495-5544, GTE in West County (800) 
483-3350, Pacific Bell in East County (800) 738-1980. 
</P>
<P>
 * ALSO: For a directory of about 4,000 sites that offer video calling, 
published by the International Teleconferencing Assn., call (800) 426-8686. For 
an additional site list, primarily for business users, call Affinity VideoNet 
Inc. (508) 768-7480. Charges vary widely, but average about $100 to $200 for 
one hour of service.

SHOPTALK; SZECHUAN-STYLE DUCK SAUCE IS HOT AND SPICY -- AND IT'S KOSHER; 
PASSOVER FARE CAN GO BEYOND BASICS, BUT FOR THOSE WHO MUST HAVE THEIR GEFILTE 
FISH, THERE'S A RED-TAG SPECIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, so gefilte fish is an acquired taste, and a red-tag sale on the item 
doesn't cause most Ventura County residents to cartwheel down the ethnic food 
aisle at the local market. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth of the matter is that the Jewish holiday of Passover begins at 
sundown Saturday, and the fishy, jellied food is a Passover staple. Which 
doesn't mean that every devout Jew has to eat the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because most major grocery stores have rummaged through the basements and 
pulled out the old Passover displays doesn't mean that you have to eat the same 
old Passover food. There is always some new culinary item to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Hughes market in Camarillo, where we found, fairly well-hidden among the 
matzos and the macaroons, some jars of Gold's Szechuan-Style Duck Sauce (hot 
and spicy and kosher for Passover). A 40-ounce container was $3.29. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in addition to visiting Hughes, we strolled the aisles of the 
Ralphs grocery store in Oxnard and Vons in Ojai to get an idea of the selection 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
 As it typically does, Hughes had by far the largest selection of 
kosher-for-Passover items. It had, for example, Elite instant coffee (7 ounces 
for $3.99), Rokeach Italian salad dressing (8 ounces for $2.19), Osem instant 
pudding mix (2 7/8 ounces for 79 cents) and instant mashed potatoes (5 3/4 
ounces for $2.29), which the other stores didn't offer. 
</P>
<P>
 And on staple items that all three stores had on their shelves -- such as 
Passover matzos and gefilte fish -- Hughes generally had the largest variety of 
brands from which to chose. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about price, you ask? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with matzo. (Keep in mind, this is Passover matzo, not the usual 
everyday kind; for an explanation of the difference, consult your local rabbi.) 
All three stores seemed to be pushing the 5-pound packages. At Hughes, the 
Manischewitz 5-pounder was $8.89 (limit one per customer); at Vons, it was 
$9.99 and at Ralphs $11.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Single boxes of Manischewitz matzos were $2.19 at Hughes and Vons. Ralphs was 
selling Streit's matzos for $2.99 a box and non-Passover matzos for $2.29. 
Hughes, by the way, had five brands of matzo, of varying price. What's the 
difference between one brand of unleavened wheat and flour and another brand of 
unleavened wheat and flour? You decide. 
</P>
<P>
 On to gefilte fish. A 24-ounce jar of Manischewitz fish was priced at $3.99 at 
all three stores. At Hughes, where there was, indeed, a red-tag sale on many of 
the gefilte fish items, there were several brands available. Mrs. Adler's (24 
ounces) was $2.49, Rokeach (24 ounces) was $4.19 and Mother's (10 ounces, low 
sodium) was $2.79. 
</P>
<P>
 All three stores were well-stocked in Passover borscht (beet soup). 
Manischewitz's 32-ounce jars (regular and low-cal) were going for $2.29 at 
Ralphs, $1.89 at Vons and $2.19 at Hughes. Hughes also had Mrs. Adler's for 
$1.59 and Rokeach for $1.89. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, we had to throw in a price comparison on chicken fat, used as a 
spread and for cooking. And you thought that gefilte fish raised a few 
eyebrows? 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ralphs and Hughes were selling 7 1/2-ounce jars of Good Old Days brand 
rendered chicken fat: $3.79 at Ralphs, $3.89 at Hughes. Hughes also had Carmel 
Kosher brand "Imitation Chicken Flavored Fat" at 10 ounces for $2.99. The label 
touts the product as having no salt or cholesterol. (And only 110 calories and 
12 grams of fat per tablespoon.) 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, we'll take a look at Easter products.

 Drawings, photos, models and furniture created by six influential architects 
are on display in the exhibit "The Draw of Eden: European Architects in Los 
Angeles" at UC Santa Barbara's University Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 J. R. Davidson, Paul Laszlo, Richard J. Neutra, Jock Peters, R. M. Schindler 
and Kem Weber all emigrated from central Europe to Los Angeles during the 1920 
and '30s and made their mark on American architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler and Davidson were integral figures in modernist home design; Weber 
was a leader in introducing Art Deco to this country; Peters became known for 
his commercial design, including the interior of the Bullocks Wilshire 
department store; Laszlo designed modernist homes, restaurants and stores, and 
worked for the motion picture industry, and Neutra earned a reputation for his 
"International Style" modernism. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on display is work by contemporary architect Michael Graves, who designed 
UCSB's 27,000-square-foot Institute for Theoretical Physics. He also designed 
the Clos Pegase Winery in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays and 1 to 5 
p.m. Sundays. Admission is free.

MUSIC; BAND CRANKS UP THE VOLUME WITH HARD-ON-THE-EARS ROCK; THE SANTA BARBARA 
FOURSOME PRIMAL TRIBE PLAYS IT LOUD, AND THE KIDS GO NUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "If it's too loud, you're too old" reads a ubiquitous bumper sticker. It could 
also be the band anthem of Primal Tribe, which will bring its brand of very 
loud hard rock to the Beach Shack in Santa Barbara tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Primal Tribe is made up of four longhairs from northern Santa Barbara County. 
Benedict Ofstead sings real loud. Bobby McGee plays guitar real loud. Mark 
Thompson hits the drums real hard. Rob Cantrell thumps his bass real hard. 
Occasionally there's enough long hair flying around to create the illusion of a 
syncopated hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
 Local radio generally ignores local bands, but not so KTYD in Santa Barbara, 
which actually plays local bands, including Primal Tribe, Munkafust and 
Woodburning Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our songs, 'Beautiful,' is on regular rotation," said Cantrell. "We're 
in there just like the Spin Doctors. They play it five or six times a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Primal Tribe was able to make its own CD, the band appeared on one of 
two compilation CDs featuring Santa Barbara bands that came out in late 1992. 
Both efforts emerged with much hoopla but sank like a "Yanni Does Megadeth" 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know our fans held off (from buying the CD)," said Cantrell. "Instead of 
getting one Primal Tribe song, they waited for our CD, and got eight songs. We 
met this young married couple who wanted to make an investment, and they 
invested in us. We ended up with 1,000 CDs and 1,000 tapes in December. We've 
already sold three-quarters of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiefly to blame for the band is Cantrell and Ofstead, who have been jamming 
together for about a decade, surviving a number of short-lived groups in the 
otherwise serene Santa Ynez Valley. McGee joined about two years ago, and 
Thompson derailed the revolving drummer policy about 1 1/2 years ago to form 
the current lineup. They play relentlessly throughout Santa Barbara County, and 
have built a large following. 
</P>
<P>
 That, and about $2.50, might get them a double cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, there was a huge Santa Barbara scene," said the bass player. 
"It's a lot different now. The Safari doesn't have live bands anymore except 
for a reggae band on Tuesdays. Zelo closed down. The Brewhouse closed down. The 
Anaconda Theater in Isla Vista closed down. Buster's in Goleta is no longer an 
all-ages place, and we have a huge under-age following. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of that is word of mouth, but we've played at a lot of local high 
schools, plus we've played a lot at the Lompoc Theatre, where we've drawn 300 
kids. We've played all over, but we consider Isla Vista to be home." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Isla Vista, where students major in Party 101, the band has 
also had its brushes with famous rock stars, most recently at the Santa Barbara 
County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played at the Santa Barbara County Fair with Robby Krieger (guitarist who 
played with the Doors)," Cantrell said. "It was great. There were 500 kids 
going nuts. We ended up signing autographs and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred kids going nuts plus 500 kids going nuts adds up to enough 
potential trouble to put the entire Central Coast on probation, or simply 
attests to the continued popularity of hard rock. Much to the chagrin of 
parents everywhere, hard rock isn't going away according to Cantrell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard rock is always going to be the basis of all popular music," said 
Cantrell, who evidently never heard of the blues. "Look who's lasted the 
longest -- Led Zeppelin, the heaviest band ever. We play hard-core groove 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, no one need waste their best years waiting for Sting and 
Freddy Mercury comparisons; Ofstead has a deep growl not unlike Eddie Vedder, 
that rich guy in Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are too quick to judge a band," said Thompson. "People may hear 
'Beautiful' and think it sounds just like Pearl Jam. Maybe it's Ben's voice; 
it's deep, but it's just a coincidence. That was an original song, and if it 
had come out earlier, people would be saying that Pearl Jam sounds like us."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A TREASURE OF CHINESE CUISINE; MANDARIN WOK IN THOUSAND OAKS 
TAKES DINERS ON A SWEEPING CULINARY TOUR OF CHINA'S PROVINCES. THE LAVISH 
INTERIOR IS FRIENDLY TO FAMILIES. 
</P>

<P>
 The outside facade of the Mandarin Wok, at the far end of the Janss Mall in 
Thousand Oaks, is austere, almost fortress-like. Bright red, over-sized letters 
blaze the name of the restaurant, as if announcing the way to a nether world. 
But up close, is a beautiful doorway, evocative of ancient China, and through 
it one steps into a truly lovely environment. 
</P>
<P>
 A generous reception area, filled with splendid, carved furniture, exquisite 
Oriental mirrors and ceramic vases, is flanked on one side by the dining room 
and, on the other, by a full bar, with rosy lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The eating area resembles an elegant ship's dining room -- a sea of tables 
covered with snowy linens in a spacious room. The walls are of silvery brocade 
interspersed with deep red panels, decorated with beautiful Oriental prints and 
a stunning bas-relief of wild bronze horses. 
</P>
<P>
 The place feels rich. But despite the elegant formality and stately service, 
it accommodates families effortlessly. The acoustics are so good, the crying of 
a newborn baby on its very first outing sounded soft and appealing rather than 
strident, as if the noise had simply been absorbed into the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Mandarin refers to either a ranking government official or the 
standard language of China, a country of many different dialects. At the 
Mandarin Wok, the menu reflects a sweeping tour of Chinese provinces: Peking 
duck from the North, Hunan lamb from the central region, Szechwan dishes from 
the West, entrees cooked in soy sauce (called "red cooking") from the East and 
the marvelous cooked vegetables typical of Cantonese cooking in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 We had to try the "Beverly Hills cup" ($2.50 per person), so named, we were 
told, from a dish served in the Beverly Hills restaurant owned by the same 
owners. This consisted of a curiously appetizing mound of warm ingredients -- 
chicken, scallions, water chestnuts -- so finely chopped they were this side of 
soft, served on a lettuce leaf with plum sauce on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizzling rice soup was mild and savory. Although the rice was too crunchy, the 
shrimp was succulent and the snow peas, fresh and crisp. Hot and sour soup was 
far blander than it should have been and tasted somewhat like tomato soup with 
Chinese ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Another dish that caught our eye was "Napa cabbage with black bushrooms" 
($6.55) -- such a wonderful word. Of course, the bushrooms turned out to be 
mushrooms, but the dish was superb. The cabbage was quite wonderful. This and 
another dish of young spring peas still in the pod, served in a subtly sweet, 
subtly spicy sauce, along with carrots and chicken, were well worth the trip to 
the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunan lamb, a special one night, was OK, but disappointingly mild, its faint 
spiciness merely hinting at possible glory. Far more interesting was lobster in 
Szechwan sauce ($15.95), with big chunks of lobster, mushrooms and water 
chestnuts in a sauce that sang a medley of flavors -- sweet, spicy, tangy and 
garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 A house specialty, orange peel chicken ($9.55), consisted of slightly sweet 
fried chicken chunks, with delightful snippets of candied orange peel and a 
fiery kick that nicely cut the sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
 Beef with asparagus was mostly beef, of a good quality and well-cooked, though 
I would have like more of the crisp asparagus slivers. An appealing dish of 
sauteed green beans with ginger ($6.55) had been stir-fried to softness. It 
relied more on the beans than the ginger, which was faint to nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of tastes and flavors here were not as extravagant as Chinese food 
can get. But the ingredients were fine and fresh and the atmosphere charming. I 
noticed the place was quite popular -- and quick -- for takeout. One night I 
brought home a big dinner for the kids. It held up well in the uncompromising 
light and Spartan decor of our kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, all that was left were the fortunes from the fortune cookies, 
lying on the table like autumn leaves. The fortunes had a decidedly 
philosophical bent. Mine read: "If all our wishes were gratified, many of our 
dreams would be destroyed." An odd note to follow such a gratifying meal.

<P>
 Luis Donaldo Colosio, widely expected to be Mexico's next president, was 
assassinated Wednesday in this border city -- a killing that stunned the nation 
and cast a cloud over the future of its scheduled August national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, 44, was pronounced dead of gunshot wounds shortly after 8 p.m., said 
Lievano Sainz, spokesman for the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
known as the PRI, which had chosen Colosio as its presidential candidate in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is with great grief that I announce that, despite the efforts of doctors, 
Luis Donaldo Colosio . . . has died," Sainz told a somber crowd of journalists 
and onlookers gathered in the smoke-filled lobby of Tijuana's General Hospital, 
where Colosio had undergone emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Cries of disbelief emerged from the disconsolate crowd, guarded by 
black-uniformed Tijuana police and plainclothes state and federal police. 
"Murder!" and "Assassin!" shouted some of those who jammed the lobby and steps 
of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio was shot twice -- once in the head and once in the abdomen -- shortly 
after 5 p.m. in a Tijuana neighborhood not far from the city airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A suspect, identified by authorities as Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, was in the 
custody of Federal Judicial Police. He reportedly told police who interrogated 
him, "I saved Mexico!" 
</P>
<P>
 Also detained was Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, 47. Authorities initially were 
unclear whether he was a witness or a suspect. But they said late Wednesday 
that he was a former head of the homicide division of the Baja California State 
Judicial Police in Tijuana and was being held as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials offered no immediate word about the motive for the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's death shocked this nation, which prides itself on its political 
stability, and disrupted preparations for the Aug. 21 national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no ruling party presidential candidate has died since the PRI was 
founded more than six decades ago, it was unclear how a successor will be 
named. But the process probably will involve the party hierarchy and federal 
elections officials, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue, however, seemed a distant concern Wednesday evening, when an air 
of national mourning seemed to grip Mexicans, who stayed glued to their 
television sets and radios awaiting word on Colosio's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 He was shot after an hourlong campaign appearance in the poor neighborhood of 
Lomas Taurinas, a gritty community of unpaved roads and makeshift housing 
northeast of downtown. Wednesday was the first of a scheduled two-day campaign 
appearance in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, dressed casually in a brown Windbreaker and open-neck blue sport 
shirt, spoke for about an hour. As he had in recent appearances, he stressed 
the importance of development in poor neighborhoods. "We are going to bring the 
power of the citizenry to the presidency of Mexico," Colosio told residents. 
</P>
<P>
 During his address, Colosio made a point of predicting victory for the ruling 
party in the state of Baja California, which is controlled by the rival 
National Action Party. "Viva Baja!" Colosio said at the end of his address. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon completing the speech, witnesses said, Colosio walked down a sloping dirt 
road, shaking hands with residents, as he headed back to his motorcade. He was 
shot at 5:08 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking down when I heard a shot," said Maria Vidal, a supporter who 
was walking with Colosio at the scene. "I looked up and saw the gun right in 
front of me. Then I saw him fall to the ground. Blood was coming out of his 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, what one witness called an "avalanche of humanity" 
descended on the confusing scene. Loud music blared as the candidate walked 
down the road, so many were initially unaware that Colosio had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the furious Tijuana crowd then surged around at least one of Colosio's 
apparent assailants, beating him savagely. Television broadcasts from the 
chaotic scene showed the suspect as a muscular man in his 20s. He appeared 
bloody and disheveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Colosio, critically wounded, was put into a Ram Charger truck and 
rushed away. He was later transferred to an ambulance and taken to Tijuana's 
General Hospital, where hundreds of people gathered. Some offered to donate the 
rare blood type that Colosio was said to need. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians at one point hoped to transport Colosio to nearby UC San Diego 
Medical Center, which could offer state-of-the-art trauma care. A helicopter 
was even dispatched for him around 7:30 p.m., but he was judged to be in too 
delicate a condition to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Rosalinda Guerra Moya, the Tijuana hospital's director, said a team of 
eight physicians sought to save Colosio. Among those attending him was Dr. 
Patricia Aubanel, who runs a clinic in Tijuana and practices at the prestigious 
Scripps Clinic in San Diego. Aubanel was the primary physician for Mother 
Teresa of Calcutta when the 83-year-old Roman Catholic missionary and Nobel 
Prize winner was treated in San Diego for a heart ailment and pneumonia in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But physicians said later that Colosio's head wound had been too severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Mexico, there were denunciations of Colosio's murder. Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari -- who ordered the attorney general to go 
to Tijuana to investigate the killing -- called Colosio's assassination "a vile 
act . . . that hurts us deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Cristobal de las Casas in the southern state of Chiapas, Manuel Camacho 
Solis, the government's peace negotiator and a longtime political rival of 
Colosio's, called the killing a "grave offense to his family and a great, grave 
offense to all Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 As angry Mexicans gathered at the police station where the suspect was said to 
be held, others at the hospital complained about the poor security at Colosio's 
campaign stop. By contrast, some said that security was much tighter during a 
recent visit to Tijuana by Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate 
of the National Action Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the deranged act of a fanatic," said Lourdes Felgueres, a human 
rights activist and ruling party supporter who was present at the rally. "This 
is the work of a hired killer. He knew exactly what he was doing. Justice must 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mexico, and especially its ruling party, the assassination could not have 
come at a more difficult time. The government was badly embarrassed in January 
by the Indian uprising in Chiapas that left at least 145 people dead. 
Grass-roots rebels are now considering details of a tentative peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's shooting also came one day after Camacho Solis announced that he 
would not run for president. The prospective candidacy of Camacho Solis had 
threatened to split the ruling party since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension about August's elections has been mounting steadily since the Chiapas 
uprising. The rebels have called for broad national reforms leading toward a 
truer democracy; Salinas had pledged to push for a more democratic electoral 
process. Mexican lawmakers on Wednesday were considering a broad package of 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a State Department spokesman expressed shock, horror and sorrow 
over Colosio's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio was an amiable politician whose open manner contrasted with the stiff 
persona of many Mexican lawmakers. But Colosio had been controversial since he 
was named as the party's candidate Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas, exercising a traditional prerogative of Mexican presidents, 
personally chose Colosio -- a native of the border state of Sonora and a 
longtime protege -- as his likely successor, passing over Camacho Solis and 
other rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics complained that Colosio adhered too closely to Salinas' view on 
free trade and other neo-liberal economic policies of the PRI. Since the 
Chiapas rebellion, he had been distancing himself from Salinas' economic plans, 
stressing the need to help the great numbers of poverty-stricken Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the PRI, which has been synonymous with government here since its 
founding in 1929, Colosio was considerably more popular. Party stalwarts 
favored him for the presidency, confident that he would do nothing to erode the 
PRI's longtime dominance. He was also much favored by this nation's business 
community and international investors who, via the Mexican markets, expressed 
deep displeasure at the mere prospect that Camacho Solis might challenge 
Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being named PRI presidential candidate, Colosio headed Mexico's vast 
Social Development secretariat, which included a multibillion-dollar 
anti-poverty initiative called Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Chiapas rebellion, many criticized Solidarity as a program 
that did little to resolve the pressing problems of rural and urban poverty 
that still characterize Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio also served as a PRI senator and chairman of the national party. An 
economist, he was a native of Magdalena de Kino, near the Arizona border, and 
did postgraduate work at the University of Pennsylvania and in Austria. His 
survivors include his wife, Diana Laura Riojas, an economist, and two children, 
Luis Donaldo, 7, and Mariana, 10.

NEWS ANALYSIS; DEATH WILL TEST THE STABILITY OF POLITICAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This nation's much-vaunted political stability will be sorely tested by 
Wednesday's assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's 
presidential candidate and the man who was widely expected to assume the next 
six-year term as Mexico's leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials had expected 1994 to be hailed as their country's entry into 
the First World as a full partner with the United States and Canada in the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. Instead, the nation has been racked by 
violence, with Colosio's killing coming on the heels of the much-publicized 
kidnaping of a prominent banker and a peasant uprising that left at least 145 
people dead. 
</P>
<P>
 As an indicator of just how anxious people were here Wednesday night, usually 
talkative analysts were tight-lipped. 
</P>
<P>
 They were utterly unwilling to speculate on how the Tijuana assassination 
might affect this country's political and economic future. It was anathema to 
commentators to even discuss the future of Colosio's political rival, peace 
envoy Manuel Camacho Solis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his campaign had been eclipsed by the rebellion in the southern state 
of Chiapas, Colosio had still represented stability and continuity. That 
stability was an important selling point for NAFTA as it was debated in the 
U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio was the handpicked successor of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari. His political ascension, as the presidential candidate of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party -- or PRI, as it is known -- occurred as part 
of a party rite, an archaic national tradition that rescued Mexico from the 
chaos of civil war and political murders 65 years ago when the party was 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
 The stability that such presidential successions ensured has been the 
justification for the survival of the PRI amid a growing clamor here for 
democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how a successor to Colosio will be designated. PRI rules allow 
the National Executive Committee to call a party convention or anoint a 
substitute candidate, but no candidate has died campaigning since the PRI was 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Mexican Congress debates reforms aimed at ensuring clean elections and 
widely seen as a response to the rebels' demands for democracy, Colosio's death 
is sure to provoke questions about the nation's stability for the first time in 
six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the assassination came just a day after Camacho Solis said he 
would not launch a maverick presidential bid, quelling rumors that had kept 
politicians and financial markets unsettled for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho Solis, the popular former Mexico City mayor, had been openly 
disappointed when his friend Salinas passed over him in favor of Colosio. His 
career, however, was revived in mid-January when Salinas sent him to negotiate 
peace with the Indian rebels who took control of several southern towns in a 
New Year's Day uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Byzantine world of Mexican politics, it was even speculated that 
Salinas was intentionally promoting Camacho Solis to keep Colosio under control 
and retain power far longer than a lame-duck president generally does in his 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the assumption that there was such a rivalry caused financial jitters in a 
country that depends on foreign investment in the stock market to offset its 
multibillion-dollar trade deficit and to finance investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerns were compounded when Alfredo Harp Helu, chairman of Mexico's 
largest financial group, was kidnaped earlier this month. He has not yet been 
released. This week's edition of the political magazine Proceso termed that 
crime "another blow to the administration." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before an assassin's bullets dealt Salinas the hardest blow a 
Mexican president and his party have suffered in decades.

GATES HAS GRAND PLANS FOR MICROSOFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER and AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have a personal computer, chances are that Bill Gates and Microsoft 
Corp. are already a part of your life. But the 38-year-old billionaire and the 
company he runs want a bigger part -- a much bigger part. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates and Microsoft are not content simply to provide programs to run on your 
PC. They want to send you movies and TV shows. They want to help educate your 
children. They want to be your catalogue retailer. They want to be your global 
telephone supplier. They even want to help you out with your rotisserie 
baseball league. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, in fact, appears to be engaged in a hugely ambitious quest to become 
the preeminent force in a broad range of new technologies, a kind of John D. 
Rockefeller of the information age. His company is cutting deals left and 
right. In the last week alone, Gates has orchestrated two major alliances. On 
Wednesday, Microsoft announced a venture with Japan's Nippon Telegraph & 
Telephone, the world's second-largest telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Monday, Gates and cellular telephone titan Craig McCaw unveiled a 
grandiose project that they hope will lead to a $9-billion worldwide satellite 
telephone system. 
</P>
<P>
 These grand plans carry plenty of risks. There are lots of examples of 
world-beating companies -- notably IBM and General Motors -- stumbling when 
they stray from their core business. And though Microsoft's position in the 
personal computer software business appears unassailable, growth in that 
business is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, there are many in the technology world and elsewhere who 
would like nothing more than to see Gates -- whose $7 billion in personal 
wealth ranks him as the second-richest American -- fail. Competitors allege 
that Microsoft engages in a variety of anti-competitive business practices, and 
the Justice Department is considering antitrust action against the company. 
Gates and Microsoft deny any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics and supporters alike agree that in pursuing new ventures, Gates may be 
spreading his bets in hopes that he will be in the right place at the right 
time when new technologies become commercially viable. 
</P>
<P>
 "My take on this is Bill's trying to buy himself some time," said Terence J. 
Garnett, head of new media at Oracle Corp., which is hoping to beat out 
Microsoft for dominance in the computer software market. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, though, no one can doubt the scope of Gates' ambition. He is a great 
admirer of legendary capitalists like Henry Ford -- a favorite book is Alfred 
E. Sloan's "My Years at General Motors." He has already achieved a degree of 
celebrity reserved for a rare few in the business world. In the United States, 
only investor Warren Buffett has amassed greater personal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who joked wistfully that Gates' recent marriage to Microsoft 
executive Melinda French would slow down the aggressive entrepreneur. But that 
has not been the case. The Harvard University dropout who scrapped and toiled 
to build his company into a global powerhouse seems as driven as ever. Now he 
wants to conquer new territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say much of Gates' success stems from a stroke of luck -- IBM's decision 
to use Microsoft software for the original IBM PC. And though it clearly took a 
lot more than luck to build Microsoft into the giant it is today, it may be 
Gates' success or failure in navigating the murky waters of multimedia 
computing and interactive technology that determines his place in history 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Microsoft's size, strength and ambitions are generating fear 
among the growing ranks of companies that want to stake a claim to the new 
information age. Microsoft's ownership of the software that controls the basic 
functions of most personal computers has yielded enormous profits. Just as 
important, it has given Microsoft a huge advantage in producing basic business 
programs, such as spreadsheets and word processors. 
</P>
<P>
 So powerful has the company become that many of its rivals have concluded that 
they must join forces or die. That has led to a wave of mergers in recent 
months in the $7.3-billion-a-year computer software business. Combinations 
announced in the past few weeks alone include Wordperfect and Novell, Adobe and 
Aldus, and Electronic Arts and Broderbund. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idiosyncratic Gates is especially enamored of the hot new field of 
multimedia and interactive communications. Microsoft recently launched a major 
push into entertainment and educational software for the home, much of it using 
flashy CD-ROM technology. 
</P>
<P>
 That's only the beginning. Microsoft aims to provide a range of consumer 
information services for personal computer users, the first of which will 
provide reams of baseball statistics for sports fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
 An even bigger prize will be providing information and entertainment via the 
television set. Microsoft has a deal with cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. 
to develop software for new interactive cable systems, which will allow 
consumers to order movies or browse through electronic shopping malls with 
their television remote controls. 
</P>
<P>
 And to have all its bases covered, Microsoft is also moving aggressively in 
the telephone world. The company confirmed this week that it has tried to 
negotiate a broad cooperation agreement with AT&T, though the negotiations came 
to naught. 
</P>
<P>
 With Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, though, it was more successful. The two 
companies announced a plan to use NTT networks for software distribution, and 
steps to ensure that an advanced NTT facsimile service will be compatible with 
a new generation of office-equipment software called Microsoft At Work. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the announcement this week that Gates was joining with 
McCaw to build a $9-billion global satellite telephone system -- a venture that 
many in the communications business believe will never get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 These efforts have stirred both anger and admiration in the business. Many 
rivals grumble that Microsoft is deliberately sowing confusion by announcing a 
lot of alliances that won't result in products for years: Just the knowledge 
that Microsoft is pursuing a certain type of venture is often enough to scare 
competitors away. 
</P>
<P>
 But others believe that Microsoft has an important role to play in building 
the infrastructure for interactive multimedia. When it ventures into the realm 
of cable television and telephones, moreover, it is at least picking on players 
who have their own designs on information age leadership, such as AT&T, the 
regional Bell telephone companies and cable industry giant Tele-Communications 
Inc. and its very aggressive chairman, John C. Malone. And Microsoft's record 
in deal-making is hardly unblemished: An effort to establish interactive TV 
software standards through a consortium with Tele-Communications Inc. and Time 
Warner fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest challenges for companies like Wordperfect and Lotus and 
Microsoft is that the 1980s are over," said Ann Winblad, a Silicon Valley 
venture capitalist. "Bill has to adopt the mind-set of a venture capitalist. He 
has to take more risks." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft has been criticized for not taking enough risks in the past, letting 
other firms dominate in growing areas such as databases and networking. Gates 
and his company are determined not to make that mistake again.

drive-by was the woman's nephew. They get the information they need and are 
ready to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 But Norma Johnson's job is just beginning. She is a city victim assistance 
coordinator who counsels and consoles families in the anguished hours after a 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 As the slain boy's aunt falls to the floor and begins sobbing, Johnson drops 
to her knees, holds the woman and rocks her. "I've had too many deaths, Lord!" 
the aunt shouts. "Too many deaths. He's been with me since he was 3 . . . and 
now he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Johnson assisted grieving families in a more sedate setting. She 
usually met them in her office a few days after the slayings, after they had a 
chance to absorb the immediate shock. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson came to realize that the survivors' needs were not being met. As 
the toll of murder victims rose, so did the dissatisfaction among their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson kept hearing the same refrain from the families of South-Central 
murder victims. "The police just don't care." In some cases the police were 
simply rude. But she learned that in many other instances it was not 
insensitivity that created the ill will, but misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson decided that the best way to ensure that victims' families are treated 
sensitively is to arrive at the same time as the detectives. So last fall she 
became one of the first victims' advocates in the state to work with police at 
murder scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, when detectives determine that Johnson's special skills are needed, they 
beep her, often in the middle of the night. She crawls out of bed and within 
minutes is soothing wailing relatives at their homes, explaining police 
procedures to families at murder sites or waiting with grieving parents at 
police stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is a familiar figure at murder scenes in South-Central Los Angeles, a 
small woman in a pink jogging suit who scurries in the dark past the hissing 
flares and yellow crime-scene tape in search of distraught relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives say they appreciate Johnson's work because it frees them to spend 
more time interviewing witnesses and studying evidence. Victims' families are 
grateful for the measure of comfort Johnson can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norma came to us at a time of great distress," says Paulette Williams, whose 
sister-in-law was killed in December, a bystander in a gang shooting. "We were 
waiting at the murder scene, just out of it. Norma was beautiful when she 
showed up. She told us what was going on and how we could get some help. But 
the main thing was the compassion she showed us. We truly felt that she cared." 
</P>
<P>
 At the home of the nephew who has just been killed, Johnson coaxes the aunt 
onto a sofa. She listens as the woman describes how she inadvertently drove by 
the murder scene earlier that night. She smoothes the woman's hair as the aunt 
talks about how well the boy did in junior high school. She offers advice in a 
soft, soothing voice when the woman wails: "What am I going to say to his 
father?" 
</P>
<P>
 When the woman's family feels ready to take over, Johnson leaves her business 
card and heads out with detectives on their next call of the night -- the boy's 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson climbs into the back seat of the car and sighs heavily. The boy was 
not a gangbanger, she says, and he was a conscientious student. She saw his 
homework assignments, which detectives had pulled from his back pocket. All 
were painstakingly completed, the handwriting very neat. He'd received an 
"excellent" on his study skills paper and a B on an algebra assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been walking to a bus stop near 52nd Street and Vermont Avenue after 
spending the afternoon at the Boys Club. A group of gang members in a van asked 
him where he was from, the traditional gang challenge. He answered: "You don't 
know me." One of the boys in the van pulled out a pistol and shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You send your child to school, to the store, to the Boys Club . . . and they 
never come back," Johnson says, shaking her head. "It just doesn't make any 
sense." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The body of a 16-year-old is sprawled on a street corner just 100 yards from 
the apartment where he lived with his aunt and grandmother. It is cool and 
misty, about 1 a.m.; the intersection of 85th Street and Avalon Boulevard is 
dimly lit by flashing lights atop the patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the crime scene tape is the boy's family. Behind them is Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was almost home," the grandmother says, tears streaming down her face. 
"Almost home." 
</P>
<P>
 The grandmother, who tells Johnson that the boy's mother lives in Mississippi, 
wants to know why she can't see her grandson one final time. She wants to know 
why he is still on the street, hours after the shooting. Johnson places her 
hands on the woman's shoulders and tells her that the police must preserve the 
crime scene; she explains that the grandson cannot be moved until the coroner's 
investigator arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boy's uncle shows up, Johnson takes him aside, gives him her card and 
tells him to call when the family is ready to talk. She tells him she can help 
obtain counseling and money for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Johnson leaves, the grandmother stares off into the distance and says, 
"I talked to him and talked to him about being late. But," she shrugs weakly, 
"he was just a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson returns to her home a few miles from the shooting, a neat stucco house 
decorated with African American folk art and filled with pictures of her two 
children and grandson. She makes herself coffee and stares into the cup. "Poor 
little thing," she says, "laying out there like that." He was a skinny kid in a 
T-shirt, she says, very young-looking, more boy than man. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 48, knows what to say at life's most difficult moments, and people in 
South-Central listen. She has lived there for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been a single mother on welfare. She has lost members of her own 
family, three young cousins, to random violence. 
</P>
<P>
 While struggling to raise her children, she attended college and obtained a 
degree in political science. About 10 years ago, she started working with the 
city attorney's office as a victim advocate in the Los Angeles Police 
Department's 77th Street Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is one of about 60 coordinators of the state's Victim-Witness 
Assistance Program in the county. They work full time as advocates who provide 
people with funds -- collected through fines assessed against criminals -- for 
counseling, medical bills and funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 About six months ago, she persuaded Lt. Sergio Robleto, who heads the LAPD's 
South Bureau Homicide Division, to let her join detectives on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remain neutral and remain at a distance a lot of times," Robleto 
says. "Norma can totally commit to the families. She has great concern for the 
people she works with. For families devastated by a homicide . . . having Norma 
there can help them begin the healing process much faster." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of this month, Johnson will begin training victim assistance 
coordinators at two other South-Central Los Angeles police stations to work 
murder scenes. She hopes she can get the practice established throughout the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Johnson's friends are mystified as to how she can bear the work, how 
she can endure being around such profound grief. But to Johnson, working with 
victims' families is not a job. It is a calling. This is her ministry, she 
says, a mission that she does not want to entrust to anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are moments when it's simply too much for me," she says. "I'll just 
break down with the families and cry with them. This work has made me cynical 
about a lot of things. But this is my home and I have to keep struggling to 
make it a better place." 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent month, she assisted the families of 14 young murder victims, 
two of them only 11, in addition to her regular workload of rape and assault 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returns home from a call, she usually flips on the television and 
searches for an old movie, preferably a romance, to help her forget the bodies 
and the despair. If the call has been particularly grim, she will slip in a 
tape of one of her favorite classics, "An Affair to Remember." The movie helps 
Johnson forget the brutality of her work, for a few hours, and lose herself in 
a world where people's motives are always good, romance always prevails and the 
ending always is uplifting. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Shirley Simmons' 17-year-old son was shot to death while standing in front of 
a restaurant with his girlfriend. Johnson is spending the morning with Simmons 
at a Downtown courtroom, offering moral support as they wait for the accused 
killer's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons' son was killed in a neighborhood outside South-Central, so the 
detectives that Johnson usually works with did not investigate the case. But 
when Johnson learned of Simmons' plight, and discovered that she lived in 
South-Central, she offered to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons is angry about how she was treated by police. She says she spent more 
than five hours at the murder scene and had difficulty obtaining any 
information from officers. For months, she repeatedly called the detectives 
investigating the case, she says, but they did not return her calls. Until 
Johnson told her, Simmons did not know a suspect had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police acted like my son's life was worth nothing," says Simmons, an 
administrative assistant for a nonprofit organization in Santa Monica. "I go to 
work every day and I pay taxes. I just wanted to be treated like a human being. 
And I wasn't, until Norma began helping me." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had her own differences with law enforcement during her days as a 
community activist in the 1970s, when she occasionally picketed against police 
brutality in front of the station where she now works. She has matured, she 
says, and realizes that she can get more done through cooperation than 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 She attends the weekly meetings with detectives at the South Bureau Homicide 
Division, which investigates all murders in South-Central Los Angeles. She 
schmoozes with them after the meetings and talks about the cases, the suspects, 
the surviving families. She also pores over police and coroner's reports and 
sometimes attends autopsies, studying each case so that she can answer the 
questions of relatives who often feel they have nowhere else to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's greatest satisfaction comes when she runs into someone she has 
assisted months later. People often tell her that she helped them through their 
greatest trauma, helped them survive pain they did not think they could endure. 
That, she says, gives her the strength to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frustrating cases are the ones in which a relative cannot let go. One 
woman, after seeing the murder of her teen-age son, began carrying a photo 
album that chronicled his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I saw her she was carrying that album. And she'd say to me: 'Miss 
Johnson, this is my baby when he started walking. . . . This is my baby when he 
first went to school. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so deeply, deeply hurt that she could not come to grips with the 
reality that he was gone." Johnson pauses and shakes her head. "I could never 
really reach her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after another murder, after a 27-year-old mother of six was shot to 
death, Johnson is sitting with the slain woman's mother at the 77th Street 
police station. The shooting occurred just a few blocks away, when the woman 
was caught in the cross-fire of a gang shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The station is quiet this early morning. The only sound is a suspect in 
another case telling a detective across the room: "All I saw was a Chevy Nova." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson lightly touches the woman's shoulder and explains the various services 
available to her. But the woman just sits rigidly in her chair, in shock, 
staring straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later Johnson stops by the house. A banner is taped to the front 
window with a large picture of the slain woman, a picture of Jesus and the 
words: "I Love You My Baby -- Mom." The house is filled with flowers and 
sympathy cards, many from co-workers of the victim, who had worked as a 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's mother, who is taking care of her six young children, and 
relatives are preparing to go to the funeral parlor in Inglewood to view the 
body. They are taking the oldest child, an 11-year-old girl. Johnson rides with 
the family, wanting to make sure that the girl gets enough attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking at my caseload and I've got more than 50 kids right now who are 
growing up without a parent because some fool decided to pull the trigger," she 
says later as she waits with the family in the lobby of the funeral parlor. 
"We've got six right here." 
</P>
<P>
 When the family is allowed to view the body, the girl, who is wearing a green 
velvet dress trimmed with lace, stares into the coffin for 15 minutes, elbows 
on the edge, without saying a word. Finally, she looks up at Johnson and says 
defiantly: "That's not my mom. It's just fake. Everything is fake." 
</P>
<P>
 While the others stand by the coffin, crying and sniffling, Johnson takes the 
girl for a walk to show her where her mother will be buried. When they return, 
the girl hovers over the body for a few more minutes, then suddenly runs into 
the hallway. Johnson follows and embraces her. The girl bursts into tears. 
Johnson begins to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just breaks my heart," Johnson says, dabbing her eyes with a tissue, 
after saying goodby to the girl outside the funeral parlor. "Now we've got 
another little kid who'll be growing up without a mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," she says, grabbing another tissue from her purse, "these bullets 
tear through more than just bodies. They destroy whole families."

5 PALESTINIANS SLAIN AS HEBRON VIOLENCE FLARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel's security forces Wednesday battled armed Palestinian extremists for 
more than 18 hours in a firefight that left at least five Palestinians dead, 
among them a pregnant woman and four men identified by authorities as the most 
wanted Islamic fundamentalist fighters in this shellshocked city. 
</P>
<P>
 During the combat, flares lit the sky, more than 100 antitank missiles 
exploded and thousands of rounds of gunfire ripped the neighborhood where the 
Israeli army attacked and destroyed at least one house. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's battle was half a mile from the Cave of the Patriarchs mosque, the 
site of the Feb. 25 massacre of about 30 Palestinian worshipers by a 
Brooklyn-born Jewish settler. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian leaders charged that a second massacre was occurring in Hebron, a 
city of 125,000 Palestinians that was shattered to the core by the murders of a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces -- which have kept the entire 
city under strict military curfew for 24 days to prevent Palestinian 
retaliation against the 415 Jewish settlers who live here -- said Israeli 
soldiers had fought suspected Palestinian extremists who had barricaded 
themselves in the Hebron house. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Ehud Barak, Israel's military chief of staff, opened his testimony 
Wednesday before a judicial commission investigating the mosque massacre with a 
statement disclosing the firefight, reports of which had been subject to state 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the military operation in Hebron began Tuesday, lasted a full 18 hours 
-- though some reports said it lasted 22 hours -- and resulted in the deaths of 
four of the most important Islamic fundamentalist resistance fighters in a city 
known to be a hotbed for armed Palestinian extremism. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Barak's armed forces said a preliminary check indicated that 
civilian casualties, among them the pregnant woman, were caused by extremist 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel Radio -- and other reports -- agreed with Palestinian accounts, 
asserting that Israeli soldiers accidentally shot and killed the pregnant 
woman, Hunduk Zahdeh, during the firefight. Palestinian sources here said she 
was hit by a bullet while watching the clashes from the window of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials said six soldiers with their security forces had been 
lightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's casualties brought to more than 70 the number of Palestinians 
killed throughout the occupied territories since Baruch Goldstein, an 
ultranationalist Jewish settler, fired more than 100 bullets at Muslims praying 
in a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 The new round of violence that tore through Hebron underscored why the city's 
continuing nightmare has thrust it, center stage, into the stalled Middle East 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new massacre has taken place, beginning yesterday, and it is still going 
on," Ahmad Timimi, chairman of the self-proclaimed Hebron Emergency Committee, 
said at a meeting of the city's moderate Palestinian leadership, which occurred 
at the height of the Hebron battle Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed unrest here -- despite the army crackdown -- compounded a 
deterioration and despair so intense that the Israeli government apparently has 
agreed to demands by the Palestine Liberation Organization that Jerusalem 
negotiate the possibility of an armed, international peacekeeping force in 
Hebron. The PLO and Israeli officials continued to negotiate that issue and 
others in Cairo on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to all these massacres that are being committed, I see the town 
of Hebron is falling apart -- economically, psychologically and in all aspects 
of life," said Timimi, a supporter of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and his 
attempts to make peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Palestinians and Israelis here agree that a continuing source of 
controversy is the presence of 415 Jewish settlers in the heart of Hebron. Most 
are ultranationalists who believe that this city, occupied along with the rest 
of the West Bank during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, is an integral part of 
Israel. They are committed to re-establishing a permanent Israeli presence, 
which ended in 1929 when 67 Jews were massacred in an Arab uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has demanded in meetings with Israeli negotiators this week that the 
settlers be moved out of Hebron before he returns to the bargaining table. 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said the small settlements in Hebron 
are non-negotiable and that any decision to evacuate settlers is "a purely 
Israeli matter." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a meeting with his ruling Labor Party on Wednesday, Rabin appeared to 
sympathize with the Palestinians' deepening plight. "I get information from 
Hebron, a sensitive place where for 24 days, 100,000 to 120,000 Palestinians 
have been under curfew because of 415 Jews, because the consideration right now 
isn't the security of Arabs but the prevention of friction and the place 
catching on fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of the Hebron settlers is explosive for Israelis, as an emergency 
session of the Parliament, the Knesset, demonstrated all too well later 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Prime Minister, whoever tries to uproot the Jews from Hebron will find 
all of us there, the masses of the House of Israel, who will defend the Jewish 
right to live in Hebron, city of our forefathers," declared Benjamin Netanyahu, 
chairman of the opposition right-wing Likud Party, which has supported the 
settlers and opposed Rabin's peace accords with Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin shot back at Netanyahu: "I don't accept any of your threats! You will 
not gather in Hebron! You will gather in the Knesset! Decisions about Hebron 
are made in the Knesset. Don't try to frighten us." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Palestinians in Hebron, there was plenty of fear to go around 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the fiery national and international debate about the Hebron 
settlers, Aziz Amr, an emergency committee member, said he and many other 
moderate Palestinians believe the mosque massacre and the ensuing violence have 
handed Rabin "a golden opportunity to evacuate the settlers from the heart of 
the city -- not as part of the PLO negotiations but as a purely Israeli 
decision to safeguard the security of the Jews."

PRODUCERS TO THE PRESIDENT PLAY A CONTINUING ROLE; POLITICS: HEALTH AD SHOWS 
THE THOMASONS' TV SKILLS AND CONNECTIONS ARE STILL AVAILABLE TO THE CLINTON 
CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS and MELISSA WYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As President Clinton's health care plan recently foundered, sitcom producer 
Harry Thomason tried to come to the rescue. He created a television commercial 
spoofing the insurance industry's campaign against the Administration's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time that Thomason had used his expertise and Hollywood 
contacts to help his longtime friend from Arkansas at a critical moment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential campaign, Thomason and his wife, Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason, took the entertainment industry's involvement in 
presidential politics to a new level -- and into the studio where they produced 
their show, "Evening Shade." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomasons relied on employees, equipment and facilities from their hit 
shows for everything from the making of campaign videos to the selection of 
wardrobes for Bill and Hillary Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 While much has been written about the Thomasons and the Clintons, little has 
been revealed about how two of Hollywood's most prominent TV producers 
harnessed the talent under their command for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Working behind the scenes, they recruited high-priced film editors, a 
composer, a cameraman and others to make three campaign commercials and a 
documentary assembled under Bloodworth-Thomason's supervision at the CBS Studio 
Center in Studio City, where she and her husband film "Evening Shade." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomasons also found grooming experts to traverse the country, coiffing 
the Clintons' hair, applying their TV makeup and outfitting them with clothes 
from high-end fashion retail outlets that supplied the Thomasons' TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the election of Clinton could rightly be considered a crowning 
achievement, the Thomasons have been unwilling to detail their assistance to 
the 1992 campaign. They said through their attorney that their role was a 
private matter. A presidential spokeswoman said the White House would have no 
comment beyond what is in public records. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's victory gave the couple an entree to Washington, where Thomason was 
placed in charge of the inauguration and was given a coveted White House pass 
and an office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomasons temporarily lowered their profile after a string of episodes 
that embarrassed the President. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a flap over a Santa Barbara County beach house that the Thomasons 
leased and made available to the Clintons. There was Clinton's "$200 haircut" 
aboard Air Force One at Los Angeles International Airport. Then it was reported 
that Thomason had a role in the firing of seven White House travel office 
employees, which prompted a federal investigation that is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomason re-emerged this month in the political arena. After his health 
care commercial was aired in Washington last week, he appeared on Cable News 
Network. He said he and several Hollywood associates made the ad for $1,100 
without Clinton's knowledge, hoping to temper the "strident" debate over health 
reform. "We thought we would just try to do something light," he said. The 
Hollywood Role 
</P>
<P>
 Since the days of the movie moguls, Hollywood celebrities have played a 
supporting role in national politics, helping with fund raising and making 
campaign appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 From Barbra Streisand to Arnold Schwarzenegger, they have generated money and 
glitter for Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Warren Beatty, who had advisory roles in George 
McGovern's 1972 campaign and Gary Hart's 1984 and 1988 campaigns, few Hollywood 
figures have been so integrally involved in a presidential race as the 
Thomasons were. 
</P>
<P>
 They became unpaid consultants to Clinton and hosted fund-raisers. Their 
company contributed $60,000 to the Democratic National Committee. And to help 
ignite Clinton's faltering campaign, the Thomasons borrowed the magical 
techniques of television. 
</P>
<P>
 With their Arkansas backgrounds in common, the Clintons and the Thomasons 
became friends and confidants years ago. Theirs were extraordinary success 
stories -- and along the way, they tried to help each other. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when the Thomasons temporarily lost control of their first hit show, 
"Designing Women," then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton placed a call to a CBS 
executive on their behalf. And when Clinton announced that he was running for 
President later that year, the Thomasons became two of his earliest and most 
ardent backers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are from Arkansas, a little tiny state . . . if you're a dreamer 
from a place like that, you feel a bond with other dreamers from that same spot 
on the globe," Bloodworth-Thomason said in a 1992 interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomasons, who had a production deal with CBS worth up to $50 million, 
worked tenaciously on two fronts: putting out their TV shows -- "Designing 
Women," "Evening Shade" and "Hearts Afire" -- and assisting Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Thomason, 52, a private pilot, crisscrossed the country, working three 
days a week in Hollywood directing "Hearts Afire" and four on the campaign 
trail, according to present and former co-workers and campaign officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He arranged televised town meetings in New Hampshire to help overcome two 
early challenges to Clinton's character -- disclosure of his draft record and 
his alleged affair with Gennifer Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harry did a thousand things," recalled Mandy Grunwald, who directed Clinton's 
media advertising. "Harry did everything from literally stapling the carpeting 
to the set to fixing the lights." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Democratic National Convention, he orchestrated the Clintons' entrance 
-- much as he might direct a television scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bloodworth-Thomason, 45, was using her creative talents for the 
campaign. On occasion, she supplied Clinton with one-liners, including one he 
used at the convention to say he would return to accept the nomination: 
"Tomorrow night, I will be the 'Comeback Kid.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Former campaign officials credit her with the idea of having Clinton appear on 
the cable channel MTV and on "The Arsenio Hall Show," where his saxophone 
performance set him apart from the staid Washington Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, however, Bloodworth-Thomason also marshaled resources from 
her own shows. 
</P>
<P>
 After work, film editors from two of her shows went to work for the campaign, 
assembling three Clinton commercials in the "Evening Shade" editing trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when Clinton clinched the nomination, Bloodworth-Thomason went back into 
an editing room to put together a 13 1/2-minute biographical film for the 
Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, she used studio facilities and equipment leased for the shows 
by the Thomasons' company, Mozark Productions Inc., according to former and 
present employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Several professionals who worked on the campaign commercials and documentary 
said they volunteered their time as a favor to the producers. Others said they 
were paid by the campaign or did not recall how they were paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Burke, a co-producer/editor on "Designing Women," said she worked on 
two of the commercials. "Linda said . . . this was something that she and Harry 
were doing on their own because they wanted to help (Clinton)," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 After late-night editing sessions, the tapes were taken to a Burbank 
post-production facility called Laser Pacific Corp. to prepare them for TV 
airing, according to former Thomason employees. Laser Pacific provides 
post-production editing for the Thomasons' TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomasons called in Bruce Miller, who wrote music for "Designing Women," 
and asked him to score one of the commercials. "I did the music at my house," 
Miller said. "The dubbing was done at the studio here." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said her night of work normally would be worth $1,100 to $1,500. But she 
said Bloodworth-Thomason later gave her a Mozark check for $500, which she 
returned, saying she did not expect payment. Miller said he donated his time, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Hayman, former tape editor for "Evening Shade," said he edited one of the 
Clinton commercials for $500. He could not recall how he was paid, but believed 
it was through one of the Thomasons' shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Glass, a Little Rock cameraman who frequently did work for "Designing 
Women," shot footage for the three Clinton commercials and sent his film to Los 
Angeles, where Bloodworth-Thomason oversaw the editing. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass said Bloodworth-Thomason paid for the commercials, but he declined to 
say exactly how much he was paid. "We are not talking even fives of thousands 
(of dollars)," he said. "It wasn't any massive deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Former campaign officials recalled that at least one commercial produced at 
Mozark facilities was aired in New Hampshire. Enlisting Skills and Services 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal election law provides wide latitude for individuals to 
volunteer their professional services to campaigns, corporations are prohibited 
from making campaign contributions or providing facilities, labor or equipment 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing policy, Federal Election Commission officials declined to comment on 
the Thomasons' campaign-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, a commission spokesman said, "The way the law reads, anybody can 
volunteer his or her services. That is not a contribution. An artist can sit 
down and do a painting and sell it for a candidate. The artist's time is 
volunteered, but the paint, brushes and the canvas are contributory. The value 
of those are contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Records reviewed by The Times show that the Clinton campaign paid Mozark 
$14,019 for unspecified "media" and "events" expenses in August, 1992, seven 
months after the commercials were made. But the records did not specify whether 
the money reimbursed Mozark for making campaign films. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said campaign chairman David 
Wilhelm could not recall the specific payments and referred The Times to a 
campaign attorney, who did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Through their Los Angeles attorney, Michael J. Plonsker, the Thomasons 
declined Times requests for interviews, made over several months, and said they 
would not answer questions submitted in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not willing, nor do they have the time, to conduct an interview or 
to answer a barrage of questions regarding what they consider personal and 
private information," Plonsker said in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 After the primaries, Bloodworth-Thomason went to work on "The Man From Hope," 
a film that chronicled Clinton's life, from his youth in Hope, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton campaign hired Jeffrey Tuchman of New York to direct the film, 
which was financed with campaign funds and produced by Bloodworth-Thomason. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, "Designing Women" composer Miller was enlisted. "I was called into 
the editing room and told, 'Can we put an orchestra together in three days?' " 
recalled Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuchman said Bloodworth-Thomason was the driving force behind the film: She 
conducted the key interviews with the Clintons and, without compensation, spent 
18 hours a day for more than a week in an editing room at CBS Studio Center 
assembling the final product. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Bloodworth-Thomason told The Times that she oversaw the editing of 10 
hours of footage shot in Arkansas and of 1,000 pages of interview transcripts. 
"I was given no instruction on how to do this film," she said. "We just sat in 
the editing room looking at film, and we started slapping it together." 
</P>
<P>
 The post-production work for the documentary and the commercials was done at 
Laser Pacific, which, records show, was paid about $4,000 by the 1992 
Democratic National Convention Committee for unspecified "video production." 
Laser Pacific officials said they were not paid anything by the Clinton 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Former "Designing Women" editor Roger Bondelli, who spent "eight to 10 days" 
assembling the documentary, said he had his "own arrangement" with Thomason. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether I was paid at all, I did it as a favor," Bondelli said. "I was not 
paid through their payroll company. It was an arrangement that Harry and I 
made. These are big producers in Hollywood. Friends of mine. I want to work 
with them again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington consulting firm of Greer-Margolis handled up to $30 million in 
Clinton campaign advertising through Great American Media Inc., but president 
Frank Greer said that neither the Thomasons nor Mozark were reimbursed for work 
on the documentary by that company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid the film crew. . . . Not Linda and Harry," Greer said. He declined to 
make the records available, saying that revealing advertising strategies might 
aid his competitors. Looking Presidential 
</P>
<P>
 It was during filming of "The Man From Hope" that the Thomasons first turned 
to Cristophe, the Beverly Hills hairdresser who gave President Clinton his 
famous "$200 haircut." 
</P>
<P>
 Cristophe said he met Hillary Clinton in June, 1992, at the home of actress 
Markie Post, who co-stars in "Hearts Afire." He said he had been invited there 
by the actress and Bloodworth-Thomason. Post did not return calls seeking her 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both called me and said, 'We have a girlfriend and we're playing around 
with hair and things. Could you come over and give your input?' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Cristophe was jetting around the country, one of three Hollywood 
grooming consultants paid a few thousand dollars each by the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in New York doing the Clintons' hair during the Democratic National 
Convention. He flew to Michigan and Virginia for presidential debates. He was 
in Little Rock for election night and in Washington for inaugural week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristophe said his work for the Clintons happened to coincide with his own 
business trips. "I'm working (on) opening salons in different parts of this 
country," he said. "The Clintons never asked me to be there on specific dates 
or times." 
</P>
<P>
 Also part of the entourage was Post's makeup artist on "Hearts Afire," Bruce 
Grayson. He was on the campaign trail for the three debates, election night and 
inaugural week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Markie called me and said that Harry asked if I would be available the next 
day (for the first debate) and I said yes," Grayson recalled. He said he 
accepted as a favor to Thomason and charged less than his normal rate. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was needed on the campaign trail, Grayson said, he would get calls on 
a moment's notice and airline tickets would be waiting for him at the counter. 
The calls would come from either Harry Thomason's office or the campaign, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final member of the traveling trio was Clifford Challey, the costume 
designer on the Thomasons' three shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomasons asked Challey to outfit the Clintons for key events, including 
"The Man From Hope," the Democratic convention, the televised debates, election 
night and inaugural week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Challey transported clothes from Los Angeles-area stores to Hillary Clinton in 
Little Rock and elsewhere. "I would shop here for her, and then take the stuff 
back and then what would work she would pay for, and what didn't work, we would 
send back to the store," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Gagnon, who said she worked on Challey's staff, recalled that he 
shopped for the Clintons at Ron Ross in Reseda and I. Magnin, stores that 
supplied clothing for the Thomasons' TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Challey nor store officials would discuss details of the purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Challey's job on the campaign trail entailed organizing the Clintons' clothing 
according to their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jewelry, the shoes, the purse, (were) bagged and tagged, labeled for that 
event and then hung up in the closet, so she could run upstairs and all of the 
pieces were there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodworth-Thomason had a role in selecting the Clintons' wardrobe, Challey 
said. "The image thing was partially up to me, but it was her too," he said. 
"She was the one who said, 'We want them to look presidential.' "

SEISMIC DESIGN HAILED FOR AVERTING HOSPITAL DAMAGE; SAFETY: BASE ISOLATION 
SYSTEM IS CREDITED WITH LESSENING IMPACT OF NORTHRIDGE QUAKE ON USC FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The terrifying jolt that woke most of Southern California on Jan. 17 felt like 
nothing more than a gentle rocking at USC University Hospital in Los Angeles, 
with some patients saying that it was as if they were babies again, back in 
their cradles. 
</P>
<P>
 In other hospitals, chaos ensued. Water cascaded from fire sprinkler systems. 
Power failed. Breathing apparatuses wheezed to a halt. Glass shattered. In all, 
a dozen hospitals, some of them built to modern seismic standards, had to close 
or curtail patient services. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the difference, experts agree, was a state-of-the-art seismic safety 
system built into USC University Hospital's foundation. The so-called base 
isolation system -- designed to work much like the springs and shock absorbers 
on an automobile -- absorbed or damped about two-thirds of the force that hit 
the eight-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1991 as the nation's first base-isolated hospital, USC University 
Hospital's performance in the Northridge quake is being hailed by some 
engineers as proof positive of the technology's potential for protecting all 
types of critical structures, from fire stations to businesses' computer 
centers and their contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some caution that the structure was too far from the epicenter to be subjected 
to more than moderate shaking and that questions remain about how such systems 
would function in a large quake. Even so, it is clear that this real-world test 
of base isolation is gaining converts to the notion of preventing buildings 
from shaking rather than only trying to build them strong enough to remain 
standing after being tossed about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's eyes lit up with that, and now all of the vendors are saying, 
'Look, told you so, base isolation works,' " said Bill Staehlin, supervising 
structural engineer for the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development, the state agency that oversees hospital construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern buildings are supposed to withstand even the most powerful of 
earthquakes, but base-isolation systems offer the added benefit of protecting 
equipment, water lines and other contents so that structures remain functional, 
Staehlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 While engineers analyze $13 billion in damage to freeways, parking structures, 
steel-frame office towers, wood-frame apartment buildings and tilt-up concrete 
warehouses and try to understand their weaknesses, some researchers and 
policy-makers are urging greater emphasis on preventing some of the damage in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the techniques being researched are the use of mechanical devices to 
counteract the force of an earthquake and installation of friction plates that 
let buildings slide side to side. By far the most promising approach, and the 
only one that is actually installed in more than just a handful of buildings, 
is that of base isolators, engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech civil engineering professor John F. Hall testified recently at a 
congressional hearing that although more research is needed, base isolation is 
"the right road to be going down" for protecting hospitals, emergency command 
centers and other structures that must remain functional after an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 300 buildings and bridges worldwide -- 80 buildings nationally -- 
use the technology. But at least a dozen more buildings and several bridges are 
being built or retrofitted with isolators in California, even though they can 
cost tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those will be a five-floor hospital within a hospital proposed as part 
of a replacement for the aging Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. The 
facility, which would contain the trauma care center, surgery theaters, 
radiology rooms and laboratory, is already known as "the lifeboat." 
</P>
<P>
 With doctors and nurses there likely to see scores of injured people after a 
magnitude 8.0 earthquake, the 300,000-square-foot, critical-care facility would 
have three days' worth of water, power and medicine in reserve. More important, 
it is to be built on a series of steel, rubber and lead pads that will help 
make sure the equipment and supplies survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The current county medical center, which includes 100 mostly old, seismically 
unsafe buildings, suffered nearly $400 million in damage in the Northridge 
quake. Two of the center's four hospitals remain closed, and 16 or more other 
buildings will have to be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 But even modern hospitals were put out of commission by the quake. Olive 
View-UCLA Medical Center, a stiffly built steel-frame building erected in 1987 
to replace an older structure destroyed in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, was not 
damaged structurally, but shaking ruptured a water main and caused the 
hospital's fire sprinklers to leak. The facility had to be shut down for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of avoiding such a scenario, San Bernardino County officials are 
planning a base isolation system for the foundation of a new $434-million, 
835,000-square-foot medical center to be built in Colton, near the San Andreas 
and San Jacinto faults. Those faults are thought to be capable of producing 
magnitude 8.0 or greater quakes, county Deputy Administrative Officer John 
Giblin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We . . . realized that if there is a major seismic event, there are not going 
to be very many hospitals in this valley that are operating . . . because of 
their age and the way they are built," Giblin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could build the hospital to withstand an earthquake, but . . . what's 
inside the hospital is not going to be in very good shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of base isolation is tantalizingly simple and goes back nearly a 
century: Just as springs and shock absorbers smooth out the ride in a car, base 
isolators soften the seismic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hardware had to be invented and tested, and computer models had to be 
developed to analyze how buildings with isolators would perform in a quake, 
said Ron Mayes, president of Dynamic Isolation Systems in Berkeley, designer of 
the system at the privately owned USC University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Some engineers say that more research is needed and that builders should be 
cautious about recommending widespread installation of the systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Heaton, a U.S. Geological Service seismologist based in Pasadena, 
agreed that the system worked at USC University Hospital. But he said: 
"Unfortunately, the ground shaking at USC was much smaller than what can be 
expected in close, very large earthquakes . . . so it was probably not the 
ultimate test." 
</P>
<P>
 He calculated that the hospital's base isolators would have been pushed beyond 
their ability to absorb energy if the structure had been located in the 
northeast Valley, where longer waves of more intense motion were recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even speculate that in the largest quakes, base isolators could actually 
amplify building movement. So far, however, the systems have only been 
subjected to moderate quakes and generally have performed as designed. 
</P>
<P>
 The first base-isolated building in the United States, the Foothill 
Communities Law and Justice Center in Rancho Cucamonga, opened in 1986 and 
houses courtrooms and offices of the district attorney, public defender and the 
San Bernardino County Sheriff. In the magnitude 5.5 Upland earthquake in 1990, 
the base isolation system absorbed about half of the force exerted, leaving the 
building's contents undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Base isolation has also been used in the construction and retrofitting of 
bridges, utility lines and sensitive equipment, such as parts of the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator experimental physics facility in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 The system has been installed in some buildings that are critical for 
emergency response, including the Los Angeles County Fire Command and Control 
Facility, and some that house expensive equipment or crucial computerized data, 
including the Kaiser Permanente Regional Data Center in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake exposed a flaw in the construction of the Fire Command 
Center, experts said. To work properly, isolation systems have to move freely 
and a moat of sorts is normally built to give the building room to rock. But 
the command center was connected to the ground with a layer of concrete that 
bridged the moat, which caused shaking inside to increase for a moment or so 
until the concrete was broken away by the quake's force. 
</P>
<P>
 Base isolation has also been used to make historic buildings less vulnerable 
to an earthquake without obscuring their distinctive architectural features. 
For example, a $21-million base isolation system is being installed at UCLA's 
Kerckhoff Hall, which was built in 1929 and is one of the oldest buildings on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Hall, and city halls in San Francisco and Oakland that were 
damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, will be renovated with the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, such as the county Fire Command Center, base isolation can 
actually reduce building costs because other parts of the structure can be made 
lighter, experts said. But the system also can add 1% to 4% to construction 
costs. Mayes said even that relatively small premium is enough to discourage 
many owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you haven't had a major event for 20 years, you forget" how devastating 
a quake can be, he said. "It's only at a time like this that you realize that 
it's a minuscule cost to society." 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed, Mayes and others said, is for the state and federal 
governments to foster efforts to prevent earthquake damage by granting tax 
incentives to encourage retrofitting and by pushing changes in building codes 
to emphasize saving structures as well as lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael P. Bocchicchio, assistant vice president for facilities for the 
University of California system and a former state architect, agreed. "With the 
tremendous amount of damage we experienced in the Northridge quake, we ought to 
be starting to think about the socioeconomic aspects of quake damage as well as 
life safety," he said. "It becomes a question of whether the society as a whole 
can withstand . . . a major disaster in which the economy takes a real hit and 
you have people without homes, businesses, jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Don Rogers (R-Tehachapi) has carried several pieces of legislation 
to encourage the use of earthquake hazard mitigation measures, including base 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to always react when it comes to earthquakes," he said. "Before the 
earthquake occurs, we should be very busy using this technology so that when 
the earthquake occurs, you have eliminated most of the damage."

CLINTON DENIES CLEMENCY APPEAL IN POLLARD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton rejected the clemency request of convicted spy Jonathan 
Pollard on Wednesday, citing the "grave nature of his offense and the 
considerable damage that his actions have caused our nation." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Clinton said he had reviewed the case personally and taken 
note of Pollard's argument that in spying for Israel he was helping "a friendly 
country." But Clinton also noted that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and law enforcement 
and national security agencies opposed clemency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Pollard's crime is one of the most serious crimes against our country," 
Clinton said. He explained that his decision was based on "the enormity of Mr. 
Pollard's crime, the harm his actions have done to our country and the need to 
deter every person who might even consider such actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollard, a former Navy analyst, was sentenced to life in prison in 1987 after 
a federal court found that he had turned over voluminous information to the 
Israelis, including satellite photographs and details on Arab military 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 His clemency request, first sent to President George Bush in 1992, aroused 
strong passions on both sides and pitted Israel and some American Jewish groups 
against U.S. law enforcement officials, the CIA and other U.S. intelligence 
agencies, the State Department and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had long debated the issue and had heard from both former 
Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and current Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point came with Reno's recommendation this week that Clinton 
reject the request. That recommendation made the determination among federal 
agencies unanimous and made Clinton's politically sensitive judgment easier to 
defend. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor was the case of Aldrich H. Ames, the longtime CIA official 
accused of spying for the Russians. A decision to free Pollard could be read as 
official softness on espionage just when the United States needs to appear 
resolute, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollard's attorney, Theodore B. Olson, said he was "very, very disappointed 
both in the decision on the merits, and because the President did not do what 
he said he would do." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Olson, Clinton had promised that he would give Pollard "the 
opportunity to be heard through his counsel once the White House received a 
recommendation from the Justice Department." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Wednesday that she was unaware 
of any such promise by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollard has won the support of such notables as Nobel Prize winner Elie 
Weisel, civil rights leader Benjamin L. Hooks and Father Theodore Hesburgh, the 
retired president of Notre Dame University. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of some American Jewish groups said feelings in their community were 
divided on the issue, and they predicted that the reaction to Clinton's 
decision would not be harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Elan Steinberg, director of the American section of the World Jewish Congress, 
said that "within some sectors of the American Jewish community, there are 
passionate feelings" in favor of reducing Pollard's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Samuel Rabinove, director of national affairs and legal director of the 
American Jewish Committee, said: "I don't think there will be a huge political 
fallout. We had urged a full review of the matter and apparently that review 
has taken place." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's rejection of the clemency request does not necessarily end Pollard's 
hope of eventual release. While Reno's report to Clinton said it was too early 
to free Pollard because of the gravity of his crime, she did not rule out 
clemency down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollard probably will have less luck if he relies on the U.S. Parole 
Commission. He first becomes eligible for parole on Nov. 21, 1995, and he can 
apply for release six months before that date, according to Tom Kowalski, case 
operations manager for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission and its predecessor agency historically have shown little 
inclination to release spies. 
</P>
<P>
 In making her recommendation, Reno had considered a memo from former Deputy 
Atty. Gen. Philip B. Heymann, whose office traditionally communicates clemency 
recommendations to the White House. Heymann had considered the case before 
resigning his post in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann had listed several options for the President. One was to reduce 
Pollard's sentence to a 20-year term, according to a source familiar with the 
memo. Another was commuting the sentence at a not too distant date. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have been adamant in arguing for Pollard's continued 
incarceration. Joseph E. DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney who argued the case, 
called Pollard's actions "the largest physical compromise of United States 
classified information in the 20th Century."

<P>
 Three major U.S. corporations Wednesday signed a record-breaking $3.75-billion 
settlement with lawyers representing thousands of women who contend they were 
seriously injured by silicone gel breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Corning Corp., Baxter International Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. 
agreed to fund the largest settlement of a product liability case in U.S. 
history.

<P>
 Several other companies have tentatively agreed to put in about another $170 
million, bringing the settlement pot to almost $4 billion. It is possible that 
the deal could be enriched by another $750 million if 3M, Union Carbide Corp. 
and General Electric Co. join in. Negotiations with those companies are 
continuing, the plaintiffs' lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he maintained that Dow has a strong defense to the thousands of 
lawsuits against it, Gary E. Anderson, executive vice president, said "a 
settlement is in the best interest of all parties involved." Baxter and Bristol 
representatives confirmed that a settlement had been concluded but did not 
issue statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The implants have become a litigation nightmare for the companies. About 
12,000 cases have been filed around the country by women who contend that they 
are suffering from a variety of medical problems stemming from their implants. 
Dow and the other firms are spending millions each month to defend the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 million women received implants between 1962 and 1992, when the 
Federal Food and Drug Administration restricted their use. Many of the suits 
maintain that silicone leaked out of the implant pouch and migrated throughout 
women's bodies, causing autoimmune diseases including scleroderma, arthritis, 
lupus, atypical neurological disease syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease 
and atypical rheumatic syndrome. About a dozen cases have been tried so far. 
The plaintiffs have won most of them, including several multimillion-dollar 
verdicts, but most are being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's deal still could fall apart. The companies could back out if a 
large number of women reject the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, San Francisco lawyer Elizabeth J. Cabraser, one of the plaintiffs' 
negotiators, expects many women to take part in the settlement. She said it 
offers them an opportunity to receive substantial compensation -- from $160,000 
to $1.6 million, depending on their ages and severity of their injuries -- 
without having to wage lengthy court battles. Those amounts could be increased 
to a range of $200,000 to $2 million if more companies join the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a uniquely beneficial settlement for women," Cabraser said. "For 
the first time in a mass tort settlement, women will be entitled to know the 
benefits they will receive, and they will not be obligated to participate if 
the settlement cannot deliver those benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key elements of the settlement is that women will not be required 
to prove that there is a causal relationship between having an implant and the 
numerous diseases that women contend they got because of their implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, women will simply be required to prove that they had an implant put in 
and have a board-certified doctor substantiate that they have one of the 
medical problems covered by the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is critical because it means women won't have to go through a 
complicated medical arbitration proceeding," said Michael Gallagher, a Houston 
attorney who also was on the plaintiffs' negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is to be funded over 30 years. It also includes money for 
implant removal and medical monitoring. Women who are not sick now but later 
develop diseases that are covered by the agreement could get compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's announcement, culminating more than 18 months of negotiations, 
sets in motion a process whereby women around the country will be notified in 
newspaper and broadcast ads and by mail of the pending settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The notices are expected to go out starting April 4, subject to approval by 
U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. of Birmingham, Ala., who is presiding 
over several thousand implant suits that have been consolidated there. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a court-approved, toll-free, 24-hour phone line, (800) 887-6828, 
was set up so women can call and request information about the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer also has to decide how much time women will have to make an initial 
decision about whether to participate in the settlement or to pursue solo 
lawsuits. Lawyers for the plaintiffs and the companies said they expect it will 
be about 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sybil N. Goldrich of Beverly Hills, co-founder of the Command Trust 
Network, a national information clearinghouse for women with implants, said she 
thought 60 days is not enough time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Judge Pointer will allow women at least 90 days," she said. "This is a 
complicated settlement, and a woman may need to consult with a lawyer or a 
counselor" to determine if the settlement makes sense for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said they expected Pointer to hold a hearing in August on the 
settlement's fairness. Although scores of plaintiffs' attorneys and lawyers for 
the companies will support the deal, Alan B. Morrison, director of Ralph 
Nader's Public Citizen Litigation Group, indicated Wednesday that he would 
challenge it. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison said he had concerns about whether the settlement fund would be 
adequate, whether all the appropriate diseases were covered and how claims 
administration would be handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be many more claims than they anticipated and the companies will 
attempt to ratchet down" the compensation amounts for each disease, predicted 
Los Angeles lawyer Roman M. Silberfeld, who represents several hundred women 
with implants. 
</P>
<P>
 New York lawyer Robert Gordon, whose firm represents 4,500 women with 
implants, also predicted that the settlement cap would be busted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the companies would be faced with the choice of putting more money into 
the deal or having thousands of women opt out. "This will be very interesting 
over the next couple of months; it's like playing an open hand of poker," 
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francine Gingras of Bristol Myers-Squibb said the company is participating in 
the agreement to put the implant problem behind it. "There is still no 
scientific research that links breast implants and disease." Plaintiffs' 
lawyers noted that several scientific studies say there is a link, but they 
acknowledge that there is a dispute in the scientific community on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement today, Dow's Anderson said: "The success of the settlement 
depends on virtually all women participating in it." Another Dow spokesman said 
that if more women than expected file claims, the settlement could be reworked. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson also said Dow's participation in the settlement "is based on 
receiving substantial and timely support from its insurance carriers." Dow and 
the other companies are currently in legal disputes with their carriers over 
who is responsible for implant litigation expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Dow estimated that legal and other expenses related to the implant 
litigation would cost the company $1.24 billion; it expected to recover about 
$600 million from its insurance coverage. Bristol-Myers said in February that 
it expected its expenses to reach $1.5 billion and that it expected to recover 
about $1 billion from insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow's share of the agreement is just over $2 billion, Bristol's share is $1.15 
billion and Baxter's share is $555.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs' lawyers said it would be necessary to review the terms of the 
settlement with each client to determine whether the deal makes sense for her. 
The accord gives women three separate opportunities to opt out at various 
stages of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Several women with implants said they were pleased by the settlement but 
wanted more details. "A lot of women are not going to jump for joy and drop 
their lawsuits without knowing the exact dollars and what classification they 
are in," said Barbara Norman of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, who suffers from chronic fatigue, immune system disorders, joint pain 
and hair loss, believes those conditions are linked to several breast implant 
operations she had beginning in 1981. "The main thing I've had is this loss of 
energy since 1987. It alienated my friends and my sons from me because they 
thought I was just being lazy."

FIRST EVIDENCE OF ASTEROID MOON SHOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Wednesday released the 
first evidence of a moon orbiting an asteroid, a discovery that could yield 
clues to the creation of the solar system and how the traffic jam of orbiting 
rocks between Mars and Jupiter came into being. 
</P>
<P>
 The moon, a mountain of stone about a mile in diameter, appears to circle an 
asteroid the size of Los Angeles, called Ida. The National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration released a photograph of the asteroid and its newly 
discovered moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first clear detection of a satellite of an asteroid," said Clark 
R. Chapman at the Planetary Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena. "There 
have been hints before. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason this is important is that asteroids have played a role in shaping 
our own planet. We need to understand these objects that rain down on us," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such small pairs of asteroids and their moons may be responsible for unusual 
double craters found in Canada, Siberia and on the surface of the moon and 
Mars, astronomers and scientists said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we worried it might be scrambled data, but most of us were 
believers," said imaging team member Ann Harch, who first spotted the object 
near Ida in a photograph transmitted to Earth by the agency's Galileo probe. 
Aesthetically, it is just so beautiful to think of all these objects dancing 
out there together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discovery. . . . It's great!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Science Coordinator Marcia Segura, who helped confirm the moon's existence 
with measurements from an infrared sensor also on board Galileo, said, "At 
first we were kind of blase about it. Then we were really jazzed. Really 
excited. The adrenalin is still pumping. It comes in waves." 
</P>
<P>
 So far the only thing NASA scientists can say for certain about Ida's moon is 
that it exists -- hanging in space, about 62 miles from the larger asteroid, 
well within its sphere of gravity. Both lie in the belt of more than 50,000 
cold, dusty, meteor-pocked rocks between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be months before scientists can determine its composition, its 
orbit around Ida or how fast it is moving. They do know that for an object in 
the deep freeze of space, it is relatively warm -- about 99 degrees Fahrenheit 
below zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sorry I can't be definite (now) but the indications are that the 
satellite is the same type of material as Ida," said Robert W. Carlson, the JPL 
scientist in charge of the infrared mapping sensor on Galileo. "It is so 
similar that it may even be part of the same rock Ida is -- a true daughter of 
Ida." 
</P>
<P>
 NASA scientists said Wednesday they suspect the moon and Ida were formed at 
the same time, but they don't know when. 
</P>
<P>
 Ida, a battered rock shaped like a sweet potato, belongs to the Koranis family 
of asteroids. Scientists think the group was formed when a very large asteroid 
perhaps 180 miles in diameter broke up several hundred million years ago, 
creating a constellation of smaller orbiting fragments of rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Galileo project scientists said they think that the moon may be a smaller 
fragment from the break-up of that parent body, or that it may be a chip off 
the asteroid Ida itself caused by a more recent collision. They said it was 
virtually impossibly that the moon just happened to wander by the larger 
asteroid and be captured by its gravity field. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing they hope to learn from Ida and its moon is how such small orbiting 
bodies interact within the asteroid belt, under conditions that resemble those 
during the formation of the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that they have found one moon around an asteroid, NASA scientists said, 
they will step up the search for others. "If you find one, then it is probably 
not the only one. We will be taking a look for others," said Michael J.S. 
Belton, a space imaging expert from the National Optical Astronomy 
Observatories in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 The new moon has been provisionally designated "1993 (243) 1," meaning that it 
is the first natural satellite discovered in 1993 near Ida, which in turn was 
the 243rd asteroid discovered over the past two centuries. Eventually, the 
International Astronomical Union will give the moon its formal name. All About 
Ida 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: The moon was photographed by Jupiter-bound space probe Galileo 
last Aug. 28, about 14 minutes before its closest approach to the asteroid. The 
photograph was transmitted to Earth earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: Ida is about 35 miles long, and its moonlet, which some astronomers 
are calling "Baby Ida," is about one mile long. 
</P>
<P>
 * Location: There are more than 50,000 asteroids orbiting in a belt between 
Mars and Jupiter. Sun-scorched, meteor-pocked, and devoid of life, they range 
in size from a few feet in diameter to more than 600 miles across. Often they 
collide, producing debris that falls to Earth as meteorites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Significance: NASA scientists hope that their observations of Ida and its 
moon will help them better understand the formation of the solar system.

OTHER STATES CHECK OUT CALIFORNIA SMOG TEST DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's compromise with the federal government on revamping its Smog 
Check program has touched off a rebellious debate in state capitols across the 
nation, with many officials hoping to strike similar special deals on how cars 
are inspected for excessive exhaust emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 From Georgia to Nevada, several legislatures and governors have suspended 
their own plans and are hurriedly evaluating California's. Although many are 
concluding that copying it would be too costly, several are preparing to 
negotiate with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for their own versions 
of California's Smog Check compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this position for 13 years, and I've not seen a backlash on an 
issue like I have on this one. It was as if a tremendous shot was heard across 
the country," said William Becker, director of a Washington organization of 
state and local air pollution regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "EPA must now give other states the opportunity to pursue the same deal that 
they are giving California," he said. "Legislatures and other officials in 
state government are asking fair questions: 'What does all this mean for us and 
why should we break our necks and move forward when it is unclear what the 
EPA's policy is?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal Clean Air Act, 22 states with serious air pollution must 
launch tougher inspection and maintenance programs for vehicles by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The faceoff between the states and the EPA focuses on the location and 
thoroughness of the tests. The EPA ordered most states to create centralized, 
test-only centers that operate under a state contract and perform more rigorous 
inspections on all cars and light trucks. But California legislators balked, 
saying that approach would hurt the state's 9,000 private repair shops and 
service stations that currently conduct smog checks. 
</P>
<P>
 After lengthy negotiations, the Legislature forged a compromise with the EPA 
earlier this month and passed a package of bills that is awaiting Gov. Pete 
Wilson's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, 15% of all cars in California in 1995 would be sent to 
the special test-only centers; the others would continue to go to regular 
service stations. The state also would start a multimillion-dollar experiment 
with sensing devices along roadsides and other means of targeting gross 
polluters and cracking down on fraud among mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 If those alternatives fail to clean up enough cars, 30% of all California 
vehicles in 1996 will go to special centers. Because each vehicle is tested 
every other year, that means 60% of all California cars -- equivalent to the 
percentage believed to be heavy polluters -- would undergo the more rigorous 
tests from then on. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the 15% of cars targeted initially will be culled from large 
fleets such as rental cars and taxicabs, cars with missing emissions-control 
devices, gross polluting vehicles and cars selected randomly. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of several other states -- angry with the EPA because it rejected 
their efforts to compromise -- said they will try to negotiate new agreements. 
Nevada Gov. Bob Miller dispatched a team to San Francisco on Wednesday to meet 
with the EPA's regional administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are areas (of the California deal) that look as though they could have 
a positive application in the state of Nevada," said Richard Urey, Miller's 
press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Many states, however, are finding elements of California's hybrid program 
unappealing, mostly because they fear it will be more costly for motorists and 
more complex for government. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be hard to replicate in other states. They may flirt with it, they 
may look at it, but when they actually examine it, I think they won't find it 
attractive," said John White, a Sacramento lobbyist for the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Reheis, Georgia's environmental director, said his state will not adopt 
California's plan because "it will be very costly to car owners and will shift 
a heavy cost burden to lower income people." Instead, Reheis said Georgia will 
work on its own compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA estimates that California motorists will pay $50 or more for a smog 
inspection, up from their current $32 average. Nationally, the average will run 
$20 for motorists in states operating new test-only centers. No limit was put 
on the amount of money a California motorist must spend to repair a car that is 
considered a gross polluter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many outside of California would argue that this is not a good deal 
for the California consumer -- that it is unnecessarily expensive, and is much 
tougher in many respects than the standard," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), the chief architect of the 
compromise, said other states are making hasty judgments based on false 
assumptions. He disputed the EPA's estimate of $50 or more per test, saying: 
"We honestly don't know how much it will cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz called the program "a reasonable alternative" for California because it 
will clean up the air, retain jobs at service stations and be more convenient 
for motorists than the EPA's version. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume of cars in California is much greater than it is in Georgia, which 
will bring the price down in California," Katz said. "The states where you have 
more dense populations and a larger number of vehicles will find this kind of 
program more attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Graveline, an EPA spokeswoman in Washington, said that even though many 
states have asked to talk to the agency, none so far have asked to revise their 
inspection programs. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do, she said, "we have to wait to see what they are asking for. Every 
state is looking at what every other state is doing, but every state wants 
something different." 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials have insisted that smog tests be separated from repairs because 
they believe the current system of allowing mechanics to do both is riddled 
with fraud and leaves smog-belching cars unfixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, most states started complying with the EPA's order reluctantly, 
after the agency threatened to freeze their highway funds and impose other 
economic sanctions. But even as they signed contracts to set up inspection 
systems, many were eyeing the wrestling match between the EPA and California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a December letter, Pennsylvania Acting Gov. Mark S. Singel warned EPA 
Administrator Carol Browner that if California is granted a special deal "not 
only will Pennsylvania's Legislature rescind our (program), but in my opinion, 
they will not take any federal Clean Air Act requirements seriously." Other 
state officials and Congress members sent similar warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Graveline, however, emphasized that the EPA has not budged from its bottom 
line -- that California's hybrid program must achieve the Clean Air Act's 
mandate or be abandoned in 1996. "They can use alternatives, but they have to 
prove to us they can meet the equivalent of taking 60% of the dirtiest cars off 
the road," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, who says a tougher inspection and repair program is the best and 
cheapest way to clear the nation's skies, worries that the new programs may be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California deal has come at a very inopportune time," he said, "given the 
fact that most states proceeded ahead in the past few months in good faith. It 
came right in the middle when states were purchasing land and letting contracts 
-- making the final decisions to implement their programs."

FBI MAY FIRE AGENT SUED FOR HARASSMENT; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE BUREAU IS SEEKING 
TO REMOVE A SUPERVISOR IN ITS ORANGE COUNTY WHITE-COLLAR CRIMES UNIT, SOURCES 
SAY. A LAWSUIT BY TWO FEMALE AGENTS ACCUSES HIM OF FONDLING AND TAUNTING THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI has moved to fire the supervisor of a white-collar crimes unit in 
Orange County who is accused in a federal civil rights lawsuit of fondling and 
taunting two female agents, according to sources who are familiar with the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent John Carpenter, a 20-year bureau veteran, was asked to vacate his Santa 
Ana office last week after FBI officials in Washington determined there were 
grounds for dismissal, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter declined to comment when contacted Monday and Wednesday at his 
Rancho Santa Margarita home. But two weeks ago, Carpenter said "I deny 
everything" in response to what is believed to be the first sexual harassment 
lawsuit filed by women still working as agents. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials in Santa Ana, Los Angeles and Washington also declined to 
comment, citing a bureau policy of not discussing pending administrative and 
personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources told The Times that disciplinary action was taken against 
Carpenter after FBI officials in Washington intervened after the March 11 
lawsuit by Agents Boni Carr Alduenda and Heather Power-Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said FBI officials in Washington ordered the start of dismissal 
proceedings after a high-level team traveled to Santa Ana last week and 
interviewed several supervisors and agents about the women's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FBI personnel procedures, Carpenter will be given time to respond to the 
allegations and final action will not be taken until his response is evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson, 38, and Carr Alduenda, 40, have alleged that Carpenter taunted 
them at work, grabbing them and making lewd remarks during several months in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson, who was assigned to Carpenter's squad, said the supervisor 
massaged her shoulders and, in one incident, kissed her on the back of the neck 
while she was sitting at her desk. Another time, she alleged, Carpenter tore 
her dress when he forced his hand onto her upper thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr Alduenda alleged that Carpenter constantly grabbed her and commented 
several times about the size of her breasts. In the lawsuit, she said that when 
she returned from maternity leave in September, 1992, Carpenter said to her: 
"Maternity has been good to you. Your breasts are really big. Are you 
breast-feeding? I wish I was your baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The women also alleged that the resident agent in charge of the Santa Ana 
office, James Donckels, discouraged them from filing discrimination complaints 
with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but advised them to 
put their complaints in writing so that he could forward them to the Office of 
Professional Responsibility, an internal FBI unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The women said in their lawsuit that they were harassed and intimidated by FBI 
officials after they complained about Carpenter's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson has been a special agent since 1984; Carr Alduenda has served 
since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 They are assigned to the bureau's 65-agent Santa Ana field office, where 
Carpenter supervised a team of 12 FBI agents who specialize in investigating 
white-collar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher B. Mears, an Irvine lawyer who is representing the women, said 
Wednesday that he was gratified to hear that the bureau was taking disciplinary 
action against Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better late than never because we've been requesting that he be 
disciplined from Day 1," Mears said. "These two women have been forced to share 
the same workplace with him for the last (18 months). It has served to rob them 
of their peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Mears said the women will proceed with their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Morley, a spokesman for the FBI office in Santa Ana, said Wednesday that 
the bureau will issue no statement about the case. He proceeded to read the 
department's policy, which states in part that "the FBI is deeply committed to 
ensuring that discrimination and sexual harassment are absent from the FBI 
workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh announced tough new guidelines 
governing the conduct of FBI employees, emphasizing higher standards of ethical 
behavior and allowing inquiries into sexual activity, including extramarital 
affairs. The director emphasized that homosexual conduct is not misconduct per 
se. 
</P>
<P>
 In a directive to all FBI executives, Freeh said the guidelines are among 
policies he has sought to institute since becoming director six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have determined that we have been too tolerant of certain types of 
behavior," Freeh said, adding that he wants to "draw a bright line which should 
serve to put all employees on notice of my expectations."

BE HALTED IF THERE ARE SIGNS OF HARM TO MARINE MAMMALS, SCRIPPS INSTITUTION 
OFFICIALS SAY.

 Scientists seeking to transmit loud sounds through the Pacific Ocean to 
measure global warming defended their experiment Wednesday, insisting that the 
noise would not deafen whales and pledging to halt the project if it appeared 
to be causing harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not out to harm a single whale with these underwater sounds," said 
David Hyde, director of the research project at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography in San Diego. "We will cease sound transmissions to avoid harm to 
marine mammals." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial experiment, which could begin as early as next month, would 
broadcast a high-volume, low-frequency rumbling sound for 20 minutes, six times 
a day, from the ocean floor off Big Sur and Kauai, Hawaii. The sound would be 
detected at U.S. Navy listening posts in the ocean as far as 10,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Some whale experts have charged that the unusual project could deafen or 
damage the hearing of acoustically sensitive marine mammals and have sought to 
block a federal permit needed for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scripps scientists said the experiment is essential to learn if the 
ocean's temperature is rising -- a phenomenon they say would pose a far greater 
risk to marine life than the loud sounds broadcast during what they hope will 
be a 10-year experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also said they have included in the project a comprehensive 
study of marine mammals near the broadcast sites to determine if the noise is 
disturbing the whales or driving them from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are an environmental research project and we are sensitive to 
environmental concerns, particularly with respect to marine mammals," Hyde 
said. "We share that concern with our critics." 
</P>
<P>
 Project leaders acknowledged that Scripps had done little to prepare the 
public for the experiment and said they were caught off guard by a sudden 
outpouring of opposition to the federally funded project. Scripps scientists 
did not respond to The Times' requests earlier this week for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to calls from constituents, both California senators, Democrats 
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, urged the National Marine Fisheries Service 
on Tuesday to move cautiously in approving the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew Forbes, the project's deputy director, blamed poorly informed 
marine mammal experts for irresponsibly alarming the public with 
misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound would be broadcast at 75 hertz, which is at the low end of the range 
of human hearing but may not even be audible to many marine mammal species, 
Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
 Transmitted from loudspeakers about 900 meters deep, the initial volume of 195 
decibels would quickly drop as the sound travels away. 
</P>
<P>
 Only an animal within 200 meters of the sound source would suffer ear damage, 
Hyde said. To warn animals away, the sound would be turned up gradually for the 
first five minutes of each 20-minute broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Also of concern to whale researchers is the possibility that the frequent 
transmission could alter the behavior of endangered marine mammals, reduce 
feeding or reproduction, or drive them from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Whales are known to change their behavior in response to noises of 120 
decibels. Hyde said the experiment's transmission would be heard at that volume 
or higher within a 30-mile radius of the sound source, potentially affecting 
677,000 marine mammals near California that live or travel through the area off 
Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scientists said their noise would not be as loud as other sounds that 
pollute the ocean, including the engine noise of large ships, explosions 
detonated during oil exploration and naval activities.

2 UC REGENTS CALL FOR PELTASON TO RESIGN; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS SEND LETTERS 
THAT DENOUNCE NEGATIVE REMARKS ABOUT STATE SENATE DEMOCRATS MADE DURING A 
PRIVATE MEETING. UC PRESIDENT APOLOGIZES BUT SAYS HE HAS NO PLANS TO STEP DOWN. 
</P>

<P>
 Two University of California regents on Wednesday called for UC President Jack 
W. Peltason to resign in the wake of recent revelations that he bad-mouthed 
state Senate Democrats and an outspoken regent during a private staff meeting 
with his top aides. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to Peltason on Wednesday, regent and Los Angeles attorney 
Frank W. Clark Jr. said it would be "clearly in the best interests of the 
University of California" if Peltason stepped down immediately. In a telephone 
interview, fellow regent Glenn Campbell of Palo Alto concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peltason and Board Chairman Howard H. Leach of San Francisco immediately 
countered with letters of their own. Peltason said it would not be in the 
university's best interest if he stepped down and Leach wrote to legislators 
that the "overwhelming majority" of the regents still support the UC president. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of faxes marked a bizarre twist in what has become an embarrassing 
episode for the university. On Sunday, the San Francisco Examiner published a 
story quoting excerpts from a March 2 private staff meeting the UC president 
held with campus chancellors and his top administrators. Peltason talked to 
university officials in Southern California via a video hookup and the 
newspaper obtained a tape of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the March 2 meeting, Peltason talked about a Senate Rules Committee 
decision Feb. 28 to reject the appointment of Lester Lee, a Saratoga Republican 
and businessman, because he had supported Peltason's recommendation to raise 
students fees next year. Peltason asked UC Berkeley Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien 
to rally Chinese American support for Lee in time for a full Senate vote the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltason said he did not want to see the Senate Democrats "get away with it 
without some kind of pain or penalty" but said he didn't want to make this an 
"issue between the university and the Democrats and make (Senate President Pro 
Tem) Bill Lockyer so mad at us that he is hostile toward the appropriations. So 
I want to keep a low profile." 
</P>
<P>
 Peltason also apparently mocked Regent Ward Connerly of Sacramento for his 
public comments urging regents not to be a rubber stamp for UC administrators. 
"He's the hero. He's the one who came in and is prepared to stand up and reform 
the place," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer (D-Hayward) responded to the excerpts by lashing out at UC officials, 
calling them "grubby, self-interested individuals" and threatening to form a 
Higher Education Committee in the Senate to keep closer watch on the UC and the 
California State University systems. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Connerly said Peltason's comments were "totally inappropriate 
and dead wrong." He said they showed a continuing siege mentality by UC 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 But Connerly said Peltason is a decent man who shouldn't be forced to step 
down because of private comments. "I think it's a very humbling experience for 
him," he said. "If this doesn't bring some of those people back to reality of 
what's going on, then I don't know what will." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, a spokesman for Peltason said the president intends to send a 
letter to legislators explaining his comments. "The remarks were unfortunate 
and I have spoken with those whose names were mentioned," Peltason wrote. "It 
is clear that the decision of the selection of regents is not a matter in which 
the university administration should be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate letter to Clark, Peltason said the tape was an apparent illegal 
bugging. Staff meetings such as this often involve privileged attorney-client 
discussions and talk about the national labs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two regents calling for his resignation say Peltason, who has taken 
three days to apologize, has already damaged the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, past president of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, 
said angering the Senate Democrats means "the university's in danger of having 
its appropriations cut even more. . . . You know, we still get about $2 billion 
from the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark declined to cite specific problems with Peltason, only to say that 
Sunday's excerpts were the latest in a "cumulative series of events" that 
prompted his call for the president's resignation.

SARAJEVANS CHEER AS BRIDGE REOPENS AFTER 2 YEARS OF WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To cheers and applause, 41 civilians crossed the Brotherhood and Unity Bridge 
linking the Serb- and government-held parts of Sarajevo for the first time in 
two years of civil war Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was the Sarajevo 'Wall,' then it is falling apart," said Borislav 
Cuh, 68, as he crossed to see his two sons on the government-held side for the 
first time since shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the journeys across the bridge spanning the Miljacka River ended 
pleasantly. An elderly man, Hazan Bejic, returned after 30 minutes, stunned at 
the news that a sniper killed his son Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 People seeking passage on the bridge must apply at least 24 hours in advance, 
and both sides must approve each name. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sign of Sarajevo's slow return to normal, a link to the outside 
world was reopened on a limited basis Wednesday. The road goes north through 
Serbian siege lines to a region controlled by the Muslim-led government and 
allied Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's looting of a U.N. relief convoy 50 miles north of the capital 
put a damper on rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs stripped a 10-truck U.N. convoy bound for the Muslim enclave of 
Maglaj of its 94-ton cargo of food and medicine, scattering or stranding its 
drivers, U.N. officials said. The trucks' two-way radios were also taken. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zagreb, Croatia, U.N. spokesman Peter Kessler called it "the most serious 
incident since last June, when Bosnian Serbs shelled a convoy for Maglaj."

MILITARY CHIEF DEFENDS TROOPS' ROLE AT MOSQUE; ISRAEL: GENERAL ALSO CONTRADICTS 
COMMANDERS WHO SAID SOLDIERS WERE NOT TO FIRE AT JEWS. HE SUGGESTS THEY 
'MISUNDERSTOOD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an angry, impassioned defense of his force's role in last month's mosque 
massacre in Hebron, Israel's military chief of staff told a judicial inquiry 
commission Wednesday that the military never expected a Jewish settler to open 
fire on Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gen. Ehud Barak -- Israel's highest-ranking military officer -- flatly 
denied earlier testimony from lower-ranking commanders that Israeli troops were 
under orders not to fire on Jews, even if they were shooting at Arabs. Barak 
suggested that the commanders had "misunderstood" orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "A massacre is a massacre is a massacre, and there is no need for a special 
order on the subject: If somebody is carrying out a massacre, he must be 
stopped," Barak said under oath before the five-member commission investigating 
the killing of about 30 Palestinian worshipers as they knelt in Friday prayers 
in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born Jewish settler who fired with 
an assault rifle into a room full of praying Muslims, Barak added, "We did not 
expect that a crazy person would come out of the settlers and carry out such an 
atrocity." 
</P>
<P>
 Barak's public testimony, broadcast live to the nation on Israeli radio and 
television, came in the wake of a series of disclosures to the commission that 
suggested chronic indiscipline and intelligence lapses by Israeli security 
forces at the sacred shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 His hourlong opening statement focused mainly on the difficult task 
confronting the Israeli Defense Forces in policing Arab territory that Israel 
has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, particularly since the onset of 
the intifada , or Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by the commission's lone Arab member -- the first time ever 
that an Arab justice was allowed to interrogate Israel's top military official 
-- Barak appeared to reinforce earlier testimony from the acting commander of 
Israeli forces in the West Bank that the massacre could have been prevented if 
the military's security plan at the site had been in full force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the security plan for the Cave, as it was drawn up, if it had 
been kept completely, it is very probable that it would have prevented the 
massacre . . . or at least greatly reduced the extent of the crime," the 
general stated. 
</P>
<P>
 But he deflected specific questions from Judge Abdel Rahman Zouabi, an Israeli 
Arab, that were based on earlier testimony from the acting West Bank commander, 
Maj. Gen. Danny Yatom, who told the commission that the massacre would not have 
happened if the full contingent of five security guards had shown up for work. 
Just one of those guards was on duty when Goldstein opened fire, Yatom has 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Zouabi also questioned Barak closely on Israeli military guidelines for the 
thousands of Jewish settlers who are permitted to carry arms in the occupied 
territories -- and why they were allowed to carry them into sacred places of 
worship. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're carrying weapons that they received legally for the purpose of 
self-defense," he replied, explaining that, in 1982, after an Arab murdered a 
settler, the military allowed Jews to carry weapons to the Cave of the 
Patriarchs; they then were to leave them with the guard at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, he said, those guidelines eroded, and it ultimately became 
standard practice to permit the settlers to enter the Cave with fully loaded 
assault rifles.

LEFTIST PARTY EXPANDS ELECTION FRAUD ALLEGATIONS IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leftist former guerrillas on Wednesday expanded their allegations of fraud 
stemming from last Sunday's elections, focusing now on a clumsy and unusually 
slow vote count that they claim is being distorted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballots have been voided during the count, monitors' access to the tallies has 
been restricted and ballot boxes have apparently been stuffed, members of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) claimed as election 
authorities continued to delay release of official results. 
</P>
<P>
 Other opposition parties -- including an up-and-coming evangelical party -- 
joined in many of the complaints, demanding closer scrutiny of the vote count. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary results have given the lead in the presidential race to the 
government's right-wing party. But a runoff with the left will be held next 
month because no candidate has received more than 50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake still are legislative seats, which are distributed based on 
percentages of votes and will determine whether the left is an effective 
opposition force or whether ruling conservatives have free rein. 
</P>
<P>
 Election authorities, already the target of harsh criticism because of the 
chaotic way in which they handled El Salvador's first postwar elections, 
abruptly cut off access to computerized tabulations of the vote on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That action further raised suspicions about whether the process is aboveboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although final results have not been released, the two top vote-getters, 
Armando Calderon Sol of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena) and 
Ruben Zamora, who heads a coalition that includes the FMLN, were summoned 
before the official Supreme Electoral Tribunal on Wednesday to begin planning 
the runoff. Both candidates demanded that the irregularities that tarnished 
Sunday's voting be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerson Martinez, a senior political strategist for the FMLN, said initial 
tabulations of the vote showed that many ballot boxes contained more votes than 
is legally possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the awkward Salvadoran system, no more than 400 voters can be assigned 
to each ballot box. Yet several boxes from the La Libertad and Usulutan 
departments had two and three times that number, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Miguel, one of El Salvador's largest cities, the left claimed that a 
group of Arena hard-liners absconded with 15 ballot boxes. And in a private 
school in the capital, 100 envelopes full of votes never delivered were 
discovered, a government prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arena spokesmen dismissed the problems and claimed the FMLN is looking for 
"ghosts" to compensate for its electoral losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The election was the first since U.N.-brokered peace accords ended El 
Salvador's 12-year civil war in 1992. Preliminary results have given Calderon 
Sol around 49% of the vote, with about 25.5% going to Zamora.

CRIME LEGISLATION; THE TARGET: ASSAULT GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation pending in Congress would ban the manufacture, sale and possession 
of the most deadly firearms legally available in the United States today: 
semi-automatic assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies have fought for years to outlaw the weapons, 
including AK-47 rifles, Uzi submachine guns and "street sweeper" shotguns -- 
all of which can inflict tremendous damage in a short time. Semi-automatic 
weapons fire as fast as the trigger can be pulled because no action is required 
between shots to load new cartridges into the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved anti-crime legislation in November, on a 56-43 vote, that 
includes provisions sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to ban 19 
types of assault weapons and any "copycat" models that have at least two 
characteristics similar to the original guns. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease concerns of hunters and sports gun enthusiasts, the legislation 
protects more than 670 specific hunting and recreational weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation is now on hold awaiting action in the House, where its 
prospects are uncertain because a significant number of lawmakers there are 
opposed and the gun lobby is pressing to convert others. 
</P>
<P>
 What would be legal 
</P>
<P>
 * Antique weapons, semi-automatic rifles or shotguns that cannot accept a 
detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semi-automatic firearms purchased before the law took effect 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 670 specific hunting and recreational weapons that rely on bolt, 
pump, lever or slide mechanisms to load each new cartridge into the firing 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 What would be banned 
</P>
<P>
 * 19 kinds of semi-automatic assault weapons made or sold after the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 * The manufacture, sale or possession of any drum, magazine or clip that feeds 
more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Feinstein's Hit List 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 19 semi-automatic weapons that would be banned under the 
legislation: 
</P>
<P>
 STEYR A.U.G. RIFLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Price: $895 
</P>
<P>
 * Designed for use from vehicles 
</P>
<P>
 * 30-round magazine, with 42-round magazine optional 
</P>
<P>
 * Can be converted to suit left- or right-handed shooters 
</P>
<P>
 STREET SWEEPER 
</P>
<P>
 * Price: $895 
</P>
<P>
 * Revolving cylinder shotgun fires 12 shotgun shells in less than 15 seconds 
</P>
<P>
 * Designed as police of military riot gun 
</P>
<P>
 * Light weight allows it to be fired with one hand like a pistol  
</P>
<P>
 GALIL 
</P>
<P>
 * Price: $1,000 
</P>
<P>
 * Used in mosque massacre that killed some 30 Palestinians 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * 50-round magazine is standard 
</P>
<P>
 AK-47 
</P>
<P>
 * Price: $500 
</P>
<P>
 * Most widely used assault weapon in the world 
</P>
<P>

THE TARGET: REPEAT OFFENDERS; WASHINGTON STATE VOTERS PIONEERED THE 
THREE-STRIKES IDEA, BUT A $151 ROBBERY CASE MAY TEST IF THEY GOT THE LAW THEY 
WANTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So how is "three strikes and you're out" faring in the state that pioneered 
the idea? 
</P>
<P>
 One way to judge is the case of Larry Fisher, a meat cutter, construction 
worker and small-time thug. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the sentencing law -- which was approved by 75% of the voters 
-- took effect in January, Fisher was arrested in the town of Everett, Wash. 
Police said he stole $151 from a sandwich store by pointing his finger inside 
his coat pocket and pretending he had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, convictions in robberies like this usually carry a prison 
sentence of 33 months to 43 months, with time off for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1986, Fisher was convicted of pushing his elderly grandfather to the 
ground and stealing $390. Strike 1. In 1988, he used the finger-in-the-coat 
hoax to steal $100 from a pizza parlor. Strike 2. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 11, Fisher goes on trial for what could be Strike 3, reportedly 
shocked to find himself facing life in prison without the possibility of parole 
-- as the law now mandates for three-time offenders. Prosecutors say there are 
eyewitnesses to the crime. His public defender says it will be a 
straightforward trial that will probably last just two days. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted Fisher, 35, will not be the first person sentenced under the law. 
But he would likely be the first to test its limits -- in court and in the 
public conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is the kind of person voters were thinking of," said Bill 
Jaquette, Fisher's attorney. "The law specifies 'the most serious offenses,' 
and I think most people envision things like murder and rape where people are 
injured." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the prosecutor's office is a little squeamish about the case, and 
officials say they wonder how higher courts will react on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one sheds a tear for three-time murderers," said Michael Magee, an 
assistant prosecutor in Snohomish County. "But (Fisher) has never hurt anybody. 
I can hear the appeals court saying (that) to equate this with aggravated 
murder, which before now was the only other crime to carry life without parole, 
is fundamentally unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the law say the civic terror created by the likes of Fisher 
is exactly what voters want to rid their streets of. The man has been in and 
out of trouble his entire adult life. His rap sheet also shows convictions for 
three burglaries, which are not counted as "strikes" under the statute, and 10 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel sorry for a guy who has had 15 bites out of the apple," Pierce 
County prosecutor John Ladenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 30 other states are following Washington's lead in one form or 
another. And Congress is moving ahead to add a three-strikes provision to 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, defense attorneys and police in Washington state have been 
besieged with calls from colleagues nationwide who wonder how the law is 
working here. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is too early to draw firm conclusions, lawyers and law enforcement 
officials say there are some anecdotal indications: 
</P>
<P>
 * Police in the Seattle area say that some felons are resisting arrest with 
greater force, fearing the effects of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors say that while plea-bargaining is much reduced in repeat felony 
cases, the court backlogs so far are not measurably worse. Only about a dozen 
three-strikes cases are pending statewide, but the effects on other felony 
cases are not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
 * So far the case of Fisher seems to be the exception. Most of the other 
criminals facing three-strikes convictions are unlikely to generate much 
sympathy -- men with histories of violence who have been convicted of such 
crimes as raping a girl in front of her mother, stabbing a couple with an ice 
pick and beating robbery victims senseless. 
</P>
<P>
 And one more thing: Those looking for trends should be aware that the 
three-strikes law is viewed among backers here as merely a step in their 
anti-crime crusade. Petitions already are circulating for their next 
initiative: "hard time for armed crime." It promises a year in prison for 
stealing guns and an extra five years for using one in a crime. 
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS EDGING AWAY FROM CLINTON; POLITICS: MOVE 
TO HOLD HEARINGS ON WHITEWATER SHOWS DISSATISFACTION WITH WHITE HOUSE, 
OBSERVERS SAY. PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY ON ISSUE CALLED 'NAIVE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The move by congressional Democrats toward hearings on Whitewater reflects 
growing dissatisfaction with White House management of the controversy and 
rising desire among many Democrats to distance themselves from President 
Clinton on the issue, legislators and party political consultants said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the drive for hearings demonstrates that senior legislative 
Democrats believe Republicans are making gains in their argument that Congress 
has been joining with the White House in an attempt to avoid inquiry. 
Legislative and White House officials said that they agree the decision also 
illuminates a long-standing unwillingness among many congressional Democrats to 
bind their fates too closely to Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it does a lot of good necessarily to be a 'friend of Bill' in 
some of these (congressional) districts," said one leading House moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats on Capitol Hill said that they have yet to see anything that belies 
the President's claim that he has not done anything wrong. But the decision to 
accept hearings illustrated their growing belief that the White House 
compounded its problems by resisting each new step toward disclosure -- from 
release of documents relating to the original investment by President Clinton 
and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton while Clinton was Arkansas governor, to 
appointment of a special prosecutor, to congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that the political strategy in the White House was not 
succeeding, that the story had legs of its own, and it was counterproductive to 
try and delay," said the House moderate. "Theirs was a naive approach." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, according to congressional Democrats, the enormous press and political 
focus on Whitewater has not seriously slowed down other legislative activities: 
Major education and crime bills are moving toward completion and in the House, 
Democrats believe they are making progress toward compromise on the 
Administration's massive health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Republican strategist William Kristol warned in a memo this week that 
the GOP's preoccupation with Whitewater "is keeping Republicans from being able 
to focus on health care at just the moment . . . when inattention to the issue 
is most dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 White House and congressional strategists admitted that they are uncertain 
whether agreeing to hearings has increased or diminished the prospect of 
Whitewater impeding other legislative initiatives. But it is clear that many 
Democrats believed resisting hearings might prove more disruptive than 
accepting them, with the Republicans hammering away. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats acknowledged that hearings represent a roll of the dice that could 
open unanticipated new questions and increase public attention on the 
controversy. "If we get into hearings, it can be dragged out for a year, which 
would be a real problem," said one senior House Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. is looking into allegations that Clinton 
may have benefited improperly from his association with James B. McDougal, 
owner of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and partner with the 
Clintons in the Whitewater Development Corp. Although Fiske's inquiry centers 
on Whitewater, he also is investigating the apparent suicide of White House 
Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster last July. His inquiry also encompasses the role 
played by Mrs. Clinton and her firm in representing Whitewater and Madison 
Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 In both houses, Republicans and Democrats have just begun negotiations over 
the timing and scope of the hearings and over whether they will be conducted by 
existing committees or panels formed specifically for that purpose. House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said in television interviews Wednesday that 
there is little prospect of joint House-Senate hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolutions passed in both houses call for hearings that would not 
interfere with Fiske's investigation. Congressional officials said that Fiske 
has assured them he intends to finish the Washington elements of his 
investigation sometime in April, which could open the door for hearings soon 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step could be rescheduling the recently delayed House Banking, 
Finance and Urban Affairs Committee oversight hearings on the Resolution Trust 
Corp. -- at which Republicans have said they intend to press questions about 
White House contact with investigators looking into the failure of Madison 
Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 "My calculus is that I would like to get this over as quickly as possible," 
especially with mid-term elections approaching in the fall, said a House 
leadership aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Administration officials from the President on down have insisted 
that Congress alone should decide whether to conduct hearings. But, privately, 
senior officials have resisted hearings, arguing that they would interfere with 
the special counsel's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, the Democratic leadership in both chambers had staunchly 
backed the Administration's position. But over the past week that opposition 
has crumbled, as greater numbers of rank-and-file Democrats have grown uneasy 
about resisting the GOP demands. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, said the senior House Democrat, the party leadership in both 
houses was forced to capitulate "because they were afraid of losing a vote on 
the floor" if Republicans offered an amendment demanding hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Democrats are not acting based on any sign that voters have 
focused on Whitewater or made any final judgments against the President on the 
controversy, political consultants and congressional aides said. "This isn't 
Watergate in the sense that people are riveted by it," said Democratic media 
consultant Joe Trippi. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats said they fear that prolonging the fight over hearings could 
eventually strengthen GOP and conservative charges that Congress was attempting 
to sweep Whitewater questions under the rug. 
</P>
<P>
 And while there was little evidence of voter anger over Whitewater, the 
issue's high profile has tended to reinforce public skepticism about 
Washington.

BUTTAFUOCO IS RELEASED AFTER 4 MONTHS IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Island auto mechanic Joey Buttafuoco, whose affair with 16-year-old Amy 
Fisher launched a media frenzy and three TV movies, was released from jail 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A slimmed-down Buttafuoco, who lost 30 pounds, left the Nassau County jail 
after serving four months and nine days of a six-month sentence for statutory 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a white T-shirt and dark pants, Buttafuoco, 38, told a group of 
reporters: "What can I say? I did my time. I'm going home to my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Buttafuoco admitted that he had sex with Fisher when she was 16, a year below 
the legal age of consent in New York. Fisher confronted his wife, Mary Jo 
Buttafuoco, at the couple's home and shot her in the head in September, 1992. 
Fisher, who is serving a 5- to 15-year sentence at an Upstate New York prison, 
said it was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Buttafuoco put out dozens of yellow ribbons on a tree in the front yard 
for her husband's return Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttafuoco gave an exclusive interview Wednesday to "A Current Affair," for 
which he reportedly earned $100,000. And tonight he is scheduled to attend a 
"Get Out of Jail, Joey" party for 400 guests, including newly announced 
gubernatorial candidate Howard Stern.

CLINTON AIDE IS PENALIZED IN TAX DISPUTE; WHITE HOUSE: ASSOCIATE COUNSEL 
WILLIAM H. KENNEDY III IS RELIEVED OF SOME DUTIES. HE HAD FAILED TO PAY SOCIAL 
SECURITY LEVIES FOR A NANNY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 White House Associate Counsel William H. Kennedy III was stripped of two areas 
of responsibility Wednesday because of disclosures that he failed to pay Social 
Security taxes for a nanny despite warnings from his superiors, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty and incoming Special Counsel 
Lloyd N. Cutler decided to relieve Kennedy of the duties rather than fire him. 
They did so in part because he is going through a difficult divorce and they 
did not want to add to his personal problems or to the Administration's 
embarrassment over the recent departure of a number of top aides, a senior 
White House official said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy will no longer be in charge of reviewing tax-compliance matters or 
security clearances for White House officials because both duties involve 
background checks of government personnel. Such checks include whether 
employees paid taxes for household workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the White House indicated that President Clinton is likely to 
revise downward his estimate of losses that he and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton suffered in the failed Whitewater Development Corp. land deal in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House aide said there is "a good possibility" that Clinton 
would acknowledge at a news conference today that a review of the investment in 
the real estate deal has found that the First Family lost considerably less 
money than previously claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons, relying on a partial audit of the Whitewater project conducted 
in early 1992 by Denver attorney James Lyons, have said they lost $68,900 on 
the vacation property deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clintons' current personal lawyer, David Kendall, has concluded after 
his own review that the Clintons lost less than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a measurable loss," the White House aide said, but not as much as 
previously thought. He said it is not yet known whether the Clintons owe 
additional taxes because they over-deducted for Whitewater interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide also said Clinton is prepared to release in the near future his tax 
returns for 1978 and 1979, which have never been made public. 
</P>
<P>
 They are of interest because they would reflect the size of the Clintons' 
initial investment in the Whitewater project, which the Clintons' owned with 
Arkansas businessman James B. McDougal during those two years. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal has estimated the Clintons' losses in Whitewater at $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of today's press conference was prompted in part by the Clintons' 
plans to leave Washington on Friday for a six-day Easter vacation in Texas and 
California. The President did not want to leave town with the appearance that 
he was ducking questions about the Whitewater deal, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. is looking into allegations 
that the Clintons may have benefited improperly from their association with 
McDougal, who owned the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the special counsel's inquiry centers on the Whitewater controversy, 
Fiske is also investigating the apparent suicide of Deputy White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster last July and the role played by Hillary Clinton and the Rose 
Law Firm, where she was a partner, in representing Whitewater Development and 
Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has answered questions on the Whitewater case at two extended 
press conferences during the last two weeks, but new issues, some with only 
tangential relationships to the scandal, seem to arise every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's problems are a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other duties, Kennedy was responsible for ensuring the compliance of 
Administration officials with tax laws relating to household help. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was a partner of Hillary Clinton at the Rose Law Firm. Two other 
lawyers of the firm have also served in the Administration, Foster, who was 
Kennedy's boss, and Webster Hubbell who resigned earlier this month from the 
No. 3 job at the Justice Department in order to deal with a billing dispute 
with his former partners. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said Tuesday that Kennedy paid $1,352.52 in back taxes 
and penalties before starting work in February, 1993. The money was for Social 
Security taxes owed for the employment of a nanny for his children in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment was made under his wife's former married name, but Kennedy denied 
that he did so to conceal the late payment from the IRS or the FBI, which was 
conducting a background check on him in connection with his new White House 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, officials conceded that Kennedy did not pay his 1991 taxes for 
the nanny until this month. Kennedy told associates that he feared the 
non-payment would become public in the record of his divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He owed about $800 in back taxes (for 1991)," said White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers. "He should have paid them. He has now paid them." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his financial disclosure form, Kennedy was paid $587,000 in 1992 
by the Rose Law Firm, where he was managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said Kennedy had been told last year by Foster and Foster's boss, 
departing White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, as well as by Myers herself, 
that he should make good on any back taxes owed for household help.

N. CAROLINA AF BASE MIDAIR CRASH KILLS 16; DISASTER: ANOTHER 82 ARE INJURED 
AFTER FIGHTER JET COLLIDES WITH CARGO PLANE AS BOTH ARE LANDING. DEBRIS SKIDS 
INTO PARATROOPERS PREPARING FOR EXERCISES. 
</P>

<P>
 Sixteen people were killed and 82 injured Wednesday when an Air Force fighter 
jet collided with a military cargo plane above Pope Air Force Base here and 
debris from the wreckage careened into a transport plane on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials said the two pilots aboard the F-16D fighter jet ejected 
safely, and the C-130 cargo plane was able to land safely with five crew 
members aboard. But the remains of the unmanned fighter skidded into a staging 
area where paratroopers were preparing for exercises and ignited the fuel tanks 
of a C-141 transport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear what caused the midair collision, which was one 
of the worst military air accidents in recent years. The Air Force said it was 
convening a special board to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-16D and the C-130 were both practicing landings when they collided, 
Brig. Gen. Bobby Floyd said. The C-130, a propeller-powered aircraft, had 
completed its training exercise with paratroopers and was returning to Pope 
nearly empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some unknown reason, they both appeared at the same time at the same 
place," Floyd said. "Obviously, there was a failure to communicate. Both pilots 
thought they were cleared to land." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said after the fighter pilots ejected, the F-16 exploded and 
crashed, sending debris flying in all directions, and then skidded past several 
parked transport planes into the paratroop staging area. The crash occurred at 
about 2:30 p.m. EST. The fire on the ground took almost a half hour to 
extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the debris hit the C-141, whose crew was preparing for a training 
flight for Army paratroopers from adjacent Ft. Bragg. Most of the victims were 
thought to have been hit by flying debris. Some were in a so-called pack shed 
near the Tarmac where paratroopers gather before boarding planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the injuries consisted of burns and broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure how badly I was hurt," an unidentified soldier told WTVD-TV. "I 
rolled to make sure I wasn't on fire or anything. It was the same with other 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very horrible," he said. "You can't really explain it. I can't 
believe it actually happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Air base officials said 62 of the 82 men who were injured were flown to nearby 
Womack Army Medical Center at Ft. Bragg or civilian hospitals in the area. The 
remaining 20 were treated by medics at the scene and released. Names of the 
dead were not released Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the injured were taken to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center in 
Fayetteville, hospital spokesman Clinton Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every unit on Ft. Bragg had someone in that area at that time," said Sgt. 1st 
Class Skip Richey. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials said the F-16D was assigned to the 74th Fighter Squadron 
and the C-130 to the 2nd Airlift Squadron, both based at Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-141 was part of the 438th Airlift Wing at McGuire Air Force Base, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton expressed his sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am deeply saddened to learn of the tragic air collision at Pope Air Force 
Base in North Carolina and the resultant loss of life and injuries," Clinton 
said in a statement issued by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tragedy is a reminder that all those who serve in the military at home 
and abroad put their lives at risk in the service of their nation and deserve 
the thanks of all Americans for doing so," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William Perry, flying home from an eight-day trip to the 
former Soviet Union, issued a statement offering "profound sympathies and 
condolences to the families of those who have been killed or injured." 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll surpasses that from a November, 1992, midair collision of two 
Air Force C-141 transports above Montana that killed 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Pine reported from Washington and Harrison from North Carolina. The Associated 
Press also contributed to this story.

HOUSE PICKS OUTSPOKEN LIBERAL, OBEY, TO HEAD POWERFUL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passing over a lawmaker with more seniority, House Democrats Wednesday elected 
an outspoken liberal activist, Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, to be acting 
chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of Obey, 55, over 74-year-old Rep. Neal Smith of Iowa by a vote of 
152 to 106 represents the rise of a new generation of leadership on a 
tradition-bound panel that has been presided over by octogenarians in recent 
years. Obey's supporters said that they believe he will be more aggressive in 
dealing with Republicans, while Smith's backers argued that he deserved the 
post because of his years on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Obey will take over in the absence of Chairman William H. Natcher of Kentucky, 
84, who has been hospitalized for most of the past month for treatment of a 
congestive heart ailment. If, as expected, Natcher does not resume his duties 
again this year, Obey would be an odds-on favorite to succeed him in one of the 
most influential jobs in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Obey declined to discuss policy issues Wednesday, but House sources familiar 
with his views said that he would work to reduce funds allocated to the 
Pentagon and defense procurement and channel more resources to job training and 
economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 This would pit him and his allies against Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), 
chairman of the panel's defense subcommittee, who often is regarded as the 
chief advocate for the armed forces in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-year-old Murtha was reported to be interested in becoming chairman of 
the full Appropriations panel himself someday. He was a strong supporter of 
Smith during the monthlong intraparty debate over who would replace Natcher on 
a temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Obey, who is two notches lower on the seniority ladder than Smith, has won 
respect from both sides of the aisle for managing the foreign aid 
appropriations bill, one of the most contentious measures taken up in the House 
each year. The tart-tongued Obey also is expected to be a point man for the 
Democrats in opposing House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is in line 
to become the GOP leader in the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has played an insider's role for most of his 35 years in the House, 
said that the lopsided outcome apparently reflected the wishes of a younger and 
more diverse Democratic caucus. About half of the Democrats in the chamber have 
been elected since the 1988 election.

 President Clinton's campaign to overhaul the nation's health care system made 
its first tangible step forward in Congress Wednesday, when a House 
subcommittee narrowly approved a bill that embraces the President's goal of 
assuring every American a broad package of medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've given the American people reason to believe that Congress can and will 
act," Ways and Means health subcommittee Chairman Pete Stark (D-Hayward) said 
after his panel had approved the legislation on a 6-5 vote, largely along party 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage came after more than two weeks of acrimonious debate, which provided a 
foretaste of the bitter partisan struggles to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have lost this particular battle but I assure you we have not lost the 
war," warned Rep. Bill Thomas of Bakersfield, the subcommittee's ranking 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the subcommittee measure would meet Clinton's bottom-line demand for 
universal coverage, it would do it in ways that differ markedly from the plan 
that the Administration submitted to Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Clinton's proposal, the bill drafted by Stark would require every 
employer to contribute up to 80% of the costs of their workers' health 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the panel rejected the Clinton plan's elaborate and untested 
bureaucratic structure under which most Americans would obtain their coverage 
through government-organized purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Stark plan contains an expanded Medicare program to cover people 
who are not insured through the workplace or private health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark also sought to produce a less costly plan by scaling back the benefits 
that Clinton proposed. The basic package in the subcommittee bill includes 
higher deductibles and unlimited out-of-pocket costs. It does not include such 
costly benefits as long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes, the White House counted the subcommittee vote as a 
victory. "The Administration commends the subcommittee members and Chairman 
Stark for their leadership," spokeswoman Lorrie McHugh said. "Their diligent 
work has moved the process forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the passage of the subcommittee bill, Republicans insisted that 
Clinton's bill also be put to a vote, in a symbolic move aimed at embarrassing 
the White House. With Democrats voting "present," it failed, 4 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no small irony in the fact that Stark was the driving force behind 
the Administration's first health care victory in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the White House began its health effort more than a year ago, the 
Hayward Democrat has been one of its most persistent and vocal critics within 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the larger battle he proved a crucial ally. Stark shares the 
Administration's basic aim of assuring coverage for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the fight moves to the full committee, where the subcommittee legislation 
appears certain to undergo significant change -- although probably not enough 
to win any GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the subcommittee completed its work, Ways and Means Chairman Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) also served notice that he plans to ignore the tax 
provisions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Those provisions proved the final hurdle for Stark as he sought to cobble 
together the six votes that he needed. He was forced to scuttle his proposed 
0.8% payroll tax in favor of additional spending cuts and taxes that are not as 
broadly based. 
</P>
<P>
 One feature that remains in the subcommittee bill, however, is a 
$1.25-increase in the federal tax on each pack of cigarettes, 50 cents higher 
than Clinton had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, only Rep. Michael A. Andrews (D-Tex.) defected from party ranks to 
oppose the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 While the subcommittee slogged toward final passage, the President and the 
First Lady pressed their campaign to drum up public support, courting doctors 
and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to his proposal to create mandatory insurance-purchasing alliances, 
which many observers now consider dead, Clinton told 450 California Medical 
Assn. delegates meeting in Anaheim via satellite hookup: "I think it'll all be 
debated in the Congress and I'm certainly flexible on it."

PRESIDENT JOINS FAST TO CALL ATTENTION TO WORLD HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton joined Rep. Tony P. Hall (D-Ohio) and 14 other House members 
Wednesday in a fast designed to call attention to world hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said Clinton agreed to participate during a meeting in the Oval 
Office."He said: 'Look, we haven't had lunch yet. We'll just fast with you the 
rest of the day,' " Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore nodded in assent but did not make a verbal commitment 
to join in the fast, Hall said. Gore's office later said the vice president was 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vice president had lunch with the President, but all they had was water," 
said Lorraine Voles of Gore's office. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers told reporters that Clinton promised 
he "would not eat any meals" Wednesday. She said he was drinking water and Diet 
Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 The President apparently got an early start on his fast. During the morning, 
he stopped by the Old Ebbitt Grill, a landmark restaurant near the White House, 
to see some fellow Arkansans, but had nothing to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, who has long sought to focus attention on the world's hunger problem, 
went on a 22-day fast last year after Congress, in a budget move, cut off funds 
for the Select Committee on Hunger, which he headed, and three other panels 
that handled little legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall promptly organized the Congressional Hunger Caucus, composed of 
dues-paying members, and the Hunger Center, a nonprofit organization supported 
by private donations. He said this year's fast, in which members pledged to go 
without food for one to three days, "is to remind us that hunger remains a very 
serious problem and that the solution remains in our hands."

 South Korea placed its armed forces on special alert as the north warned that 
U.S. deployment of antimissile batteries in the south will push the peninsula 
to the brink of war. In another move likely to inflame the situation, the south 
said that this year's joint military exercises with U.S. forces will involve 
the Patriot missiles.

 The International Court of Justice said that Yugoslavia has started 
proceedings against NATO, accusing members of breaching the U.N. Charter by 
threatening to use force in Bosnia-Herzegovina without Security Council 
authorization. The court said in a statement that Yugoslavia, now made up of 
Serbia and Montenegro, has filed suit against NATO's member states for issuing 
an ultimatum threatening to bomb Serbian artillery encircling Sarajevo. 
Yugoslavia says the ultimatum breached U.N. rules because the threat of force 
had not been authorized by the Security Council.

<P>
 Kevin Franklin's college basketball career had been marked by tragedy and 
turmoil, but it ended gloriously Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the final 20 seconds of the NAIA Division I championship game, won by 
Franklin's Oklahoma City University over Life College, were among the sweetest 
imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Taft High standout scored a game-high 30 points in 37 minutes to 
lead Oklahoma City to a 99-81 victory over Life, a school in Marietta, Ga. 
Franklin, 25, sat on the bench next to Coach Win Case, 30, and gave Case an 
affectionate punch on the arm. Case wrapped his arm around Franklin and kissed 
him on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, during a timeout, Case covered his face with his hands and 
started to weep. Franklin embraced Case and kissed him on the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange was interrupted only when guard Elijah Maxey emptied a container 
of water on Case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great feeling," Franklin said. "It was one of those situations that 
worked out for me. I was happy for myself, the team and Coach Case." 
</P>
<P>
 Case had given Franklin a second chance two years ago after Franklin had left 
Nevada and taken a two-year hiatus from college. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin had become disillusioned after the death of his mother, Grady 
Franklin, in January, 1990. But 18 months later, Franklin was introduced to 
Case by relatives who live in Oklahoma City and the two hit it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin rewarded Case's confidence in him by helping the young coach win a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin made the winning shot in an 86-85 victory over rival Oklahoma Baptist 
in the semifinals, finishing with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final, Franklin made 14 of 22 shots from the field and had six rebounds 
and eight assists. He was named the tournament's most valuable player, and for 
the second consecutive season he was accorded first-team, NAIA All-American 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, big things had been expected of Franklin since he led the state in 
scoring his senior season at Taft, averaging 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin is without question the best player I ever coached or saw," Taft Coach 
Jim Woodard said. "Dedan Thomas (of Nevada Las Vegas) was tougher, but Kevin 
was the most talented." 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been difficult to argue after Franklin scored 40 points, 37 in 
the second half, and hit the winning shot for Nevada in a 102-100 victory at 
Eastern Washington on Jan. 20, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the occasion was bittersweet. That was the night Franklin's mother died, 
and he never played another game for the Wolf Pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard had trouble keeping track of Franklin from that point until Saturday, 
when he watched on television as the 6-foot-5 guard swished a twisting, 
off-balance jump shot with 13 seconds left to lift the Chiefs into the title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Franklin of the winning shot: "It was a designed play for me, and I 
figured that was the best look I was going to get." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin's heroics and his final moments with Case were shown on a national 
cable telecast while millions of viewers were tuned to another network for the 
Academy Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the highlight right now," Franklin said. "This beats the Eastern 
Washington game." 
</P>
<P>

 Checking the fax: Former Hueneme High player Mike Spears helped surging 
Westmont reach the second round of the NAIA championships. The Warriors lost to 
eventual finalist Life College. The 6-6 senior, who was selected to the 
All-Golden State Athletic Conference team, had a game-high 18 points in a 75-71 
victory over Salem-Teikyo of West Virginia. He had 12 points and nine rebounds 
in an 85-65 loss to Life. Westmont finished 19-13. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, freshman Stacy Kleiner (Taft) has made a sudden impact with 
Nevada Las Vegas. His .341 batting average is second highest on the team. His 
seven doubles, 25 runs and 14 walks are team highs. He has 10 multiple-hit 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach State, freshman first baseman Jeff Tagliaferri (Kennedy) is 
batting .385 with 15 runs batted in after 57 at-bats. Teammate Tim Falsken 
(Westlake) has struggled. The third baseman is batting .214 but his home run in 
the top of the ninth inning Monday tied the score in an eventual 5-4 victory 
over Cal State Northridge.

NO. 99 GETS GOAL NO. 802 -- NOW HE'S NO. 1 ON LIST; HOCKEY: THE GREAT ONE 
PASSES GORDIE HOWE IN THE SECOND PERIOD, BUT THE KINGS LOSE AGAIN, 6-3. 
</P>

 There are so many numbers that make up the Kings' Wayne Gretzky -- the number 
on his jersey, 99, his four Stanley Cup championship rings, his 92-goal season 
in 1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
 His world made room for a one new magical number on Wednesday night as the 
game's greatest playmaker became its greatest all-time goal scorer. Gretzky 
glided once more into the rarefied air of the sporting world's all-time greats, 
moving past legend Gordie Howe with his 802nd goal in the Kings' 6-3 loss to 
the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The anxious weeks of waiting gave way to sweet emotion at 14:47 of the second 
period on the power play when Gretzky took a cross-ice pass from defensman 
Marty McSorley and put the puck into virtually an empty net with a shot from 
the base of the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver goaltender Kirk McLean had come out to play the angle on McSorley 
after Luc Robitaille started the play with a drop pass just inside the blue 
line to Gretzky. Gretzky found McSorley and headed for the net. McSorley was 
patient and perfectly timed the pass and waited until he skated past the middle 
of the right circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky put his own unique signature on the historic goal, jamming it into the 
net out of the air before the puck dropped to the ice. The sellout crowd of 
16,005 at the Forum erupted, Gretzky threw his arms in the air and the first 
player to hug him was Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographers mobbed Gretzky and there was a 15-minute on-ice ceremony with 
Gretzky's parents, Walter and Phyllis, his wife Janet as well as King ownder 
Bruce McNall and NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 A jubliant Gretzky took the microphone, saying: "I've played here six years 
and I hope I play here another six." 
</P>
<P>
 He had said that he wanted to get No. 802 in front of King fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out almost perfectly for Gretzky. His record 1,851st point -- also 
surpassing Howe -- came on Oct. 15, 1989, in Edmonton, where he started his NHL 
career and won four Stanley Cups before being traded to the Kings in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I've said many times, to me, this is the greatest game in the world," 
Gretzky said. "Six years ago, they said California wasn't a great hockey area. 
In six years, we have a pretty strong franchise and we've shown the rest of 
North America they're wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 His other wish -- that Jari Kurri be involved in the goal -- did not come 
true. Kurri was on the ice, but the assists went to McSorley and Robitaille. 
McSorley played with Gretzky in Edmonton also and has assisted on 17 of the 802 
and Robitaille has assisted on 42. Kurri has assisted on more of Gretzky's 
goals than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley was asked on Tuesday about the possibility of being involved in NHL 
history. "I just count my blessing that I've been able to play with him for 
eight-plus years." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky surpassed Howe in his 15th NHL season. It took Howe 26 seasons to 
score 801 goals. And actually it's more like 14 1/2 seasons for Gretzky, who 
missed the first 39 games of last season and scored 16 goals. Gretzky either 
holds or shares 62 NHL scoring records. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gretzky, there was a certain symmetry since he scored his first NHL goal 
against the Canucks and goaltender Glen Hanlon in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 But two disappointing aspects of the historic night provided sort of an 
anticlimatic air for Gretzky and the Kings. One was the absence of Howe. Howe, 
who had followed Gretzky during the chase of his point record, declined to 
participate in this record pursuit and made some slightly bitter comments, 
saying his World Hockey Assn. goals should be counted and the goals from both 
leagues should be combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe had said he wouldn't follow Gretzky this time and didn't change his mind. 
However, he will be on hand for a special ceremony honoring Gretzky before the 
next game at the Forum on Wednesday against the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The other downside was the final score. Gretzky's goal had pulled the Kings to 
a 2-2 tie, but they quickly gave up another goal after the ceremony when Cliff 
Ronning scored at 15:40 of the second period to make it 3-2. The Canucks were 
never threatened, outshooting the Kings, 50-37. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings (24-38-11) remain tied with Anaheim in ninth place in the Western 
Conference, six points behind the San Jose Sharks for the final playoff spot.

THERE'S SYMPATHY, BUT NO ONE RUSHES TO PFUND'S DEFENSE 
</P>

 Nice guy, that Randy Pfund. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson, who has replaced Pfund as the Lakers' coach, and General 
Manager Jerry West agreed there's probably not a more pleasant or diligent 
person in basketball than Pfund. Michael Cooper, who will move from the front 
office to a place beside Johnson as an assistant coach, even offered Pfund 
sympathy on losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always had an obstacle in his way," Cooper said. "He never had an 
opportunity to work with a full ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
 But being a nice guy didn't win him any games, leading them to a 
less-than-glowing assessment of Pfund's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 While they avoided personal criticism and said they respect his efforts, the 
principals at Wednesday's Forum news conference cited several qualities they 
felt Pfund did not supply during his 151-game term. Intensity in games and 
practices, consistency, solid defensive strategy and the respect given a former 
player were the missing links, they said, links they hope Johnson can forge. 
</P>
<P>
 West was irked by the team's erratic defense. Before Wednesday's game at 
Dallas, the Lakers had given up an average of 103.9 points per game, the 
sixth-highest total in the NBA and 3.9 points more than they had scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're defensively coordinated, you can compete," West said. "All year 
long our biggest concern, especially with our younger players, was that at 
times we just did not defend well." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper called the defense "very, very lacking." He added: "Randy's philosophy 
was to put up 100 points and to be a fast-break team. The fans of L.A. enjoy 
that (from the championship era). Little do the fans know our fast breaks were 
predicated off good defense, rebounds and steals. All of that put Showtime into 
effect. Under the freedom of Earvin, we will work a little more on defense, 
transition and a half-court style." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson: "I just think what we have here a lot of young guys, we have to 
be aggressive. Randy was different in his approach, and you'll see me different 
from Randy. We've got to pick people up (defensively). We've got to make them 
use up the clock. We're not big and strong. We've got to get out on them and be 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the Orlando game (a 97-91 victory Sunday). When we've been 
aggressive, we've usually won those games. We didn't do it on a consistent 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who in January criticized players' acceptance of losing and lack of 
pride, said he will make practices tougher and mold a team that is more 
forceful on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion of Randy is very high because I know Randy personally. I've been 
through a lot of wars with Randy. Randy is a good guy," Johnson said of Pfund, 
who was a Laker assistant for seven years. "I'm not going to sit here and bash 
him. Maybe he was just in the wrong situation at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 Buss was out of town and not available for comment. Pfund could not be reached 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper sidestepped the question of whether the players respected Pfund, who 
never played in the NBA. "You're supposed to have respect for your head coaches 
and it looked like they did," Cooper said. "I wasn't around on a daily basis. 
But Earvin will definitely warrant respect because he's been there. He's a 
legend." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Kurt Rambis said of Pfund: "Who's to know what a fair shake is? Did they 
let him stick around too long or did they cut him short by two years? No one 
will ever know the answer to that question. You just know he felt strongly 
about the ballclub, he liked the players. He really felt that at this point in 
time we were coming around as a young ballclub starting to do the things we'd 
talked all season about doing." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Pfund will be replaced by the player whose retirement on the eve of the 
1992-93 season ruined the plans he had created for his first coaching season. 
West acknowledged that Pfund was a victim of misfortune and that Pfund's 
efforts were undermined this season by injuries to Doug Christie, Anthony 
Peeler and Sam Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy Pfund is one of the great people I've met. I'll say that until my dying 
day," West said. "I think he did a nice job under difficult circumstances."

THE FUTURE MIGHT BE NOW FOR MAGIC; LAKERS: COACHING DEBUT IS MORE LIKE A TRYOUT 
TO SEE IF HE WILL LIKE THE JOB ENOUGH TO DO IT NEXT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Magic Johnson, a man who needs no introduction, was officially introduced as 
the Lakers' new coach on Wednesday, a job owner Jerry Buss wanted him to take 
for two years but might ultimately last only 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at the same spot where he announced his retirement 2 1/2 years ago 
after testing HIV-positive and later his aborted comeback attempt, Johnson said 
he might only be the interim coach after Randy Pfund was fired. What happens 
between Sunday against Milwaukee at the Forum in his debut and the season 
finale exactly four weeks later, assuming the Lakers' longshot playoff hopes 
don't materialize, will determine whether he returns for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be back with the Laker family, for however long it's going to 
be," he said at a packed news conference at the Forum. "I know it's for about a 
month, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something that I'm doing because Dr. Buss asked me would I do it. I 
told him I would do it for him, and that's the reason I'm doing it. . . . I'm 
looking forward to the challenge, because, basically, that's what it is, a new 
challenge. I will put forth 125% effort, just like I did when I was a player, 
and we'll see what it's all about from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers bristled at the notion that the move, first announced Tuesday 
night, was made to boost lagging interest as the team heads to the lottery for 
the first time. That wouldn't make sense from an economic point of view, they 
say, because Johnson can't sell enough tickets in the remaining 10 home games 
to make much of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 What does make sense, Buss and General Manager Jerry West said, is all about 
basketball. Maybe a little logic, too. Pfund was going to be fired after the 
season anyway, so why not let Johnson take the team for a test drive and see if 
he likes the feel as a fledgling coach as much as a superstar point guard? If 
so, the coaching search ends immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided in the last few weeks that next year I would like to have a new 
coach," Buss said. "Since that was the case, by coaching the rest of the year I 
felt Earvin could gain some invaluable experience and at the same time find out 
whether it is something he'll want to do long range." 
</P>
<P>
 Said West: "Jerry Buss had made that decision, that we were going to have a 
coaching change. This will give Earvin a chance over the next month to see if 
this is something he would have a future with and enjoy, get his feet wet, get 
to know some of our younger players and hope to impart some of the things he 
has learned as a basketball player. And we really feel, particularly with our 
young players, that this will be a very positive thing for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not a business decision, not at all. Period. This is not a 
sideshow. This is something we hope that will help our ballclub and 
particularly our younger players." 
</P>
<P>
 And if Magic does not continue past this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes little or no difference because it gives him an opportunity to see 
if it's something he would really want to continue," West said. "He has no 
plans at this point in time, but next year, after he's going through it, it 
might be something that really whets his appetite, a chance for him to 
participate in a game that he loves. If not, it gives us an opportunity to go 
out and look for someone that we would want to coach our team for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 So Pfund apparently became expendable within the last two weeks, after Buss, 
who over the previous two years had talked with Johnson in a conversational 
sense about taking over, turned the talks into an actual offer. What made the 
timing so strange, in addition to it being late in a season when the Lakers 
didn't expect to make the playoffs anyway, was that they had won six of the 
final eight games under Pfund and were improving on defense, the area of most 
criticism from management. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest players in basketball history, whose talent can only be 
rivaled by his popularity in Los Angeles during the Showtime era of the 1980s 
that produced five NBA titles, Johnson will undoubtedly be questioned about his 
health as much as his coaching abilities at every stop. Wednesday, noting he 
has played regularly while heading a barnstorming team that has toured the 
world, the league's all-time assist leader said he does not have AIDS and is 
fit to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 For how long appears to be the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think about next season until I'm there," he said. "Give me a shot at 
Saturday (at the opening practice) first. Let me just concentrate on that right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 What issues will he analyze in deciding whether to come back? 
</P>
<P>
 "Did the team improve, both as a team and individuals? Did I enjoy myself? Is 
it something that I really want to put my time effort into? Because it takes a 
lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Johnson, 34, easily becomes the NBA's highest-paid coach. 
Sort of. He signed no coaching contract, but continues to draw on the playing 
contract that pays him $2.5 million this season and $14.6 million for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 He has, however, given up or delayed income to become the 11th head coach in 
Los Angeles Laker history because commercials, appearances and speaking 
engagements had to be canceled or rescheduled. Lon Rosen, his agent, estimates 
those to be "in excess" of $500,000, but says Johnson will keep a charity 
commitment to watch his high school all-star game April 9 in suburban Detroit. 
The Lakers play at Portland that night, so Bill Bertka, the interim coach 
Wednesday at Dallas and tonight at Houston, will take over again. Magic Johnson

JIM MURRAY: CHALLENGE FOR MAGIC? IT'S PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thing about Magic Johnson is, he's not a sideline guy, not a weekend 
anything. Magic has to be in the action. Magic wants the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't sit in the seats munching popcorn while those dim bulbs out on the 
court miss the open man, blow the layup, completely miss the point on defense. 
Magic has taken every team he has ever been on, shaped it up, told everybody 
where to be on the floor, then said, "OK, I'll take it from here." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think anyone had the instinctive feel for the game of basketball Magic 
had -- not Bird, not Jordan, Cousy, Oscar Robertson. Not anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 He could do whatever was called for. And he loved the spotlight. That was 
important. A lot of people with a positive genius for the game couldn't take 
the hoopla it came packaged in. They whined about their privacy. They simply 
thought the game had always been there, the money came from the tooth fairy. 
They didn't have to do anything to promote it; that had already been done for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Magic. Magic brought the most important elements to the Lakers when he 
came -- a broad smile and a love of the action. Magic couldn't wait to get to 
the arena, and he couldn't bear to leave afterward. Magic was the veteran 
reporters' best friend -- and also to the newest kid on the beat. He stayed 
until you ran out of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers were a joyless team when Magic joined them, a dour but talented 
bunch that played basketball as if it were laying bricks -- or doing windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic would have none of that. A basketball game became Showtime, a headliner 
act, a happening. Hollywood wouldn't miss the Magic shows. The remarkable thing 
was, nobody got jealous. Because Magic was a generous player. He scored only 
when nobody else was open. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to remember now, but basketball was a hard sell, in a struggle for 
the entertainment dollar in those days. It was almost an acquired taste. It 
didn't always get the front sports page. 
</P>
<P>
 It did when Magic came. I don't know of anyone who did more to put his sport 
up on a rung with all the others. The nickname, of course, helped. But so did 
the smile. So did the attitude. So did the talent. I think one of the greatest 
sights and sounds in any sport was Magic coming up the floor with the ball in a 
tie game in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic was not only a star, he was a salesman. When the so-called Dream Team 
hit the Olympics in Barcelona, the world press didn't get to see much of Air 
Jordan, or Mailman Malone, or Larry Bird, or even Charles Barkley. But they saw 
Magic Johnson at every news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 So now he's a coach. The world is wondering if he'll have the patience. After 
all, this is not a Dream Team he has on the floor at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the truisms of sport is that great athletes do not often make great 
mentors. The game came too easily for them. You get a picture of a Babe Ruth 
saying to a kid going to the plate, "Why don't you go up there and hit a home 
run, kid? That's what I'd do here." Or Sammy Baugh unable to understand why his 
quarterback doesn't simply get the ball to that guy open in the end zone like 
he would. 
</P>
<P>
 For a coach, you need a guy who will also know when to bunt. Or when to bring 
the defense in with a running play. A guy who won't sit around and wait for the 
three-run homer or the 80-yard bomb, who knows there are .230 hitters and 
pass-droppers. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Magic's challenge. Will the Smile fade? The eyes lose their 
twinkle? Will he find out why Bob Knight throws chairs? 
</P>
<P>
 But Magic Johnson already took a team that was in comparative disarray when he 
came on it and turned it into an NBA champion without raising his voice. If 
there is one thing you have to say about Magic Johnson, it is he knows how to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 My notion is, basketball is lucky he wants to coach. Basketball has always 
been lucky he wanted the spotlight. Basketball has enough no-comment guys. 
</P>
<P>
 In his news conference, Magic made it clear he is returning because he craves 
the action. "I'm a basketball junkie," he said. "I'm here every night anyway. 
My wife says I might as well coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Already paid millions a year by the Lakers under an existing contract, he will 
coach for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic is back where he wants to be. On a bench, on a court, in front of the 
crowd. Center stage. On the high wire. Magic was never a captive of his talent, 
thrust by it into situations he didn't want to be. Magic, like the great ones 
-- Ruth, Pete Rose, Muhammad Ali, Bob Hope, Arnold Palmer -- knows he belongs 
to the world. And is glad of it. Magic is not a rocking-chair or an 
18-holes-of-golf-a-day guy. Not even the most dreaded disease of our time could 
make him go sit in a corner, feel sorry for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 There are baskets to be made, fast breaks to be run, shots to be blocked. 
Magic wants to go out with flags flying, bands playing, crowds cheering. He has 
always loved every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he make a great coach? Basketball sincerely hopes so. So do I.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; IT'S WHERE THEY MIGHT BE HEADED 
THAT MATTERS MOST TO THIS GROUP; WEST REGIONAL: MISSOURI, ARIZONA, LOUISVILLE 
AND SYRACUSE GATHER AT SPORTS ARENA WITH HOPES OF MOVING ON TO FINAL FOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The best team in the West? Well, it's either the team from New York, the one 
from Missouri, the one from Kentucky or the one that is actually from the West, 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse, Missouri, Louisville and Arizona not only know where they're from, 
but they are also quite aware of where one of them is headed after the West 
Regional, which continues with the semifinals tonight at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Charlotte, N.C., for the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri (27-3) and Syracuse (23-6) will match smoldering firepower in the 
first game before Arizona (27-5) and Louisville (28-5) fill the air with 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners meet Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny Crum, who has won two NCAA championships in 23 years at Louisville, 
knows what it takes to win it all and he likes it. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for basketball," he said of the practice of sending teams out of 
their regions. "It's hard on coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 For the many critics who have said the West isn't exactly the toughest 
neighborhood to come from, Crum said they haven't been paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I totally disagree," he said. "Missouri went through the Big Eight 
undefeated, that tells you something. Virginia was the No. 7 seed and they beat 
North Carolina and they beat Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has got to be as tough as nails. How can you say it's not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lute Olson couldn't. There should be no regional prejudice, he said. In fact, 
the Arizona coach accurately pointed out that the West teams may have grown in 
stature because of some teams that are no longer playing in any region at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want name recognition, probably (the region) where North Carolina 
was," he said. "But they're not in it. Or probably where Kentucky was. But 
they're not in it." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a good point. Missouri, seeded No. 1 in the West, reached the 
semifinals by decking Navy and Wisconsin, both by 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Norm Stewart said the Tigers are going to continue to rely on defense 
and follow a simple path toward what would be their first Final Four 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The procedure has always been the same to win it all," he said. "You have to 
win the next game." 
</P>
<P>
 The next game is against fourth-seeded Syracuse. Coach Jim Boeheim's Orangemen 
rely on a sizable backcourt of 6-foot-5 Lawrence Moten and 6-4 Adrian Autry, 
who average about 37 points a game between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Moten wore a protective wrap on his left hand after falling on it Monday at 
practice. The good news is that it isn't the hand Moten uses to shoot the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Wednesday, he gave sort of conflicting statements about 
the condition of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all right," he said. "You've got to play hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 When Arizona and Louisville play, someone's feelings are going to be hurt, the 
one that couldn't keep up. Both teams would rather run than walk and play at a 
tempo only a notch or two below frantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Arizona. Olson's No. 2-seeded Wildcats average 89.6 points and 22 
three-pointers a game, but that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, Arizona also has averaged one first-round loss in the 
tournament, but now the Wildcats are two victories away from their first Final 
Four appearance in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The two big reasons why are Arizona's backcourt of Damon Stoudamire and Khalid 
Reeves. Stoudamire scored 36 points in victories over Loyola of Maryland and 
Virginia, but Reeves was even better, scoring 32 against Loyola and 30 against 
Virginia, 27 in the last 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played decent," said Reeves, who claimed he wasn't playing in some kind of 
mental zone, although he has been there before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the greatest feeling in the world," he said. "You throw up everything 
and it's going in." 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville threw up everything and very little went in against Minnesota in 
the second round. But the third-seeded Cardinals held the Gophers to 21 points 
in the second half and lived to play again, which is the key to the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne Morton, who scored 26 points, made all seven of his shots and the rest 
of the Cardinals made exactly nine.  
</P>
<P>
 Usually, there is a lot to Louisville's offense. With 6-9, 235-pound Clifford 
Rozier, the Cardinals have an offensive edge over Arizona's 6-9 1/2, 250-pound 
Joseph Blair, but certainly not in size. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson is considering defending against Rozier double-team help from another 
big man, from the weakside, from the top and basically from wherever he can 
find somebody in a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Rozier) can create a lot of problems," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crum said the Cardinals are playing as well as anyone else and that their 
chance of winning a third title to go along with the ones he won in 1980 and 
1986 are not any better or worse than any other team.

NFL MEETINGS; A HEADS-UP RULING ON USING RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite claiming it was not turning football into Star Wars technology, the 
NFL took a space-age step Wednesday by ruling that a coach-to-quarterback radio

 The device will allow a sideline coach to communicate with the quarterback for 
up to 15 seconds before the start of each play. 
</P>
<P>
 The device features a microphone on the coach's headset and tiny speakers 
inside the quarterback's helmet. When the play clock reaches 15 seconds, it 
will be shut off by an official in the press box. The messages from the coaches 
will be scrambled with more than 268 million codes.

 The four main realignment ideas proposed by the NFL were released Wednesday. 
The Rams and Raiders remain in their respective NFC and AFC West Divisions in 
all scenarios. In two scenarios, Houston is added to the AFC West and Seattle 
is moved to the NFC West. Also joining the NFC West in different scenarios are 
Jacksonville, Phoenix or Minnesota. BILL PLASCHKE

ALL IN THE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY; PRO FOOTBALL: THOSE QUIBBLING COWBOYS, JIMMY 
JOHNSON AND JERRY JONES, WERE AT IT AGAIN THIS WEEK AT NFL MEETINGS. IN THE 
END, THEY PATCHED UP THEIR DIFFERENCES -- FOR NOW. 
</P>

<P>
 While tinkering with rules and realignment, NFL officials were reminded 
Wednesday of one delightful part of their game that never changes. 
</P>
<P>
 America's Feud. The Johnsons versus the Joneses. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jimmy Johnson is fighting again with Jerry Jones, owner of the Super 
Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most recent battle, perhaps their juiciest, involves red wine, a hotel 
bar, a toast gone bad, and a coach gone home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (our relationship) is excellent," Jones said, with a smile. "There's 
not another one like it in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute heated up at 2 a.m. Tuesday with Jones vowing to fire Johnson and 
replace him with Barry Switzer during an off-the-record conversation with 
reporters at a hotel bar. 
</P>
<P>
 It continued later Tuesday when Johnson heard about the remarks and confronted 
his boss in the hotel lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief discussion, Johnson left the owners meetings a day early, 
skipping the annual coaches breakfast with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident concluded Wednesday afternoon when Jones said he had no plans to 
fire his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I visited with him about this time yesterday . . . I think he was concerned 
that he had heard things being rumored around," Jones said. "We kind of both 
agreed he's still the coach of the Dallas Cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who initially said he was dumbfounded by Jones' remarks, had retired 
to his boat off the south Florida coast and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 This is only the latest in a string of public disagreements between former 
college roommates who have somehow managed to lead the Cowboys to consecutive 
Super Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
 An opportunity to become the first coach to win three consecutive Super Bowls 
is the only thing keeping Johnson from quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming the first owner to win three in a row is the only thing keeping Jones 
from firing Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
 But how those egos clash, as evidenced Monday night at a party where witnesses 
say Jones passed a table in which Johnson and a group of former Cowboy coaches 
and officials were seated. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones stopped and offered a toast to the team's recent success, apparently 
forgetting that at least one of these officials had left the organization after 
being forced out by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson toasted quickly but did not invite his boss to join the table. Jones 
was left standing and steaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't satisfied with the toast and decided to toast someplace else," 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, Jones returned to the hotel bar, drank red wine, and 
invited several writers to his table. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2 a.m., witnesses say he was publicly questioning Johnson's importance to 
the team and threatening to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones did not deny the comments, but noted that both he and Johnson frequently 
say such things about each other off the record. Those close to the situation 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't apologize about Monday night in any way, that was an off-the-record 
situation," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Jones) better change wines," New York Giant Coach Dan Reeves said. "He 
better find some non-alcoholic wines."

BLACK COACHES' DEAL TO BRING DIALOGUE, MORE INVOLVEMENT; COLLEGE SPORTS: NCAA 
VOWS TO ENHANCE MINORITY INPUT IN 15-POINT SETTLEMENT, BUT DOES NOT ADDRESS 
SCHOLARSHIP CUT THAT STARTED BOYCOTT TALK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 An agreement brokered by the Justice Department sets a framework for increased 
dialogue between the Black Coaches Assn. and the NCAA, and promises to include 
minorities in reviewing tougher eligibility standards, scheduled to go into 
effect in August of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-point settlement, announced Wednesday in Washington by officials from 
the Justice Department's Community Relations Service, does not directly address 
the Division I basketball scholarship cuts from 14 to 13, which triggered the 
BCA's boycott threat last January. But it does list as a goal "increased 
educational opportunities, particularly for Blacks and other minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that at the NCAA Convention, the vote didn't mention 
educational opportunities, only the 14th grant," NCAA spokesman Francis Canavan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that has been the problem with the public's perception of this whole 
matter," said USC Coach George Raveling, a prominent BCA member. "The media 
might have confused the issue with the 13 scholarships because it showed us as 
self-serving. This has been more about employment opportunities and 
representation. I think the NCAA kept an open mind on the things we talked 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement lists the broad goals of increased opportunity for minority 
representation in NCAA decision-making areas, increased input in committees to 
study requirements for athletic eligibility and increased participation by 
minority females in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA scheduled two meetings with the BCA this summer to offer reports on 
its progress. 
</P>
<P>
 All parties expressed satisfaction with the settlement, but said the process 
is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides have worked hard to reach this agreement, and will have to 
continue that hard work to accomplish these goals," said Drake Coach Rudy 
Washington, president of the BCA. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, the BCA will have a representative on an NCAA 
committee that will study the stricter academic requirements scheduled to begin 
in 1995. The entrance standards will change from a 2.0 grade-point average with 
a minimum score of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to a sliding scale of 
minimums involving the two, such as a 2.5 GPA and 700 score or a 2.0 GPA and 
900 score. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of academic eligibility has been a subject of ongoing debate since 
passage of Proposition 48 in 1983 when the 2.0-700 requirement was instituted.  
</P>
<P>
 That measure also allowed a nonqualified or partially qualified athlete only 
three years of eligibility instead of four.  
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement, the NCAA agreed to introduce legislation at next year's 
convention to increase that to four years.  
</P>
<P>
 Many black coaches have called the academic requirements discriminatory. When 
the NCAA decided later to eliminate one year of athletic scholarship money for 
those the so-called Prop. 48 athletes, Georgetown Coach John Thompson walked 
off the floor during a Hoya game at Landover, Md., in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was one of the BCA members who negotiated Wednesday's settlement, 
along with Washington, Raveling, Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson and Temple 
Coach John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department became involved last January after the Black Coaches 
Assn. threatened to boycott some games. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat came after the NCAA Convention, where delegates rejected a proposal 
that would have restored the basketball scholarship limits to 14. The BCA said 
that the move served to restrict education opportunities for minorities, 
particularly blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mediation process reminded us that we are colleagues engaged in a common 
purpose," said Joseph Crowley, NCAA president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly feel optimistic," said Raveling. "We have been dealing with 
people like Joe Crowley and (executive director) Ced Dempsey and (presidents 
commission member) Judith Albino, and we think they are fair-minded people."

AS EXPECTED, KIDD WILL GO PRO; BASKETBALL: CAL'S SOPHOMORE POINT GUARD DECLARES 
HIMSELF ELIGIBLE FOR THE NBA DRAFT AFTER TWO SEASONS WITH THE GOLDEN BEARS FAIL 
TO PRODUCE A FINAL FOUR FINISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Kidd, California's point guard, said Wednesday he will forgo his final 
two years of college eligibility to make himself available for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, who announced the decision on his 21st birthday, is projected to be 
taken as high as No. 2 in the June 29 draft. The 6-foot-4 sophomore 
All-American is the first collegiate underclassman to declare for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd led Cal to 21- and 22-victory seasons, but failed to help the Bears reach 
the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sad inside in a way because I haven't finished my mission at Cal," 
said Kidd, who attended a news conference with his parents and two sisters. "I 
know there's a lot of things I have to learn, but I know in time I can be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 In his final college game, Kidd made four of 17 shots as Cal was upset by 
Wisconsin Green Bay in the first round of the NCAA tournament last week. After 
the game, Kidd talked about playing at Cal for at least another season. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than a week later, he did what he was expected to do all along -- 
leave Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd and Coach Todd Bozeman broke down in tears and hugged each other after 
Wednesday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is a day of mixed emotions," Bozeman said. "I'm happy because Jason is 
able to fulfill his dream of taking the next step to the NBA. He has my total 
blessing. I think he's ready to accept the challenge of everything that's out 
before him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, who said he would like to play for the Lakers and their new coach, Magic 
Johnson, said the decision to turn pro was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made it even harder because of Coach Bozeman and us being so close," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One influence in the decision was that his friend Chris Webber, who left 
Michigan after his sophomore year, was picked first in last year's draft and 
signed a contract worth $74 million with the Golden State Warriors. Another 
factor was the impending NBA rookie salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his creative playmaking, active defense and exceptional court 
vision, but criticized for his inconsistent jump shot, Kidd set the Pacific 10 
Conference season record for assists with 272. This season, he averaged 16.8 
points, 9.1 assists, 6.8 rebounds and 3.1steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he had 110 steals, an NCAA record for freshmen. He averaged 13 
points and 7.7 assists per game while leading the Golden Bears to an NCAA 
tournament victory over two-time defending champion Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, expectations for Cal were high, but injuries to several key 
players left Kidd as one of only seven scholarship players. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd's teammate, junior Lamond Murray, also is expected to make himself 
available to the NBA draft. He has until May 15 to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamond will make his decision based on what's best for himself and his 
family," Bozeman said.

NCAA SOUTHEAST REGIONAL; AT MARQUETTE, HE CAN'T ESCAPE GHOSTS OF MCGUIRE'S PAST 
</P>

 The shadow knows Kevin O'Neill. Worse than that, it never leaves him alone. It 
is there when he wakes, it is there when he goes to work, it is there when he 
walks into a crowded room and total strangers get in his face and demand, "Why 
can't you be more like Al?" 
</P>
<P>
 The shadow is cast by an old, revered, retired basketball coach, from another 
time, growing larger with each tick of the clock, and after five years of 
uneasy co-habitation, O'Neill has learned there are only so many ways to deal 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 You can lose your first-round NCAA tournament game to Tulsa and all but drown 
in the shadow. Anybody out there want to throw Jim Harrick a line? 
</P>
<P>
 You can win your first-round NCAA tournament game, and your second, toppling 
Kentucky in the process, and confront the shadow head on, spawning hometown 
headlines that read Warriors Turn Back The Clock and Happy Days Return . 
</P>
<P>
 You can run away from the shadow, jumping at the first coaching vacancy that 
comes your way, an option O'Neill is currently mulling. O'Neill arrived in 
Knoxville, Tenn., for today's Southeast Regional semifinals amid heavy 
speculation that he is about to be offered the Tennessee job, rumors O'Neill 
doesn't try to deny or discourage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's flattering," he says, hoping that the posse that has circled the 
Marquette basketball program in Milwaukee catches wind. 
</P>
<P>
 There's only one thing you can't do, O'Neill says, and that is shadow box. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody tries to fight that stuff -- 'After Al' and all that," O'Neill 
says. "You can't fight that. Hey, Al McGuire is the most colorful coach who 
ever lived. If you try to fight it, you're going to die, because everybody out 
there loves him." 
</P>
<P>
 If John Wooden is the Wizard of college basketball, Al McGuire is its 
Absent-Minded Professor. McGuire's stream-of-unconsciousness coaching style 
brought Marquette to two NCAA finals during the 1970s, including the 1977 
championship, but it is how he did it -- two laughs for every basket -- that 
still warms the cockles of every old Warrior's heart 17 years after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill doesn't want to say that Marquette fans are obsessed, but he claims to 
have seen at least a snippet of the 1977 championship game tape at every alumni 
function he attends. 
</P>
<P>
 " Every function," he says wearily. "There are 38 (Marquette) alumni clubs in 
the country and this is no lie: I have been to each of them at least once and I 
have never been at one where they haven't had the '77 championship tape." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you do. You grab onto your best moment. I understand it. I don't 
like it, but I understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill has lost most of his hairline because of it. After a 15-14 debut in 
1989-90, he has taken the Warriors from 11-18 in 1990-91 to the school's first 
NCAA appearance in a decade in 1993 to 24-8 and a date against Duke in 
tonight's third round of the Southeast Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 When last Sunday's 75-63 upset of Kentucky deposited the Warriors here, the 
reaction around Marquette was a glance down at the fingernails and a huffy 
"About time." 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad thing about this," O'Neill frets, "is that people at Marquette expect 
this every year." 
</P>
<P>
 So Marquette won the Great Midwest Conference regular-season title this 
season. So? Marquette also lost to Cincinnati in the first round of the 
conference tournament, settling for an at-large NCAA bid, a No. 6 seeding and a 
first-round trip to St. Petersburg, Fla. "They put us out in the boonies," 
point guard Tony Miller grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 So Marquette beat Southwest Louisiana and Kentucky in St. Petersburg, moving 
into the Sweet 16 for the first time since -- there's that number again -- 
1977. So? The Warriors don't ram and jam, don't tear down rims or anything fun 
like that. They bore teams to death. They lead the nation in two statistical 
categories -- team field-goal defense and blocked shots by an individual 
player, 7-foot-1 center Jim McIlvaine. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the way Al did it, O'Neill keeps hearing. When Al coached, 
everybody laughed, nobody yawned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young Marquette people are actually excited we're in the final 16," 
O'Neill says. "The old Marquette people, the ones from Missouri, they're not 
going to be real fired up until they get another national championship. And 
then it wouldn't be enough. Because it would have been more fun with Al." 
</P>
<P>
 That's just the way it is, O'Neill says. He repeats: No sense fighting it. 
</P>
<P>
 So he makes sure to mention to reporters here that "I like Al. We have a very 
father-son type of relationship. . . . He comes by the office, makes phone 
calls, hangs out. He's a good friend to our program." 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire will always be there, for whomever coaches at Marquette. Hank 
Raymonds, Rick Majerus and Bob Dukiet have already come and gone, and O'Neill 
could be next out the door, as soon as the Warriors play their last game in 
this tournament and Tennessee gets the contract drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill insists none of this will distract his team against Duke tonight, but 
then, what else can he say? 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been going on for two weeks, three weeks, a month," he says. "If 
anything, we've been joking about it. We get off the bus today and (forward 
Roney) Eford, says, 'Oh, so this is the University of Tennessee? Nice place.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Eford would probably be glad if I left. He'd feel the shackles would be off 
him. That's the only thing slowing him down from going out and getting 45 
points a game." 
</P>
<P>
 A hand shoots up from the audience and a reporter asks about the rumors, 
calling them "the biggest thing to hit these parts since Kefauver." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's Kefauver?" O'Neill wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have to ask. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The name is Estes Kefauver. Tennessee graduate, former U.S. Senator, running 
mate to Adlai Stevenson in 1956. A big name around here, mister, as big as that 
McGuire guy back there in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, O'Neill will get to do some brushing up soon. He will be pleased 
to learn that Kefauver only played football at Tennessee. Never coached any 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Marquette and Duke (25-5) play in tonight's first game, the schools' first 
meeting since the first round of the 1990 preseason NIT at Durham, N.C. Duke 
won, 87-74. Marquette forward Damon Key remembers: "Jim (McIlvaine), Rob 
(Logterman) and myself were all coming in as freshmen at the time and it was 
exciting, playing Duke in our first college game. I thought we were the three 
best players in the state in high school and we were going to come in and 
dominate. Duke put us into reality right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Purdue (28-4) and No. 4 Kansas (27-7) meet in the second game. 
"Glenn Robinson is extremely talented, maybe the best college player of the 
last three or four years," Kansas Coach Roy Williams said. "He may not be in a 
class by himself, but if he isn't, it doesn't take long to take roll call." . . 
. Robinson is averaging 30.4 points a game, including 33 in Purdue's 83-73 
second-round victory over Alabama, a game in which no other Boilermaker scored 
more than 11 points.

NO PEACE IN MIDEAST REGIONAL; WOMEN: USC'S MILLER IS SHARPLY CRITICAL OF LACK 
OF TOURNAMENT TV COVERAGE ON EVE OF TROJANS' GAME AGAINST VIRGINIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If there is one thing Cheryl Miller can do better than play basketball, it's 
talk. And Wednesday, she had a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie coaches are supposed to be seen and not heard, but USC's coach had 
something on her mind at an NCAA Mideast Regional news conference.  
</P>
<P>
 On the afternoon before her USC women's basketball team plays Virginia in 
tonight's NCAA Mideast Regional semifinal, Miller was asked about television 
coverage of women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a chance, I'd tell Ted Turner: 'Come on, Ted. Get off your butt. 
Let's go!' " she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I worked in the industry (as a basketball broadcaster the two seasons before 
becoming USC coach last September), and I said all along that women's 
basketball wasn't getting the coverage it deserves.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are women in this country playing basketball at a very high level, and 
people who like basketball should be able to see them, like the 6-year-old girl 
in Iowa who could be shown women playing ball instead of Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame. It seems like you can put your feet up and find a men's game 
any time of the day. With all the satellites, all the cable, TV could do so 
much more. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, and after predicting that the winner of this regional would win 
the national championship in Richmond, Va., next week, Miller put her team 
through a relaxed practice at 19,200-seat Bud Walton Arena, where about 4,000 
are expected tonight to watch her 25-3 Pacific 10 champions meet the 27-4 
Atlantic Coast Conference champion Cavaliers.  
</P>
<P>
 The first game tonight matches No. 1-ranked Tennessee (31-1) and Louisiana 
Tech (28-3). The winners will meet Saturday night for a Final Four berth. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the tournament's toughest regional. Tennessee was ranked No. 1 in the 
final regular-season poll, Louisiana Tech No. 6, USC No. 7 and Virginia No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Louisiana Tech Coach Leon Barmore: "I've been to 10 Final Fours, and I'd 
say this regional is tougher than about five of them." 
</P>
<P>
 USC has won five games in a row since it was beaten, 80-50, at Stanford on 
Feb. 24. Afterward, Miller predicted her team wouldn't lose again this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Although winning, the Trojans haven't played well. USC's long-range shooting 
has dropped to 31%, and the offense seems to have lost its early and midseason 
sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the inside power games of 6-foot-5 senior Lisa Leslie and 6-3 freshman 
Tina Thompson have been the difference in tight tournament victories over 
Portland and George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, who averages 22 points and 12 rebounds per game, will see a familiar 
face on the Virginia bench in Cavalier Coach Debbie Ryan, who coached Leslie at 
a 1989 world juniors tournament in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just hope to contain Lisa; no one can stop her," Ryan said. "We just don't 
want her to go off for 35 against us." 
</P>
<P>
 The only common opponent between the teams is Maryland. The Trojans defeated 
Maryland, 92-85, to win the preseason Richmond tournament. Virginia won twice 
in ACC games, 68-56 and 86-83, the second in double overtime. The 
Tennessee-Louisiana Tech game is a rematch of a 94-60 drubbing by Tennessee at 
Knoxville on Dec. 22. Since then, the Techsters have won 22 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennessee's second string is a top-10 team," Barmore said. "They're hands 
down the best team in the country, and maybe the best in the last six, eight 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Women's Notes 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach Cheryl Miller sought a restraining order in Los Angeles Superior 
Court against a neighbor she claims is harassing her and threatening to drive 
her out of her neighborhood because she is black. . . . Tennessee's Pat Summitt 
joined Miller in sounding off about a lack of TV exposure for the women's game. 
Tonight's games aren't being shown live anywhere. "We've come a long way, but 
there's a long way to go," she said. "It seems like all the men's games are on 
TV. All of our March tournament games should be on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Summitt, who is 499-124 at Tennessee in 19 seasons, reiterated that she is not 
interested in becoming the men's coach at Tennessee, where Wade Houston has 
resigned. "We're making great strides in women's basketball and I want to 
continue doing that," she said. Later in a news conference, she was asked what 
her reaction would be if Houston's replacement signs for a bigger salary than 
she receives. "If someone is hired who makes more than Pat Summitt, then we'll 
sit down and talk about Pat Summitt," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last season, three Pac-10 women's programs outdrew their counterpart men's 
programs: Stanford, Oregon and Washington. This year, only Washington outdrew 
the men, 4,621 per game to 3,655. Stanford's women came close: 4,613 for the 
women, 4,640 for men. . . . Miller is one of three to play and coach in the 
NCAA women's tournament. . . . George Washington Coach Jack McKeown, who was an 
assistant on the 1992 U.S. women's Olympic team, on Cheryl Miller, at 28, 
trying to make the team before she was stopped with a knee injury: "She was 
amazing. I kept thinking to myself: 'Hey, she's still got it.' " . . . USC's 
practice was so low-key Wednesday, Miller and Lisa Leslie finished up with a 
game of HORSE. Leslie won, on a fourth shootoff.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL / NCAA WEST REGIONAL; SURPRISING TEXAS A&M TRAVELING IN FAST 
LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three of the teams in tonight's semifinals in the NCAA West Regional women's 
basketball tournament at Stanford's Maples Pavilion were expected to get this 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 One was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M (23-7), seeded 13th, will play top-seeded Purdue (27-4) in the 
opener at 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M is the lowest-seeded team remaining in the tournament, the next 
being Alabama, which is sixth in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Stanford (24-5) will play third-seeded Colorado (27-4) at 8:30 
in a rematch of a West Regional semifinal last season at Missoula, Mont. That 
game was won by Colorado, ending Stanford's reign as national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Texas A&M has size in centers Martha McClelland, who is 6 feet 4, and 
Kelly Cerny, who is 6-5, its leading scorer is 5-4 guard Lisa Branch, averaging 
16.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sort of a Mutt-and-Jeff-type team," Coach Lynn Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies upset fourth-seeded Florida, 78-76, in the first-round at College 
Station, Tex. The game was supposed to be played at Florida, but was moved 
because of a Rod Stewart concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M defeated San Diego State in overtime, 75-72, on Sunday in a 
second-round game at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Its semifinal opponent surprised a few people this season, too. Purdue was 
picked to finish fifth in the Big Ten in a preseason poll of conference 
coaches, but shared the conference title with Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we are a young team, the experts underestimated our players," Coach 
Lin Dunn said. "That was motivational in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue is led by forwards Leslie Johnson, a 6-1 freshman who averages 18.5 
points and 9.5 rebounds, and Stacey Lovelace, a 6-4 sophomore who averages 11.6 
points and 7.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has not forgotten last season's loss to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will be a little bit motivational for us," Coach Tara VanDerveer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal is led in scoring by Anita Kaplan, a 6-5 junior center who 
averages 16.4 points, and in rebounding by Rachel Hemmer, a 6-3 junior forward 
who averages 7.8.  
</P>
<P>
 One player the Cardinal is concerned about is Buffalo guard Shelley Sheetz, 
who scored 28 points the last time these teams met. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheetz, a junior, averages 13.5 points. Jamillah Lang, a 6-0 senior forward, 
averages 19.3.

MAGIC'S SCRIPT IS SIMILAR, BUT THE TALENT AROUND HIM ISN'T; SCENARIO: JOHNSON 
HAS RESCUED LAKERS BEFORE, BUT THAT WAS AS A PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The players were filing onto the team plane in a state of despair. They were 
heading to Philadelphia for the sixth game of the 1980 NBA finals against the 
76ers without their captain and leader, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 But one undaunted rookie strode down the aisle and took the bulkhead seat on 
the left side, traditionally Abdul-Jabbar's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never fear," he proclaimed, "E.J. is here." 
</P>
<P>
 And he was. Twenty-year-old Earvin Johnson filled not only the seat, but the 
role, playing center part of the time and team leader all night as the Lakers 
beat the 76ers to win the NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have fallen on hard times. There are failures on the court and 
empty seats in the stands. The glamour and glitter of Showtime is tarnished. 
The championship banners on the wall are a stinging reminder of better times. 
</P>
<P>
 High up in his private box, owner Jerry Buss sees a team headed nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the bulkhead seat is empty. Again, Johnson is asked to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss had been dropping hints to Johnson for nearly two years about coaching 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 But two weeks ago, Buss got specific. Would Magic coach until the end of the 
season? 
</P>
<P>
 It was a reasonable gamble for both sides. If it works, Buss might have his 
coach of the future. If not, he'll find a new coach. The decision to remove 
Randy Pfund is irrevocable. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Johnson, if he doesn't like coaching, he'll walk away. If he does like 
it and the Lakers want him back, Johnson has some leverage in his bid to buy a 
piece of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss caught Johnson at just the right time. His world tour is on hold until 
the end of May. In the meantime, Johnson has been sitting courtside at the 
Forum, agonizing over the misfortunes of his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not take a seat on the bench and try to do something about it? 
</P>
<P>
 Once he decided to give it a try, Johnson first ran the idea past his wife, 
Cookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're here (at the Forum) every night anyway," she told her husband. "So you 
might as well go on and coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said his health was not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine, I'm great," he said. "Don't worry about that. If I wasn't, I 
wouldn't be doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 Next order of business was a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's agent, Lon Rosen, sat down and worked out an acceptable deal in 
about the time it takes for the 24-second clock to expire. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to work out a deal when the dollar figure comes to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Already receiving $2.5 million this season from Buss under his player 
contract, Johnson agreed to add on his new duties at no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the matter of Johnson's schedule. With activities ranging from 
speaking engagements to television tapings, it was impossible to drop 
everything at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was decided to wait until Sunday to inaugurate the Magic Era, Part II. 
</P>
<P>
 The original announcement was to be made at the end of the week, but, when the 
news leaked Tuesday, a news conference was hastily called for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the decision already made public, Johnson made a call Tuesday night to 
his old friend and teammate, Michael Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Cooper like to join him on the sidelines? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Cooper think Johnson can coach? 
</P>
<P>
 "I do after I saw him come in here with his team on tour," Cooper said. "I was 
sitting in the stands watching them practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually with teams like that, they say, 'Come here in shape and let's go.' 
But he was preparing them and giving them drills and making them work. And I 
thought, 'He can do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it's going to take some getting used to. When Rosen asked Johnson what 
time he wanted to practice Saturday, Johnson replied, "Whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen shook his head. "No," he told Johnson, "You're the guy. This is your 
team. You decide. You're Pat Riley." 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet, but there are parallels. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley also took over the team without any head coaching experience. He, too, 
assumed command in a time of tribulation, the Lakers in turmoil in those days 
after the firing of Coach Paul Westhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, however, had far more talent to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Johnson weave his magic with far less? 
</P>
<P>
 He approaches the task with his usual unwavering confidence. Never fear, E.J. 
is here.

 The possibility of Magic Johnson again playing for the Lakers, a notion that 
excites fans and frustrates management, arose again Wednesday, with Johnson 
again refusing to say he will never return to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably be down there (the sidelines) and want to tear off the suit," 
Johnson said when asked about the possibility of becoming a player-coach."Of 
course. . . . Once I step out there on Sunday (his first game), it's going to 
be crazy, I'm going to be crazy, excited. I know if it gets tight, a minute to 
go, I'm going to look and say, 'Man, go get that (No.) 32 jersey.' Of course. 
That will never leave. I love basketball, and I enjoy winning. It's hard for me 
to sit here and say I won't be tempted. Of course I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson even said: "If Michael (Jordan) comes back and plays, I'll play." 
</P>
<P>
 When questions about Johnson playing again first came up at a Forum news 
conference, General Manager Jerry West shook his head with a look of disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "His playing days are over," West said. "It's almost gotten to the point of 
being annoying to keep hearing about it." SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED?; AIDS SPECIALIST SAYS JOHNSON'S RETURN AS COACH 
OF LAKERS MIGHT PROVE BENEFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A leading AIDS specialist endorsed Magic Johnson's surprise return to the 
Lakers as the team's coach, saying Wednesday it could prove beneficial to his 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always thought that was an important aspect in his care," said David Ho, 
director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho has assisted Michael Mellman, the Laker team physician, in Johnson's care 
and treatment since Johnson was found to have the virus that causes AIDS in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think it is OK," Ho said of Johnson's decision. "He's been doing 
quite well recently. We always considered that he was well enough to work, 
maybe not as a professional athlete, but in some other position." 
</P>
<P>
 Mellman also supported the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at Earvin, he's happiest, other than with his family, on the 
basketball court," he said Wednesday. "Whether he is playing or coaching is 
less an issue. The primary issue is being involved in the game he loves so 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson reassured reporters Wednesday that coaching will not affect his 
health, although one reason cited when he retired before the 1991-92 season was 
the NBA's heavy travel schedule. AIDS specialists said at the time that the 
rigors of a long season could reduce Johnson's ability to slow the progressive 
weakening of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing basketball, to me, is more strenuous than coaching," Johnson said. 
"This is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Mellman said Johnson does not have AIDS, the acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me just say this to everybody: I'm fine, don't worry about that," Johnson 
said. "If I wasn't, I wouldn't be doing this. Let me just ease everybody's 
mind. I've been on tour, I've been playing, I've been everywhere. If something 
was wrong, I wouldn't be coaching this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Mellman, who oversees Johnson's medical care, was not consulted in this week's 
decision, but said he and Johnson discussed the possibility of coaching during 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a head coach, he will be able to adjust his lifestyle appropriately," 
Mellman said. "It's not like he has to be able to run every night. He has more 
control as a coach than a player because he will be setting the standards and 
the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho said as long as Johnson continues to watch his diet, rest and stress level, 
he will be fine on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho and Mellman said Johnson's care should not change because of the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But will it have a positive affect on Johnson's life? 
</P>
<P>
 "You're dealing with an issue we don't know the answers to," Mellman said. "I 
think this will be a positive event overall. If you ask me for proof or 
substantiation, there is none. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the first known player who was HIV-positive and now the first known 
coach."

LAKER PLAYERS NOT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT FROM NEW COACH; PRO BASKETBALL: WHILE 
RALLYING TO DEFEAT MAVERICKS, 112-109, THEY WONDER WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE TO PLAY 
FOR MAGIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Lakers, caught in the awkward limbo of the post-Pfund, pre-Magic era, will 
find out Sunday what it is like to play for Coach Earvin (Magic) Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't already know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing for him when I was playing with him," Kurt Rambis said. "When 
he was out on the floor, he was choreographing and orchestrating the offense. 
He made up plays coming down the floor. He kind of winged it. That's the way 
he's been since he was a kid. You'd see him waving his arm, getting players to 
do this and that. He'll have to learn how to do that from the bench, yelling 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not going to be easy, that's for sure. . . . He's going to have to 
take his lumps. He'll make some bad decisions and he'll make some good 
decisions, and he'll learn from it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers -- who needed a furious rally to defeat the lowly Dallas Mavericks, 
112-109, Wednesday at Reunion Arena after trailing by 10 points with five 
minutes to play -- met the news that Johnson is replacing Randy Pfund with the 
typical mix of sympathy for a fired coach they liked and enthusiasm for a 
friend who reminds them of their glory years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am looking forward to Magic," said Vlade Divac, a player who developed 
under the driving tutelage of Johnson before Johnson retired after contracting 
HIV. "He knows a lot about basketball and has a winning attitude and that is 
what we need. . . . It's mixed, though. I still believe Randy's a good coach. 
Management made a decision. That's business. We'll move on. . . . I'm looking 
forward to working with (Johnson) again. Whatever it takes to be the best 
player, I'll do it, it doesn't matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the Lakers know Magic so well, especially the team's young core. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to exciting, just for the fact that growing up I was a big Magic 
Johnson fan and I patterned a lot of what I do after watching him play," Doug 
Christie said. "In some sense, there are a lot of unknowns. We don't know what 
to expect. As a player, he did things a certain way. I'm sure as a coach he 
will, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund got some support from the players, but it was more empathy than 
indignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody had two emotions," Rambis said. "One, you were sad for 
Randy and felt bad for him and his situation. And you were happy for Earvin and 
the prospects he might bring to the club. The same things he brought as a 
player, a great work ethic, enthusiasm for the game, an understanding of the 
game, a knowledge of the game. He'll try to relay that to the players." 
</P>
<P>
 James Worthy, a 12-year veteran, has seen coaches come and go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Randy did a great job, but I don't think time was on his side," 
Worthy said. "I think the expectation level was so high. There was a lot of 
teaching that needed to be done. There were a lot of new players in the last 
year. It was just overwhelming for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Worthy will answer to a teammate he won NBA titles with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be strange at first, but that will be over in about 30 seconds," Worthy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to say how a new coach is going to do especially when it's new for 
him. It's really hard to speculate. I know his attitude, I know he's a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anytime there's positive change, everybody's excited. The fans will 
be extremely excited. It will give them an opportunity to reminisce and hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bertka, longtime Laker assistant, coach, has been through coaching 
transition after transition. He's handling the team during the two-game interim 
before Johnson takes over, and he'll be there to help him adjust to life on the 
bench, something Johnson never knew much about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic is a person who has tremendous qualifications to come in and do the 
job," Bertka said. "He's a very strong personality, and he's actually been 
coaching the game all his life, because that's the way he plays basketball. I 
think he'll be a very positive influence on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Question is, of course, how long can Johnson be content to stay on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
 "It will probably take about 30 seconds," Rambis said, laughing. "That's up to 
him. I've played in these games with him over in Europe, so I know he can still 
play. That's always a possibility. I'm sure he'll have a hard time keeping his 
hands off the ball in practice situations. Whether that rolls around to a game 
situation, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot the Lakers don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody's waiting to see how it will unfold," Worthy said. "No one 
wants to speak yet, because nobody really knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been a winner. Efficient, demanding, those are all the 
characteristics that make up a coach. His ability to get people in the game was 
always good, to keep everybody involved. If he can do that, he's got a great 
chance."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; DOUBTING HIM WAS A GREAT MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was too scrawny to survive in the NHL, scouts and general managers said 
with knowing nods. Didn't have much of a shot. Couldn't score on a breakaway if 
the Stanley Cup depended on it. They laughed over the 46-goal season he 
recorded as a teen-ager in the World Hockey Assn. In the NHL, where men are men 
and elbows to the jaw are dispensed without mercy, he would be just another 
failed phenom. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, this Wayne Gretzky kid had no future. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did another scrawny, blond small-town boy who joined the pro 
basketball ranks that same year, 1979. He couldn't jump, couldn't shoot and he 
was destined to be a casualty in the nightly wars under the basket. Larry Bird 
had no chance, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky still doesn't have what players call a heavy shot, one that stings 
goaltenders' hands. He stopped growing at a modest 6 feet, never attaining the 
bulk of a Phil Esposito. And he has yet to master the art of scoring on 
breakaways. If he had developed that knack, he joked last week, "I probably 
would be well beyond the 802." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite lacking those supposedly vital assets, Gretzky has become the NHL's 
career goal-scoring leader.  
</P>
<P>
 With a neat but unspectacular wrist shot from the near edge of the left 
faceoff circle, Gretzky on Wednesday scored his 802nd goal and broke Gordie 
Howe's NHL record of 801. The Great One became the greatest one, grabbing the 
only significant NHL scoring record he didn't have after he broke Howe's NHL 
point record in 1989, by scoring the second goal in the Kings' 6-3 loss to the 
Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 To appreciate his feat, think of this: To score 800 goals, a player would have 
to average 40 goals per season for 20 seasons. Or 20 goals for 40 seasons. 
Gretzky, whose record-setting goal was his 37th this season, has averaged 55 
goals over 14 NHL seasons. He broke Howe's record in his 1,117th game; Howe 
needed 1,767 to score his 801. 
</P>
<P>
 For his career, Gretzky has averaged 2.19 points per game; Howe averaged 1.05 
per game and finished with 1,850 NHL points. If he had averaged as many points 
per game as Gretzky, he would have collected 3,940 points. Among the NHL's top 
100 point leaders, only Mario Lemieux comes close to Gretzky's wizardry. 
Lemieux has averaged 2.03 points per game, but his career is being threatened 
by back problems. No other player in the top 100 has averaged as many as 1.5 
points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 The sellout crowd of 16,005, which moments earlier saluted Oscar winner Tom 
Hanks with a standing ovation at his Forum seat, gave Gretzky an even louder 
cheer. This crowd knows class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six years ago when I came to L.A., they said California wasn't a great hockey 
area," Gretzky said during the ceremony that commemorated his goal. "Mr. 
(Bruce) McNall brought me down here six years ago, and we showed North America 
that they were wrong. . . . To the fans of L.A., I've loved playing here for 
six years and I'd love to play another six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky doesn't have a mean streak like Howe, who probably would have checked 
his grandmother into the cheap seats if she stood between him and the net. He 
didn't revolutionize the concept of how to play a position, as Bobby Orr did 
for defensemen. He didn't have the slap shot that Bobby Hull made famous. He's 
not tall enough to have the regal air of Jean Beliveau. He didn't invent the 
goalie mask or the curved stick. 
</P>
<P>
 His game isn't rink-length rushes, like Paul Coffey, or the pure speed up the 
wing of Mike Gartner. It isn't breakaways or shots from the point or 
one-handing a shot with two defenders on his back, as Lemieux can do with the 
reach afforded by his 6-foot-4 frame. 
</P>
<P>
 What he did was bring to hockey a vision and creativity never seen before. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's game is built on quickness, not flat-out speed. It's the ability to 
know where the puck is going to be, to dart there, startle a defender and force 
a turnover with a flick of his stick. 
</P>
<P>
 His game is seeing everything, analyzing it and acting a split-second too 
quickly for opponents to react. By the time they realize he has set up behind 
the net, he has already released a pass to a teammate who was left open for a 
shot. That's why that bit of ice behind the opposition's net has become his 
favorite spot, his command post, because from there he can see everyone coming 
at him and recognize where his best play will be. 
</P>
<P>
 His record-breaking goal was only a wrist shot, like hundreds he has scored, 
but it was the completion of a clever passing sequence with Luc Robitaille and 
Marty McSorley. Robitaille left a drop pass for Gretzky, who passed to McSorley 
on the right side. McSorley passed back to Gretzky, who quickly put the puck in 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing flashy, just subtle, smart and well executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he greater than Howe? Purists will argue Howe was superior because he set 
his records against tougher competition, in the days of the six-team NHL and 
before over-expansion diluted talent. But he didn't have to endure an 84-game 
schedule or the draining coast-to-coast travel Gretzky faces. There's no real 
answer, merely the fun of arguing and the joy of appreciating the unique gifts 
each has brought to the game. Greatest Hits

GRETZKY KNEW EARLY ON DAY WOULD BE HISTORIC; HOCKEY: THE GREAT ONE TOLD FRIENDS 
AND FAMILY THAT HOWE'S RECORD WOULD BE HIS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 For the 802nd time, Wayne Gretzky had the puck on his stick, the look in his 
eye and the net in his sights. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 802nd time, Wayne Gretzky swung his arms and the red light flashed on. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 802nd time, Wayne Gretzky flashed his big grin and celebrated with his 
joyous teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 But this goal wasn't quite like any of the 801 that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a goal for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the goal that catapulted Wayne Gretzky from Great One to Greatest 
One. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a historic end to a day that had witnessed another memorable moment in 
the morning when Magic Johnson, his own legend already assured, took on a new 
life as a head coach. Probably never has one building been the site of so much 
history in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky could feel it early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Phyllis, had already predicted that Wednesday was the day he would 
pass Gordie Howe's career goal mark. She had correctly predicted that her son 
would score two goals Sunday to tie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, Gretzky's mother told him that his father, Walter, who 
is recovering from a brain aneurysm, was running out of medication, which was 
at the Gretzkys' place in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get it today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem," her son replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky watched an old tape of himself scoring his first NHL goal 15 years ago 
and took a call from Howe, who wished him luck. 
</P>
<P>
 As he drove to the Forum, Gretzky called his agent, Mike Barnett, and told 
Barnett how great he felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it will be tonight," Barnett replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great One rarely exudes such great feelings on a game day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called it," Barnett said. "It was a big goal at the time and he wanted it 
to be a big goal. He has a flair for the dramatic. He has always been able to 
take it to a bigger level when he wanted something desperately. This he wanted 
desperately, to do it in front of the home fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he headed into the locker room, Gretzky received some final advice from 
his wife, Janet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try to enjoy it," she said. "It only happens once in your life. Try to take 
it all in and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what King owner Bruce McNall did when the magic moment came during the 
second period of a 6-3 loss to the Vancouver Canucks. The man who brought 
Gretzky to Los Angeles sat in his seat and surveyed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the greatest moment I've ever had in my business career," McNall said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty who doubted hockey would ever become popular in Southern 
California back in 1988, when McNall pulled off his blockbuster deal to bring 
Gretzky to the Kings from the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, McNall took a moment to survey the scene: a full house including Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and movie stars such as Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn, 
Kurt Russell and Martin Short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six years ago, when I came to L.A.," Gretzky told the cheering crowd when 
play was stopped to celebrate the moment, "they said California wasn't a great 
hockey area. Mr. McNall brought me down here six years ago and we showed North 
America they were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he skated over to McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne made a point of coming over," McNall said, "and that meant a lot. He 
had a billion things on his mind, everyone was hassling him and he came over to 
me."

FIGURE SKATING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; MENO AND SAND TAKE TOGETHERNESS A LITTLE 
BIT TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As figure skating's world turned Wednesday, the talk was of pairs. Off the 
ice, the waitress and the truck driver, Calla Urbanski and Rocky Marval, 
reunited. On the ice, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand, proved equally inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
 In figure skating's equivalent of two young lovers becoming attached at the 
braces, the hook on Meno's skate became caught in the pants leg of Sand's 
costume, forcing them to interrupt their freestyle program during the World 
Championships at Chiba, Japan, for almost 10 seconds while they broke the 
clench. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the best thing that happened to the U.S. champions from Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing less than masterfully up to that point, Meno said they improved 
after the entanglement, enabling them to retain the sixth-place position that 
they found themselves in after the previous day's technical program. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was a disappointment for Meno and Sand, who finished fifth in last 
month's Winter Olympics and figured to improve after the gold and silver 
medalists from Russia decided to bypass the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, two other Russian pairs skated to the forefront as Evgenia Shishkova 
and Vadim Naumov won and Marina Eltsova and Andrei Bushkov finished third. The 
defending champions from Canada, Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, were 
second despite her broken rib. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no U.S. pair finished among the first five -- Kyoka Ina and Jason 
Dungjen were 12th, Karen Courtland and Todd Reynolds 17th -- the United States 
will have only two berths in the event in next year's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Vying for one of them might be Urbanski and Marval, the two-time U.S. 
champions who can't seem to find happiness skating with or without each other. 
Or they might decide to come back this time as professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Less certain about her future is Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park, who teamed 
with Marval in this year's national championships to finish fourth. Once a 
bronze medalist in the World Championships with Sand, she is searching for her 
third partner in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure Skating Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's technical program, Olympic silver medalist Elvis Stojko of Canada 
was first. Aren Nielsen, a replacement for injured Brian Boitano, finished 
sixth, and U.S. champion Scott Davis was eighth.

KID STUFF: EXPRESS LINES; 'EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY' ABOUT THE FEELINGS 
SHARED BY SCHOOLCHILDREN AND ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paint-by-number sets were big when I was young, although frankly between the 
eye strain and those thimble-sized tubs of paint that either ran out or dried 
out halfway through the project, I was never all that wild about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when every color had been dabbed in its appointed space, there was a 
nice payoff when the adults gathered 'round to admire my work: Look at this, 
honey! Can this kid stay inside the lines or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it's unlikely a parent would respond the same way. Child-development 
experts and countless parenting books have changed the way most of us think, or 
least think we should think, about a child's artwork. The focus has shifted 
away from technical ability to self-expression. If our budding artist wants to 
make a tree fuchsia instead of green, current thinking tells us we should 
support him all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a product of the paint-by-numbers generation, this progressive 
thinking may be hard to adopt, but a new exhibit (through May 22) at the Irvine 
Fine Arts Center could help. Titled "Every Picture Tells a Story: An Exhibition 
About Feeling Awareness," the collection features visual art by schoolchildren 
and adults that, in the view of IFAC curator of exhibitions Dorrit Rawlins, 
demonstrates how art goes beyond something that is pleasing to the eye to act 
as a vehicle for all ages to identify their feelings and communicate them with 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than segregating the children's work from the adults', Rawlins has 
intermingled the generations in her display, grouping them instead by themes, 
which she explains in brief essays mounted alongside the works. (It's somewhat 
ironic that Rawlins should take such a semi-structured approach in displaying 
and explaining the works, considering the intent of the show. However, because 
the essays are directed toward adults and teen-agers, they can be interpreted 
for younger children in whatever way the reader feels most comfortable.) 
</P>
<P>
 An example: On a card titled "Windows to Feelings," Rawlins discusses how the 
window is used as a symbol for the way humans process feelings ("We look out 
of, into and through the world through feelings"). Near by are works by 
youngsters from the William Lyon School at the Orangewood children's home. Each 
piece is divided into four panels depicting different facial expressions, 
ranging from cheery to angry to hauntingly detached. Alongside, an adult artist 
displays a small, glass-paned door with one pane shattered and the words 
"Please Don't Tell Mom" neatly lettered on the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlins said that by intermingling children's and adults' works, she hopes to 
illustrate how each generation of artist can borrow positive elements from the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The works here just seem to play off each other well, too," she continued. 
"Together, they remind us how important it is not to think of art as an object; 
it's an experience, a conduit to the aesthetic part of who we are that can 
really get squelched in contemporary society." 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, that exchange led to a collaboration that produced "Tom the Cat," 
a series of paintings by professional artist Lau Haaning inspired by cartoon 
drawings of the same name by teen-ager Carman Bibbo.  
</P>
<P>
 Bibbo's panels, which mostly focus on a superhero-style cat kicking tush on a 
razor-toothed dog named Bulldozer, influenced Haaning's pieces featuring the 
character in fantasy situations. Haaning also exhibits two other works that are 
intentionally more disturbing and depict childlike characters under extreme 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Other works, however, have a gentler spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, March 26, IFAC will host two special Youth Art Days in 
conjunction with the show. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., sessions in kite-making, 
kaleidoscopes and clay, as well as ethnic dance and music are planned for 4- to 
9-year-olds at IFAC. (On-site registration begins at 9 a.m.)  
</P>
<P>
 Next door at the Youth Services Center, workshops in visual art and poetry 
will be presented from 1 to 5 p.m. for high school students, in a program 
co-sponsored by the Irvine Youth Action Team. No preregistration is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Every Picture Tells a Story: An Exhibition About Feeling Awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Through May 22. Hours: noon to 9 p.m. Monday; 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday

ROSIE: SHE CUTS THROUGH THE RUBBLE AND TELLS IT STRAIGHT UP; THE 
COMIC-TURNED-ACTRESS IS A REAL-LIFE RIZZO WHO SAYS WHAT'S ON HER MIND 
</P>

<P>
 In the Bristol Lounge of Boston's stately Four Seasons hotel, the tone is set 
by buttery oak walls and ceilings, gathered drapes, swirling carpets. A stone's 
throw from Boston Common and a few blocks from the city's theater district, the 
bar-restaurant is the kind of place one reasonably might expect to see opera 
singer Jessye Norman reclining on a plush fireside sofa while a classic 
mid-February blizzard rages outside. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the sort of joint you'd imagine that Betty Rubble would pick for 
dinner. And yet, isn't that her high-pitched, Stone Age cartoon laugh, spilling 
forth from a corner table? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahnnnn hnnn hnnn. Bamm-Bamm, put that down!"  
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the voice isn't coming from someone with bare feet and a cave-woman 
cocktail dress. But it might as well be. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie O'Donnell -- adorned by the same gray sweat pants, navy blue sweat 
shirt, black high-tops and zero makeup she had on when she left theater 
rehearsals that day -- clearly has about as much respect for the sanctity of 
her posh surroundings as Dino had for Fred. 
</P>
<P>
 The stand-up comic-turned-actress is explaining how she won her role as Betty 
in the upcoming "Flintstones" movie, and that explanation seems to require a 
demonstration of "The Laugh." So without hesitation, apparently oblivious to 
the power-tie and Perrier crowd dining around her, laugh she does. Loudly.  
</P>
<P>
 That's Rosie. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of the fastest rising personalities in the entertainment business 
-- movie offers by the fistful, a starring role in a revival of "Grease" headed 
for Broadway (May 11, after a stop in Orange County beginning Tuesday), best 
friend to Madonna -- but she's having none of the Terence Trent D'Arby Syndrome 
that proudly announces newcomer-with-an-attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 During this interview, at least, she is candid, nonchalant and altogether real 
-- even stopping mid-sentence at one point to ask her interviewer if that is 
Jessye Norman across the room, then excusing herself to go meet the diva, like 
some wide-eyed kid running into Roger Clemens outside Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Between gulps of Coke and bites of gentrified Thai spring rolls and chicken 
satay, O'Donnell, 32, chats almost nonstop on subjects that range from her own 
Long Island upbringing to Tonya Harding, movie making and the allegations of 
pedophilia against Michael Jackson. Nothing, it seems, is off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate questions: Why "Grease"? Why now? 
</P>
<P>
 Her movie career has been humming along nicely ("Car 54, Where Are You?" 
notwithstanding) since the success of her debut in "A League of Their Own" in 
1992 -- last year, she did "Sleepless in Seattle" and "Another Stakeout" -- so 
this might not seem the best moment to take a nine-month hiatus. But with "The 
Flintstones" headed for theaters May 27 and the Garry Marshall-directed "Exit 
to Eden" targeted for summer release, O'Donnell thinks her timing is just about 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm done with (the 'Grease' tour and Broadway run) by the end of October, so 
I'll be back making movies by November," she explains. "Besides that, if you do 
movie after movie, the public gets sick of you." (She's on screen -- briefly -- 
in the current "I'll Do Anything," the scrapped musical version of which 
featured a rap number with her and Woody Harrelson.) 
</P>
<P>
 As to why "Grease" specifically: well, because Tommy Tune cast her. The 
original musical, by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, debuted on Broadway in 1972; 
this revival is a Tune production, directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were looking for a 'name' to be one of the lead roles, and when I said I 
had wanted to do Rizzo, they thought that would probably work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun says he first knew the casting would work when O'Donnell brought a 
yo-yo to rehearsals one day, lending Rizzo an added dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never in a million years would have thought of the yo-yo," the director 
confessed over the phone from Seattle, where the production was camped earlier 
this week. "I knew from that moment that we were OK." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell has wanted to do just about any role in just about any musical on 
Broadway since she was old enough to memorize every line and lyric to "Funny 
Girl" (a talent she retains, and -- in Streisand-esque comic voice -- uses 
periodically to punctuate interviews such as this one). 
</P>
<P>
 But she is under no delusions that she has Barbra Streisand's vocal chops. Or 
even Stockard Channing's, who played Rizzo in the movie version. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never really a singer, except for maybe in the shower or something like 
that. But I always wanted to do it because to me there is nothing like the 
thrill of going to a Broadway show when the lights go down and you have that 
orchestra in front of you. I always get goose bumps. It's the reason I went 
into show business in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she says, the reception has been warm and forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audiences have been great. Nobody is really expecting me to get up there 
and be Whitney Houston. They know who I am and what I do, and I think they do 
expect me to be funny, and hopefully I am funny. Then the rest . . . they 
think, 'You know, she is all right.' Even the critics have said, 'She's all 
right; she's not the best singer.' Which is fine. I can take that. It's the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, at least a few critics have been less kind: 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kelly, Boston Globe: "She has the brazen delivery of Ethel Merman. She 
snaps one-liners like gum, she burps, she boogies. She has two songs . . . 
which she sings in an even tone but, often, with the wrong emphasis."

<P>
 Pamela Sommers, Washington Post: "The part of Rizzo . . . is no stretch for 
the pasty-faced, tough-talking O'Donnell, but the less said about her off-key, 
blaring singing, the better." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that critics really have landed on is something that 
O'Donnell herself has problems with. While she thinks the show is less about 
the '50s than it is "about kids wanting to fit in, and the awkwardness of love 
and loving and sexuality and allegiance to your friends," she concedes that 
some of the trappings of the era unfortunately come through, including sexism, 
crass humor and naivete: 
</P>
<P>
 "The line I hate the most . . . I go through this hard scene about how (Rizzo) 
thinks she is pregnant, and she's so upset and she cries, and then she does 
this song with her friends. And then five seconds later she goes, 'Good thing I 
got my Friend, phew!' Like the whole thing is resolved because she's not 
pregnant, all the issues. Every night that I go out and I have to do that I 
think, 'Oh, God.' I hate what I have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Calhoun defends that passage of the play, and others, pointing out 
that five seconds in the theater can represent days and what may seem like 
too-quick resolution of complex issues could be just necessary editing. Plus, 
he says, there is a certain intention here to appear naive. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's sort of the point of doing this show," he says. "It's about a simpler 
time with simpler issues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if some parts of the show hold up better than others, O'Donnell thinks 
the package works pretty well, especially with such cast members as Sam Harris 
and Billy Porter around to lend some show-stopping vocals. The camaraderie 
among the actors, despite grueling all-day rehearsals that have continued 
through the pre-Broadway tour, is unlike anything she has come to expect on 
movie sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really having a great time on this show. Because on a movie you get to be 
friends with other actors, but you don't get to spend every day with them. . . 
. This is like high school to me. You get to have friends and buddies and go 
out after the show for a drink, and it's very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a film career that invariably has seen her cast as the Everybuddy, 
O'Donnell professes to have mostly missed out on that sort of thing in her 
youth.  
</P>
<P>
 At about age 18, she left her home in Commack, N.Y., to hit the stand-up 
comedy circuit. Her mother died of cancer when Rosie was 10 and, even with a 
sister and three brothers around, there wasn't much levity on the home front as 
she remembers it ("very Irish Catholic sort of repressed family"). 
</P>
<P>
 Her career had gotten off to a now-infamous start. At 16, she walked into a 
local club and delivered a killer routine lifted -- verbatim -- from an 
up-and-coming young comic named Jerry Seinfeld. After the other comics on the 
bill nearly had her dismembered for the infraction, she met with a far scarier 
realization: This comedy thing was going to require her to create her own 
jokes.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was like 'Holy ----, that's horrible. How am I going to write material? I'm 
not a writer.' I was so mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she stuck with it. In 1984, she won several episodes of "Star Search" 
(though not the coveted grand prize), moved to Los Angeles and two years later 
found herself on the NBC series "Gimme a Break." Then came emcee duties on 
VH-1's "Stand-Up Spotlight," which capitalized on the comedy boom and perhaps 
even precipitated its bust, allowing in-home access to some of the same 
routines that comics were peddling in clubs around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her leap to feature films came when she was cast as best friend and teammate 
to Madonna's character in "A League of Their Own." The friendship ultimately 
extended into real life and, both confirm, it continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a mega-star's pal has shown her something of the price of fame. "Coming 
to know (Madonna) and love her as a human being brought me to a different 
awareness of what that kind of media image does to someone," O'Donnell says. 
Superstardom is now far from something she aspires to, though she admires her 
friend's attempts to live somewhat normally in spite of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is recognized, but she does go places," O'Donnell insists. "I mean, we go 
the mall; we go to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna goes to the mall?  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we've been to the mall. It's not easy always, but on the whole people 
leave her alone in some capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary, though. She's very, very famous." 
</P>
<P>
 And what does Madonna have to say about her pal, Rosie? 
</P>
<P>
 "My friendship with Rosie has nothing to do with image," the pop diva 
commented earlier this week. "I cannot explain the mystery of what happens when 
you become best friends with someone. I can only say that we are tortured by 
the same things, we laugh at the same things, and I love her madly!" 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, neither Rosie's own celebrity status nor that of her famous friend 
has soured Rosie on the media, even the tabloid variety. She is a huge fan of 
court TV, "Hard Copy," "A Current Affair" and Connie Chung interviews with 
plea-bargaining skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm obsessed with all those tabloidy things. Like the Michael Jackson thing 
and the Menendez brothers. I was glued to court TV. Absolutely glued." 
</P>
<P>
 And, like the tabloid media, her convictions sometimes are influenced by 
popular opinion and circumstantial evidence. For instance, she stands squarely 
behind most professed victims of abuse -- Lorena Bobbitt, Erik and Lyle 
Menendez, Michael Jackson's accusers -- no matter what their own crimes may be, 
but has no sympathy for Harding, who also reportedly was abused as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I totally love Nancy Kerrigan, I totally cannot stand Tonya Harding. And 
everyone says, 'Oh, that's not fair; you don't know that she is guilty' . . . I 
don't care. I'm totally a victim of the media, and I think that (Harding) is a 
horrible person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to fly to Lillehammer just so I could be in the Boo Tonya Festival." 
</P>
<P>
 Tongue still in cheek, she adds that because she's followed the case so 
closely, she deserves a part in whatever movie of the week comes out of it. Her 
role of choice? Harding's former bodyguard, burly Shawn Eckardt, who is 
suspected of arranging the attack on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Jackson's troubles, O'Donnell -- who says she met the singer some 
months ago when he accompanied Elizabeth Taylor to the set of "The Flintstones" 
(Taylor is playing Wilma Flintstone's mother) -- expresses sympathy but does 
not entirely dismiss accusations of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a tragedy in so many ways," she says. "It forces people to look at 
the issue of child abuse and the ramifications and the implications of what 
happens generationally if it's not treated. And also what happens when someone 
is so famous that the people around him lose their perspective on right and 
wrong, and allow or condone or hide or enable behavior that ultimately kills 
the person. Whether it is Elvis Presley with drugs or Michael Jackson with 
whatever his demons are that he is struggling with, it's really unnerving." 
</P>
<P>
 To those who say Jackson never could be guilty of such behavior, O'Donnell 
replies somewhat indignantly: "You know, they say that about priests; they say 
that about people's fathers and their brothers and the elementary schoolteacher 
and the soccer coach. They say it about every man who is accused of (child 
molestation). 'He would never . . . ' Well, guess what? The statistics show 
that one out of four girls and one out five boys in the United States is 
molested before the age of 18. Wake up." 
</P>
<P>
 Prone to such candid comments, O'Donnell is a press agent's nightmare. And she 
knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult, because my publicist (Susan Geller in L.A.) will say, 
'You know, you don't have to tell everyone the truth.' Because somebody asked 
(early on during the 'Grease' tour), 'How is it to work with Tommy Tune?' and I 
said, 'I haven't worked with Tommy Tune; he was there only three days.' Susan 
goes, 'Well, look at how it looks.' Well, it's the truth. What do you expect me 
to say? 'It's great to work with Tommy! The thing about Tommy is . . . ' You 
know, because I don't know!" 
</P>
<P>
 Such honesty might rattle cages in Hollywood and New York, but it also tends 
to endear O'Donnell to the press, which, again, she professes to resent only 
minimally, despite the national affinity for media-bashing. She even is 
philosophic about the occasional misquote, unflattering photo or outright lie 
that pops up in stories about her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get away unscathed," she says flatly. "They're going to print 
something. And I've been really lucky because the press has been really nice to 
me. And I'll stop wherever I am -- even if I look like crap -- I say, 'Go ahead 
and take the picture,' because they are trying to get the job done and it's 
part of the game, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Next up in the game, movie-wise, is the release of "The Flintstones," a Steven 
Spielberg production that O'Donnell hopes has blockbuster written all over it. 
But even if it bombs at the box office, she's already realized a dream as a 
result of the project: 
</P>
<P>
 She is a Happy Meal figurine. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it's actually Betty Rubble's likeness that is poised to become a prize in 
McDonald's fast-food version of the Cracker Jacks box. But O'Donnell, who long 
has been a collector of Happy Meal toys herself ("I have like hundreds"), is 
thrilled to be even this close to immortalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Following "The Flintstones," O'Donnell's screen image will take a dramatic 
turn -- she goes from fleshing out a cartoon to showing more of her own flesh 
than we've ever seen before. In "Exit to Eden," based on the Anne Rice novel, 
she plays an undercover cop who goes to an adult-themed fantasy island to solve 
a drug-smuggling caper. The role, reportedly turned down by Sharon Stone, 
includes a semi-nude scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nearly nude," O'Donnell reports. "Nude enough to scare people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in S & M sort of clothing, and it's really not that much different from 
wearing a one-piece bathing suit, but I have enough problems wearing a 
one-piece bathing suit at family parties, nevermind in front of all of America 
in a film. So I took it in a way to get over my own problems about my body 
image and to try to face the things that I fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Weight control always has been something of a demon for O'Donnell, but it 
hasn't stopped her from cultivating a love of athletics. The baseball skills 
she brought to "A League of Their Own" were genuine. And now, she says, she has 
a movie in development at Disney about a former basketball star who gave up her 
college scholarship when she became pregnant, but comes back to the game years 
later as coach of a high school girls' team. The film, "Girl Hoops," which she 
wrote and would star in, is expected to begin shooting early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the only athletic skills she is mastering are yo-yo-ing, 
bubble-blowing, Hula-Hooping, hand-clapping and smooching, all of which she 
does often and enthusiastically in "Grease."  
</P>
<P>
 She says that one day she might like to do a Letterman-esque type talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the perfect training. 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Grease," starring Rosie O'Donnell.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: BARRENCE WHITFIELD WITH TOM RUSSELL, "COWBOY MAMBO", ESD  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These Northeasterners don't have the profile of the singers featured on 
"Rhythm, Country & Blues," a hot-selling new album of duets between country and 
R&B stars. But "Cowboy Mambo" is similar in concept, and the meeting results in 
a sampler of American roots music that is wide-ranging, well-chosen and solidly 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitfield is a Boston-based bandleader known for rollicking stage shows 
grounded in the rock 'n' soul tradition of Little Richard, James Brown and 
Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Russell, who lives in Brooklyn, is a highly regarded 
writer of progressive-country songs, having written such gems as "Navajo Rug" 
(with Ian Tyson) and "Outbound Plane" (with Nanci Griffith). Dave Alvin sought 
him out as a writing partner, and there's no higher endorsement for a 
songwriter than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cowboy Mambo," the second album Whitfield and Russell have made together, 
doesn't confine itself to crossing country with R&B. Instead, the duo seems 
bent on proving that, in the vast field of roots music, every strain is 
transplantable. Among the highlights are a charging rock version of a Richard 
Thompson nugget, "I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight"; an urgent 
Memphis-soul reading of the Pop Staples civil rights anthem, "Freedom Highway," 
and a graceful rendering of Gram Parsons' bittersweet lament, "Brass Buttons." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hallmarks of authentic roots music is an emotional duality that 
lets us confront sadness and anxiety with music that makes us want to dance 
troubles away. That's covered here in "A Little Wind," a seriocomic Louisiana 
Zydeco stomp written by Russell and L.A. rock stalwart Peter Case. Another 
prime original is Russell's plaintive ballad, "Home Before Dark," which sets 
aside the possibility of a carefree response to troubles and probes deeply into 
a mind wracked by the uneasy feeling that something terrible can happen at any 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitfield sings most of the leads in a baritone that sounds like a combination 
of Elvis Costello and The Band's Rick Danko. His trademark banshee scream is 
kept in reserve for sparing and judicious use. Whitfield sometimes fails to 
inhabit a lyric as fully as he might -- he isn't nearly wild enough in playing 
the young outlaw in Steve Earle's "The Devil's Right Hand," and "Insufficient 
Sweetie," an old-time lark that copies the scratchy sound of an old 78 r.p.m. 
record, should have been more funny and vital than it is. But even when 
Whitfield is a bit off, the material is strong enough to compensate. The backup 
band is excellent, dabbing on spirited saxophone, sawing fiddles, warm organ 
and piano, or whatever else is required to fuel this engaging ride along the 
roots-music rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 This CD is available from East Side Digital, 530 N. 3rd St., Minneapolis, MN 
55401.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: JACKSON BROWNE, "SATURATE BEFORE USING" (1972), 
ELEKTRA/ASYLUM  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET KINOSIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jackson Browne made his best record on his first try out. From the tender 
"Jamaica Say You Will" to the emotionally hungry "Song for Adam" and the 
radiant, gospel-drenched "Rock Me on the Water," he wrote convincingly of what 
it was to be a young, sensitive man grown up in the '60s, afflicted by 
post-'60s fallout.There is a longing, spiritual undercurrent to his voice, 
accentuated by some of the best studio musicians of the time (Russell Kunkel on 
drums, Leland Sklar on bass, Craig Doerge on piano -- the same group that 
played on most of the James Taylor and Carole King records back then). 
"Saturate's" tone is sparse but warm, Browne's vision deeply intelligent, the 
tempo even; this is the world before '70s glam invaded everything. The focus is 
always clearly on Browne, his guitar and his words. And if that voice singing 
harmony sounds familiar, it's a nice, Woodstock-era sound, too: David Crosby.

THE CORNER BAR: NIEUPORT 17 PASSES WITH FLYING COLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you haven't been to Nieuport 17 in a while and are still using the name as 
a mnemonic device to remember that it's on 17th Street in Santa Ana, you're 
using the wrong mnemonic device. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it's not on 17th Street anymore. It's on Newport Avenue. Owner Bill 
Bettis moved the veteran restaurant to the corner of Newport Avenue and Irvine 
Boulevard in Tustin about four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, if you insist on using word association, use Nieuport. That's the name 
of a World War I-era airplane, and the touchstone of one of the more impressive 
collections of aviation art and memorabilia anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're a regular, drinking at Nieuport 17 is like taking a cram course 
in aircraft identification. Throughout the restaurant -- but particularly in 
the bar -- the walls are covered (read: COVERED!) with oils, prints, photos, 
signed portraits of famous pilots, letters from the Wright brothers, even a 
tail hook from a Navy fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Aviation talk often holds sway here, although it doesn't necessarily come from 
the mouths of active-duty pilots. Nieuport 17 has become a kind of club for 
dozens of retired, mostly military flyboys, a handful of whom have presented 
Bettis (himself a retired Navy pilot) with pictures of themselves and their 
planes to hang on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll notice a preponderance of photos of the Navy's Blue Angels team. During 
the week of the El Toro Air Show, Bettis has hosted the team at a large dinner 
at the restaurant (last year he hosted the Air Force Thunderbirds). 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also notice that this isn't the same cozy bunker of a bar that was the 
Nieuport 17 of old. Bettis intended to build a big, turreted place along the 
lines of a 19th-Century German hunting lodge. That meant an imposing 
high-ceilinged bar with lots of dark burnished wood, regal tasseled drapes, 
military flags, a chandelier made of deer antlers and a stone fireplace that 
extends all the way to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 It manages not to be stuffy. A good-sized clutch of regulars continues to use 
the bar as a den-away-from-home. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't make it to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, Nieuport 17 may 
satisfy your craving for aviation history for the time being. Besides, the 
Smithsonian doesn't serve drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieuport 17, 13051 Newport Ave., Tustin. Open daily from 11 a.m.; bar closes 
at midnight Sunday through Thursday, 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday. (714) 
731-5130.

A MOVIE AND A SHAKER . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .; FILM 
IMAGERY INSPIRES ARTIST EILEEN COWIN TO CREATE 'UNDER-YOUR-SKIN KIND OF WORK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS and Cathy Curtis covers art for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the warmth of the sunny morning, artist Eileen Cowin protectively 
wrapped herself in a big white sweater as she perched on a couch in a rented 
Venice house -- her refuge after the Northridge quake destroyed her Culver City 
studio and made her home in Santa Monica uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowin, a longtime art professor at Cal State Fullerton, is known for her 
photographs of people engaged in ambiguous, often mysterious actions that look 
as though they might be moments from a film. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mixed-media installation "A Form of Ecstasy" is part of "Love in the 
Ruins: Art and the Inspiration of L.A," a group show at the Long Beach Museum 
of Art that evokes Los Angeles' dual identity as a sunny paradise and a locus 
of natural and man-made disaster. (The roster of artists also includes John 
Baldessari, Uta Barth, Vija Celmins, Russell Crotty, John Divola, Judy Fiskin, 
Catherine Opie, Jorge Pardo, Lari Pittman, Edward Ruscha and 11 others.) 
</P>
<P>
 "My work before the earthquake was about fear," Cowin said. "So I thought, to 
be in a show called 'Love in the Ruins' was so perfect. . . . I don't believe 
(the earthquake) is a message from God. I don't believe in that at all. But 
there is something in this idea of the handwriting on the wall, things being 
out of control. That 30 seconds of 'out of control' changed our life. There was 
nothing you could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything stopped. A lot of people remember the car alarms going off. But to 
me, there was something that seemed horrifyingly silent -- as if you were stuck 
in mud or quicksand or something. . . . It was chaos, but a chaos that was 
silent. In the (Akiro Kurosawa) movie 'Ran,' there is one part where a battle 
scene comes on and there's no sound. It's a silent battle. It's out of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cowin's piece, shown in a darkened room, three black-and-white 
photo-transparencies are illuminated like apocalyptic signs. A pen is poised as 
if writing by itself in a lined book. A fire -- taken from video footage -- 
seems to be burning out of control. An owl and a hawk perch next to each other 
in a luminous flurry of feathers: One looks toward the fire while the other 
seems to stare at the viewer. Juxtaposed with these images is a video 
projection of the lower portion of a woman's face. Almost imperceptibly, as if 
mutating from a still to a video image, the woman's mouth forms soundless 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the impassive, sculptural qualities of the woman's face give her a 
strong presence, she's actually saying things such as, "I don't know" or "Thank 
you very much." Such "polite little phrases," Cowin said, are related to the 
idea that "being mute has to do with being powerless -- that people make you 
powerless." 
</P>
<P>
 Eclectic movie references continually crop up in Cowin's conversation, and it 
comes as no surprise that film imagery inspires her carefully orchestrated 
tableaux. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rent videos and make stills from them to study lighting and gesture and 
things like that," she said. "On my studio wall in my other life, I had 
gestures of people doing things from all different films." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowin's movie binges date to her childhood in New York during the 1950s and 
'60s.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been interested in film as a pure, 'I'm-so-depressed- 
I-need-to-go-to-the-movies' escape," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an art student at the State University of New York at New Paltz, she 
attended campus film screenings almost every night. At the same time, with the 
influence of Pop Art, she began combining her drawing and printmaking with 
photographic images drawn from the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she started posing members of her family in deliberately stagy 
scenes evoking undercurrents of tension and anxiety, and these images remain 
her best-known work. But for the past decade, she has hired models to 
investigate other kinds of edgy relationships, particularly between men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 "A museum director once told me that he was interested in 'in-your-face' 
work," Cowin said. "I walked away from that discussion thinking, 'Well, I'm 
interested in the under-your-skin kind of work.' Did you ever see 'Tremors'? 
It's the stupidest movie, about these creatures you see crawling under the 
earth, and all of a sudden they pop up in front of you. . . . It's that sort of 
feeling of things crawling in your skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I give lectures, people will ask why I don't do film. And I say, 
'Because I'm interested in that ultimate moment, that high moment when you 
don't know whether or not it's going to go this way or that way.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In "Between the Beasts and the Angels," a piece Cowin showed in 1991 at Roy 
Boyd Gallery in Los Angeles, "the entire room was an open narrative," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were surrounded by images: a couple embracing, an owl, a door floating in 
space, two women struggling, a black woman covering her mouth (from which smoke 
is escaping), a woman with a tear welling down her face. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "You were supposed to feel an open-ended idea of unresolved narrative which 
starts in a direction and thwarts that direction and leaves you someplace else. 
It's about danger lurking, struggles, and relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 That show "opened the week of the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings. A lot 
of people interpreted (the piece in terms of) deceit and lying and 
your-word-versus-mine, and who has the power. . . . It was a perfect 
framework." 
</P>
<P>
 The spark for another recent work by Cowin (not in the Long Beach show) was a 
passage from Milan Kundera's novel "Immortality," in which he likens events in 
daily life to land mines: "The majority of them never explode, but the most 
unremarkable of them may someday turn into a story that will prove fateful to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Land Mines" is about "that whole thing of something exploding and you're not 
knowing it was going to happen," Cowin said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why was I doing this piece before the earthquake? It's creepy to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The piece includes such images as a man covering his head with a pillow as a 
dog watches, a woman trying to force her foot into a shoe that's too small for 
her, a deer caught in car headlights (staged with a 10-inch toy deer and a 
lamp), and a curiously menacing shot of someone getting a facial, from the 
Roman Polanski thriller "Repulsion." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, what frustrates people about my work," Cowin said, "is that 
it has the look of a narrative, but it doesn't satisfy (the urge to know how 
things turn out). But we get that (form of resolution) on television. What's 
interesting for me is how (an event like) a wrong turn on your way to work can 
change your whole life. I get you to that turn in the road and then I leave 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowin agrees that this approach can be troublesome to viewers.  
</P>
<P>
 "But one of the things I also try to do -- which I've always been involved 
with whether it was chic or not -- is to make my work look beautiful. I do it 
with lighting, so that you're attracted, physically attracted to it. That's the 
seduction, the form of ecstasy. There's something beautiful, but lurking 
underneath, there's this terror."

DO IT!: CARLSBAD CHILDREN'S RACE PAVES WAY FOR SERIOUS RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you expand when you're not only one of the most popular 5-kilometer 
road races going, but also the fastest, with eight world records broken in the 
last eight years? 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, the Carlsbad 5000 has answered that question by going after 
young runners, 12 and under, to help provide a base for road racing's future. 
The youngsters, however, won't be getting in the way of the world-class 
athletes who have been invited to compete: The fifth annual Junior Carlsbad 
will be held Saturday, whereas the Carlsbad 5000 goes off Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Junior Carlsbad is a series of 10 separate races, ranging from a mile to a 
quarter-mile, run in the streets of downtown Carlsbad (off Interstate 5 in 
north San Diego County). There will even be 25-yard "Toddler Trots" for 
children 3 and under. 
</P>
<P>
 Fun, not speed, is the focus. Each participant receives a medal, a pack of 
trading cards and a race T-shirt. Celebrity athletes, including Steve Scott, 
will sign autographs and hand out awards. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the spotlight will return to pure speed. Among the invited athletes 
scheduled to compete are Colleen DeReuck of South Africa and Shelly Steely of 
the United States. Battling it out in the men's race, among others, will be 
1992 winner and world-record holder William Mutwol of Kenya and Phillimon 
Hanneck of Zimbabwe, last year's winner. They will compete for a $40,000 total 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's race will also have room for more than the very best. In fact, more 
than 8,000 runners are expected, along with about 25,000 spectators. The 
post-race festivities include a fitness fair, a micro-brewery beer garden and 
live reggae music. 
</P>
<P>
 The field is so big that starting times have been staggered. A masters race, 
for men and women 40 and older, will begin at 7:30 a.m.; a women's race at 8:15 
a.m.; men 29 and under at 9 a.m.; a wheelchair invitational at 9:30 a.m., and 
men 30 to 39 at 9:35 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's highlight for spectators, the invitational race, starts at 10:15 
a.m. Mutwol ran the course (3.1 miles) in 13 minutes, 11.7 seconds in 1992, a 
world record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Junior Carlsbad and Carlsbad 5000. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Junior Carlsbad begins Saturday, March 26, at 7:20 a.m. First race of 
Carlsbad 5000 starts Sunday, March 27, at 7:30 a.m. (Registration opens at 6:30 
a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Carlsbad Village, Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take Interstate 5 south to Carlsbad Village Drive and head west. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: Junior Carlsbad entry is $12. Carlsbad 5000 entry is $22. Both 
fees include T-shirt.

REWIND: PLAYING CAT AND MOUSE IN 'JACKAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the suspenseful "Day of the Jackal," a master assassin hired to kill French 
President Charles de Gaulle works to complete his mission while government 
detectives race to uncover his identity and stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth, begins as French generals 
are plotting to kill the president and entice an assassin known only as "the 
Jackal" to do the job. Police soon discover the plot but have no idea who the 
hit man is or when he may strike. Worse, the president insists on maintaining a 
schedule of risky public appearances and refuses extra security measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Fox is the Jackal, a villain who's all the more menacing because his 
attitude is so matter-of-fact and businesslike. In a scene in which an 
accomplice blackmails him, the assassin responds without anger or threats, but 
it is clear that his smug partner can measure his remaining life in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the film follows the Jackal as he prepares for his mission, doing such 
tasks as getting passports to match his disguises and a collapsible rifle 
capable of firing explosive-tipped bullets. Dialogue is often sparse because he 
is alone in many of the scenes, preparing, planning and evading capture, but 
the action is involving because it reveals only one small piece of his plan at 
a time.  
</P>
<P>
 Michel Lonsdale plays Claude Lebel, the police commissioner who is charged 
with the seemingly impossible task of identifying and capturing the assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrewd and thorough Lebel is up to the task. When he unmasks the source of 
an information leak among more than a dozen cabinet-level officials, they 
challenge him to provide evidence. So he plays a recording of one of the 
officials' lovers phoning information about the investigation to the 
conspirators. Later, the impressed prime minister tells him: "There is one 
thing, though. How did you know whose telephone to tap?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't," Lebel replies. "So I tapped all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie unfolds as a kind of chess game between an assassin bent on taking a 
life and a detective determined to save one. Each employs move and countermove, 
hoping to catch the other off balance and strike the final blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Day of the Jackal" (1973), directed by Fred Zinnemann. 143 minutes. Rated PG.

SPECIAL SCREENING: HEPBURN AND TRACY FIND ROMANCE AT WORK IN 'DESK SET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy had become so comfortable with each other 
by the time "Desk Set" came out in 1957 that sometimes it looks as if she could 
drape the older, bulkier and pleasantly rumpled Tracy over her shoulder like a 
familiar coat. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happens when you put a pair of natural actors together, then 
factor in the easy friendship they had developed over the years. Hepburn and 
Tracy were something special, and there's never been much mystery surrounding 
the good vibrations the couple could generate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovers off-screen, they were more than relaxed in each other's space, even in 
the artificial world of a sound set. What was so remarkable is how welcomed 
audiences felt watching them; movies turn us all into voyeurs, but you never 
felt invasive eyeing Tracy and Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desk Set" (screening Friday afternoon as part of the Cypress Senior Citizen 
Center's ongoing free film series) isn't the first of their collaborations that 
comes to mind. It followed "Woman of the Year" (1942) and "Adam's Rib" (1949), 
after Hepburn and Tracy had already fixed their reputations. But it's still a 
witty, often diverting romantic comedy that further demonstrates how well the 
duo fit.  
</P>
<P>
 This time out, Tracy plays Richard Sumner, a computer expert brought in to 
streamline operations at the Federal Broadcasting Co. TV station. One of his 
targets is the research department, run by Hepburn's Barbara (Bunny) Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 They're both fastidious and smart in their own ways -- he compulsively 
measures everything, crawling on all fours through Bunny's office. She's like a 
computer herself, remembering the most obscure details about the oddest things 
-- but also funny. They're amused by life; it breaks through their 
self-contained brilliance all the time, making them laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunny doesn't start out giggling over Richard, though. She knows he could mean 
trouble for her and her staff of wisecracking assistants (Joan Blondell, Dina 
Merrill and Sue Randall), but she's eventually attracted to him. Proving that 
three is company is Gig Young as smooth, likable Mike, the boyfriend who's been 
dating the marriage-minded Bunny for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 This could have been a frail venture if not for Hepburn and Tracy, but 
director Walter Lang's silky touch and screenwriters Henry and Phoebe Ephron's 
smart dialogue also raise it. Just one example: There's a hilarious scene on 
the rooftop where Richard gives Bunny what amounts to an IQ test, asking her 
the strangest questions, which she answers with all the charm of a lovable 
brainiac. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's cherished computer is also a hoot, especially when we think of that 
tiny PC many of us have at home. This was the '50s, remember, a time when 
technology was boss and the computer was one of the beacon lights of a new age. 
But they were also huge contraptions, filling entire rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards' "Emmarac" is billboard size, with all the flashing lights and funny 
electron-crackling sounds we've come to expect of early computers. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also an inside joke: Hollywood felt threatened by still-fledgling 
television in the '50s, and the imposing Emmarac is not-so-affectionately 
called "Emmy" -- a straight jab at the industry's most coveted prize. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Walter Lang's "Desk Set." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, March 25, at 12:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Cypress Senior Citizen Center, 9031 Grindlay St., Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Gabriel River (605) Freeway to Lincoln Avenue and 
head east to Grindlay Street, then go right.

 Two local restaurants have recently received phony dry cleaning bills, and 
they are warning others to watch out. Thee White House in Anaheim and La Vie en 
Rose in Brea were billed for payment to remove a spot from a silk jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to let everyone know" to be careful of these hoaxes, said Bruno 
Serato, owner of Thee White House. 
</P>
<P>
 About one year ago, many local restaurants received similar phony bills -- 
including J.W.'s, Bistango and the Cellar. The bills are so small that 
restaurateurs often pay them without double-checking. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, the maitre d' at La Vie en Rose detected the problem 
because he remembered that he had not served rack of lamb on the night in 
question, which was the meal the phony diner claimed to have eaten.

RESTAURANTS: CUTS AT 201 MAKE BISTRO A CUT ABOVE 
</P>

<P>
 There are crowds at Bistro 201 again, now that it has lowered its prices and 
moved closer to its bistro roots. This Irvine showpiece restaurant has never 
lacked style. Now it's even a fiscally sensible place to dine. 
</P>
<P>
 You enter it through a long, sleek cocktail lounge that uses a classy, 
zinc-topped bar as its centerpiece. The main dining room is comfortably daring: 
high ceiling, beige marble floor, inlaid walls in earth tones, soft Diva lights 
perched above lush booths of raw silk. Beyond it, there's a lovely outdoor 
patio. 
</P>
<P>
 The patio actually isn't being used at the moment, which is a pity, but 
perhaps it will open soon.  
</P>

 Bistro 201 has a strategic location adjacent to Koll Center, making it a 
logical choice for Orange County's power lunchers. It's great people-watching 
territory. A large percentage of the customers come decked out in their best 
Zegna or Armani fashions, to see and be seen -- and more importantly, to do a 
little impromptu networking. 
</P>
<P>
 The art of eating is equally serious business here. The restaurant remains the 
jewel in the crown of West Coast Restaurant Ventures (owners of Diva, Topaz 
Cafe and Zuni Grill, among others). Co-founder and creative force David Wilhelm 
has parted company with it, along with previous chef Alec Lestr (a protege of 
Los Angeles' kitchen-meister Joachim Splichal). That has put this kitchen back 
into the hands of the company's executive chef, the well-traveled and immensely 
capable John Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe immediately reduced prices by 25%, pruning much of the haute cuisine 
element that Lestr brought to the menu during his tenure. "Irvine is not Los 
Angeles," he says, "and Bistro 201 is not Patina." What all this means is more 
homey foods such as beef brisket on a bed of mashed potatoes and fewer of the 
luxury seafoods, the labor-intensive creations and the exotic dishes that 
Sharpe says didn't catch on.  
</P>
<P>
 The appetizers have definitely gotten simpler. There are delicious Fanny Bay 
oysters from the Pacific Northwest in a light mignonette sauce with a small 
chunk of chicken sausage. The sharp and muscular Caesar salad is garnished with 
tangy sourdough croutons, and you can get fat grilled shrimp served on a mushy 
polenta tinged green with a pungent pesto sauce. A creamy tapenade of olives -- 
a fixture here since Day One -- is among the most habit-forming spreads 
anywhere, and the various house breads are perfect foils for it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best dishes is a filling pasta called rustic noodles -- twisty, 
egg-rich helixes that fall somewhere between sheet-like pappardelle and 
corkscrew-shaped fusilli. They are dressed up with smoked chicken, mushrooms 
and fresh herbs, emphasis on the word smoked . I find the powerful smokiness 
pleasing, but not everybody will. 
</P>
<P>
 Many dishes grace both the lunch and dinner menu. The one difference: no 
sandwiches at dinner. The sandwich list includes a tempting turkey club on 
homemade bread and the bistro burger. The latter, a patty of top-grade meat 
about twice the size of anything served in local hamburger emporia, is one of 
the county's thickest and juiciest.  
</P>
<P>
 Salads such as the one with grilled rare ahi tuna are big lunch favorites, 
too. And a trencherman's appetite is required for the smoked-chicken Cobb, 
another lunch standby. Sharpe prepares it with a scandalous amount of cooked 
chicken, crumbled bacon, blue cheese, diced avocado and chopped tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrees are generally hearty, though few remind me of anything served in 
an actual Paris bistro. Steamed clams and crisp roast chicken come closest. The 
clams are served in a soup bowl, mingled with leek, garlic and the homey mashed 
potatoes that the restaurant made its reputation with. The good roast chicken 
gets a similar treatment with garlic sauce and mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had fine fish here, such as flaky, tender roasted sea bass in a light 
whole-grain mustard sauce and a rather esoteric salmon creation in a potato 
crust that recalls chef Splichal's influence up in Los Angeles. In the poultry 
division, this kitchen afflicts duck with a sun-dried sour cherry sauce, taking 
a perfectly beautiful bird and turning it into something halfway between main 
course and dessert. (I wish someone around here would have the wisdom to serve 
duck with grown-up flavorings like olives or turnips -- preferred in rural 
France -- instead of these endless sweet sauces.) 
</P>
<P>
 The official dessert list remains spectacular, if slightly more haute than 
bistro law strictly allows. You can still get a good chocolate souffle here, a 
fudgy puff steaming with melted Belgian chocolate. Sharpe has the good sense to 
top it with nothing more than chocolate sauce and whipped cream, and the 
combination is excellent. The hot apple tart with caramel sauce is another 
model of a dish, and the creme brulee is positively silken. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, I like to have a homemade sorbet, or possibly the warm brioche and 
raspberry pudding . . . if I don't have anything else to do for the entire rest 
of the afternoon, that is. This just might be the world's richest bread 
pudding. Everything doesn't have to make sense in a sensible restaurant, and 
this ultra-rich dessert, thankfully, is one of the things that doesn't. 
</P>
<P>

$8.25 to $10. Entrees are $9.75 to $16.95. Desserts are $3.50 to $6.25.

LOST IN O.C.: TURNING 39 GIVES A GUY PLENTY TO CHEW ON

<P>
 I have lived to see the self-adhesive postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress like that I can understand, as opposed to grasping whether the 
computer I'm buying has "Pentium upgradability." But it is all of this progress 
that is starting to make me feel really old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say, Sonny, we used to lick them stamps." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, sure, Gramps." 
</P>
<P>
 I just had a birthday and turned the Jack Benny age, and I really don't care. 
So I'm old. Give me a discount coupon and shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 I think mine might be the first generation to go straight to being old without 
bothering to stop first at adulthood. I look back at parents like mine and all 
previous generations and wonder: How the hell did they ever get so responsible 
? They actually got pleasure out of getting a new patio laid or understanding 
their finances. They knew which fork to use and how to compose a business 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm 39, and my chief expenditures are still breakfast cereal and electric 
guitars. I don't have a checking account and only got a credit card so I could 
rent videos, which I wind up not doing anyway because I become genuinely 
furious every time I'm handed a rental form loaded with needless prying 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 I determined not to do certain things until I was 40. Hence, at 39, I still 
don't know how to tie a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 This leads to occasions like one time some years back when I happened to be 
getting sued by Bruce Springsteen and CBS for $1.5 million, which sounds a 
whole lot more interesting than it actually was, not that I won't write about 
it in some future column when I'm desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, I had to be at a deposition hearing upon which my future, or at 
least $1.5 mil of it, hinged, and found myself standing in CBS's prestigious 
Century City law firm's prestigious parking garage, putting my tie on. But 
since I couldn't put it on myself, it was accomplished by a friend, who had to 
stand behind me awkwardly pretending my neck was his in order to figure out how 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, we looked like Ray Milland and Rosie Grier in "The Thing With Two 
Heads." Several high-powered lawyers walked by looking at us, their ties 
knotted perfectly. There's really not much you can say in situations like that, 
except "Hi." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So I forgot to grow up. Given that we now have a President who likes to amble 
around the White House blatting out "Night Train" on a tenor sax, I'm not going 
to apologize for clinging to my adolescence. There's lots of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day I was talking on the phone to my guitar repairman friend 
Steve Soest. Steve is in his 40s and about as respected as one can be in a 
profession where they use terms like "Stratocaster jack-plate." Yet, right when 
we were in the middle of some important guy-chat about old amplifiers, he 
suddenly exclaimed "Ow!!! That really hurt!" 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that concurrent with talking to me, he and his wife were trying 
out a vintage BB gun, and she shot him. Not intentionally; it was a ricochet, 
she claimed. Whatever the circumstance, I can't tell you what a warm feeling it 
was to find that someone I look up to is still catching BBs. 
</P>
<P>
 I should make a distinction here: I'm not especially in favor of the 
party-hardy kegger consciousness that some adults sustain their whole lives 
through. Rather, I just don't want to become grown-up in the manner that so 
many adults presume grown-up means they have no more growing to do. I want to 
stay open to things, and that often requires a willingness to land on your ass. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining a sense of play is serious business. I think the crucial inner 
battle in life is the choice between living fully or letting your world be 
proscribed by fear. It's scary to let go of life's handrails and see what 
happens next. For all the years -- between water-balloon fights -- that I spent 
studying philosophy and religion, my personal credo has finally been pared down 
to this: Let's see what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
 That means facing life without so many presumptions; letting things happen; 
making things happen, and paying attention when they do. That should all be the 
easiest stuff in the world, and it was back when we were all 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 As I age, though, I have to admit that worry places a widening gap between 
knowing something and living it. 
</P>
<P>
 When playing music, for example, I can get so uptight worrying what the 
audience thinks that it's guaranteed the only thing they are going to think is 
"Hey, does this stuff ever sound uptight!" Knowing that music is supposed to be 
fun, flowing, adventurous and all that good stuff doesn't always help you make 
it so. 
</P>
<P>
 My girlfriend recently got me out on a pair of cross-country skis, and I wound 
up having a blast, but not before I worried about it in every direction. You 
know the way skis point up in the front? I was convinced that if I fell those 
points were precisely positioned to be right where my eyes would land. 
</P>
<P>
 I did finally relax into it, which is more than I can say about recent 
attempts to learn how to roller-skate. There, despite any metaphorical maxims 
about letting go of handrails, that was hard concrete down there, and I was 
clinging like a drowning man to any handy surface. 
</P>
<P>
 If thought is flight, fear is surely gravity, and if there is anything that is 
sure to make you old, it is to worry about getting old. (Feel welcome to stuff 
a fortune cookie with this sentence.) 
</P>
<P>
 If I might offer one small piece of advice gleaned from my ski trip: Do not 
Armor-All the soles of your snow boots, unless you really prefer a 
zero-traction lifestyle. I do recommend the stuff for most other uses, to the 
point where I'm sometimes tempted to Armor-All my teeth. And it is teeth I 
would finally like to discuss today. 
</P>
<P>
 More than most things, it's my molars that make me aware of my mortality. 
Teeth, at least my own, give me the creeps. Maybe it's because they're the only 
part of the skeleton that shows. Maybe it's because, unlike hair, you tend to 
notice more when teeth fall out. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because dentists exult in pointing out the thousands of dollars' 
worth of things that can go wrong with them. And if something as dense and 
simple as teeth are so besieged, what about the hundreds of weird-named glands 
and organs squishing around inside us?  
</P>
<P>
 My most recent dentist once stuck a newfangled fiber optic video camera in my 
mouth, and, blown up hideously on a TV screen, my teeth exhibited the kind of 
rot one usually associates with New Orleans graveyards. I have to admit, 
though, that with the jiggling camera making the teeth look as if they were 
dancing in a sea of pink flesh and saliva, my mouth makes a hell of a rock 
video.

3-HOUR TOUR: TAKING THE TRIAL OUT OF KILLING TIME AT COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, Anne Michaud is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm not saying, exactly, that the court system is plodding. It's just that 
people often find themselves waiting -- whether it's to research cases, receive 
copies of documents, file a complaint or complete some other task. 
</P>
<P>
 If you happen to find yourself with time to kill at Municipal Court in Laguna 
Niguel, there are several amusements in the area that might interest you. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: I love to read, and the courthouse has two nearby locations 
dedicated to that pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, just a short walk south on Crown Valley Parkway, is a branch of the 
Orange County Public Library. If you plan a visit here, however, you'll want to 
check the hours closely. They have been shortened because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The second quiet locale is the Christian Science Reading Room, where one can 
bring a book and relax, undisturbed. This particular reading room, which is 
tucked along a byway in the Crown Valley Mall, has a kids' table, too, filled 
with felt-tip pens and coloring books. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2: Eating is another worthwhile pursuit, and there are some interesting 
venues for that, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Snooty Fox, a couple of doors down from the Reading Room, serves hearty 
diner fare. The hamburgers are juicy, served with fries for $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Another eatery is inside the Apple-a-Day Health Foods store, also at the Crown 
Valley Mall. It's not apparent from the outside that this cozy shop contains a 
counter where sandwiches, salads and health shakes are served. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices are $1.25 for herbal tea and $4.25 for a large Laguna Tuna sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, you might want to take a quick shop around Apple-a-Day. Herb 
remedies, vitamins, natural cosmetics and books on health are sold here. 
</P>
<P>
 The health-conscious will also appreciate the Farm to Market grocery store 
across the street from the Crown Valley Mall. Farm to Market sells organically 
grown produce and bulk items: coffee, cereals, roasted soybeans and whole-wheat 
apple bars. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3: If you don't mind a short walk or drive, there is a beautiful park 
just half a mile north of the courthouse, along Crown Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crown Valley Community Park is good to its name. It contains a community 
soccer field, a baseball diamond and an outdoor swimming pool that anyone can 
use for $1.50 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The park has also considered kids. To the right of home base is a T-ball stand 
for batting practice. To the left of the pool is a sandy playground, with a 
mock ship and train and motorcycle for youngsters to climb on. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the park offers a nature walk. The concrete pathways ascend hills, so 
the walks are not for the faint of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Skirting the paths are flowers in purple, yellow, pink and white. As you 
ascend, you gain a view of the house-dotted foothills surrounding Crown Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Birds and crickets sing you along your way. 1. Orange County Public Library

RAMS ORDERED TO MOVE OUT OF PRACTICE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of unsuccessful lease negotiations, the owners of the Los Angeles 
Rams' practice facility told the team Wednesday it must move out by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the Rams imminent eviction from the practice site does not 
bode well for keeping the professional football team playing at Anaheim Stadium 
after next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a positive sign," said Anaheim Councilman Bob D. Simpson. 
"I'm disappointed that it has gotten to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Magnolia School District, which owns the practice site, said 
the Rams' refusal to sign a lease extension left them no alternative but to 
demand that the team vacate the property. The team has created a full-scale 
practice facility at the site, which was formerly a school. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which leases the site from the district and then sublets it to the 
Rams, sent a letter to the Rams Wednesday informing them of the district's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really nothing we can do," City Manager James D. Ruth said. "They are 
contractually obligated to move out." 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, the Rams executive vice president, said he not seen the city's 
notice and would not comment until he received it. But earlier this week, he 
said he did not believe the city and school district would evict the team from 
the Lincoln Avenue practice site and so the Rams had not made plans to find a 
new location. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Shaw is wrong about the district's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about as serious as you can get," Ruth said. "Nobody is bluffing in 
this thing. It's like getting thrown out of your house." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the letter of notice, city officials said they are hopeful that the 
district would reconsider its position if the city and Rams agree to lease 
terms before March 31. The Rams have used the site for the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia School District Supt. Paul S. Mercier said the district might 
reconsider its demand to vacate but would make no promises, especially since it 
had extended its deadline twice before. Furthermore, he said the district 
already has heard from others interested in leasing the site. He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between the city and Rams broke down over a clause in the 
proposed 10-year lease that required the Rams to restore the practice site -- 
formerly the Juliette Low Elementary School -- back to the condition it was in 
before the team moved in 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams wanted the city to share the restoration costs, estimated at $1.2 
million to $1.5 million. The city agreed to pay for some of the costs but not 
enough to please the Rams. The restoration included replacing blackboards, 
sinks, countertops and other things that had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed lease, the team could leave if it exercised an escape 
clause after six months for $250,000. But the team objected to paying both a 
penalty fee and restoration costs to leave the site, both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same restoration clause is in the team's previous lease, which expired 
Dec. 31, meaning the team must now pay those costs before it vacates the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "This process (restoration) must begin immediately," Mercier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercier said the district's notice was not a formal court eviction. But he 
said he does not believe one is necessary. Because the Rams have not signed the 
lease, they have in effect made their own decision to leave, Mercier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems only logical," he said. "I would expect the integrity of a 
professional organization -- such as an NFL team -- would prompt their swift 
action and cooperation" in leaving the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials have hinted that they may sue the city over the practice 
facility dispute. Shaw said Tuesday that the city "breached its contract" with 
the team by not fulfilling a promise to spend $7 million to upgrade the 
existing facility or find the team a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials dispute that claim and say they only offered to find the team a 
new facility if the district decided not to offer the former school.  
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials have said the Rams' attitude in the negotiations for the 
practice site is an ominous indication that they intend to move out of Anaheim 
after next football season. Rams officials already have told the city they will 
exercise an escape clause in their long-term Anaheim Stadium lease May 3 and 
look to move the franchise to another city with greater financial 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams have treated the city abominably," Mercier said. "They showed no 
respect to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has received numerous calls from the community supporting the 
district's and city's stance during the lease negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are disgusted by what they Rams are doing," Mercier said. 
</P>

MORE PAPERS ON NIXON'S CAREER WILL GO ON VIEW; RESEARCH: DOCUMENTS AT 
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY CONCERN HIS EARLY DAYS IN POLITICS AND THE 
NON-PRESIDENTIAL YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of long-awaited documents related to former President Richard 
Nixon's early political career and his non-presidential years will become 
available today for researchers and scholars at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The records, some of which date back 50 years, provide more detail about 
Nixon's public life, including his famous "Checkers" speech and the espionage 
probe of State Department official Alger Hiss that launched the young 
California congressman out of obscurity in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an historic occasion for us," library director John H. Taylor said 
Wednesday. "We have been a museum for the President and a policy forum to 
discuss problems and issues. Now we are offering research capabilities. It is 
that third pillar of the library we are recognizing." 
</P>
<P>
 The collection, unveiled Wednesday during a preview for the news media, 
contains 19,000 photographs, 1,600 books, 130 films, 900 audiotapes of Nixon's 
speeches, and documents that occupy 2,100 feet of shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the records are correspondence with world leaders. There are notes from 
Nixon's extensive travels abroad, campaign material and other personal papers 
that span his years as a congressman, senator and vice president, as well as 
his post-presidential activities. 
</P>
<P>
 There are letters Nixon wrote to his Whittier law firm as a Navy officer 
during World War II, a set of texts from his alma mater, Whittier College, and 
original manuscripts of the books he has written since resigning from the 
presidency in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is everywhere in this collection," said Susan Naulty, the 
library archivist. "He is editing, creating and directing with his fountain 
pen. You can see his thought development and how he conducted business." 
</P>
<P>
 Naulty said, however, that the collection contains no startling revelations 
about Nixon's public life, except that the thousands of records should provide 
a substantial number of answers to questions about his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid out in detail are Nixon's campaigns against Helen Gahagan Douglas for 
U.S. Senate in 1950. His unsuccessful 1962 California gubernatorial campaign is 
there, as well as his campaigns with Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the presidential 
contest with John F. Kennedy in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the ticket as Eisenhower's running mate, Nixon gave his famous 
"Checkers" speech to deny allegations that he was the beneficiary of an $18,000 
fund set up by a wealthy businessman. He said he had received a gift after 
being nominated for vice president, a black and white cocker spaniel that his 
daughter had named Checkers. The collection includes published news reports 
that prompted the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's observations and warnings about communism are reflected in notes he 
took as a member of the Herter Committee that toured Europe after World War II 
to see if the Marshall Plan should be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those concerns are embodied in his papers and correspondence related 
to his work for the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which 
investigated suspected subversion in the U.S. government at the start of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 While serving with the committee, Nixon led the investigation of Alger Hiss, a 
State Department official who was accused of being a Soviet spy. Hiss, who was 
turned into a symbol of Communist infiltration in the U.S. government, was 
ultimately convicted of perjury, not espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges from the thousands of documents is a portrait of Nixon as an 
"extremely attentive and meticulous person," Naulty said. "There is a freshness 
to it and a confirmation of the fact that Nixon was extremely dedicated, worked 
hard and sacrificed substantially." 
</P>
<P>
 Still missing from the subject-title catalogue is the Watergate scandal that 
led to Nixon's downfall in 1974. Two years before a Marine helicopter shuttled 
Nixon from the White House into private life, Congress seized about 44 million 
pages of presidential papers and 4,000 hours of tapes to preserve them for the 
Watergate investigation. The National Archives now stores them at the 
University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the current collection at the Nixon library, about a 16th, some 4,000 to 
5,000 records, has been sorted and organized for firsthand viewing by scholars 
and researchers. The slow, painstaking process has taken about 2 1/2 years and 
is far from finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bulk of the documents have yet to be catalogued, Naulty said, the 
information they contain is still available upon request to scholars, authors, 
journalists and academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Archive administrators will start taking requests for access to the collection 
today. So far, library officials say, about 20 people, mostly scholars, have 
applied for access to the collection. Their names were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the archives is the second major development in about a year at 
the $21-million facility, which includes the simple wooden farmhouse Nixon's 
father built from a kit. Last year, library officials announced plans for a new 
policy center, The Center for Peace and Freedom, which will operate out of 
Yorba Linda and Washington.

FIRE FORCES EVACUATION OF 51; BLAZE: FIVE UNITS IN 3-STORY LAGUNA NIGUEL 
APARTMENT BUILDING ARE DESTROYED. RESIDENTS RUN FOR THEIR LIVES; SOME SAY THEY 
DIDN'T HEAR SMOKE ALARMS. 
</P>

<P>
 A three-alarm fire raced through an apartment building Wednesday, causing an 
estimated $400,000 in damage and forcing the evacuation of 51 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-moving flames swept through the three-story building in the Crown Terrace 
Apartments complex at 30122 Niguel Road shortly after 11 a.m. A woman was 
treated by paramedics for shock and smoke inhalation, but no other injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire was under investigation, Orange County Fire Department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents said they were forced to run for their lives when thick, 
black smoke filled the hallways of the 16-unit building. Some said they did not 
hear the built-in smoke alarm system go off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I smelled something bad and when I opened my door, there was so much smoke 
that you couldn't see anything," said Marilyn Perez, 25, who was home with her 
two children and mother. "I didn't hear anything from the alarms." 
</P>
<P>
 Three other residents said they also did not hear the alarms. Fire officials 
said, however, that they interviewed some residents who heard the alarm system. 
Investigators said it was too early to tell if the system was faulty. 
</P>
<P>
 The managers of the 179-unit Crown Terrace Apartments could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire definitely started in a ground-floor unit," said Orange County Fire 
Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha. "We know there were people inside the 
apartment when the fire started, but we're still trying to find out what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Five apartment units were destroyed by the blaze, fire officials said. Another 
five apartments received smoke and water damage. Concerns over structural 
damage prompted fire officials to close off the remaining six units in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those displaced by the fire will stay at an American Red Cross 
emergency shelter at the Crown Valley Recreation Center at 29751 Crown Valley 
Parkway, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With his cat, Sebastian, draped over his neck like a black fur wrap, Doug 
Crofts, a 26-year-old maintenance worker at the apartments, said he "lost a lot 
of stuff, a lot of personal things. But my cat is safe and I'm going to be just 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 John and Debbie Baynes also managed to save their pets, a pair of red tail boa 
constrictors that wrapped themselves around the couple as they watched the 
building burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hallways were full of smoke when I looked out my door," said John Baynes, 
32, whose apartment was damaged by water. "I got out of there and started 
banging on doors, yelling for everyone to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got all of our animals out, but that was it," he said. "It was a pretty 
scary scene." 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 Orange County firefighters manning 15 trucks battled the blaze, which 
took about 1 1/2 hours to extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was burning real hard when we got here," said Division Chief Richard 
Witesman. "We managed to knock a hole in the roof and got the fire to head 
towards the fresh air at that point. That kept the fire from spreading to the 
outside of the building towards surrounding apartment structures." 
</P>
<P>
 John Nagle, 51, a retired fireman from Tarrytown, N.Y., and resident of the 
burned building, credited firefighters with great efficiency in putting out the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a textbook example of an apartment fire, and these guys did what 
they were supposed to do," he said. "They put it out in a textbook fashion."

SURVEY FINDS WIDE SUPPORT FOR NEW RAIL LINE; TRANSIT: IN POLL, REGISTERED 
VOTERS BY A 3-TO-1 MARGIN FAVOR USING TAX MONEY TO BUILD A FULLERTON-TO-IRVINE 
TRAIN ROUTE, BUT THEIR ENTHUSIASM PLUMMETS WHEN PRICE TAG OF ABOUT $2.1 BILLION 
IS MENTIONED.

<P>
 By better than a 3-to-1 margin, Orange County voters want to spend tax money 
on a proposed Fullerton-to-Irvine urban rail line, a new survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 But support drops to about 50% when they learn the cost would be $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone survey asked 600 registered voters if they back the plans for a 
28-mile train route, which would include stops near Disneyland in Anaheim and 
South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 600 registered voters was conducted from Feb. 26 to March 6 by 
J. Moore Methods of Sacramento for the Orange County Transportation Authority 
and has a possible margin of error of plus or minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine percent said they do not support spending tax money for it, and 
12% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA board is likely to vote on April 11 to seek partial federal funding 
of the proposed rail line and to launch a full study of transit alternatives, 
which is required for federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials on Wednesday were cautiously optimistic about the survey 
results and noted that 62% of the respondents ranked mass transit rail as an 
effective way of reducing traffic congestion. In 1991, that figure was 59%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials said it is too early to decide whether to ask voters for a 
half-cent sales tax hike or to extend the existing half-cent tax, which expires 
in 2012, to help pay for the rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to explore the issue more, and this gives us the 
encouragement to do so," said Sarah L. Catz, a Laguna Beach lawyer who serves 
on the OCTA board as the public's at-large representative.  
</P>
<P>
 County voters approved Measure M, which raised the sales tax half a cent for 
transportation improvements, in 1990. That fund has about $340 million 
earmarked for urban rail. Officials are also counting on some state rail bond 
money and possibly developer contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 47% of the respondents favor raising the county sales tax another half a 
cent to a full penny for rail transit, and 70% favor seeking federal funds for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds support imposing a special smog fee on all vehicles that do 
not meet federal smog guidelines. The least popular taxing methods were 
imposing an employee payroll tax or hiking the gasoline tax by 10 cents a 
gallon.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials were surprised by the relatively low priority given to helping those 
who cannot afford, do not want or cannot operate cars. Only 12% said public 
transit is needed for those people, while 73% said it is needed to provide 
commuters with alternatives to using their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, officials said, voters are concerned about themselves first and they 
prefer that taxes already sent to Sacramento and Washington come back to Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * By more than a 3-to-1 margin, respondents said convenience and ease are very 
important in considering mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 85% rank safety as very important. 
</P>
<P>
 * 56% said the cost of the system compared to the benefits is an important 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who said they opposed rail transit admitted the reason was that it would 
not benefit them personally, even if it did help others. 
</P>
<P>
 And 25% said they simply oppose funding any mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA's Catz said the concern about safety, in her view, relates to fears of 
"being mugged" at or near a transit stop. Others interpreted it to be a concern 
about train derailments. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout California, surveys consistently show that fear of crime is a 
major concern of those who admit they could use mass transit daily but do not. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, an OCTA board member, said that in 
general, the survey results "don't give us a definitive answer" about whether 
to build such a costly rail system. "If I were running a multimillion-dollar 
corporation, I wouldn't want to make a key decision based on this evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said the survey should have tried to answer the following questions: 
How many people who say they want to spend public money on a rail system 
believe that they will be close enough to the route to use it in their daily 
commutes? How many of those who favor the project already use buses and would 
simply substitute a more cost-effective bus trip with a more expensive rail 
trip? 
</P>
<P>
 Such questions may be asked in future surveys, OCTA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Mallinckrodt, a frequent critic of OCTA's rail plans, added that the 
public's support for rail is not surprising, because the lead-in remarks or 
background facts used in survey questions have never told respondents how much 
traffic congestion relief can be bought with $2.1 billion, depending on how it 
is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that $2.1 billion spent on roads buys more congestion 
relief than $2.1 billion spent on rail," said Mallinckrodt, a semi-retired 
radio science engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 In an aside, the OCTA survey showed that 72% of the respondents believe 
California generally is "on the wrong track," compared to 57% who felt that way 
about the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, only 31% said their local community is on the wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials said such questions were asked to gauge whether the respondents 
were in a upbeat mood, which could influence the results. They were slightly 
more optimistic than in a 1993 survey. Price Cools Rail Enthusiasm 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County voters strongly support plans for a 28-mile, Fullerton-to-Irvine 
rail line. But support drops markedly when actual cost figures are attached to 
the project. Seeking more transportation funds, smog fees and extending the 
Measure M tax receive heavy support as ways to pay for the system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Approve or disapprove construction of Fullerton-Irvine rail line: 
</P>
<P>
 Approve: 71% Disapprove: 20 Don't know: 9 * Approve or disapprove spending 
$1.4 billion to $2.1 billion to build and $10 million to $15 million a year to 
operate and maintain rail line: Approve: 49% Disapprove: 39 No opinion: 12 * 
Support or oppose various ways to pay for building new urban rail system and 
subsidizing its operation: 04,46,09,08,09 No Support Oppose opinion Seek more 
state/federal transportation funds 70% 26% 4% Impose smog fees 65 32 3 Extend 
Measure M tax to 40 years total 64 32 4 Increase county sales tax by half a

TRIAL ON SETTLEMENT WITH KING BEGINS; LAPD BEATING: HIS LAWYER SAYS HE STILL 
SUFFERS PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY. JURORS MUST DECIDE HOW MUCH COMPENSATION IS 
JUSTIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after a crude black-and-white videotape brought him worldwide 
recognition, attorneys for Rodney G. King said he still suffers physical pain 
and public humiliation from his beating at the hands of the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Milton Grimes made the remarks during opening statements in King's 
federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and the four police officers who 
took part in the 1991 beating of King in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no private life," Grimes told the 10-member jury shortly after it was 
impaneled to hear King's multimillion-dollar lawsuit. Grimes said his client 
still suffers periodic headaches and dizziness from the police beating, along 
with the embarrassment of being the butt of jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said that even when King attempted to appeal for calm after the 
acquittals of the four officers in the state trial sparked a riot, he was not 
taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he said, 'Can't we get along,' that was taken as a joke," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his remarks, Grimes relived the events of March 3, 1991. He swung a 
steel baton, picked up an electric stun gun and demonstrated kicks to an 
imaginary King on the ground.  
</P>
<P>
 Then he concluded by showing the videotape of the beating -- the key piece of 
evidence in the state and federal trials. Even though all the jurors said they 
had seen it before, it held their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 King is seeking compensation from the city for the permanent injuries and 
mental anguish he suffered at the hands of the police. The city has admitted 
its responsibility for King's injuries, but has left it to the jury to 
determine how much he should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said King has $200,000 in medical expenses and is unable to work in a 
construction job. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Don Vincent said the city has a responsibility to pay 
King for his injuries. But, he said, King does not escape blame because he was 
driving with a blood-alcohol level that was twice the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has decided to pay for the damages to make Rodney King a whole 
person," he said. But he urged that King be compensated in a "fair way for the 
injuries he sustained." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the injuries, he said, "are long gone." 
</P>
<P>
 After the opening statements, Grimes called two witnesses to describe what 
they heard the night of the beating. Dorothy Gibson, who lives near the site of 
King's beating, testified that she heard someone say "Please stop" that night, 
as if he were in pain. Robert Hill, another resident, recalled hearing King 
groan and scream in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John Davies has given King's side three days to present 
its case, and the city will have two days.  
</P>
<P>
 After the jury decides the amount of King's compensation, the trial will move 
to a second phase, in which the jury will determine if individual defendants 
should be required to pay punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit names as defendants the city, former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
and 15 current and former police officers, including the defendants in the two 
previous King trials, Stacey C. Koon, Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and 
Theodore J. Briseno. Koon and Powell were found guilty of civil rights 
violations last year and are serving 30-month sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations to settle the lawsuit out of court have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members could not reach an agreement to raise their offer to 
King, which previously stood at $1.25 million. City lawmakers said privately 
that Grimes' latest offer differed little from what he had demanded months ago. 
They said he asked for $7.5 million, plus attorneys' fees, compared to the $9.5 
million demanded previously. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you add in the attorneys' fees (to the latest offer), there would be 
little or no difference," said one council member, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden said Wednesday that he attempted to persuade his 
colleagues to increase their offer substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said the city could end up paying a great deal more by putting the case 
in the hands of a jury. "The trial can be nothing more than divisive," he said. 
"The members of the council should move to heal this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he has reduced his demand twice, but he refused to reveal the 
amount of his final offer to the city.

HOTELS TARGETED IN UNION DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A union representing Los Angeles-area hotel and restaurant workers launched a 
high-profile organizing campaign Wednesday, marching through Downtown streets 
and taking their demands for better wages and working conditions to city 
officials and tourism representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the people of Los Angeles to know how difficult it is for us to 
survive in these conditions," said Maria Rivera, a 40-year-old hotel employee 
and mother of three who was handing out leaflets explaining the workers' plight 
to visitors at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's action was an effort to galvanize public support for the largely 
invisible corps of hotel maids, restaurant busboys, amusement park workers and 
other tourism mainstays. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8-billion regional tourism industry, the area's second largest after 
manufacturing, employs an estimated 500,000 people, most of them immigrants 
from Latin America and Asia. Fewer than 15,000 work with union contracts; many 
toil for near-minimum wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's coordinated union action, targeting the tourism trade, unfolded a 
day after the Los Angeles police union -- mired in difficult contract 
negotiations with the city -- began posting billboards warning people about 
crime. Mayor Richard Riordan deplored the tactic and tourism industry 
representatives criticized the strategy as potentially harmful to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Local 11 of the Hotel Employees & Restaurant Employees 
Union -- organizers of Wednesday's action -- disassociated themselves from the 
police initiative. Calling their effort a long-term strategy to assist hundreds 
of thousands of workers, Local 11 leaders described the police effort as a 
one-time negotiating ploy that could frighten away prospective visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want tourists to come to L.A., but we want them to come to a union L.A.," 
said Local 11 spokeswoman Madeline Janis-Aparicio. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the same union sparked a furor when it sent out a video to 
convention planners nationwide, contrasting images of Los Angeles-area beaches, 
boutiques and fancy hotels with scenes of the poverty and violence endemic in 
the neighborhoods where many workers reside. The police union plans to 
circulate a videotape highlighting crime in Los Angeles if its contract dispute 
is not settled. 
</P>
<P>
 In leaflets handed out Wednesday on Downtown streets and at Los Angeles 
International Airport, union activists declared: "We are the backbone of L.A.'s 
vital tourism industry -- and we live in poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Escobar, a 37-year-old native of El Salvador and a mother of two who 
was among those outside the Convention Center, lamented: "These hotel owners 
become multimillionaires off our hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Union organizers are currently targeting several Downtown and airport-area 
hotels for unionization drives. Their hope is that successes will eventually 
spread to other service industries in a city not known as a bastion of 
unionism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Union representation is the best way to improve conditions" said Maria Elena 
Durazo, president of Local 11. 
</P>
<P>
 In cities more friendly to unions, such as San Francisco and New York, wages 
of hotel workers often average 50% more than salaries for comparable jobs in 
Los Angeles, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, Durazo said, is seeking so-called neutrality accords from operators 
of new hotels. Under such agreements -- long resisted in Los Angeles, union 
officials say -- management agrees to refrain from opposing organizing drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Durazo and others brought the issue up during meetings Wednesday with Deputy 
Mayor Robin Kramer and representatives of the Los Angeles Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. No guarantees emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Unionists view the tourism trade -- particularly big Downtown and airport-area 
hotels -- as an industry benefiting from a myriad of public subsidies in the 
form of tax breaks, land discounts and other aid. City redevelopment officials 
dispute this view, saying the hotels pay fair market value for their projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, union leaders argue that city officials have a role in helping 
workers improve their standards of living.

COURT CONVENES AT DISASTER SITE; QUAKE: JUDGE LEADS TOUR THROUGH NORTHRIDGE

 The roof line resembles a roller coaster, with all its dips and curves. Every 
window is blown out, and the slats of the vertical blinds beckon like skeletal 
fingers in the breeze. Flies swarm in air heavy with the cloying stench of 
decay. 
</P>
<P>
 Court is now in session, the Honorable William A. MacLaughlin presiding. Enter 
at your own risk. Hard hats required. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailed by three dozen attorneys, engineers, city officials and news crews, 
MacLaughlin walked through the ruins of the Northridge Meadows apartments on 
Wednesday, inspecting the listing hulk that is the key piece of evidence in 
Cerone vs. S.J. Properties 4, the first wrongful death lawsuit to arise from 
the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived at 10:30 a.m. When he left about 90 minutes later, the judge was 
somber after viewing so much destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see what is left of all these peoples' lives in every apartment, it 
gives you great pause. I think it would give anyone pause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building on Reseda Boulevard appears to have been twisted every which way 
before coming to rest atop cars, sofas, beds and trees -- even in the middle of 
what once was a driveway. The walk-though allowed the judge and attorneys to 
decide which sections should be dismantled layer by layer in a costly 
controlled demolition, and which should be razed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the stucco walls have peeled away like paper. Those that still stand 
-- sickeningly skewed in places -- are marked with the grim graffiti of death: 
The black letters "DB" -- for dead body -- had been painted on the walls by 
rescuers who searched for survivors the morning of the temblor. Northridge 
Meadows has become a macabre tourist attraction. Now, it also serves as an 
engineering test laboratory as experts study its construction, hoping to 
improve building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the city of Los Angeles, the complex is a vermin-infested public 
nuisance that must be torn down -- the sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the evidence-gathering continues under a court order preserving the 
building. The buried first floor must be studied before experts can say how and 
why Northridge Meadows collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't be the first time an autopsy has been done in order to determine 
the cause of death," attorney Ned Good said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, who ultimately must decide whether this disaster was an act of God 
or man, or some combination of the two, was but the latest of thousands of 
people who have been drawn to the collapsed building. 
</P>
<P>
 The "looky-loos," as the locals call them, "come day and night," said Sgt. Ed 
Wheelis of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire station. "On 
weekends, there's a big crowd out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The tourists, many from other countries, snap photos, crowd sidewalks and ring 
up profits for nearby restaurants. When last Sunday's 5.3 aftershock hit, for 
example, it sent about 30 people running from King's Mongolian Bar-B-Q at the 
strip shopping center next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen people pose their kids in front of the place like they're at 
Disneyland. It's morbid," said Allen Tharpe, a lawyer for owner Shashikant 
Jogani. 
</P>
<P>
 Police report there have been numerous fender-benders as the curious, riveted 
by the sight, ram into the cars of other rubber-neckers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's traffic was typical. Brakes and tires squealed intermittently.  
</P>
<P>
 A woman who gave her name as Deborah Deadman, of Canoga Park, said she'd 
brought visitors to see the damage. "The hair stands up on the back of your 
neck, just knowing what those people went through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did this building get it so hard when other ones nearby didn't?" asked 
her friend, Sharon Williams of Redding.  
</P>
<P>
 That question cuts to the heart of the lawsuit, and the investigations by 
teams of engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaughlin, a San Fernando Superior Court judge, has been assigned the 
Northridge Meadows litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawsuits are expected to be filed. The families of 10 of the 16 people 
who died have retained lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers allege that owners, builders and architects of the 1972 building 
were negligent. Attorneys for owner Jogani and builder Brian Heller say 
Northridge Meadows was built to code and that the collapse was caused by an 
"act of God" -- the 6.8-magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Northridge Meadows served a dual purpose -- as Exhibit A in the 
coming legal battles and as the courtroom for, literally, an open-air hearing 
about how demolition should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 On his tour, MacLaughlin and the others learned where people died, where the 
more dramatic rescues occurred and where the building pancaked onto first-floor 
apartments and tuck-in parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Each apartment they passed seemed to be a gaping cave of wreckage. Dried 
Christmas trees, lights and ornaments still decorated some balconies. 
</P>
<P>
 After walking through the courtyard, two of the lawyers and the judge ventured 
inside the northwest corner of the building, which pulled away from the rest of 
the building and leaned precariously against a concrete retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you feel the ground start to move, please run," advised Robert M. 
Freedman, one of owner Jogani's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, the building had lurched 12 feet west and eight feet down. A 
section of a rear parking structure also collapsed, leaving one car atop 
another in a twisted "T," right next to a "No Parking" sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "How would you like to be here at 4:30 in the morning with no lights, no shoes 
and people all over screaming, 'Pull me out! Pull me out!' " said Joel E. 
Castro, the Santa Monica lawyer who represents the families of Bea Reskin and 
Ann Cerone, who died in their beds, trapped under the top two floors.

ALASKAN STORM IS POISED TO STRIKE L.A.; WEATHER: EXPECTED DOWNPOUR RAISES 
THREAT OF MUDSLIDES IN AREAS HIT BY LAST YEAR'S FIRES. UP TO TWO INCHES OF RAIN 
AND A FOOT OF SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS ARE PREDICTED.

<P>
 A potent storm from the Gulf of Alaska is expected to pummel Southern 
California with hail, snow, heavy rain and thunder late today, posing a renewed 
threat of destructive mudslides below hills denuded during last fall's 
devastating brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm, which could last through Sunday, is expected to drop up to two 
inches of rain in the Los Angeles area and as much as a foot of snow at 
mountain resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty strong early-spring storm, stronger than usual for Southern 
California," said Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. "There's 
definitely a good possibility of mudslides in the burn areas. And it's going to 
be pretty cold, too, with the snow level down to 3,000 feet in some areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the storm -- which struck Northern California late Wednesday 
and began working its way down the coast -- is expected to move inland across 
Santa Barbara and Ventura counties sometime this afternoon, reaching Los 
Angeles before nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said the precipitation here will begin with light rain, shifting to 
heavier rain, with thunderstorms and hail during the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the thunderstorms could be severe," Thoren said. "That means winds at 
up to 55 m.p.h. and hail as big as three-quarters of an inch in diameter." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service said the rain will continue, off and on but 
occasionally heavy, through Friday and Saturday and possibly into Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Storms like this are hard to gauge, but there's a pretty good moisture tap 
this time," Thoren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures are predicted to be cool during the rest of the week, with highs 
in the Los Angeles area ranging from the low 60s today to the mid-50s on Friday 
and Saturday. Highs at mountain resort levels should remain below freezing 
until the storm departs. 
</P>
<P>
 The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Wednesday was 68 
degrees, after an overnight low of 50. The season's rainfall total stood at 
6.23 inches, less than half the norm of 12.99 inches for the date.

OUTLOOK GRIM IN COUNTY'S EARLY BUDGET DOCUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR and CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In preliminary budget documents released this week, senior managers have drawn 
a bleak picture of a Los Angeles County government beset by outbreaks of 
violence and subject to lawsuits as the population grows increasingly 
frustrated with long lines, reduced services and deteriorating facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 That grave assessment comes as county officials gear up for what promises to 
be a bruising budget battle, with predictions of dire cuts in services and 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts, required in part to close a $900-million deficit in the current 
year's budget, come as demands for county services, including welfare, health 
and recreational facilities are at their peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the process of cutting back is expensive. The Department of Public Social 
Services, for example, is anticipating layoffs of 3,500 workers. To cover the 
one-time costs associated with layoffs, such as paying out vacation and sick 
leave, the department will have to dismiss an additional 170 staffers, a 
"bitter irony," noted department head Eddy S. Tanaka. 
</P>
<P>
 County observers note that there is a certain amount of posturing in early 
budget proposals, and the documents admittedly present worst-case scenarios. 
But Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed, hired on her reputation as a 
tight-fisted fiscal manager, acknowledges that the outlook is indeed grim. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of it is realistic," said Reed, speaking of the dire forecasts. "Whether 
it will be as serious as portrayed we won't know until we do the final 
balancing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed said emphatically that county residents will have to live with 
dramatically reduced services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will only be able to provide services to limited numbers of people and 
they will be the most seriously ill, the most seriously in need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help her prepare the 1994-95 budget, Reed instructed each of the county's 
43 department heads to draft a proposal based on cuts that averaged 36%. The 
suggested cuts ranged from zero for the Sheriff's Department to 95% for the 
Community and Senior Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanaka, asked to trim his budget 36% warned of turbulent times ahead as those 
in need attempt to cope with diminishing services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recently witnessed ominous foreshadows of the probable results in our 
experience with the emergency Food Stamp program after the Northridge 
earthquake," he said. "Some applicants nearly rioted when their needs were not 
met in a matter of hours or days. . . . I have little doubt that at least some 
applicants will respond with rage aimed at my employees and members of the 
public who may be in my office." 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Mental Health Director Areta Crowell, asked to trim her 
operation by 78%, described her 1994-95 budget as the "accelerated 
dismantlement of the public mental health system in the County of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 She said about 6,000 people currently served by her department will have to 
look elsewhere for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell on Wednesday questioned how much longer the health and well-being of 
the community can be maintained in the face of current cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will see these cuts in increased demands on social service, human 
services, law enforcement and increases in the homeless mentally ill," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials found the CAO's target figures so low that they 
wouldn't even respond to them. The district attorney's office, which has been 
battling with Reed in recent weeks over budget matters, did not file a 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors would suffer a proposed cut of about $3.3 million, or 
about 9% of its current $36.6-million budget, said the board's executive 
officer, Larry Monteilh. The budget would require the five supervisors to each 
give up their annual $750,000 discretionary fund that is used for community 
events and organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among significant budget impacts forecast by department heads: 
</P>
<P>
 * As a result of layoffs at the Department of Public Social Services, welfare 
applicants would be required to wait up to 18 weeks before being allowed to 
file for benefits; applicants would be handled by rotating workers rather than 
be assigned a specific, ongoing caseworker; district offices would be closed 
one day a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the department will have to increase its security budget by 25% 
to ensure the safety of employees and the public, necessitating even more 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County public library would close 49 of 87 libraries and lay 
off 160 workers. This would come on top of losses last year that resulted in 
the closure of 10 libraries, severe reductions in service hours, and the layoff 
of 67 permanent and 300 temporary library staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Parks and Recreation is proposing to shut down 59 of 130 
park sites, including 17 of its 33 pools. It would eliminate park police 
patrols and pare back maintenance at the remaining 53 park sites. The 
department will not at this point identify the facilities considered for 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Museum of Natural History is proposing to shut down all of its 
facilities, including the George C. Page Museum in Hancock Park, from Monday to 
Friday and predicted the deterioration and eventual destruction of key exhibits 
due to maintenance cuts. School tours and other educational services would be 
eliminated. The department has been asked to absorb a 38% cut in funding, 
reducing its budget to $6.1 million.

MTA TO STUDY RAISING FARES, CUTTING ROUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To help close a severe budget shortfall, the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority may consider increasing bus fares by as much as a third or canceling 
some underused bus routes beginning July 1, county transit planners say. 
</P>
<P>
 The planners said Wednesday that the basic bus fare could be raised to $1.50 
from $1.10, weekend and holiday service could be reduced and bus lines that 
duplicate rail routes could be eliminated to bring down a combined $300-million 
operating and capital deficit projected for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the authority could significantly raise the price of monthly 
passes or introduce a fee schedule that takes advantage of prime riding hours 
with separate peak and off-peak fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some combination of fare increases and service cuts are inevitable if we are 
to balance our budget, as we are committed to do," MTA Chief Executive Officer 
Franklin E. White said Wednesday in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials stressed that no final combination of service cuts and fare 
increases has been determined. But the possibilities unveiled Wednesday 
provided the first glimpse of how the cash-strapped authority may shift fares 
and service levels to fulfill its financial responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting Wednesday, the MTA board scheduled a public hearing on 
the contentious issue for 10 a.m. April 23 at the county Hall of Administration 
in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Its announcement came on the heels of a plan released by the MTA last week to 
scale back some transit projects and eliminate more than 250 positions to shear 
$100 million from the anticipated shortfall in the agency's $3.4-billion annual 
budget. The action could trigger as many as 200 layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares have remained static since 1988, when the Southern California Rapid 
Transit District increased them to $1.10 from 85 cents. The price of monthly 
passes has also held steady at $42. Officials are considering raising the price 
as high as $75 or abandoning passes altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In another plan outlined Wednesday, the MTA could institute a graduated fee 
schedule with peak-period fares between $1.10 and $1.50, and off-peak fares 
ranging from 90 cents to $1.25. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Wednesday, the MTA board unanimously awarded a $45-million 
contract for subway station construction to Tutor-Saliba-Perini, a partnership 
including two firms that have come under fire for defective tunnel work in 
sections of the Metro Red Line subway. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a team of inspectors found defects along nearly two miles of 
tunnels between Union Station and Pershing Square, including thin walls and air 
pockets in the crowns of the structures. Although the specialists deemed the 
tunnels safe, the Tutor-Saliba Corp., based in Sylmar, agreed to make the 
necessary repairs and pay all related costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to close the door and move on," Ronald N. Tutor told the board 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract -- one of eight Tutor-Saliba now holds for the second segment 
of the Red Line -- involves construction of a station at Vermont Avenue and 
Sunset Boulevard. The firm's contracts total $330 million, nearly half of the 
entire heavy-construction budget of $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In recommending Tutor-Saliba-Perini for the latest agreement, Edward McSpedon, 
president of the MTA's Rail Construction Corp., told the board that the company 
has been doing an "entirely satisfactory" job with its current contracts. 
"Perfect no," he said. "Satisfactory yes." 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Director James Cragin said he would vote in favor of the firm but remained 
uncomfortable about its performance, saying he would watch the new projects 
very closely.

WILSON RALLIES FOR 'ONE-STRIKE' LAW; SEXUAL ASSAULT: GOVERNOR'S COMMENTS ON 
DATE RAPE PROMPT CRITICISM BY NOW OFFICIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Seeking to generate support for legislation to impose life prison terms on all 
first-time rapists, Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday instead appeared to be making 
the case for opponents who say the proposal's inflexibility would impede 
prosecution and convictions in all but the worst cases of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who was in Claremont to meet with community leaders who are upset over 
the potential release of serial rapist Christopher Hubbart, spoke briefly and 
then fielded a handful of questions from a friendly audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering one query, Wilson strayed onto the politically treacherous topic of 
date rape, the term used by some to describe the act of forcing sex on an 
acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
 A man from nearby Claremont College told the governor he feared that the 
so-called "one-strike" proposal would mean life in prison for university 
students accused of pressuring their dates to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said that in his view, there is sometimes no difference between what is 
known as date rape and the forcible rape of a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also said: "I leave it to you to define date rape. If that is something 
that happens with consent and then results in some change of heart, that is a 
very different thing from someone who is attacked." 
</P>
<P>
 Reassuring the questioner, Wilson added that the judicial system has what the 
governor called a safeguard for men falsely accused of rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, Wilson said, would be "very, very careful" and "not terribly 
willing to go forward" in cases that came down to one person's word against 
another's. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's implication that some women concoct rape charges after a change 
of heart prompted a quick retort from one women's rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 And his admission that the mandatory life terms he proposes for first-time 
rapists would make district attorneys more reluctant to prosecute some cases is 
exactly what critics say is the bill's biggest problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization 
for Women, said Wilson's comments demonstrate a lack of knowledge of the fact 
that most rapes are committed by assailants who know their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "These statements show how callous and uneducated Pete Wilson is with the 
fears women face on a daily basis," Bruce said. The NOW leader was barred from 
attending the meeting where Wilson addressed 82 civic activists invited by the 
mayor and the city manager, but she reacted to his comments after being given 
an account of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce said Wilson's rhetoric on rape -- conjuring up the image of a masked man 
attacking a woman in a dark parking lot -- is a "step backward" because it 
ignores what she said is the very serious problem of men forcing sex on women 
they know. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says real rape is only when you rape 100 women and you don't know them," 
she said. "That is the mentality that is fueling the epidemic of rape in our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 In his prepared remarks, Wilson said the release of Melvin Carter -- the 
so-called College Terrace Rapist -- and the near-release of Hubbart, who has 
been linked to 50 rapes over a 22-year period, were only the most recent 
examples of a sentencing system that he described as dangerously lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds more rapists will be released to our streets this month, next month 
and every month until we change the law," he said. Men like Carter and Hubbart, 
he said, "should never, ever be released -- not to any community." 
</P>
<P>
 Rape now is punishable by as few as three years in prison, and Wilson says the 
average rapist is free in less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to change the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bruce and others outside the hall said Wilson needed to do more to 
prevent rape, the governor said the one-strike bill would stop rape by keeping 
potential repeat offenders behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "One strike in my view shouldn't be viewed as vengeful," he said. "It should 
be viewed as preventive."

OWNERS TO ABANDON RED-TAGGED CONDOS; EARTHQUAKE: CITING PROHIBITIVE COSTS OF 
REBUILDING, RESIDENTS VOTE TO DEMOLISH THE BUILDING AND SELL THE LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a move that could be the precursor to other owners deserting their 
earthquake-damaged properties, a group of Sherman Oaks residents has voted to 
walk away from a red-tagged condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the 30-unit complex in the 4600 block of Willis Avenue are 
believed to be the first to abandon their property because of the prohibitive 
cost of rebuilding. The complex was one of dozens of structures on the same 
street rendered unlivable by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who lived there were on fixed incomes; there were a few young 
families who were just starting out," said resident Barry Wegman, president of 
the Willis Palms Homeowners Assn. "There just wasn't money to rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
 Structural engineers had told residents they could rebuild at a cost of $3 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, we were thinking that it might be an opportunity for us to rebuild 
. . . but it was wishful thinking," Wegman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine of the 30 residents voted to demolish the building and sell the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten residents own their units outright and are walking away from their homes. 
Twenty others will attempt to get lenders to excuse their mortgages, or let the 
lenders foreclose on their property, Wegman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of months from now, they may be viewed as one of many," said Jim 
Lindl, a Camarillo attorney who represents 450 community associations in the 
Los Angeles area, of the Sherman Oaks group. 
</P>
<P>
 He said up to 20% of owners of damaged condominiums and apartment complexes 
throughout the Los Angeles area may choose not to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't have (earthquake) insurance or they don't have money for the 
deductible," Lindl said. "People will have to take out loans that are worth 
more than their condo before the earthquake" in order to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, 1,503 
residences were red-tagged after the quake. Many owners of condemned apartment 
and condo complexes were given 30 days to inform the city whether they planned 
to repair or demolish their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindl said high rebuilding costs left residents with no economic incentive to 
rebuild, especially in the current housing slump.  
</P>
<P>
 Most homeowners with earthquake insurance will be required to pay an average 
of $2,000 to $20,000 in deductibles, Lindl said, depending on the extent of 
damage and the repairs associations can make themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Willis Palms complex, Wegman said the vote to leave was 
painful, but necessary.

 "It was a tough decision from an emotional standpoint," he said. "But once you 
see the damage, there was no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that leaving his unit will cost him his five years of equity, but 
noted that those who owned their properties outright lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said damaged 
buildings turned into vacant lots will have a bad effect on the community.  
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a lot of empty fenced lots if people decide to do this, which 
is not very attractive," Close said. "It will look like Beirut."

ALASKAN STORM POISED TO STRIKE L. A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A potent storm from the Gulf of Alaska is expected to pummel Southern 
California with hail, snow, heavy rain and thunder late today, posing a renewed 
threat of destructive mudslides below hills denuded during last fall's 
devastating brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm, which could last through Sunday, is expected to drop up to two 
inches of rain in the Los Angeles area and as much as a foot of snow at 
mountain resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty strong early-spring storm, stronger than usual for Southern 
California," said Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. "There's 
definitely a good possibility of mudslides in the burn areas. And it's going to 
be pretty cold, too, with the snow level down to 3,000 feet in some areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the storm -- which struck Northern California late Wednesday 
and began working its way down the coast -- is expected to move inland across 
Santa Barbara and Ventura counties sometime this afternoon, reaching Los 
Angeles before nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said the precipitation here will begin with light rain, shifting to 
heavier rain, with thunderstorms and hail during the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the thunderstorms could be severe," Thoren said. "That means winds at 
up to 55 m.p.h. and hail as big as three-quarters of an inch in diameter." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service said the rain will continue, off and on but 
occasionally heavy, through Friday and Saturday and possibly into Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Storms like this are hard to gauge, but there's a pretty good moisture tap 
this time," Thoren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures are predicted to be cool during the rest of the week, with highs 
in the Los Angeles area ranging from the low 60s today to the mid-50s on Friday 
and Saturday. Highs at mountain resort levels should remain below freezing 
until the storm departs. 
</P>
<P>
 The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Wednesday was 68 
degrees, after an overnight low of 50. The season's rainfall total stood at 
6.23 inches, less than half the norm of 12.99 inches for the date.

VETERAN OFFICER ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT RESIGNS; POLICE: GRANADA HILLS MAN WAS TO 
HAVE FACED DEPARTMENT HEARINGS ON 13 CHARGES, INCLUDING STEALING PORNOGRAPHY 
FROM EVIDENCE LOCKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran Los Angeles police officer has resigned, on the same day he was to 
face internal departmental hearings that would have put him on trial publicly 
on more than a dozen misconduct charges, authorities confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Walter Ray Bentley Jr. of Granada Hills, a 23-year veteran, worked 
most recently in the department's Juvenile Division before his suspension last 
August. He faced two separate department administrative hearings on 13 charges, 
including stealing pornography from locked evidence lockers and selling 
information he illegally retrieved from department computers to private 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the most severe penalty the hearing officers could have imposed was 
dismissal from the force, those hearings have been canceled, said Capt. Eric 
Lillo, commanding officer of the Police Department's Internal Affairs Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fellow officers, who asked not to be named, said that by retiring Monday, 
the day the hearings were to begin, Bentley avoided having to testify against 
himself in the board of rights hearings -- which are open to the public and 
reporters -- and prevented other witnesses from testifying against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lillo had no comment on such speculation, he said Bentley "certainly 
retired at a time that allowed him to avoid the board of rights hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Bentley, 47, remains under criminal investigation for allegedly 
using his power as a police officer to illegally gain access to confidential 
information in departmental computers. Police and prosecutors said Wednesday 
that that investigation will continue, as will an existing criminal case filed 
against Bentley last summer, after Bentley was arrested and charged with 
possessing child pornography and receiving stolen property. He has pleaded not 
guilty to those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley's retirement "has nothing to do with the criminal case," said Police 
Lt. Ken Welty, head of the Police Department's Bunco-Forgery Division. "The 
only difference is that now he's a civilian." 
</P>
<P>
 The departmental charges lodged against Bentley -- outlined in internal police 
documents -- may provide material for additional criminal charges against him, 
because all the evidence gathered in the internal affairs investigation has 
been shared with the district attorney's office, Lillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is up to the district attorney's office to decide whether to file 
additional criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most times we wait until our case is completed and present that to the DA's 
office," Lillo said. "But because of the high publicity of this case, there has 
been information exchanged with the DA's people almost from the very 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last August that the Police Department was investigating 
allegations that Bentley illegally gained access to confidential police 
information on nearly 500 people and sold them to private investigation 
companies, including one run by retired Deputy Police Chief Daniel Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his lawyer, Bentley refused to comment Wednesday on his retirement or 
the allegations lodged against him by the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, department investigators allege that Bentley improperly used 
department computers for non-law enforcement purposes, sometimes using the 
passwords of other department employees, and sold computer files to others 
outside the department for profit. Bentley also was charged in the internal 
complaint with illegally possessing child pornography and stolen property, 
according to the documents, which were obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley's lawyer, Darryl Mounger, said his client's decision to resign March 
21, and thus retire with a 40% pension, had nothing to do with the hearings 
scheduled to start the same day. If he had waited another two years, the 
department said, Bentley's annual pension would have been 55% upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of rights hearings, though administrative, are similar to a 
civil-criminal trial. They are conducted by a three-member panel of police 
commanders and officers who hear sworn evidence from witnesses and review a far 
broader spectrum of evidence than that allowed in a criminal court, Lillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a criminal defendant can cite his Fifth Amendment right not to 
incriminate himself through his own testimony. But in a board of rights 
hearing, an officer can be fired from the force outright if he does not issue a 
statement and respond to questions, Lillo said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; MAN STABBED DURING FIGHT AT RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old man who was stabbed in the neck during an argument behind a 
fast-food restaurant is expected to survive his wound, but his three attackers 
remained at large Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing occurred at 5:20 p.m. Tuesday at Del Taco, 22401 El Toro Road, 
said Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Harold Rama Corzano of Lake Forest, was taken to Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he is in good condition, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Corzano was arguing with three men when one of them stabbed him 
on the right side of his neck, severing an artery, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the stabbing, the attackers jumped over a block wall fence and fled. 
They may have left the scene in a white Honda, a large black truck, or both, 
Martini said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CHESS TEAM FACES BIG CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six chess players from Buena Park Junior High School are preparing their next 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will compete in a U.S. Chess Federation-sponsored tournament next 
month in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the top of the line, it's like going to the top of the mountain," said 
Dewain Barber, adviser of the school chess team. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber said the students playing in the tournament are the best in the 
school's 22-member club. 
</P>
<P>
 Those competing in the 1994 National Junior High Chess Championships in Rye, 
N.Y., April 14-18 are Chris Martin, 12; Chris Esguerra, 13; Charles Poovakan, 
13; Paul Spillan, 13; Isaac Bravo, 13, and David Howard, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we win or lose, the challenge will be to play the best players in the 
United States," said Barber, who teaches history. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his young chess pupils, Barber singled out Poovakan as having a shot at 
a national title. 
</P>
<P>
 "His skill level has excelled over the last few months," said Barber, adding 
that in his age group, Charles holds the Southern California championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles has the potential to be a chess master by the time he is out of high 
school," said Barber, who has turned out a number of masters and experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles, who has played about 70 tournament games since September, said he 
plays because chess is fun and he makes new friends at the competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said he likes to win the top prizes: trophies and prize money, 
which he is using to pay for his trip to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are raising money to offset the expenses of traveling to the 
championship tournament, which will cost about $500 for each player. Local 
organizations have contributed money, but Barber said donations are still 
needed in order for players to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber said the students will be doing more than playing chess while in New 
York. They plan to travel to New York City to see attractions including the 
Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also going to be an educational event so it expands their horizons," he 
said. Barber, author of "Guide to Scholastic Chess" and "Blindfold Chess 
Genius," said that chess is a learning tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chess has a direct relationship with math," he said. "It can be used to 
improve logic and reasoning processes." 
</P>
<P>
 Students agreed. "It helps you get good grades," Chris Esguerra said, adding 
that the game instills self-discipline. "You learn how to budget your time." 
</P>
<P>
 David Howard said he plays chess because "it's the only thing I'm actually 
good at -- that I can put in a lot of effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Barber is seeking recognition of the chess club by the school district as a 
curriculum-related organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The benefit is there won't be any argument whether we should be an 
organization on campus," he said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA / YORBA LINDA; ACTIVIST PRESSES FOR CHICANO 
CURRICULUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A debate over whether Esperanza High School students can start a chapter of 
MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan) has attracted the attention of 
the community activist who helped organize a demonstration last September 
demanding more Chicano studies at several other Orange County high schools and 
a community college. 
</P>
<P>
 Seferino Garcia threatened similar action here if Chicano history and culture 
is not included in the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicano students "will continue to walk out until we have our history included 
in the curriculum," Garcia told the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School 
District Board of Trustees Tuesday night. "Our history, language and culture 
has to be brought into your district." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Garcia presented a list of 14 demands to the board, saying 
"we will demonstrate every Sept. 16 (Mexican Independence Day) until our 
demands are met." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sept. 16, students from Sonora High School in the Fullerton Union High 
School District and Anaheim High School in the Anaheim Union High School 
District walked out of classes to demand more Chicano studies. The students 
were met by others from Fullerton College as they marched through the streets, 
eventually ending up in front of the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers used pepper spray on the 300 students to disband the protest, 
saying the students were blocking traffic. Six protesters, including two 
17-year-olds, were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in Garcia's demands Tuesday were the hiring of more bilingual 
teachers and more teachers with majors or minors in Chicano studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Tim Van Eck, who oversees hiring for the district, said the 
district already actively recruits Latino teachers who are bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to have teachers and staff who can understand the variety of 
cultures in our district," Van Eck said. "We compete aggressively against other 
districts for those teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Eck said 47 of the district's 874 teachers have been certified as 
bilingual in Spanish and English. Twelve administrators -- principals, 
vice-principals and counselors -- are bilingual and several others are Latino, 
Van Eck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. James O. Fleming characterized Garcia's comments as "threatening remarks 
from someone outside my district. I am not going to have people threaten me or 
my district." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he addressed the board at the request of many students from 
Esperanza High School who were disappointed when told district guidelines 
forbid establishing a MEChA chapter at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Fleming said most of the students who initially asked for MEChA last 
month have been satisfied with a compromise worked out by Esperanza Principal 
George Allen. He encouraged the students to join the school's International 
Club and incorporate many of MEChA's goals into the club's actitivies. 
</P>
<P>
 District policy allows only organizations directly related to the 
curriculum.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CHUMASH ELDER GIVES BLESSING AT DAMAGED CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As construction workers with trucks and steam shovels tended to the outward 
damage on the Cal State Northridge campus Wednesday, Chumash Indian elder Bob 
Rivera was tending to its inward damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera was invited to the campus by the American Indian Student Assn. to give 
a blessing in the Chumash tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Association treasurer Joan-Marie King said the purpose was to soothe frayed 
nerves in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 quake and safeguard the campus against 
future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera came from Buena Park with his daughter and grandsons for the occasion. 
About 20 onlookers gathered in a circle with him on the lawn in front of the 
damaged Oviatt Library, now encircled by chain-link fencing and scaffolding. 
Construction equipment roared in the background as Rivera began his ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 He lit tightly wrapped bundles of white sage and, as students carrying 
backpacks ambled disinterestedly by, Rivera walked the circumference of the 
circle, showering each participant with a cascade of fragrant white smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 He then called two leaders of the students association into the center of the 
circle and brushed the smoke across their shoulders, over their heads and down 
their feet, using a spike made of feathers from a golden eagle. The group 
remained silent throughout, even when Rivera left their midst to cast dried 
tobacco leaves into the air around the circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was addressed to ancestors, asking both forgiveness for the 
wrongs committed by man on Earth, and benediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking our grandfather that if he makes Mother Earth shake -- and she 
has to shake -- that no one gets hurt, that no one gets stressed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 King said it was aftershocks such as the 5.3 tremor Sunday that prompted her 
to invite Rivera to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was a good idea to do this, to cleanse and purify the campus. . 
. . I thought it was really beautiful," she added. JILL LEOVY

MAKING CITY HALL SAFE; THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE LENT ADDED URGENCY TO A 
WARNING THAT ENGINEERS HAVE BEEN SOUNDING FOR YEARS-THAT LOS ANGELES CITY HALL 
NEEDS SUBSTANTIAL STRENGTHENING TO SURVIVE A MAJOR QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Project In an expensive seismic retrofitting program that is expected to 
begin in 1995 and take three years, City Hall will be repaired so it can 
withstand an 8.1-magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas Fault and a 6.8 quake 
on the Elysian Park Fault. Major features of the plan include a dry, 
underground moat that will surround the foundation and high-tech shock 
absorbers that will limit shaking. Background The 65-year-old building suffered 
substantial damage to its upper floors in the January earthquake, even though 
the epicenter was miles away. After the Sylmar quake in 1971, holes were 
drilled in the terra-cotta facing and a ceramic bonding agent was pumped into 
the facing to prevent further damage. Over time it has deteriorated and is now 
crumbling out of the holes. The top of City Hall, left, is now shrouded in 
black nylon netting to prevent debris from falling during the aftershocks. 
Stairwells New staircases will be built to provide better emergency access. 
Room to Move A four-foot-wide underground moat will surround the foundation to 
provide room for earthquake movement in any direction. Steel sliders will be 
placed intermittently to act as bearings for the concrete above and below. The 
moat will be covered by such things as planter boxes for safety reasons. Shear 
Walls Reinforced concrete walls will replace hollow clay block walls, which 
have been loosened by more than a century of temblors. Project Cost Voters 
approved a $376-million bond measure in 1990 to pay for the City Hall 
improvements and to strengthen dozens of other city buildings and bridges. But 
work has been slow and engineers recently increased the cost estimate for City 
Hall two-thirds, from $92.3 million to $153.5 million. How a Building Bounces 
City Hall will be placed on 430 high-tech shock absorbers, called base 
isolators, that will move up to a foot in any direction to limit shaking in the 
28-story building. These will be inserted one at a time, allowing for continual 
support of the building during renovation. 1. New pillar foundations will be 
built in basement above originals. 2. The old foundation will be braced with 
jacks on four corners to transfer the existing load off of the column while 
work is being done. 3. Then a piece of the original column will be cut out and 
replaced with the base isolator. 4. The brace jacks will be removed so the 
building rests on the base isolators. 5. New basement slabs will be added, 
joining all the new foundations. This is one of several designs of base 
isolators. Vulcanized rubber layers that can move in any direction are 
laminated between steel sheets to form a moveable, flexible base. The steel top 
and bottom plates are anchored to the columns above and below. Sources: L.A.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; REIMBURSEMENT OKD FOR BOND MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Low-income senior citizens and disabled Burbank residents will be reimbursed 
for the cost of a proposed $100-million school bond measure under a motion 
passed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council approved the plan in a 4-0 vote despite some 
objections from the public that the council was trying to buy votes for the 
Burbank school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen anything as shameless as this," Ted McConkey, a leader of a 
local homeowners group who told the council, "some of you must have been 
Chicago aldermen in an earlier life to come up with this scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 The bond referendum has been scheduled by the Burbank Unified School District 
for April 12 as part of a $138-million plan to rebuild the public schools. The 
city has promised $23 million in aid to help rebuild the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible for the reimbursement, the person must be a property owner with 
a household income of less than $16,900, or $19,300 if it is a two-person 
household. Some of the speakers Tuesday night complained that the reimbursement 
program was not being extended to renters, who will have to pay more as their 
landlord costs go up. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank city management services director John Nicoll said the city had no way 
of reimbursing renters for the increase in costs because there was no way of 
tracking how much a landlord would raise rents if the bond were to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicoll also told the council that the exemption for low-income property owners 
would cost the city $14,000 to $35,000 a year over the life of a 25-year bond. 
He also guessed that nearly 700 residents would be eligible for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the financial experts hired by the district, the bond would cost 
the owner of a home worth $101,000 about $36 a year, but some residents have 
questioned those figures. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; PARK ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are seeking the county's help to improve several neighborhood 
parks and make them more accessible to disabled residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided last week to make the request to Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder, who informed city officials earlier this month that funds are available 
for park projects within her district, which includes Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are hoping to install new lights on the soccer and softball 
fields at a 12-acre area at McAuliffe Middle School on Cerritos and Bloomfield 
avenues, according to Recreation and Community Services Director Mark A. 
Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements at McAuliffe also would include installing new grass and 
sprinklers. The improvements at the school would total about $548,000, Wagner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Wagner said, the city is requesting money to replace old 
playground equipment and install new sprinklers at Labourdette, Sterns, 
Roberts, Soroptomists and Stansbury parks, which were built in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost to renovate the five parks is estimated at $132,000, Wagner 
said. The renovations include design changes to allow access for disabled 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the county support, the projects would not be possible," Wagner said, 
adding that the city has budgeted $55,000 for park improvements in the 1993-94 
fiscal year.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PLANNERS TO CONSIDER CLOSING OF NIGHTCLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission tonight will consider whether to close down the 
six-month-old Bacchus nightclub because of what police call a pattern of rowdy 
behavior, including a brawl outside the club earlier this month.  
</P>
<P>
 During the fight, three people who were arrested and placed in Newport Beach 
police patrol cars were freed by others in the crowd.One person escaped wearing 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 This incident, according to Police Chief Robert J. McDonell, follows a series 
of problems at the club that have kept police officers busy. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Council study session two weeks ago, McDonell said he would 
recommend to the Planning Commission that Bacchus be shut down. Planning 
Commissioner Gary Di Sano said the commission will not pull the permit pending 
a public hearing in coming weeks so that both sides can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacchus has pledged to do whatever it takes to stay open. Robert Mitchell, one 
of the owners, said that the club would hire more security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 In a detailed report to commissioners dated March 20, police Sgt. Jim Kaminsky 
attached a chronology of 47 incidents that have required police attention at 
the club, including drug possession, public urination and numerous fights. 
According to the same report, the club has been cited twice by the state 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Department for not clearly identifying its security 
personnel and for operating a private club within the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission hearing starts at 7:30 tonight at City Hall. BOB

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CASH, TAPES STOLEN IN ARMED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two armed men robbed the Music Plus store on Marguerite Parkway Tuesday 
afternoon, fleeing with $1,000 in cash and about 30 new tapes, the county 
Sheriff's Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects entered the store at 4:30 p.m. and forced one employee to lie 
down on the floor while taking another employee to a back room, where they 
removed about $1,000 in cash from a safe, according to a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects then ordered the employees into the store's bathroom, said Lt. 
Dan Martini. The robbers took about 30 tapes before fleeing, he said. No one 
was injured in the holdup, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both suspects were described as Latinos between the ages of 16 and 20, police 
said. One had a stocky build and was wearing a maroon cap and maroon sweat 
shirt. Witnesses said the other had a thin build and a shaved head and was 
wearing a blue hooded sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Store managers declined comment.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: POLICE FORCE BELOW STATE AVERAGE FOR SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Glendale posts a relatively low crime rate when compared with other 
California cities its size, the number of police officers patrolling streets 
here is well below the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale ranks as the seventh safest community among 45 California cities with 
more than 100,000 residents, according to FBI crime reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The city boasted the lowest crime rate in its comparison group until the 
mid-1980s, when it was ousted from first place by bedroom communities that 
slowly crept over the 100,000 population mark, Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale ranked behind suburban meccas such as Thousand Oaks, Sunnyvale, Santa 
Clarita, Simi Valley, Irvine and Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime in Glendale is up 81% since 1976, the number of calls received 
by police jumped 34%, and the number of crimes committed increased 34%, 
Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not increased its police force in the past 18 years in proportion 
with the higher demand for police services -- leaving fewer officers to grapple 
with more complex crimes and lengthier reporting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1.1 officers per 1,000 residents -- for a total of 250 sworn police 
personnel -- Glendale has fewer officers per 1,000 residents than Pasadena, 
Burbank, Inglewood, Torrance, Santa Ana and Anaheim. Guidelines set by the 
International Assn. of Police Chiefs recommend that cities Glendale's size have 
2.5 officers per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide average is 1.45 officers per 1,000 residents, but if Glendale 
were to meet the average the city would have to hire 55 more officers, said 
Jack Altounian, an administrative analyst with the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the city's crime rate has traditionally been low, he said, the council 
has maintained minimum staffing levels. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; HEARING ON RIDGELINE STRUCTURES PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to restrict satellite dishes, fences and other structures on or 
near ridgelines will be the topic of a public hearing Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas Planning Commission hearing will be held at 7:30 p.m. in the 
council chambers at City Hall, 26135 Mureau Road. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the proposed revisions to the scenic corridor ordinance would 
require homeowners and builders who want to put up minor structures in 
designated scenic areas to apply for a permit, pay an application fee of about 
$150, and possibly plant trees and shrubs to hide the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal applies to fences 6 feet or taller, patios, patio covers, 
gazebos, decks and landscaping. Also covered are antennas, satellite dishes, 
certain type signs, and certain kinds of home additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate planner Anna Lisa Hernandez said the Planning Department forwarded 
the proposal after hearing concerns from residents and planning commissioners 
that people have been installing satellite dishes and fences that are unsightly 
or block views. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA CANYON; BOARD OKS PURCHASE OF CANYON OAKS SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy board this week approved the purchase 
of land that had been proposed for the controversial Canyon Oaks Estates 
development, moving one step closer to securing the hilly property as open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The action Monday night solidifies the state agency's surprise announcement of 
its intention to buy the property, just minutes before the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors was scheduled to consider approving the project earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote by the conservancy board sends the proposed $19.9-million 
purchase of the land to the supervisors, who will consider approving about 75% 
of the funds at its regular March 29 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the money would come from state park funds or fund-raising 
efforts, said Carolyn Barr, project manager for the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are basically two hurdles left," Barr said. "The first is the approval 
of the whole negotiation by the Board of Supervisors. Then we have to find the 
other funds." 
</P>
<P>
 If the supervisors fail to approve funds for the deal and escrow is not closed 
by April 5, the battle over Canyon Oaks will probably resume as quickly as it 
stopped. The board is still scheduled to consider the development proposal 
April 12, and the landowners are still interested in building Canyon Oaks. If 
the project is built after all, it will likely include a golf course and 97 
homes. KURT PITZER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FILMED ON LOCATION HERE, THEY HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, the film industry has immortalized the coast and skylines of Los 
Angeles County, but the cities, canyons and beaches of Orange County have 
seldom seen the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, enticed by big production budgets, Orange County wants to be a player 
too.  
</P>
<P>
 With officials on hand from the California Film Commission and the private 
sector, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez introduced plans Wednesday for the county's 
new Film Office during a Newport Beach press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The office will promote Orange County locales and landmarks to filmmakers who 
may be tired of often-seen Los Angeles sites, and will work to make the county 
user-friendly for the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said that luring movie-makers to Orange County could pump millions 
into the local economy, and heighten the area's visibility to film and 
television audiences nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, he said, would be to duplicate the success of the San Diego County 
film office, which in 1992 used a $362,000 budget to lure filmmakers who ended 
up spending more than $27 million locally. In Orange County, film producers 
spend about $200,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not even in the same ballpark," Vasquez said. "We may turn out to be 
the best-kept secret in Southern California for filmmakers. The potential is 
almost unlimited." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has recently gotten a taste of Hollywood, with Harrison Ford and 
Willem DaFoe in the area last month filming their next feature, "Clear and 
Present Danger." Last year, the crew of "Demolition Man," an action film 
starring Sylvester Stallone, spent 10 days shooting in Orange County, spending 
about $33,000 a day, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Film Office will be operated as a private-public 
partnership, with the county putting up $50,000 to $70,000 for the program's 
budget, and the Orange County Chamber of Commerce and Industry providing office 
space, computers, volunteers and other assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The office's staff will organize tours of Orange County for movie-makers, 
visit Hollywood to promote the area and try to set up a standardized permit 
process among the county's 31 cities to make location filming easier, office 
director Cristi Silverberg said. The office will also field calls from movie 
industry members seeking a certain type of setting. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY RETURNS NUTRITION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing an "overwhelming demand coupled with a lack of space," county health 
officials have turned down $900,000 in state aid since October that would have 
provided thousands of low-income pregnant women and parents of children and 
babies with vouchers for food and infant formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of local cases handled by the Women, Infants, and Children program, 
or WIC, has tripled since 1991, said Len Foster, Orange County's deputy 
director of public health.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana program currently serves 36,500 mothers, providing vouchers 
along with health checkups. The additional money would have provided services 
for another 6,000 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to run as fast as we can to utilize additional state aid, 
but we've just run out of space to accommodate thousands of additional cases," 
Foster said. He attributed the increased caseload to a population and 
immigration increase in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said Wednesday they are negotiating to find an additional 
site to expand the popular program so they can take advantage of state 
assistance in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 But that won't do anything to reverse a recent decision by the state of 
California to send $450,000 in aid for the county's voucher program to other 
counties because local officials had failed to use the money by March 1. Last 
October, state officials took back another $450,000 for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they had no choice, even though there was a great need 
for expanding the local program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot simply hold onto the federal grants and wait for them to find space 
for those additional cases," said Phyllis A. Bramson, a statewide coordinator 
of the WIC program. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's General Services Agency is charged with finding additional office 
space to accommodate more women and children who need the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner said finding more space is a 
priority, and that GSA officials will likely find suitable space within the 
next three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest $450,000 grant is now gone. But if county officials come up with 
additional space by October to handle the increased caseload, they will receive 
additional money to make up for the grant they lost this month, Bramson said. 
</P>
<P>
 If additional space is found sooner, Bramson promised to look into ways to 
find more money for the county's WIC office sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second time in less than a year we've gone through this," Bramson 
said, referring to when the state took back the first grant in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us then that they would be ready in March, but that is not the 
case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said the problem began in 1991 when the county's WIC program in Santa 
Ana experienced a 47% increase in applicants. In 1992, the office experienced 
an additional 39% increase and in 1993, an additional 15% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big jump, the county really does have a big challenge in trying to 
serve all those people," Bramson said. "Orange county is probably the 
fastest-growing need area in the state." BRIAN RAY BALLOU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; PAGING READERS: BOOK BARGAINS AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Good books and good buys are what readers will find inside the Friends 
Bookstore at the Fountain Valley branch of the Orange County Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't beat the price," said mother of three Kari Koh, 31, of Tustin. She 
recently bought three children's books, including "Black Beauty," for a quarter 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Gann of Huntington Beach frequents the bookstore and browses through 
shelves for outdated books about U.S. Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can really find old treasures," said Gann, 63. 
</P>
<P>
 If readers don't mind yellowed pages and worn covers, discards can be the best 
deals, agreed Don Walker, 50, of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bargains are unbelievable," he said. "You can have untold hours of 
entertainment for $5." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker recently spent $6.50 and filled two canvas sacks with 14 books, 13 of 
them for his mother, Catherine Walker, who is a voracious reader, and one for 
his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an expensive trip," Walker said.  
</P>
<P>
 Usually Walker spends a few bucks, but he splurged on two large print books at 
$1 each and 10 Agatha Christie books. His mother likes mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The bookstore, operated by the Friends of Fountain Valley Library, resells 
donated books from the community. Books discarded by the library also are sold 
in the store, nestled inside a small room next to the entrance of the library 
at 17635 Los Alamos St. 
</P>
<P>
 Book prices can't be beat: 25 cents for paperbacks and children's books; 50 
cents for hardcover books and large-size paperbacks and 10 cents for magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from sales help the library put on free community programs and pay 
for new books, equipment and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Friends help the library buy things the county can't or doesn't supply 
for the library," said June Brown, co-chair of the bookstore with Dorothy Nail. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is sorely needed since the county has cut the library budget, which 
resulted in libraries reducing hours and cutting services, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the store reaped about $12,000 from sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'd be pretty grim, cut and dry, without the Friends," added Phyllis Brown, 
Fountain Valley Library branch manager. "They provide so many wonderful extras 
that make the public want to come to the library and use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bookstore's bestsellers are romance novels, mysteries, and science 
fiction and fantasy books, Nail said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookbooks, craft books and children's books are also popular, she said. 
Readers will also find books just for women on such topics as beauty tips or 
how to get ahead in business. There are college textbooks and books on art and 
music, nature and ecology, child-rearing -- and even books on how to hold a 
garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Magazines, while they are old issues, run the gamut from Gourmet to Glamour to 
National Geographic.  
</P>
<P>
 The store is staffed by Friends volunteers, who each work a 2 1/2-hour shift a 
week to price and shelve books and ring up purchases.  
</P>
<P>
 And they are book lovers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Mary Geller, who likes to read classics, said: "We go through the 
books to see what's new and what you want to read." 
</P>
<P>
 Nail agreed: "We're our own best customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bookstore hours are noon to 7 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Thursdays and Saturdays. DEBRA CANO

BOARD VOTES TO CURB FREE MEDICAL CARE FOR FOREIGNERS; HEALTH SERVICES: 
SUPERVISORS APPROVE A PLAN TO PREVENT VISITORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES FROM HAVING 
NON-EMERGENCY OPERATIONS AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has voted to stop foreigners from 
receiving free non-emergency medical care at county health facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was intended to curb a disturbing trend in which foreign nationals, 
many with substantial wealth and assets, come to Los Angeles to have expensive 
medical operations performed at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the action approved by the supervisors Tuesday, visitors would have to 
show their passports and appropriate visas when requesting medical care. 
Non-immigrant foreign nationals would be informed that they are not eligible 
for non-emergency care. Previously, virtually anyone professing poverty could 
qualify for some level of free medical care, including elective surgeries that 
cost tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The board acted in response to a story in The Times last year that detailed 
how thousands of foreign visitors improperly obtain free medical care by 
manipulating health programs intended for illegal immigrants and other poor 
California residents. About half of all people caught falsifying their Medi-Cal 
applications in Southern California are visitors from other countries, 
officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "This action should stop that kind of abuse," said Robert C. Gates, director 
of the Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the new curbs, the county's health care facilities would continue to 
provide emergency medical care to all, as required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana voted against the measure, saying 
it did not go far enough. The two supervisors wanted the Health Department to 
erect signs in several languages saying foreignners are not entitled to 
elective or other non-emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, however, warned that many prospective patients, including those with 
dangerous communicable diseases, might be intimidated by the warnings and leave 
before being properly screened by medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no comprehensive statistics on the size of the problem of foreigners 
seeking publicly paid medical care, or how much of a drain it is on 
taxpayer-financed facilities. But doctors at one county hospital said such 
foreign visitors account for 20% of their monthly heart surgery caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times found that some of the patients arrived for treatment at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center wearing expensive jewelry and driving fancy cars, only to claim 
poverty when presented with the hospital bill.

VOICE ADMITTING POLICE OFFICER'S KILLING RINGS TRUE, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Voice experts say a caller who admitted killing Manhattan Beach Police Officer 
Martin Ganz sounded genuine when he claimed the fatal shooting was an accident, 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Stoneman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A tape recording made at Manhattan Beach police headquarters shows that during 
the call from a phone booth two days after the Dec. 27 slaying, a man said, "I 
kill a police officer. . . . What can I do, because I am not a criminal?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, OK," the 911 operator answered. "It was just an accident?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, an accident," the man said, before hanging up. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoneman said the experts have concluded that "what they heard was some 
genuineness in the voice, (in) the different voice inflections and the things 
that were said by this individual." 
</P>
<P>
 The description of the shooting as a possible accident contrasts sharply with 
the sheriff's investigators' account of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Ganz, 29, was on patrol when he stopped a driver in front of the 
Manhattan Village shopping mall for a possible traffic violation. With Ganz in 
his patrol car was his 13-year-old nephew, who was participating in a 
department-sponsored ride-along program. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators said that when Ganz got out of the police car, the assailant 
opened fire. They said that Ganz retreated behind his car and the man followed 
him, firing several more shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, who was struck three times, pulled his pistol but did not return fire, 
the investigators said. They said the gunman pointed his semiautomatic pistol 
at the boy but did not pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fugitives have been identified as possible suspects in the case, but no 
arrests have been made.

UNLV HEAD GETS TOP CAL STATE LONG BEACH POST; EDUCATION: ROBERT C. MAXSON 
PRESIDED OVER A MAJOR EXPANSION OF THE NEVADA SCHOOL. HE OFTEN CLASHED WITH 
FORMER BASKETBALL COACH JERRY TARKANIAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 California State University trustees on Wednesday picked Robert C. Maxson, the 
embattled president of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, to be the new 
president of Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson, 57, nudged out interim Long Beach president Karl Anatol for the top 
spot, which he will assume July 1. Both met with Cal State trustees for final 
interviews Wednesday before Maxson was named to take over the 27,000-student 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't take this job to leave UNLV," Maxson said, referring to his 
sometimes stormy tenure at the Nevada school, where he often clashed with 
former basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian. "I had 10 wonderful years (at UNLV). I 
love UNLV. I love Las Vegas. I took this job because I wanted to be president 
of Cal State Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 As his first order of business, Maxson said he would "embrace the community 
and get it involved in the university," particularly through increased private 
giving. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what's happening all over the nation," he said about the need for 
aggressive fund raising. "It's not just California. States all over the country 
have had to look to the private sectors to help the public institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson's appointment underscores a push by Chancellor Barry Munitz and 
California State University trustees to hold campus presidents more responsible 
for raising private funds. Following years of deep state budget cuts, Munitz 
this fall will institute a new job requirement that the chief administrators on 
the 20 campuses raise between 5% and 10% of their budgets from outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The move also reunites Maxson and Munitz, both of whom worked at the 
University of Houston during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Munitz was 
chancellor of the university's central campus when Maxson was chancellor at 
Houston's Victoria Campus and a senior vice president for academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed to lead UNLV in 1984, Maxson worked to transform a school derided as 
"Tumbleweed Tech" into a burgeoning institution with a more solid academic 
reputation. His presidency coincided with the gambling capital's economic boom, 
and the desert campus bloomed with construction or plans for 35 new buildings, 
14 new accredited programs, 28 new degrees, a beefed-up faculty and a student 
population that nearly doubled to 19,682. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind this heady expansion, say school officials, was Maxson's talent at 
raising prodigious amounts of private gifts. He brought $100 million to the 
school's foundation through a variety of methods, including naming campus 
buildings after or conferring honorary degrees upon the most generous donors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maxson's work was overshadowed by his highly publicized feud with 
Tarkanian, widely adored by Nevada's sports-starved fans for building the 
Runnin' Rebels basketball team into a national powerhouse that won the NCAA 
championship in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Tark the Shark, as he was called, packed the sports arena and delighted Las 
Vegas civic boosters, but his program was dogged by NCAA investigations into 
recruiting violations. Three players were once photographed sharing a hot tub 
with a convicted sports "fixer," one prospect was arrested on cocaine charges 
and the team was secretly videotaped holding an illegal practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian quit, changed his mind, then quit again in 1991, but he remains a 
popular figure in Las Vegas. His supporters have continued to oppose Maxson, 
who had vowed to make academics a priority and bring the renegade basketball 
program in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got worse this year when the Rebels turned in a 15-13 season. "Bob 
Maxson was a revered president," said Madison Graves, a Nevada developer and 
UNLV regent. "But when he fired the most popular coach in the state of Nevada, 
who brought us a national championship, it divided the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's announcement brings the Maxson-Tarkanian saga full circle: Maxson 
comes to lead the campus where Tarkanian launched his coaching career before 
leaving in 1973 -- under a cloud of recruiting violations -- for greater glory 
at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach, Maxson will face decidedly different challenges. Nearly $30 
million in budget cuts have forced the school to drop football and men's 
swimming and close 700 class sessions on the 322-acre campus, limiting 
enrollment to 27,000 -- a reduction of 3,000 from last year. Profile: Robert C. 
Maxson * Born: May 8, 1936, in Watson, Ark.

<P>
 * Residence: Las Vegas

<P>
 * Education: Ph.D. in educational leadership from Mississippi State

Arkansas at Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: As president of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, 
Maxson was considered a consummate fund-raiser who brought an estimated $100 
million into the school's foundation. He is perhaps best known, however, for 
his long-running feud with former UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, who 
resigned in 1991.

COURT UPHOLDS RULING BANNING GATED PUBLIC STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles cannot fight crime by allowing homeowner groups to erect 
electronic gates on public streets to keep out unwanted traffic and 
pedestrians, the state Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 21-page decision upholding an earlier ruling by Superior Court Judge 
Robert H. O'Brien, a three-judge appeals panel compared the practice of gating 
public streets in some neighborhoods to medieval feudalism, a system that 
allowed powerful people to control access to designated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the city cannot do is wave a magic wand and declare a public street not 
to be a public street," the panel wrote in ruling against the Whitley Heights 
Civic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- with the approval of the Los Angeles City Council and at a cost 
of $350,000 of its own money -- two years ago erected seven gates across 
streets and sidewalks in Whitley Heights, a 1920s-era hillside neighborhood 
just east of the Hollywood Bowl. The group said the gates were needed to stem 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the grass-roots Citizens 
Against Gated Enclaves (CAGE), O'Brien ruled the gates illegal and ordered the 
homeowners not to close them. 
</P>
<P>
 The court decision handed down Wednesday upheld O'Brien's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 It noted that under its agreement with the Whitley Heights homeowners, the 
city had allowed the group to decide who is allowed in and out of the 
neighborhood while taxpayer money was used to maintain streets, sewers and 
storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling affects scores of groups that have sought applications from the 
city to gate their neighborhoods. Forty-three of those applications have been 
approved, but the approvals probably will have to be rescinded, legal experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling does not affect private communities whose streets are not 
designated for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 David Faustian, lawyer for the Whitley Heights group, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Howard, one of the lawyers who represented CAGE, called the ruling a 
victory for the poor and the less powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Court of Appeal got it exactly right," he said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CAMP TEACHES STUDENTS ABOUT INTERACTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an unlikely place to talk about school violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Birds chirp quietly as a breeze rustles tall pine trees in the lush hillsides 
of Griffith Park. Inside rustic cabins that dot the green hills, far from the 
gritty halls and daily trials of high school, 61 students are learning how to 
get along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should do this every month," said Iskui Chldrian, a junior at 
Ulysses S. Grant High School in Van Nuys. "There are so many stupid fights in 
school because of race and the way people dress." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, students from North Hollywood High School and Grant met at Camp 
Griffo as part of a program called Student-To-Student Interaction. The program 
offers one-day human relations workshops to elementary, middle school and high 
school students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1980 to address stereotypes and prejudice, the program's focus has 
expanded to include discussions of school violence. Over the years, however, 
Student-To-Student has suffered funding cuts, and its workshops have been 
whittled from two-day overnight trips at three different campsites to a one-day 
workshop at Camp Griffo. 
</P>
<P>
 But the students -- chosen by their schools for their leadership qualities -- 
seemed to make the most of their limited time. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the cabins, 10 students sat on chairs in a semicircle around adviser 
Chuck Coleman, who showed students how holding a picture one way made it look 
like a duck, while holding it another it was a rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a chance to look at something, look at it close," Coleman said. 
"See if there's another side." 
</P>
<P>
 In small groups, students talked about communication, campus violence, 
cross-cultural understanding and personal empowerment -- discussions that 
helped open some students' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maritza Martin del Campo, a junior at Grant, said her initial reaction to a 
student in the group who was dressed in baggy pants and a white T-shirt and 
wore his hair cropped extremely close to his head was to assume that he was a 
gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I saw him on the street, I'd be intimidated," she said. "But I learned how 
he felt. People need to take the time to know other people." SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SWEEPSTAKES SCAM REPORTED IN VALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scam artists claiming to represent the Publisher's Clearinghouse are working 
the San Fernando Valley and telling victims to wire money to cover the costs of 
delivering their prizes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police learned about the confidence game about a week ago, when a number of 
residents called the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Station to ask 
if the telephone offer was legitimate, said Sgt. Corina Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, police officers attempted to nab the con men by staking out a 
Western Union office in Downtown Los Angeles where the caller had directed the 
mark to send $90 to cover insurance and tax costs of delivering a new car, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one showed up to collect the money and the phony representative called back 
to complain that the resident never sent the cash, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Tom Gandara, who investigated the case until he turned it over to 
the Police Department's bunco unit Wednesday, said a company spokeswoman told 
him that there have been reports of similar scams on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the residents he contacted told him that they had entered the annual 
national sweepstakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bizarre," he said. "The last couple I heard from this morning 
(Wednesday) were told they won a color television and were told to send a $49 
freight charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandara said he also has learned that similar complaints from Valley residents 
have been taken at the Van Nuys and Devonshire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, hopefully, we'll be able to shut these guys down very soon," Gandara 
said. "Otherwise, we hope the publicity will make them go away." 
</P>
<P>

Washington, N. Y.-based company warns sweepstakes participants that any 
requests for money to receive prizes is fraudulent. CHIP JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS TELL TALES OF RED CROSS DEEDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local American Red Cross volunteers and people who have been served by the 
organization gathered Wednesday to share stories and celebrate American Red 
Cross Month and the 100th anniversary of the Anaheim House. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 people listened to volunteers talk about the rewards of their labor, 
and Mary Reed told of the dream the Red Cross helped her to realize six months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964 during the Vietnam War, Reed, 36, had been given up for adoption by a 
mother desperate to get her ill child out of Saigon. Reed had contracted 
smallpox and was adopted by a Thousand Oaks couple. Letters from her mother, 
Thanh Dao, stopped coming after two years when Dao lost Reed's address during a 
bombing raid on her village. Dao was presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, however, Reed was reunited with her mother, whom she hadn't 
seen in 29 years. The Red Cross, which tracks lost family members in 
war-stricken areas, had searched for Dao for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout "my childhood and most of my adulthood, I always had one dream, to 
hold my mother in my arms," Reed said. "After 29 years, my dream came true. . . 
. I have great respect and admiration for the Red Cross for making my dream 
come true and changing my life. It's a happy ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials said many people don't know about the organization's free 
tracking service or other services that are offered throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of coverage during the disasters," said Kara Lakkees, a 
spokeswoman for the Orange County chapter of the Red Cross. "But we're not like 
fairies in the night that just come out when everything goes bad. We're here 
all year round. Yesterday, today and always." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakkees said aid is provided during disasters, but youth activities and social 
services also are offered throughout the year. She said she hopes the 
celebration of Red Cross Month will inform people about the many services 
offered by the organization and inspire people to become volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Between tours of the Red Cross-owned and operated Anaheim House, a museum 
filled with Red Cross memorabilia, Vivian Engelbrecht told why she has been a 
volunteer for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's twofold," she explained. "You get joy from doing for others and personal 
satisfaction. It sounds corny, but in reality it's the truth." MIMI KO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CSUN BUILDING TO BE NAMED FOR RICHFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A building on the Cal State Northridge campus will be renamed for a pioneering 
faculty member and dean who died in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And students at other Cal State campuses say they plan to donate more than 
$12,000 to CSUN earthquake relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting Wednesday in Long Beach, the Board of Trustees of the Cal State system 
voted to change the name of the north wing of Sierra Hall to Jerome Richfield 
Hall, honoring the longtime humanities dean who was founder of CSUN's 
philosophy department. 
</P>
<P>
 The request was submitted by CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson based on 
Richfield's 30-year career at CSUN. He started in 1959 as a faculty member when 
the campus was called San Fernando Valley State College and retired in 1989 as 
dean of CSUN's School of Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
 Richfield, a Northridge resident, died in October, 1992, from complications of 
a heart attack. During his CSUN tenure, he worked to revise the curriculum, 
headed several faculty groups and was an advocate for the liberal arts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same board meeting, Associated Students presidents from the other 19 
campuses in the system said the donated money will be given to CSUN's 
Associated Students to help fund an existing program that offers campus 
bookstore vouchers to needy students. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's student government established the voucher program in the wake of the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, which caused major damage to the campus. The 
full amount was not donated Wednesday, but all of the money will be turned over 
to the CSUN student group in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Jun Kim, student body president at Sacramento State University, said the money 
was raised from student groups and individual contributions at the other 
campuses. He said student leaders at the other campuses decided after the 
earthquake to help their CSUN counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "As students, we do care about the big picture," Kim said. JOHN CHANDLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; POLICE SEEK GUNMAN WHO ROBBED EATERY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are looking for a gunman who disguised himself as a cook then robbed 
the Claim Jumper restaurant of $12,000 over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The man walked into the restaurant at 18050 Brookhurst St. at 7:30 a.m. 
Saturday through a rear door that had been opened for an early-morning 
delivery, said Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Dann Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect, armed with a handgun, attempted to disguise himself by dressing 
up in a cook's apron that he apparently found in the kitchen," Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber mingled with a cleanup crew before he slipped into the bookkeeper's

from the safe, Bean said.

<P>
 The robber left the restaurant through a back door and escaped in a waiting 
vehicle that was driven by a second man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber is described as black, in his mid-20s with black hair and brown 
eyes. He is approximately 6 feet tall, weighs about 200 pounds and has a medium 
build.

 He was last seen in a rust- or orange-colored Toyota Celica two-door hatchback 
with a California license plate.

<P>
 "Some of the employees said they saw this man at the restaurant earlier in the 
week, so he may have spent some time planning this," Bean said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL DISTRICT, UNION TO END TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Languishing since last summer, negotiations between the Orange Unified School 
District and its classified employees union are expected to conclude this week, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake may be the district's assertion to county education officials that 
the cash-strapped district will be financially sound next year.Earlier this 
month, the district's board approved a "positive" financial certification for 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires school districts to file financial status papers annually 
so that education officials can monitor a school system's fiscal health. A 
district can file a "positive," "qualified" or "negative" ranking. If a 
district files a qualified or negative report, the district's credit ratings 
could be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members approved the positive certification, assuming they could obtain 
an additional $130,000 in savings from the union negotiations. The district 
needs the $130,000 to balance its $107-million 1993-94 budget, chief fiscal 
officer Joyce Capelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the district cannot get the $130,000 from union negotiations, the 
district's financial reputation, which has been steadily improving in recent 
years, could be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 The union may find the necessary savings by reducing its health benefits, but 
officials would not elaborate further. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; COUNCIL OKS CUT IN PLANNING DEPT. FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously Monday to cut fees, some by as much as 50%, 
for routine applications filed with the city's Planning Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees were reduced for applications that can be processed quickly, such as 
requests to change the exterior colors of proposed buildings and extensions for 
projects that take longer than planned to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants now pay the same amount for plan changes, or revisions -- sometimes 
as much $1,200 -- as they do when they apply for a project the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should look at ways to reduce (fees) further, without hurting ourselves," 
said Councilman Jeffrey Thomas. He said business and homeowners need help while 
the local economy continues to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new fees, which will take effect immediately, a minor revision of a 
conditional use permit, such as a request for an additional rack to display 
more merchandise inside a store, will cost the applicant $350. Currently, the 
fee is $665. 
</P>
<P>
 A flat $250 fee will be charged for all extension requests. The 
extension-request fee now is more than $1,000 if the proposed project involves 
building more than 5,000 square feet of floor area, as in new apartments or 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain fees could be reduced further if the council decides to direct Asst. 
City Manager Christine Shingleton to also serve as a zoning administrator. The 
zoning administrator could help applicants cut red tape in processing planning 
and development applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that plan, fees for variance requests in East Tustin, for instance, 
could be reduced from $380 to $95, Shingleton said. An ordinance to approve her 
expanded duties is expected to go before the council in about 30 days, she 
said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FUND FOR WETLANDS PRESERVATION CREATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors this week created a wetlands preservation fund that 
will put penalty money paid by developers who destroy marginal wetlands into a 
program that protects more ecologically valuable areas.  
</P>
<P>
 The $50,000 per acre that developers pay when their projects tread on wetlands 
will now be set aside to help fragile land in parks or nature preserves, said 
Robert G. Fisher, director of the county's harbors, beaches and parks division. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said the program will not give developers free rein to build on 
wetlands, nor will it help them sidestep the variety of federal and state 
environmental regulations already protecting sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The program recognizes the fact that all wetlands were not created equal, 
Fisher said, nor are they equally valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fragmented, small wetlands spring up sometimes when an area is cleared and 
runoff (water) from nearby comes in," Fisher said, citing the extreme example 
of a mini-wetlands he once saw created on a large, freshly graded lot by a 
neighbor's sprinklers. "It creates a kind of accidental wetland that may not be 
long term or valuable to the habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing development on these fragmented areas does not harm the wetlands 
system, and it will generate money that will help county parks officials to 
dedicate more resources to maintaining larger, established wetlands. "It's a 
win-win situation," Fisher said. GEOFF BOUCHER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MOTORIST ADMITS RUNNING OVER OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Arleta man pleaded guilty Wednesday to driving drunk and running over a Los 
Angeles police motorcycle officer who was stationed at a sobriety checkpoint 
Thanksgiving weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 After he pleaded guilty to felony charges of driving under the influence and 
hit-and-run, Juan Hinojosa was sentenced to three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge John Fisher sentenced Hinojosa, 24, after he 
agreed to a plea bargain in which prosecutors dismissed two counts of assault 
with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Hinojosa had a blood alcohol content of at least 0.22 percent 
-- nearly three times the legal limit -- when he ran over Officer Jeffrey 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was stationed at a sobriety checkpoint at Van Nuys Boulevard and 
Nordhoff Street in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD and California Highway Patrol officers were stopping vehicles traveling 
southbound on Van Nuys Boulevard when Hinojosa, who was speeding in a 
northbound direction, struck Williams' motorcycle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year veteran was thrown into the air, landing on Hinojosa's 1980 Toyota 
and shattering the windshield, police said. Witnesses said the car spun out and 
the officer fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinojosa then made a U-turn and ran over Williams, Deputy Dist. Atty. David 
Mintz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who spent 15 days in the hospital, suffered a lacerated liver, six 
broken ribs and a punctured lung in the Nov. 28 incident. He has since been 
released from the hospital and is undergoing physical therapy with hopes of 
returning to the force. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: HEARING PLANNED ON DONUT SHOP LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hearing on a request to restrict the operation of a donut shop that police 
allege is a nuisance and a magnet for crime has been set for May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the shop, Orville's Originals, have already cut back hours but 
plan to fight the issue before a city zoning official. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, the shop at Vanowen Avenue and Sepulveda Boulevard was the 
base of operations for Mary Lou Holte, who launched a personal crusade to clean 
up the streets in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owners Ulysses and Zuita Contador have blamed their problems on Holte. 
She has left the shop and has stated that she will testify against the 
Contadors at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings will be held at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club, 4808 Kester Ave., 
in Sherman Oaks. Zoning officials from the city of Los Angeles will use police 
and public testimony during each hearing to decide whether to restrict the 
location's operating hours, force the owners to hire security or take other 
action. JEFF SCHNAUFER

CRITICISM CROWDS OUT BERGESON'S OCCUPANCY-LIMIT BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill that would allow Santa Ana and other cities to reduce overcrowded 
housing made an inauspicious debut Wednesday as a state Senate committee put 
off a decision on the measure until next month and asked backers to incorporate 
better safeguards against discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, authored by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), drew 
criticism from some members of the Senate Local Government Committee, who said 
its lack of stated occupancy limits gives leeway to civic leaders eager to 
evict low-income residents and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without any kind of standard, it's very difficult to just give unfettered 
discretion to local bodies," said Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier). "I 
think all of us agree there will be some cities that will abuse that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson agreed to work with officials from Santa Ana and other cities to 
establish occupancy guidelines as part of the legislation, which municipal 
officials have been championing as a way to decrease fire danger in apartments 
and houses jammed with residents and their belongings. The measure will be 
heard again April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Current state law allows up to 10 people in a 500-square-foot apartment, but 
Santa Ana officials would like to see the limit cut roughly in half, reasoning 
that it would dramatically reduce the fire risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can strike a happy medium between providing affordable housing and making 
sure it is safe for people," Santa Ana Councilman Robert L. Richardson told the 
committee. "Right now we have a state housing policy that is doing neither of 
those. It is not producing housing and it is clearly unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana has been attempting for several years to enact an overcrowding 
ordinance. The law was declared illegal by a state appellate court in 1992 
because it was in conflict with state housing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have long argued that overcrowding strains the school system, 
overloads sewers and burdens police. It also wears down property and gives 
neighborhoods a blighted appearance, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that a stricter occupancy law would not reduce Santa Ana's 
overcrowding problem but would criminalize poor people and prompt landlords to 
discriminate against large families, many of them Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing occupancy limits "are issues that should remain at the state level," 
Christine Minnehan of the Western Center on Law & Poverty told the committee 
members. She also argued that local governments have "many of the tools" they 
need to ensure that housing remains fire safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the delay by the committee, Bergeson and Santa Ana officials remain 
hopeful the measure will eventually be embraced. "It's going to be tough," 
Bergeson said. "Opposition to this bill is very strong."

COYOTE TRAPPING DEBATE CONTINUES; WILDLIFE: ANIMAL REGULATION COMMISSION CALLS 
FOR FURTHER STUDY IN AN ATTEMPT TO REACH A COMPROMISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a long, contentious hearing on a controversial nine-month ban on coyote 
trapping, the Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission on Wednesday called for 
further study before deciding how to stop coyotes from foraging for food in 
residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is expected to seek a compromise that will appease wildlife 
conservationists, who oppose coyote trapping, and hillside residents -- mostly 
in the west San Fernando Valley -- who say trapping is needed to protect pets 
and children from coyote attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to ask animal regulation officials to draft recommendations 
within 60 days put an anticlimatic end to a meeting that was expected to finish 
the emotional debate over coyote trapping once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is expected to decide whether to continue a nine-month ban on coyote 
trapping despite an increase in coyote sightings in the urban foothill areas, a 
ban that will remain in effect in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came during a sometimes emotional meeting at Parkman Middle 
School in Woodland Hills attended by about 110 people, many of whom live in the 
hillside areas where coyote sightings have been on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The memory of my little Kelly's moans is more piercing than any yelp a coyote 
could make," said Cathy Keen, mother of a 3-year-old girl killed by a coyote in 
Glendale in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapping -- though painful to the animal -- would make neighborhoods safer for 
children, Keen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that trapping was a solution, but it kept the coyotes under 
control," said Melvin Sumner, a longtime Woodland Hills resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife conservationists oppose trapping, saying the best way to keep coyotes 
out of urban neighborhoods is to cut off their food supply by keeping pets and 
pet food in at night, fencing yards and securing lids on trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need for coexistence is here," said Martine Collette, operator of the 
Wildlife Waystation in the Angeles National Forest, which shelters injured and 
homeless wild animals. "The coyote will not go away." 
</P>
<P>
 "The state supports the ban on trapping," said Bob Schlichting, a spokesman 
for the state Fish and Game Department, drawing applause from the coyote-rights 
partisans. "The animals should be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 The trapping controversy began in June when the Animal Regulation Commission 
voted -- partly in response to pressure from animal-rights advocates -- to halt 
the trapping of coyotes by city employees. But the panel left residents the 
option of hiring a certified pest-control company to trap the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, animal regulation officers must kill a coyote after it is trapped and 
are forbidden to relocate coyotes to other areas within the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Since trapping was banned, hillside residents, mostly in the West Valley, have 
complained of an increase in coyote sightings and attacks on pets. Michael 
Lazarous, a Woodland Hills resident, contends that his young son, a toddler, 
was stalked and nearly attacked in his back yard by a coyote. In one case, an 
animal regulation officer was forced to shoot to death a coyote stalking a 
small dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in sightings and the storm of controversy over the ban prompted 
animal regulation officials to considering reviewing the policy. The commission 
met in Woodland Hills because most of the coyote complaints came from the West 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal regulation officers attribute the increase in sightings to a 
combination of factors, including recent wildfires that drove coyotes into 
urban areas, the trapping ban and a seasonal abundance of the small wildlife 
that coyotes feed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the controversy, wildlife conservationists and hillside residents 
have offered a variety of solutions to the coyote problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cal State San Bernardino professor has suggested that the city feed coyotes 
food laced with a nontoxic salt to make the animals sick and discourage them 
from returning to a neighborhood.

MEETING TO FOCUS ON REBUILDING BETTER VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elected officials and community leaders will meet in Reseda on Friday to 
discuss ways to build a better San Fernando Valley in the wake of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Valley Leadership Conference: Rebuilding the Valley" will include 
discussions on transportation, regional economic development, emergency 
preparedness and housing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference will be held at Reseda High School's Regent Hall from 8:30 to 
5:15 p.m. and is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco emerged as a better city out of the rubble and ashes of the 
1906 earthquake -- not by rebuilding everything as it has been, but by 
rebuilding as it needed to be," said state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the conference is to "reflect on the opportunities this 
earthquake gives us for rebuilding our community as new money, new jobs and new 
designs come our way," the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Senate Select Committee on the Northridge Earthquake, which 
is headed by Roberti, the conference is expected to draw participants from 
community groups throughout the Valley. Several state senators, assembly 
members and City Council members will participate in the discussion, along with 
representatives of the city's Housing Department, Board of Transportation, Fire 
Department and Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Management consultant and CSU Prof. Leo Coleman will be the keynote speaker 
and will discuss, "Millenium 2000: Living, Learning and Working in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Conference organizers said they hoped that the event would produce a 
collective plan for rebuilding the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common vision of the future that we will start developing on Friday can 
guide the elected leaders in making their decisions in the coming days and 
months," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday is the first of what will probably be several planned events sponsored 
by the Senate Select Committee on the Northridge Earthquake, said Gregory 
deGiere, Roberti's spokesman. The committee has coordinated quake-related 
legislation in the Senate.

CITY BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS ARE OFFERED PLEDGE OF NO LAYOFFS IN LIEU OF RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has voted to offer the city's trash haulers, 
janitors, jailers and other blue-collar workers no raise over the next two 
years, but a guarantee that they will not be laid off in favor of private 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,500 members of Local 347 of the Service Employees International Union 
will begin voting by mail this week on whether to ratify the contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Union General Manager David Trowbridge said Tuesday that the prospect of no 
raise has become less palatable since Mayor Richard Riordan said police 
officers would be offered a pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trowbridge said the promise of job security may be more important to union 
members because Riordan announced plans to consider hiring private firms to 
provide trash collection and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Job protection has been our rallying cry since last summer," when Riordan was 
elected, Trowbridge said. "How much you get paid isn't important if you don't 
have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed pact would cover nearly two years retroactively and run through 
July 1, 1996. It would give the blue-collar workers another chance to negotiate 
a raise next summer but makes no promises of higher pay.

2 GET LIFE SENTENCES IN FATAL CARJACKING CASE; CRIME: TRIGGERMAN, OTHER

<P>
 The final two defendants in a carjacking that left a teacher's aide fatally 
shot in a Westminster park almost three years ago were sentenced Wednesday to 
the harshest terms possible under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggerman Enrique Segoviano, 20, was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Luis 
A. Cardenas to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 
first-degree murder, plus nine additional years for other counts that included 
carjacking, robbery and belonging to a criminal street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Gonzalez, 23, who went to Bowling Green Park with the other gang 
members but had no weapon when Janet L. Bicknell was shot in her car, was 
sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder.

 The youths, all members of a Santa Ana gang, were arrested shortly after the 
August, 1991, shooting at a nearby convenience store, where they had stopped to 
cover rival gang graffiti with their own slogans. They had allegedly planned to 
steal a car and use it in a drive-by shooting on rival turf.  
</P>
<P>
 When Bicknell, a 49-year-old playground supervisor at a Huntington Beach 
school, refused to turn her car over, Segoviano shot her in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Anderson said the sentences should send a strong 
message to gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely satisfied that the conduct warrants the sentence, and I truly 
hope that gang members will see the consequences and take, if nothing else, an 
instant to think about what they're doing," Anderson said. "This case is a fine 
example of gang group behavior and how dangerous it is. It's more than 
appropriate for the court to sentence in the fashion that it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's attorney, however, countered that his client's sentence stemmed 
from hysteria over gangs and far outweighed his culpability in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't the perpetrator, he didn't have the gun, and he was 80 feet away 
when the crime occurred," Jerome Goldfein said of Gonzalez. "It's clear that my 
client was less culpable than any of the others and certainly less culpable 
than one who got probation." 
</P>
<P>
 Gang member Christopher F. Martinez, who both the defense and prosecution say 
was an instigator of the carjacking, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, 
testified against the others and received probation.  
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old pleaded guilty, and Gonzalez's brother, Edel Gonzalez, who was 
16 at the time, was sentenced last year by Cardenas to life in prison without 
the possibility of parole, making him the youngest person in Orange County 
history to receive that punishment.  
</P>
<P>
 In a written plea to Cardenas, Bicknell's brother, John Bicknell, urged that 
the defendants be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young men you have before you shot and killed my sister. They destroyed 
her without a thought," his statement said. "I believe they should be given the 
same punishment they gave Janet."

STRONG, COLD STORM EXPECTED; MUDSLIDES 'A GOOD POSSIBILITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A potent storm from the Gulf of Alaska is expected to pummel Southern 
California with hail, snow, heavy rain and thunder late today, posing a renewed 
threat of destructive mudslides below Orange County hills denuded during last 
fall's devastating brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm, which could last through Sunday, is expected to drop up to two 
inches of rain in Orange County and as much as a foot of snow at mountain 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty strong early-spring storm, stronger than usual for Southern 
California," said Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. "There's 
definitely a good possibility of mudslides in the burn areas. And it's going to 
be pretty cold, too, with the snow level down to 3,000 feet in some areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the storm -- which struck Northern California late Wednesday 
and began working its way down the coast -- is expected to move inland across 
Santa Barbara and Ventura counties sometime this afternoon, reaching this area 
before nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said the precipitation here will begin with light rain, shifting to 
heavier rain, with thunderstorms and hail during the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the thunderstorms could be severe," Thoren said. "That means winds at 
up to 55 m.p.h. and hail as big as three-quarters of an inch in diameter." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service said the rain will continue, off and on but 
occasionally heavy, through Friday and Saturday and possibly into Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Storms like this are hard to gauge, but there's a pretty good moisture tap 
this time," Thoren said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Thoren said, the precipitation should range from an inch in 
coastal areas to two inches in the mountains, unless the storm system connects 
with a subtropical system now between Hawaii and Baja, producing even greater 
rainfall.

GUNMEN ROB COMPUTER WHOLESALER OF CHIPS; CRIME: THREE TO FIVE MEN FORCE 
EMPLOYEES TO LIE ON FLOOR WHILE THEY TAKE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS. INCIDENT IS 
FIFTH OF ITS KIND IN COUNTY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Armed men invaded a high-tech facility Wednesday, ordering employees to the 
floor while they robbed the company of valuable computer chips and other 
electronic components. The computer chip robbery was the fifth of its kind in 
Orange County in the past 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea police, who patrol Yorba Linda, said that three to five men armed with 
handguns and a knife entered Shecom Computers, a wholesaler of computer 
components, in the 22700 block of Savi Ranch Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 While one of the men ordered the employees to lie down in a sales area, the 
others removed computer hardware parts -- including memory chips -- from a rear 
storeroom, according to Detective Clyde A. Wason. No dollar value was placed on 
the loss, Wason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police surrounded the building within a minute of receiving a 911 call from 
the company, Wason said, but by then the suspects had fled through a back door. 
</P>
<P>
 Three similar robberies took place in the city of Brea from Feb. 1, 1993, to 
Feb. 16 of this year. On Dec. 12, 1993, armed men in Irvine stole thousands of 
dollars' worth of computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have been looking into the likelihood that some of the robberies 
are related because the crime pattern involves robberies by "three to five 
armed, Asian suspects who usher employees into a room in a business, and 
sequester them there while a robbery is taking place," Wason said. "And because 
the product taken in many instances is related to computer assembly or 
hardware." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea investigators have shared information with Irvine police on one of the 
Brea chip robberies, but there is no concrete evidence linking them so far, 
Wason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have made arrests only in connection with the first Orange County 
robbery, on Feb. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, four men believed to have planned the robbery of PC Craft Inc. 
were arrested in Monterey Park and later pleaded guilty to a variety of charges 
related to the robbery. Police recovered more than $300,000 in computer chips 
and other electronic equipment from them. 
</P>
<P>
 But PC Craft officials said later that the loss of a total of $2.2 million in 
stolen chips ultimately cost the company $5.9 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Those responsible for carrying out the armed robbery were never apprehended. 
Such robberies are tempting to thieves, Wason said, in part because there are 
generally no identifying marks on chips, making them difficult to trace and 
easy to sell.

VENTURA BOULEVARD FUNDING SHIFT SUPPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Property owners' share of the bill for Ventura Boulevard improvements would be 
cut from nearly 90% to about half under a report adopted by a Ventura Boulevard 
planning board, with government funds making up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board, meeting in Van Nuys on 
Tuesday, approved the report, which calls for property owners to pay for 52% of 
the plan's budget and for Los Angeles city and other governmental agency funds 
to pay 48%. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan provides for widening intersections, building parking structures, 
running community shuttles and revamping pedestrian walkways  
</P>
<P>
 The report will be sent to the city Planning Commission and the City Council. 
On Feb. 10, the board submitted a draft of the report to the Planning 
Commission recommending that the commission scale back the goals of the 
Specific Plan and reduce costs from $220 million to $100.3 million. The 
commission agreed to consider the recommendations, which affect Ventura 
Boulevard between Woodland Hills and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 The report calls for public funds to come from federal, state and local 
sources such as state highway funds, Propositions A and C, the city of Los 
Angeles and permit parking districts along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair to charge property owners on Ventura Boulevard to pay for all 
the improvements," board chairman Jeff Brain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recommendation calls for the elimination of "trip fees" -- a charge to 
business owners based on each afternoon car trip that planners estimate their 
property generates. The report recommended charging business owners a certain 
rate per square foot of internal building space instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found (trip fees) to be a disincentive to doing business on the 
boulevard," Brain said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which was appointed by the City Council, is made up of owners and 
residents of property along and near Ventura Boulevard.

4 COURTROOMS CLOSED IN WAKE OF AFTERSHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Already faced with a courtroom shortage, officials in Van Nuys Superior Court 
suffered another hit Wednesday when an entire floor was closed for as long as a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Sunday's 5.3-magnitude aftershock, four courtrooms on the 
seventh floor of the Superior Court building were declared off-limits due to 
possible asbestos contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 When asbestos monitors found there was no danger, engineers stepped in 
Wednesday and said the closure will continue because of fear that giant marble 
slabs hanging on walls in public corridors may fall to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Marble specialists will be brought in Friday to determine how best to remove 
the wall panels without damaging them. The floor could be closed for up to one 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials in Van Nuys have managed to find space for nine San Fernando 
Superior Court judges forced to move from their courtrooms when the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake caused severe damage to the 10-year-old courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to accommodate the San Fernando judges, temporary courtrooms in 
trailers that had been mothballed more than two years were pressed into 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Court administrators have scrambled all week to find space for the four judges 
with courtrooms on the affected floor. Judge John Fisher was forced Wednesday 
to conduct business in the Municipal Court building next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Meredith C. Taylor is planning to begin working today in her chambers on 
the seventh floor before hearing some matters in a courtroom she will share on 
the third floor, officials said. Taylor will then continue taking testimony in 
a death penalty murder trial in another courtroom on the fourth floor, 
according to administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll handle it on a piecemeal basis," said Judge Robert M. Letteau, who 
manages Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll need to be patient for a couple of days," said Judge Judith M. Ashmann, 
who oversees San Fernando's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ashmann said Wednesday the San Fernando courthouse will cost $15 
million and take a year to repair.

PROSECUTOR URGES MURDER CONVICTION IN FATAL ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 While conceding that the defendant is not the gunman, a prosecutor 
nevertheless asked a jury Wednesday to convict a Pacoima man of murder in the 
death of a soft drink salesman who was executed during a supermarket robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels told a Van Nuys Superior Court jury that 
Jose Santillan is responsible for the death of a Coca-Cola representative 
because he participated in a crime that led to a death. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those who participate in the robbery are responsible for any murder 
which occurs during the robbery, whether or not they were the actual killer," 
Samuels said in her opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor asked for a conviction on first-degree murder, a charge that 
carries a mandatory penalty of 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Santillan, 20, is charged in the death of Robert Ward Jr., a 28-year-old 
Palmdale man who was talking on the phone to his fiancee -- apparently unaware 
a robbery was taking place -- when a gunman fired into the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still searching for the gunman and another suspect in the Oct. 19, 
1992, killing in the Ralphs supermarket at Sherman Way and Woodman Avenue in 
Van Nuys. The pair have been featured on several national crime shows, but 
authorities believe that they have fled to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the murder, Santillan faces 20 felony charges related to his 
alleged participation in a six-week series of armed robberies at San Fernando 
Valley supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Santillan is accused of participating in eight robberies at seven stores. The 
Ralphs where Ward was gunned down was hit twice in a two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors originally charged Santillan with special circumstance allegations 
in Ward's death that could have sent him to the gas chamber, but a Municipal 
Court judge threw out those charges last summer.

AMENDMENTS THREATEN ANTI-SMOKING MEASURE; LEGISLATURE: ASSEMBLYMAN FRIEDMAN 
SAYS HE WILL DROP HIS BILL UNLESS SENATE COMMITTEE CHANGES THAT REDUCE ITS 
SCOPE ARE REMOVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Portending a major legislative victory for the tobacco industry, the author of 
potentially landmark anti-smoking legislation said Wednesday that he will drop 
his bill to ban smoking in almost all indoor workplaces unless he can remove 
controversial amendments added by a Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Tuesday night session heavily attended by tobacco lobbyists, the Senate 
Judiciary Committee approved the bill by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), but inserted an amendment prohibiting cities from adopting 
stricter anti-smoking ordinances. A second amendment could permit smoking in up 
to 25% of the space in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not pursue the bill with these amendments," Friedman said. "They are 
hostile, they are anti-worker, they are anti-business, and they serve the 
interests of the tobacco industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Sens. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Charles Calderon (D-Whittier), the 
committee imposed the amendments over the objections of Friedman and business 
and health groups that had supported the smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill has just been raped," said Tony Najera, lobbyist for the American 
Lung Assn. Unless the amendments are removed, Najera said, "we will do 
everything possible to make sure it is killed." 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry, long a rich source of campaign funds, began losing 
ground in Sacramento last year when Friedman's bill gained surprising support. 
Los Angeles, San Francisco and scores of smaller cities imposed tough smoking 
restrictions. And state health officials issued a report showing that the 
percentage of adults who smoke has declined to 19.1% from almost 30% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the tobacco industry is battling back with renewed fury. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's largest tobacco company, is paying the 
costs of gathering 600,000 voter signatures to place an initiative on the 
November ballot in California that would erase local anti-tobacco ordinances 
and impose a statewide standard allowing smoking in ventilated areas of 
workplaces, including restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris and others have filed a lawsuit challenging a local ordinance 
restricting smoking in restaurants and other indoor workplaces in San 
Francisco. A victory in the suit could threaten other local smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Heightening the tensions, the anti-smoking group, Americans for Nonsmokers 
Rights, resorted to the courts Wednesday, charging in a lawsuit that Gov. Pete 
Wilson and the Legislature refuse to fully implement 1988's Proposition 99, 
which added a 25-cent cigarette tax to fund anti-smoking campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Legislature, Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) is pushing a bill to 
eliminate state income tax deductions for lobbying and promotions by the 
tobacco industry, while Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run) is pushing a 
2-cents-a-pack tax to fund research on prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the bills introduced in recent years have had the sweep of 
Friedman's bill. It began last year as a flat-out ban on smoking in all indoor 
workplaces. To win endorsements and gather votes of skeptical legislators, 
Friedman amended it to allow smoking, with restrictions, in card clubs, bars, 
hotel rooms and a few other places. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as it entered the Senate Judiciary Committee, the bill would have 
created perhaps the toughest state anti-smoking law in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the process, Friedman managed to keep intact a provision allowing 
local governments to impose stricter smoking bans. But that unraveled when 
Calderon won committee support for his amendment prohibiting cities from 
imposing stricter anti-smoking ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 A statewide standard that would abolish stiff local ordinances is one of the 
tobacco industry's key goals in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Torres, a candidate for state insurance commissioner, engineered 
passage of an amendment that could allow smoking in restaurants. He insisted 
that he was supporting anti-tobacco efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't put me with the tobacco industry," Torres told Friedman during one of 
their heated exchanges. "Don't you dare do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' amendment would require Cal/OSHA, the state job safety agency, to 
develop standards allowing smoking in up to 25% of the space in restaurants. If 
no standards could be developed, he said, smoking would be banned in 
restaurants.

COMBAT ABUSE WITH BONDING, EXPERT SAYS; SOCIAL WORK: YOUTH VIOLENCE CAN BE 
REDUCED IF GROUPS MIMIC WHAT GANGS DO BEST, LEADING AUTHORITY TELLS CONFERENCE 
ATTENDEES.

<P>
 A leading authority on child abuse prevention said Wednesday that gangs, youth 
violence and teen pregnancy can be reduced if community groups mimic what gangs 
do so successfully: Offer bonding and encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a conference organized by the Child Abuse Prevention Council of 
Orange County, Prof. David J. Hawkins of the University of Washington said, "If 
you want to prevent these problems before they happened, you must identify the 
factors," emphasizing the need for incentives and recognition for 
performance."Gangs understand this model very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, which continues today at the Sheraton Anaheim Hotel, focuses 
on youth problems such as molestation, violence, drug abuse and teen pregnancy. 
It was attended Wednesday by about 600 social workers, nurses, psychologists 
and other professionals working with children and youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has professionals with a lot to share, and we needed a forum 
for that," said Glennda Mourer, director of the Orange County campus of the USC 
School of Social Work. Mourer founded the conference in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission is to provide the highest quality training at the lowest possible 
cost," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Janis Webb, program manager of the Children's Home Society in Santa Ana, has 
attended the conference three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's excellent -- on the cutting edge of issues. Other conferences often 
discuss safe issues or issues you've discussed before, but this -- the issues 
are really put out there."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 1,000 RACIST FLYERS FOUND AT PLACERITA JUNIOR 
HIGH; HATE LITERATURE: IT IS BELIEVED TO BE THE LARGEST DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH 
LEAFLETS IN NORTHERN L.A. COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 1,000 flyers containing derogatory remarks about Latinos and Jews 
were stuffed into student lockers at Placerita Junior High School in what 
authorities said was the largest distribution of hate literature in northern 
Los Angeles County in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaflets, distributed on the campus before classes Monday, come on the 
heels of an incident in which racist flyers appeared late last year in soft 
drink cartons and other merchandise in area grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad commentary that people are so hateful toward other people that 
they would do this," said Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson, whose grandson 
attends the school. "It's a cowardly act." 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson said the leaflets don't indicate a city trend. Hatred and prejudice 
can, he said, be found universally. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident represents the largest distribution of hate literature that law 
enforcement officers can remember in northern Los Angeles County, and the first 
on a Santa Clarita Valley school campus, said Sgt. Howard Fairchild of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not the first such incident in the valley. About a dozen 
anti-Latino leaflets were discovered in soda packs, backpacks and female 
hygiene products in December at several Santa Clarita grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities said that in both incidents, the flyers gave a 
phone number for the White Aryan Resistance group in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen these particular flyers before, but we know they're coming 
from the same area," Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hate literature is inflammatory, it is rarely illegal because of the 
Constitution's First Amendment protections, authorities said. A person caught 
putting such materials in student lockers could only be charged with 
trespassing, Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a real low-grade misdemeanor," Fairchild said. "The flyers 
themselves don't constitute a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, school administrators were angered by the leaflets, then decided to 
use the incident to launch discussions about racism, cultural diversity and 
tolerance. On Tuesday, teachers began lessons using "A World of Differences," a 
program that shows how to confront prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials wanted to respond to the flyers without giving them 
unwarranted notoriety, said Placerita Junior High Principal Jim Tanner.

 "Like so many things, you ask if you're going to give more attention to it" by 
discussing the leaflets in class, Tanner said. "We felt there was going to be 
more good coming out of it. It was a natural hook." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers were trained to use "A World of Differences" materials five years 
ago, and enough of those staff members remain to present the lessons 
effectively, Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,300 students are enrolled in the Newhall school, including about 260 
Latinos. Most youths characterized the 3-by-8-inch flyers, containing an 
insulting rhyme about Latinos and a derogatory reference to Jews, as stupid and 
threw them away, Tanner said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 LANCASTER MEN SOUGHT IN DOUBLE SLAYING; 
CRIME: SUSPECTS ARE ACCUSED OF SHOOTING THE PAIR IN A BUNGLED ROBBERY ATTEMPT 
AT AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Lancaster men are being sought in connection with a double slaying at an 
apartment complex here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's homicide investigators said Terry Tyrone Evans, 18, and state prison 
parolee Harry Jackson Boyd, 26, knew the man and woman they are accused of 
murdering in a bungled robbery attempt. Charges of first-degree murder and 
robbery were filed against Evans and Boyd and warrants were issued Tuesday for 
their arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began in a parked car early on the morning of March 1 at Antelope 
Valley Apartments in the 43400 block of 32nd Street West. Ronald Greene, 22, of 
Upland was shot once in the back of the head while Latonya Walker, 23, of 
Ontario was shot in the hand, upper body and head. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the shooting, Evans and Boyd were sitting in the back seat of the 
victims' car, said Deputy Patrick Hauser. "Without warning, Evans shot Greene 
once in the head with a semiautomatic pistol." 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide Bureau Lt. Ray Peavy said Evans probably shot Greene because Greene 
also had a gun. "Their intent from the beginning was to rob (Greene)," Peavy 
said. "Their intent was to shoot him so there would be no chance for them to 
get shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans and Boyd never got any money, Peavy said. Despite their quick search of 
Greene's body for cash, they did not find anything, Peavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, however, found $4,500 in cash hidden in Greene's clothing, 
although, Hauser said, it was later determined that more than $4,000 was 
counterfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, a coroner's investigator was sentenced to 90 days in jail 
after pleading no contest to a charge that she stole some of the counterfeit 
money from Greene's body. Candi Lea Culberson resigned from the coroner's 
office after admitting that she stole the money. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the money that brought Evans and Boyd together with the two they are 
accused of killing. Greene and Walker picked up their suspected killers after 
Greene "flashed a large amount of cash and indicated he had $8,000," Peavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Evans shot Greene, his gun jammed, Hauser said. Walker, who was sitting 
in the passenger seat of the car, fled from the car but was chased and held by 
Boyd about 15 feet away from the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans then took Greene's handgun from the front of the car and walked over to 
Walker. "As Walker pleaded for her life, (Evans) fired three shots at her," 
Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "Evans put the gun on the ground and walked with Boyd to a waiting 
car driven by a third man." 
</P>
<P>
 Peavy said the third man is not being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd was released from prison less than two months before the shooting, 
according to the state Department of Corrections. Boyd's prison record dates 
back to 1987 when he was sentenced to 30 months in prison for oral sex with a 
child under 14. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 he was convicted on a charge of possession of a controlled substance 
for sale, according to the Corrections Department. After serving 10 months in 
prison, Boyd was paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd was twice returned to prison for parole violations. In January, 1992, he 
served additional time on a variety of charges.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PRIEST RESIGNS, PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN 
MOLESTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Episcopal priest has been charged with sexually molesting two teen-age boys 
who attended his Palmdale church and has resigned from his clerical post, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Ducker, 63, pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Antelope Municipal Court 
to eight counts of committing various sex acts with minors. He remained in Los 
Angeles County Jail Wednesday in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker befriended the two youths, who are now 15 and 14, and allegedly 
molested them over the past two years, Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Portillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An older brother of one of the boys learned about the incidents and reported 
it to his mother, who contacted authorities last week, said Detective Ron 
Schram, a sheriff's child abuse investigator. The priest was arrested Sunday at 
his Palmdale apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schram said he is trying to determine whether any other youngsters were abused 
at Christ the King Mission in Palmdale, where Ducker had served as vicar since 
1991, or at a Northern California church where Ducker previously worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Ducker informed the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles "that he 
had been involved in sexual misconduct with teen-age minors," said Robert 
Williams, a diocese spokesman. "Upon informing the bishop's office of this, he 
immediately resigned his position as vicar . . . The bishop has removed him 
from any and all priestly duties anywhere in the Episcopal Church." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Roy Wallen, assigned to represent Ducker, said 
Wednesday that he could not comment on Ducker's statement to the church. Wallen 
said criminal defendants usually plead not guilty at their arraignments to give 
their attorneys time to review police reports and to decide how to proceed with 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The diocese has offered counseling and other support to the families involved 
in the case and to other members of the Palmdale church, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker was ordained as a deacon in 1955 and as a priest in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he attended a seminar on clerical sexual misconduct, which is 
mandatory for all priests in the diocese.

MOHR EXPECTED TO BE NAMED CANYON FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canyon High School is expected to announce as early as today that assistant 
coach Larry Mohr will succeed Harry Welch as the school's head football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch confirmed that Mohr was one of the three finalists for the job. The 
others, Riverside Poly Coach Dan Armstrong and former El Segundo Coach Dave 
Chauncey, said they have been eliminated as candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Principal Mike Allmandinger would not confirm that Mohr has been 
offered the job, but Mohr said Wednesday, "I don't know anything but I think 
that I have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Allmandinger said he would make his recommendation to the William S. Hart 
Union High School District trustees, who were expected to meet in closed 
session on the matter Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a letter in the mail today saying I was not chosen," Armstrong said 
Tuesday. "I felt my interview went real well. I kind of thought I had the 
inside track. And I've heard through the coaching grapevine I'm not the guy for 
the (Valencia High) job either." 
</P>
<P>
 Chauncey, who lives in the Santa Clarita Valley and commutes daily to a 
teaching job at Hawthorne High, said he applied at Canyon and Valencia, which 
opens in September but won't start varsity football until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is I'm not getting either job," Chauncey said. "I'm still 
looking around, but I'm sure Larry will do a good job (if he gets it)." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr, 35, is a special education teacher who came to Canyon last fall after 
serving 12 seasons as an assistant at Thousand Oaks. Welch, who posted a 
120-31-2 record and led the Cowboys to three Southern Section championships in 
12 years at Canyon, endorsed Mohr, calling his expected selection "a wise 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry is knowledgeable, intense and already has a good rapport with the 
players," Welch said. "They like him and respect him. He would bring his fresh 
ideas while he would maintain tradition. He is my endorsement without 
reservation. I know he'll do well."

A DESERT HIGH; KYMAN FINDS FRESH AIR, FRESH START TO HIS CAREER AND LIFE AT 
LITTLEROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How is renewal sought? 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Kyman took a hard drive to the Antelope Valley from his Northridge home 
of two decades, bore east past gravel quarries, stray dogs and a dilapidated 
county raceway, and kept going until the paved road ends at Avenue R and 110th 
Street East. 
</P>
<P>
 He looked left and there sat immaculate Littlerock High, what Kyman's friend 
and colleague Jim Bauer calls "an oasis among all this." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an oasis from grief for Kyman, 53, whose wife of 27 years went to bed on 
a May night in 1990 and never woke up after two aneurysms burst at the base of 
her brain. Patricia Kyman went into a coma and died 11 days later at 47. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is a place to rekindle a love for coaching that for 30 years had Kyman 
hopscotching among two colleges and six high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyman was hired as a teacher at Littlerock in 1991 and this year became the 
baseball coach, his first head coaching job since 1987 and eighth of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is new here," he says contentedly. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a new home in Palmdale, a new team sporting a 5-2 record, and a new 
wife, Sandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first date, we went to Saugus Speedway, and we've been racing around ever 
since," Kyman says with a wry grin. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be poetic to say Kyman never looked back, but he does, returning each 
year to teach summer school at Chaminade, where he was athletic director from 
1980-87. 
</P>
<P>
 It gives him a chance to visit his numerous friends in the Valley, 
reconnecting the dots of his nomadic career. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyman attended L.A. High, Santa Monica City College and San Fernando Valley 
State (now Cal State Northridge), playing football and baseball at every stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortstop at San Fernando Valley State was Bob Hiegert, now the Northridge 
athletic director, and the third baseman was Tony Davila, now women's tennis 
coach at Northridge. Kyman played first base. 
</P>
<P>
 On the football team, Kyman played center and linebacker. Joel Schaeffer, the 
Reseda High football coach of 16 years, played guard and linebacker. Gary 
Torgeson, Northridge softball coach, played tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyman's first coaching job came in 1965 at Murphy High, and in 1972 he left, 
beginning a journey that would take him to L.A. High, St. Bonaventure High, 
Pierce College, Moorpark High, Alemany High, Pierce (again), Chaminade, Cal 
Lutheran and Chaminade (again) before Littlerock. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an assistant football coach at Littlerock under Bauer, who in his first 
year of coaching in 1972 assisted Kyman at St. Bonaventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1955, I've either played or coached football and baseball somewhere," 
Kyman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyman also served as an athletic director in 19 of those years. It was 
fulfilling, if unspectacular work, and allowed Kyman lots of time with Patricia 
and their children: daughters Cassi and Jodi, and twin sons Bobby and Coley. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids were grown and three still lived at home the night their mother 
lapsed into a coma. Coley, a Cal State Northridge football and volleyball 
player at the time, lived on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so hard for all of us," Coley says. "My mom was wonderful. She went to 
every game my dad ever coached. She'd drive us all. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved to laugh, loved to be around friends. She was that type of person." 
</P>
<P>
 The following summer was a long one for Bernie. He returned to Chaminade as 
football assistant in the fall, but began actively seeking a place to start 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Renewed vigor came in 1991 in two forms. He started teaching at Littlerock and 
he met Sandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My stepmom is a wonderful lady," Coley says. "After the heartaches dad has 
been through, it makes me extremely happy to see him happy. They've got the 
Jacuzzi and big screen TV. They are laid-back." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyman didn't leave it all behind. Cassi and Jodi have moved to Palmdale, 
although both work in the San Fernando Valley. Bernie and Sandy, who has three 
grown children, have turned one room into a shrine to their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a sports room full of pictures and awards from all those years," 
says Coley, an All-American volleyball player and starting quarterback at 
Northridge. He and Bobby were standout football players at Reseda High, where 
they played for Schaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie would like to add another championship trophy of his own to the 
collection. At an age when many colleagues are easing back on coaching, he 
looks forward to hitting the field every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love coaching, I love being with the kids," he says. "It keeps me young. 
The way I see it, I've never worked a day in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will probably die coaching. I may not die teaching, but I will die 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyman stands in the heat on the Littlerock track and slowly rubs his bald 
head. He is teaching a midday physical education class and he gazes past 
students plodding halfheartedly around the track, past the desolate brush and 
gnarled yucca trees, to the snow-dotted San Gabriel Mountains seemingly within 
arm's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the wind on some days, this place would be unbelievably 
perfect," he says.

AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: HE'S GOT THE RIGHT MAN FOR MR. RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a story as old as boy meets boy. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as every love story should, it will have a happy ending. In mid-May, Dr. 
Stephen Gabin, 46, and Mike Trost, 32, will exchange vows before 200 guests at 
their Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrants will include C. David Kulman, who introduced the pair three years 
ago. Kulman, who bills himself as "David the Match mater ," is in his 20th year 
as a latter-day Dolly Levi for men looking for Mr. Right. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabin -- who is medical director of the AIDS unit at Century City Hospital -- 
says he finally went to Kulman because "it's difficult to meet quality people," 
gay or straight. He liked Kulman's personal, low-tech approach and figured that 
anyone with the matchmater's fee -- $750 a year -- probably had a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Trost, a construction coordinator, was seeking a good, stable family life. "I 
never saw myself going out with someone who was 14 years older. But David told 
me to be open." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kulman claims about one-third of his introductions lead to matchups, he 
is like the cobbler's barefoot children: He lives and works alone in a 
cluttered West Hollywood apartment -- with his cats, Cornelius and Samantha -- 
and hasn't had a true love in, oh, 35 years. And he likes it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulman, who puts his age somewhere in the 60s, calls himself a matchmater to 
emphasize that his isn't just a dating service. "I get the people who aren't 
into the bars and baths." 
</P>
<P>
 He started his boy-meets-boy business in 1974 in San Francisco, where he was a 
civil servant. His credentials? Well, he'd been a secretary in his native New 
York, a designer of "stupid, cheap things" in L.A.'s garment district and an 
Army sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was good but, homesick for a real Jewish deli, he returned to L.A. in 
1982 to hang out his shingle. The number of names in his files is between him 
and the IRS. "It's a good living," he says, "not a great living." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's been a great education. What are men looking for in this me-first 
town? 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is money. No. 2 is youth. No. 3 is good looks. 
Personality and intelligence are at the bottom of the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Few clients will date a smoker. And men rarely make passes at the grossly 
overweight. "If they're a dog," he says, "they get a dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Kulman tries to match by age and income. "I don't want one buying dinner and 
having the other one leave the tip." Older men may like young men for sex, but 
"for a companion you want someone who knows who Betty Grable was." 
</P>
<P>
 On his file cards he jots notes such as "No redheads." "Doesn't like bald." 
"No toupees." 
</P>
<P>
 Kulman doesn't take transsexuals or men into S and M. "I don't know enough 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are TV producers, priests, doctors, lawyers, accountants. The latter are 
problematic, as they "go out to dinner and split the tax down the middle. 
Nobody wants an accountant." 
</P>
<P>
 But "everybody likes architects. They're creative, they're sensitive. . . . 
And most of them do well." 
</P>
<P>
 He has few actors. If they're famous, they're in the closet. If they aren't, 
they can't afford his fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-collar men are a rarity -- "There aren't too many gays in plumbing." Men 
who are married, with children, are not. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kulman's clients, the road to romance begins with a one-to-one two-hour 
interview. He asks about a client's sex habits, whether he's been tested for 
AIDS, and suggests testing for everyone but does not require proof, reasoning 
that a doctor's statement is easily forged. "I've never had a problem yet," he 
says. A few HIV-negative clients are willing to be matched with HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 He also takes snapshots, but they are for his eyes (and files) only. The fee 
-- Visa, MasterCard or cash, please -- is collected before names are handed 
over. Date-making is up to the client. 
</P>
<P>
 It is late afternoon, when clients call the matchmater with date feedback. A 
40ish pediatrician is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, doctor," Kulman says. "Who did you meet?" He scans the other man's 
card for comments. "I was told you are very quiet. You've got to be more 
bombastic." 
</P>
<P>
 No match. "Let's go to someone else. Did Barry call you, or Tom? Tom looks 
just like John Kennedy Jr." 
</P>
<P>
 The matchmater's apartment grows dark; classical music plays softly. Kulman 
walks about, taking mental inventory of his paintings and bronzes of men. He 
picks up a ceramic frog. "I'm going to start collecting frogs," he says. "Then 
I can tell them, 'I can get you a prince . . .' " A Bridal Registry for an 
Inveterate Single 
</P>
<P>
 It's spring, and from Beverly Hills to Madison Avenue, we are confronted by 
that 20th-Century grab: the bridal registry. 
</P>
<P>
 As one who refuses on principle to buy from some sanctioned wish list, I say 
hooray for Henry Alford. 
</P>
<P>
 We caught up with satirist Alford, a New Yorker who makes a career of getting 
himself into silly situations so he can write about them, on National Public 
Radio. He was plugging his book, "Municipal Bondage: One Man's 
Anxiety-Producing Adventures in the Big City." 
</P>
<P>
 Alford, who claims his social life consists of "dancing with a mop" in his 
living room, considers it "the curse of the single person to be a perpetual 
witness to the splendors and privileges of matrimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Most "galling" of these is institutionalized gift-giving. Why, he asks, should 
his married friends have each other " and a drawerful of sterling asparagus 
prongs"? 
</P>
<P>
 So, Alford signed up with a quartet of bridal registries, though marriage was 
not on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Registering at Bergdorf's, Alford asked for a $950 Staffordshire St. Bernard 
and a $3,000 Victorian coal scuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at Bloomingdale's, he signed up for a bag of potato chips. The clerk 
blanched. Alford had triumphed.

PEOPLE; HOW POETIC -- A BUKOWSKI WAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For someone who liked to flout the bounds of literary acceptability, Charles 
Bukowski still has more than a few fans among L.A.'s literati. 
</P>
<P>
 The departed godfather of L.A. poetry has been cordially invited to attend, in 
spirit, an "all-star poetry wake" in his honor on Saturday evening.(Witness the 
mannequin with Bukowski's craggy face.) 
</P>
<P>
 The wake at Arundel Antiquarian Books, 8380 Beverly Blvd., will feature 
readings written and inspired by L.A.'s Meat School master. Signing on are 
Bukowski biographer Neeli Cherkovski; John Harris, owner of the erstwhile Papa 
Bach bookstore; beat poet John Thomas; L.A. Free Press contributor Michael C 
Ford; poet Harry Northup; a fellow U.S. Postal Worker from Bukowski's federal 
days, among others. The evening will be hosted by Liza Richardson of public

 "He was very much a Southern California presence," says poet and wake 
organizer Laurel Ann Bogen. "He was a champion of the underdog. He approached 
life with grace and honesty and a kind of truth that found honor in the attempt 
to live in the world, as opposed to just achieve in it. . . . The city is going 
to be a much darker place without him.

 "I never met him, but I've heard him read two or three times -- the last time 
at the Troubadour in West Hollywood about 1976. He came up with a six-pack of 
beer and he read until the six-pack was gone and then he left." 
</P>
<P>
 The poetry wake, featuring 20 readers, runs from 8 p.m. to midnight. It's free 
and open to the public. IRENE LACHER

ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: ANNUAL DOHENY AWARD BENEFIT HUMS TO THE TUNE OF 
$200,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of New York cabaret star Bobby Short let him know "You're the Top" the 
other evening to make the third annual Doheny Award Benefit at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire a huge success -- 400 guests for a $200,000 net. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Short's legendary rendition of Cole Porter lyrics (he's in his 27th 
year at Cafe Carlyle), the affair was music to the ears of co-chairmen Joni 
Smith and Ed Landry. The evening also soothed nerves: Landry is still digging 
out from the Northridge disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Doheny Award went to Dr. Stephen J. Ryan Jr. in recognition of his 
"significant preeminence" in the field of ophthalmology. In addition, it 
commemorated his 20th anniversary at the Doheny Eye Institute. (He's also dean 
of the USC School of Medicine.) 
</P>
<P>
 Humming along were Clark Smith, Ginie and Henry Braun, Gordon Crary, George 
and Mary Lou Boone and a raft of Dohenys -- Patrick and Patricia Doheny and 
William Doheny. 
</P>
<P>
 Photo Finish: It all was larger than life -- "Photo Finish," the Pasadena 
Junior League's Center Stage benefit. How often, mixed in with the lastest of 
fashion, will you see Rollerblading on the ramps, winningest canine Frisbee 
champ Joe, bodybuilders pumpin' iron and whiz dancers strutting their stuff in 
summer swimwear? 
</P>
<P>
 It all sort of crazed the fans -- 500 (many mother/daughter combos) Saturday 
noon, 450 (members and escorts) Saturday evening and another 500 (mostly kids 
and parents) for brunch on Sunday. Hard-working chairman Dina Morgan was 
thrilled with the popular event, and president Kit Shenk got three good 
opportunities to note that the league has raised $1.1 million for community 
work over the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaguers originally considered staging the event at Santa Anita. Though it was 
held at the Huntington Hotel, it had all the earmarks of Santa Anita -- racing 
programs for the silent auction and a paddock ambience for the show. Greeting, 
selling, pointing, laughing was a happy committee including Teri Ward, Penny 
Burkard, Amy Lamb, Michelle Worthington and Lynn Swank plus advisers Susan 
Chandler, Christina Varner and Phyllis Wilburn and provisionals such as Valerie 
Bauman and Catherine Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 As the announcer pointed out, "Volunteerism is always in fashion." Shenk 
noted, "This is not an ordinary fund-raiser; our goal is to reward you for your 
support." Nice race. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Madrinas: It was a good year for Las Madrinas. The stellar Childrens 
Hospital group raised $573,710.86, primarily through its debutante ball at 
Christmas.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Mary O'Connell passes the gavel to new president, Peggy Galbraith of San 
Marino. On the new slate, too, will be Barbara Fountain, Daisy Spurgin, Cheryl 
Ziegler, Clare Webb, Kay Onderdonk, Susan Hull, Mary Luck, Maria Grant, Tally 
Mingst and Mary O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaudits: Arpad and Katalin Domyan (both former Hungarian Olympians -- she 
swimming, he water polo) are back from Washington, where they, along with 
others including Judith Leiber, Adrienne Vittadini and Edward Teller, were 
honorees at the American Council of the World Federation of Hungarians Gala 
benefiting Balkan refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearin' o' the Green: Shannon Tarnutzer and Mary Bryant co-chaired a 
deliciously fun St. Patrick's Day luncheon at the Bistro Garden for The 
Luminaires Juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, members are in multiples of Christmas red. Enjoying a switch to 
spring and much green were Juniors president Katie Finnegan Darnell, Liz 
Bishop, Victoria Rogers, Laurie Hartigan, Karen Dalby, Marlene Brackovich, 
Diane Avery and Angela Doheny, who was selling her personalized stationery at a 
brisk pace for the Doheny Eye Institute.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently the Juniors broke previous records on a "Sunset Blvd." benefit 
premiere. Among those raising a glass over the spring tulips to that success 
were Ginny Shelton, Sally Green, Jan Karl and Diane Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hats off: To Gerald and Virginia Oppenheimer, honored by Jules Stein Eye 
Institute Affiliates at a Westwood Marquis St. Patrick's Day luncheon . . . To 
Shirley Jones, feted at the USC Town & Gown's Helga fashion show chaired by 
Bernice Christenson and Yvonne Bogdanovich . . . To Frank "Cowboy" Bogert and 
his wife, Negie, honorary chairs of Palm Springs' dressy Western Americana Ball 
. . . To Jane and Steve Ackerman, hosts at a buffet book-signing for artist 
Jane Wooster Scott . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Crown City: Pasadena Beautiful Foundation's pride glistened at its awards 
dinner at the Ritz-Carlton, Huntington. The concept -- "A city is not going to 
be any more beautiful than it wants to be" -- was voiced as awards went to the 
new Colorado Street Bridge restoration, to Pasadena City College's new Shatford 
Library, to Polytechnic and New Horizon schools and to One Colorado Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining foundation president Richard Nevins in applause were Lawrence Wilson, 
Jean and Boyd Higgins, Nancy Holliday, Alice Frost Kennedy and Robin Spear. Ann 
Gay Hovey chaired the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Cityscape: Portraits of English children of the 18th Century fascinated a 
sophisticated Huntington Library Joint Seminar Committee headed by chairman 
Peggy Galbraith. Super attentive to the views of British and continental art 
curator Shelley Bennett were new committee chairwoman Eileen Read, Robin 
Barker, June Banta, Catharine Alexander and Gail Ellis . . . More than 700 
attended Loyola Marymount University's groundbreaking for the Conrad N. Hilton 
Center for Business on the Westchester campus.

PRACTICAL VIEW: QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE YOU LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE WALKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buying or leasing a car is a decision best made for individual circumstances. 
What is a great deal for a neighbor could be a mistake for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some questions the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Reports 
magazine and CNW Marketing Research, an Oregon automotive research firm, 
suggest you ask to determine whether to buy or lease: 
</P>
<P>
 * How much do you drive? Leases are not the right choice for people who put 
many miles on their cars, unless the driving can be written off as a business 
expense. Most contracts allow 12,000 to 15,000 miles per year before assessing 
an excess mileage charge, usually 10 cents a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 * How much do you have for a down payment? If you have a lot of cash, buying 
is probably cheaper in the long run. But a lease might make sense if you don't 
have much money up front, you want to spend your cash on other things or you 
believe your money could be used more profitably if invested elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you take care of your car? If you don't take meticulous care of your 
car, you shouldn't lease. Charges for excessive wear and tear can be 
substantial and negate any benefit of a lease. 
</P>
<P>
 * What kind of car do you want? Lease deals are better with mid- to 
upper-priced cars and those that hold their value better. 
</P>
<P>
 * How long do you want to keep the car? If you like to drive your car until it 
dies in your driveway, you are better off buying it. If you are cruising the 
showrooms every two or three years for the latest model, leasing may be the way 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you have good credit? Because there is little or no down payment required 
with a lease, consumers face higher standards of credit when leasing than when 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are you prepared to stick with the lease for its entire term? You will pay 
dearly for breaking a lease contract. CONSTANCE WALKER

O.C. DEPUTY FELT 'COCKY' DURING FATAL EXERCISE; INVESTIGATION: D.A. RELEASES 
OFFICER'S NARRATIVE OF EVENTS SURROUNDING HIS SHOOTING OF COLLEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Brian P. Scanlan knew he had to work on keeping his finger off the trigger of 
his service weapon. He'd learned that a few months earlier at the so-called 
"laser village" at the Sheriff's Department's training academy, where he'd 
mistakenly shot two people in video exercises -- "two people that didn't need 
to go," he remembered later. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Orange County sheriff's deputy acknowledged in an interview 
released Wednesday that he was feeling "cocky" as he prepared to run through a 
car-stop exercise behind a Lake Forest movie theater on a quiet Christmas Day 
that would end in one of the most controversial police shootings in Orange 
County history. 
</P>
<P>
 He and fellow Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins were developing ways to counteract 
new techniques that Los Angeles gang members had been using to get the drop on 
cops. Scanlan -- a sheriff's field training officer -- figured that if the 
gang-bangers were up to new tricks, "I want to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, playing the role of a suspect in a car stop, was going to show him 
something new. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, the nine-year veteran approached Robins' car with his loaded 
9-millimeter handgun drawn. Robins started talking back to him, demanding to 
know why he was stopped. Robins' hands were jittery, "going all over the 
place," as he handed over a white piece of paper marked "CDL," meant to 
represent a driver's license, Scanlan recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, supposedly responding to a request for his vehicle registration papers, 
Robins reached up behind the driver's side sun visor and produced an unloaded 
.25-caliber handgun, thrusting it out the window, Scanlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Startled, Scanlan "jerked back," he said, and fired a single Talon bullet into 
his colleague's face. Half an hour later, Robins was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan's gripping yet strikingly unemotional narrative of what took place 
behind the Lake Forest movie theater forms the keystone of two months' worth of 
interviews, forensic reports, videotapes, photographs and other evidence 
released to the media Wednesday by the district attorney's office. The release 
came a week after the Orange County Grand Jury decided to disregard 
prosecutors' recommendations and not indict Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 The volatile shooting case has garnered considerable media attention, fueled 
in part by charges from black and Latino groups that the case was not handled 
properly by authorities because the dead deputy was black and the one who shot 
him was white. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite heightened racial sensitivities, many details of the case remained 
the subject of speculation and off-the-record sources -- until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said prosecutors took the unusual step of 
releasing almost everything in their investigative files in hopes of dispelling 
lingering suspicions that the shooting may not have been accidental -- or that 
Robins' race was somehow a factor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors refused, however, to allow copying or television broadcasting of 
any of the key videotapes in the case. And even as they allowed reporters to 
view the tapes in a crowded Santa Ana office, they edited out certain key 
scenes -- such as that showing Robins' fellow deputies frantically carrying him 
from a patrol car into the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided it was kind of shocking and we didn't want the family to be upset 
by showing it to people," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the newly released evidence provides for the first time a 
detailed chronology of the day's events. And it is Scanlan's 90-minute account, 
given to investigators just hours after the shooting, that authorities say has 
become the most authoritative version. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than 40 interviews done after the shooting, "nobody's contradicted 
anything" that Scanlan related, Conley said. "All the other little details 
fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some six hours after the shooting, Scanlan agreed to speak about the incident 
with investigators from the district attorney's office and the Sheriff's 
Department. He wore light blue doctor's garb, given to him at the hospital 
after his blood-stained uniform was seized as evidence, and he spoke in calm, 
flat tones with the investigators for 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you have a seat right here," district attorney's Investigator Mike 
Major said to Scanlan at the outset. "Long as there's no spotlight," Scanlan 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed little agitation as investigators pressed for details on the 
shooting, and his voice broke with emotion only twice: once as he described 
struggling to get the bleeding Robins into a patrol car and en route to the 
hospital; and again when he recounted having to tell his newlywed wife that he 
was in fact the shooter. His wife, who also works at the Sheriff's Department, 
had heard in the immediate aftermath of the incident that Robins had shot 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to be the one to tell her what had happened," said Scanlan, near tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The day began quietly at the Sheriff's Department, and the deputies who cover 
Lake Forest were counting on a slow shift, interviews showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet from the beginning, there was the reminder of potential violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Hendry, a deputy who had been on patrol for one week and was riding with 
Scanlan to learn the beat, read aloud an FBI report at the morning briefing. 
The grim subject: "how many officers have been killed," he told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning went as slowly as expected. But just after 1 p.m., Scanlan and 
Robins -- along with Hendry and Adam Powell, who was riding with Robins -- went 
to assist in a chase of four car-theft suspects who were speeding up the San 
Diego Freeway near Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The four were stopped and arrested near the Irvine Center Drive exit, and 
California Highway Patrol officers -- who handled the chase -- have said in 
interviews that there was nothing unusual about the stop. Everything, they 
said, went according to the book. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sheriff's deputies backing them up were clearly bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hendry waited at a distance with a shotgun trained on the car, he watched 
as a CHP officer -- without his weapon drawn -- approached the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan was seething. "What the hell are you doing?" Hendry remembered him 
shouting at the CHP officers. "This guy's gonna get killed," Scanlan remarked. 
</P>
<P>
 Unnerved by what he considered a breach of safety procedures, Scanlan 
organized an impromptu training session at a Kmart parking lot on El Toro Road 
in Lake Forest. He wanted Robins and Powell to help, so he called them on the 
police radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them to meet me at the Kmart parking lot, that we were going to do a 
scenario on a felony car stop, so I can show my partner," Scanlan told 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The session -- videotaped from the patrol car camera beginning at 1:37 p.m. 
and played Wednesday -- went smoothly, as the veteran deputies demonstrated how 
to pull over suspected felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan played the cop, Robins the suspected felon. It was a typical role for 
Robins, Hendry said. He "always liked to be a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 No guns were pointed -- just Scanlan's finger. 
</P>
<P>
 The air was relaxed for the session, and one of the closing scenes on the 
training tape shows Robins waving into Scanlan's patrol vehicle and laughing 
before walking out of view. 
</P>
<P>
 A few moments later, Robins got a call about a possible burglary at 
Fuddrucker's Restaurant, just down the street from Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
 Backing up Robins, Scanlan and Hendry went into the building with guns drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian (Scanlan) specifically told me, 'Keep your finger on the trigger 
guard,' " Hendry recounted. It turned out to be a false alarm, but the point 
was made, Hendry said. "He always stressed safety in everything we did," Hendry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, investigators said, the events of the next few minutes proved 
all the more perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins wanted to run through a training scenario of his own. This one, 
investigators said, would center on potential threats from Los Angeles gang 
members wandering south into Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show you something I learned in L.A.," Hendry remembered Robins 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The four deputies -- Robins, Scanlan, Hendry and Powell -- would use the plaza 
parking lot near Fuddrucker's as their training ground. Robins drove around the 
entire lot first to make sure it was clear of people, Hendry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Robins told his colleagues, "I don't want anybody watching, so I can get 
everybody's reaction separately," Hendry said. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked Scanlan to run through the drill first while the other two deputies 
waited in an alley area behind the movie theater at the plaza. "Okay Brian, 
you're going to be first. Just pretend I just ran a stop sign and you're 
chasing me," Hendry recalled Robins saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, the two deputies sped off in their patrol cars, Scanlan tailing 
Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 The only witness to what happened next, authorities say, was Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan assumed, he said later, that Robins would likely try to pull a gun on 
him during the scenario. That much was clear from the way that Robins had set 
up the whole exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said something . . . (about) how cops are getting killed, how they're 
doing cops in L.A. Something along those lines. So yeah, I knew that there was 
going to be a weapon involved," Scanlan said. "At least I had that premise, 
like you know, he was going to come after me in some fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, Scanlan said, he began the drill on guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he was feeling when he walked up to the car that he had supposedly 
just pulled over, Scanlan said: "Cocky. Like I wanted to, I wanted to, I don't 
know, I'm not going to say outdraw him or something along those lines. But 
cocky. I mean, confident. Like you know, 'Okay, if this is what's going (on) in 
L.A., then I want to know. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the FTO" -- the field training officer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan said a fellow deputy had just given him a new magazine for his 
semiautomatic handgun a few days before, and his weapon was loaded as he walked 
toward Robins' car. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department policy bans the use of a loaded gun during training 
sessions. But when asked by investigators if he felt comfortable using a loaded 
gun in a training session, Scanlan said simply: "It felt OK." 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked why he didn't unload his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had an answer for that, Darryn would (be) alive," he said. "I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan said he never really felt threatened by Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt real comfortable with the fact that I know Darryn's not gonna do 
anything to hurt me. I felt real comfortable with that," he said. "I know he's 
done these scenarios before, with other deputies. . . . My intention wasn't to 
do anything but just be prepared. Not to fire a round. Not to do anything but 
just show my position with my weapon. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 As Robins fumbled for his driver's license, the 6-foot-6 Scanlan stood over 
him with his handgun resting on the roof of the car, out of Robins' sight. 
Suddenly, Robins whipped from behind the visor a small handgun and thrust it 
out the window at him, Scanlan said. He knew Robins carried a second gun, but 
he said the sight was still jarring. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came out the window, I jerked back," he said, "It just scared me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened so fast," Scanlan said. "It's a moment that will live for the 
rest of my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the wounded Robins crawled toward the passenger door, "I couldn't believe 
what I was seeing. I couldn't believe that this had actually happened. I said, 
'Darryn, are you OK?' He went, 'No.' Then he looked at me and I grabbed him. 
And he said: "Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, Scanlan said, he put out an emergency dispatch over the police radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few dozen yards away, the call startled Hendry and Powell as they 
waited behind the theater for their turns to run through the training exercise. 
Hendry thought he had heard a "pop" a few seconds before, but it wasn't until 
he heard Scanlan's voice on the police dispatch on a "10-33" emergency call, 
yelling "Get me help here now!" that they knew something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two sped around the corner to find out what had happened, Powell said 
all he could see was what looked like two people fighting on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Brian at first," he said. "I thought (it) was involving some type of 
wrestling match. . . . He was involved with some type of physical altercation 
with someone trying to getting (sic) him into the back of the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he saw Robins, blood "spurting out" of his mouth as he struggled to take 
a breath. "Brian was saying, 'He's been shot, pull him in.' He was having 
trouble getting him into the back of the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Hendry said: "I immediately started looking around for suspects." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he saw Scanlan's gun on the ground outside the passenger door and picked 
it up, uncocking it and setting it down on the front seat of Robins' patrol 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 The next moments were a blur for each of the deputies, but two patrol videos 
show Scanlan racing through three stop signs on the short ride to Saddleback 
Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the deputies were unable to get Robins' rigid legs into the car as he 
lay bleeding across the back seat, they left the back door open, with Robins' 
feet sticking out, as Hendry knelt precariously in the front passenger seat and 
held the back door open. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, they made it to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 While portions of the arrival scene at the hospital were excised from the 
tapes shown Wednesday, one of the most poignant scenes comes from behind the 
closed doors of the hospital, as a medical crew takes Robins from the deputies 
and prepares to bring him into the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, buddy, come on, come on, come on!" Scanlan is heard shouting, the 
frantic sounds of hospital workers and deputies in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're my buddy, man. Come on, Darryn!" 
</P>
<P>
 Hendry said he and Scanlan then joined hands. "We prayed for Darryn, hoping 
he'd make it," Hendry recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half an hour later, Robins was pronounced dead. The Shooting: 'It 
Happened So Fast' 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Brian P. Scanlan's account of what happened when an impromptu 
training session ended in the Christmas Day shooting of Deputy Darryn Robins: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Scanlan, playing the role of a police officer, removes his loaded 
9-millimeter automatic pistol from his holster and holds it just above the roof 
of Robins' patrol car, out of the view of Robins, who is playing the role of a 
suspect stopped by police. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Robins reaches up behind the driver's side sun visor, as if to retrieve the 
registration papers Scanlan had asked for, but instead produces an unloaded 
.25-caliber automatic pistol he had placed there, and thrusts it in Scanlan's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Startled by the unexpected weapon, Scanlan steps back and his pistol 
discharges. Bullet hits Robins in the face, and severs his carotid artery, a 
wound which proves to be fatal.

$3.75-BILLION SETTLEMENT OKD IN IMPLANT SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and DAVID OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three major U.S. corporations Wednesday signed a record-breaking $3.75-billion 
settlement with lawyers representing thousands of women who contend they were 
seriously injured by silicone gel breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Corning Corp., Baxter International Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. 
agreed to fund the largest settlement of a product liability case in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other companies have tentatively agreed to put in about another $170 
million, bringing the settlement pot to almost $4 billion. It is possible that 
the deal could be enriched by another $750 million if 3M, Union Carbide Corp. 
and General Electric Co. join in. Negotiations with those companies are 
continuing, the plaintiffs' lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he maintained that Dow has a strong defense to the thousands of 
lawsuits against it, Gary E. Anderson, executive vice president, said "a 
settlement is in the best interest of all parties involved." Baxter and Bristol 
representatives confirmed that a settlement had been concluded but did not 
issue statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The implants have become a litigation nightmare for the companies. About 
12,000 women have filed suits around the country, including about 400 from 
Orange County, contending that they are suffering from a variety of medical 
problems stemming from their implants. Dow and the other firms are spending 
millions each month to defend the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 million women received implants between 1962 and 1992, when the 
Federal Food and Drug Administration restricted their use. Many of the suits 
maintain that silicone leaked out of the implant pouch and migrated throughout 
women's bodies, causing autoimmune diseases including scleroderma, arthritis, 
lupus, atypical neurological disease syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease 
and atypical rheumatic syndrome. About a dozen cases have been tried so far. 
The plaintiffs have won most of them, including several multimillion-dollar 
verdicts, but most are being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's deal still could fall apart. The companies could back out if a 
large number of women reject the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, San Francisco lawyer Elizabeth J. Cabraser, one of the plaintiffs' 
negotiators, expects many women to take part in the settlement. She said it 
offers them an opportunity to receive substantial compensation -- from $160,000 
to $1.6 million, depending on their ages and severity of their injuries -- 
without having to wage lengthy court battles. Those amounts could be increased 
to a range of $200,000 to $2 million if more companies join the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a uniquely beneficial settlement for women," Cabraser said. "For 
the first time in a mass tort settlement, women will be entitled to know the 
benefits they will receive, and they will not be obligated to participate if 
the settlement cannot deliver those benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key elements of the settlement is that women will not be required 
to prove that there is a causal relationship between having an implant and the 
numerous diseases that women contend they got because of their implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, women will simply be required to prove that they had an implant put in 
and have a board-certified doctor substantiate that they have one of the 
medical problems covered by the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is critical because it means women won't have to go through a 
complicated medical arbitration proceeding," said Michael Gallagher, a Houston 
attorney who also was on the plaintiffs' negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is to be funded over 30 years. It also includes money for 
implant removal and medical monitoring. Women who are not sick now but later 
develop diseases that are covered by the agreement could get compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's announcement, culminating more than 18 months of negotiations, 
sets in motion a process whereby women around the country will be notified in 
newspaper and broadcast ads and by mail of the pending settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The notices are expected to go out starting April 4, subject to approval by 
U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. of Birmingham, Ala., who is presiding 
over several thousand implant suits that have been consolidated there. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a court-approved, toll-free, 24-hour phone line, (800) 887-6828, 
was set up so women can call and request information about the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer also has to decide how much time women will have to make an initial 
decision about whether to participate in the settlement or to pursue solo 
lawsuits. Lawyers for the plaintiffs and the companies said they expect it will 
be about 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sybil N. Goldrich of Beverly Hills, co-founder of the Command Trust 
Network, a national information clearinghouse for women with implants, said she 
thought 60 days is not enough time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Judge Pointer will allow women at least 90 days," she said. "This is a 
complicated settlement, and a woman may need to consult with a lawyer or a 
counselor" to determine if the settlement makes sense for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Walsh, founding president of the Breast Implant Information Foundation, 
a support group based in Laguna Hills with about 600 members in Orange, Los 
Angeles and San Diego counties, said: "I don't think there should be a 
deadline, to be fair to all the women. A lot of women don't yet realize the 
medical complications they have may be related to their implants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is only going to be through support groups, the media and attorneys that 
these women will be able to glean enough information to make a decision," she 
said. "I was flabbergasted when I heard they were going to institute a 
deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said they expected Pointer to hold a hearing in August on the 
settlement's fairness. Although scores of plaintiffs' attorneys and lawyers for 
the companies will support the deal, Alan B. Morrison, director of Ralph 
Nader's Public Citizen Litigation Group, indicated Wednesday that he would 
challenge it.

INQUIRY UNCOVERS NO ILL WILL BETWEEN SCANLAN, ROBINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH and ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite concerns that race may have played a role in the accidental shooting 
death of a black sheriff's deputy by a white officer, documents released 
Wednesday show the Orange County district attorney's office turned up no 
evidence to indicate animosity between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 While the records detail how investigators concluded that Deputy Brian P. 
Scanlan showed "grossly negligent behavior" during the incident, they offer no 
clear explanation of why criminal charges were not brought by a grand jury 
against him for shooting and killing deputy Darryn Leroy Robins in an impromptu 
training exercise Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, transcripts of the Orange County Grand Jury's proceedings remain 
secret, leaving critics with lingering doubts about the circumstances 
surrounding Robins' death. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more questions that are raised in my mind than answered," said 
Eugene Wheeler, who heads 100 Black Men of Orange County, a business and civic 
group. "We are still searching for answers, still searching for the truth and 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prosecutors saw something that caused them to believe they should prosecute," 
he said. "If (Scanlan) was negligent and it cost someone their life, there 
should be some action." 
</P>
<P>
 Voluminous reports compiled by the district attorney -- including dozens of 
interviews, lab findings, crime scene analyses and an autopsy report -- appear 
to corroborate Scanlan's recollection of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, prosecutors investigating the shooting were forced to 
rely heavily on Scanlan, the only person to witness firsthand one of the most 
bizarre incidents in the history of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
Robins, the only other person who knew what happened in a deserted parking lot 
behind a Lake Forest movie theater, was pronounced dead shortly after he was 
shot in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics also remain skeptical, however, that Dist. Atty. Michael R. 
Capizzi's office could complete an independent review of the case because of 
the close relationship between his office and the Sheriff's Department. They 
still question how aggressively investigators pursued an indictment against 
Scanlan and wonder how a routine training session could go so terribly awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, the training officer in the exercise, was black. Scanlan, who played 
the role of an officer who had stopped a car, is white. 
</P>
<P>
 "A separate body should have handled it," said Pastor Van Roberson, president 
of the Baptist Minster Fellowship Conference of Orange County. He has helped 
form a coalition of black leaders to press for more information about the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something still is not right about all this. It's heartbreaking to know that 
a deputy dies at the hands of another officer and nothing is being done," 
Roberson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. John D. Conley said he is well aware of such criticism, 
but believes it is misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "This investigation is as thorough as we can make it," he said, adding that 
Wheeler, who was interviewed by authorities as part of the probe, could not 
point to evidence that race was a factor in the shooting or the subsequent 
investigation. Another anonymous tip that the shooting was intentional also 
could not be proved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own speculation is that there are people out there who will say 'this is 
white, racist, John Birch Society Orange County, and it must be racist,' " 
Conley said. "That is unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many deputies who worked closely with Scanlan and Robins say the two 
were close friends, according to interviews with sheriff's deputies released 
Wednesday. They believe the shooting was an accident that will forever haunt 
Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one female deputy who trained with Scanlan said she heard him 
make "ethnic comments and innuendos in her presence," a report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Trisha Davis said Robins once warned her to stay away from "cowboys" 
like Scanlan because "they'll either get you hurt or in trouble," according to 
her statements to authorities. Davis said, however, that she did not believe 
race was a factor in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators interviewed 45 people, including Scanlan and 37 other sheriff's 
deputies, as well as seven civilian witnesses. Their reports, which stretched 
hundreds of pages, included forensic tests, blood tests, autopsy results, a 
ballistics analysis and numerous other tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for investigators, the case was clearly a difficult one, given the lack of 
eyewitnesses. Arriving at the site of the shooting, which shattered the calm of 
Christmas Day, they found a gruesome scene: the bloodied front seat of Robins' 
patrol car, speckled with bits of flesh and several of the critically wounded 
officer's teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 After combing the car, parking lot and the deputies' weapons for fingerprints 
and gunpowder residue, and examining the bullet's trajectory, investigators 
found themselves trying to reconstruct the mishap based largely on Scanlan's 
recollections. 
</P>
<P>
 Video cameras posted in patrol cars captured some of the day's events, but not 
the actual shooting. Investigators interviewed two deputies awaiting their 
turns at Robins' training session; they were at the scene, but were around a 
corner and did not actually witness the shooting. They questioned residents of 
the area who heard gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood tests turned up no evidence of drug use or alcohol use among the 
deputies on the day of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said the key to the case was Scanlan's own statements to police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a position that no one else saw the shooting but him, of course," 
Conley said. "But there was no evidence that contradicted him, no evidence that 
it was anything other than an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was serious enough, however, for prosecutors to ask the grand 
jury to return a manslaughter indictment against Scanlan for "aggravated, 
reckless and grossly negligent" behavior by training with a loaded weapon in 
clear violation of department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury, after reviewing much of the evidence, including 
Scanlan's videotaped interview, declined to return an indictment March 10. The 
rare rejection of a prosecutor's request for an indictment angered activists 
all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the investigation, Conley said, investigators aggressively pursued 
claims that race may have played a role in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins "was shot because he was black? These guys were friends!" Conley said. 
"Was this a deliberate shooting? No. Was (Scanlan) thinking 'Oh, good, I've got 
him alone now so I can kill him?' It's all such wild speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the investigation, Robins' widow has been supportive of Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear is both Robins and Scanlan were violating department policy at 
the time of the shooting: Scanlan, by training with a loaded weapon, and 
Robins, by using a so-called "backup" gun that apparently startled Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation revealed that Robins had in the past staged other unplanned 
training sessions, using his backup weapon or toy guns. 
</P>
<P>
 But other elements of the investigation still trouble critics. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the reports show that a registered nurse at Saddleback Memorial 
Medical Center, where Robins died, heard deputies at the scene talk about 
"taking care of the statement," a comment that the nurse considered unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan and the other two deputies at the scene also washed their hands before 
tests could be performed to detect gunshot residue, and one of the deputies 
handled Scanlan's gun after the shooting, but before investigators arrived, 
according to the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler and Roberson claim that correspondence from the district attorney's 
office during the investigation appears to accept Scanlan's version of the 
incident, a claim that Conley denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't say it enough, there's just something that's not right about 
this case," Roberson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't make sense," Wheeler said. "Something is missing."

SLAYING SHOCKS O.C. LATINOS; MEXICAN STABILITY IS CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 More than 30 Orange County Latino community leaders expressed shock and 
uncertainty Wednesday night after the fatal shooting of Mexican presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathered for a previously scheduled meeting at the Hispanic Bookcase, a 
bookstore and hair salon, the activists said they were shaken by the events. 
Word of Colosio's death came to the group by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to throw the whole political arena into chaos," said Arturo 
Montez, 44, president of the Santa Ana chapter of the League of United Latin 
American Citizens, or LULAC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope of democracy for Mexico should not be destroyed by one assassin's 
bullet," he said. The social change that he said needs to come in Chiapas and 
elsewhere "should come at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Garcia, 34, president of the Orange County chapter of Hermandad Mexicana, 
said, "I was shocked. I think it's unfortunate, but in a way it's kind of a 
sign of the instability in Mexico in addition to the Chiapas revolt." 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, 41, leadership program director of the Orange County chapter of 
MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said that 
while "assassination is not the way to address internal tension in the 
country," it might jolt the country into change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, in any country, when there's been a tragedy, the country has 
united," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Colosio's death, he said, "you may see the U.S. Congress give a 
greater effort to addressing the economic needs of Mexico to assure stability 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Osuna, 47, a health clerk for the Santa Ana school district, said she 
was in a restaurant when she first heard the news of the shooting, "and I felt 
sick about it. Our own people are killing our own people. . . . It seems like 
we've got this (violence) everywhere . . . over here, over there, and it seems 
unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 The group was meeting at the Latino Bookcase to launch an Orange County 
chapter of the Mexican American Political Assn., established to spur voter 
registration and citizenship applications.

O.C. WOMEN DOUBT PAYOFF IS FAIR DEAL; COMPENSATION: SOME SAY INDIVIDUALS MAY BE 
SHORTCHANGED IF MORE OF THEM OPT FOR GLOBAL SETTLEMENT FROM BREAST IMPLANT 
MANUFACTURERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marie Walsh, the Laguna Hills woman who organized a self-help network for 
breast implant patients, said she has no intention of accepting any part of the 
$3.75-billion settlement that manufacturers are offering women like her who say 
they have suffered injuries from silicone gel breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be opting out based on the gross damage I have suffered and the wanton 
lack of compassion and neglect on the part of the manufacturers of all the 
breast implants," Walsh said. "We haven't had one manufacturer yet come forward 
and say I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, who suffers a painful, arthritic-like condition she blames on silicone 
gel breast implants, said she will go forward with her own lawsuit even if she 
finds she is entitled to the maximum $1.6-million award that the settlement 
would offer an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would never compensate me for what I've been through," she said. "I have 
been on permanent disability since 1989." She said she is receiving 
chemotherapy to treat a problem with her immune system that threatens to 
destroy her heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said that since the breast implant settlement was anticipated a month 
ago, she has been receiving an average of 20 calls a day from women around the 
country asking for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she does not believe many women will obtain fair compensation from 
the settlement and thus she advises the majority in her own organization to go 
ahead with their own lawsuits. The exception, she said, would be women who 
cannot go to court because the statute of limitations has run out or those who 
worry that the manufacturer of their breast implants may be financially 
insolvent and therefore unable to pay the damages that a jury would award. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to give some guidance to women wondering whether to accept the 
settlement offer, Breast Implant Information Foundation, the organization that 
Walsh founded, is holding a meeting from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Friday at Western 
Digital in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Rossi Lopez, a lawyer representing Walsh and about 400 other women who 
have medical complaints they contend stem from silicone breast implants, said 
that at the meeting, he will try to outline the criteria that could make the 
global settlement more or less attractive to an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would recommend the settlement to women who do not have cases that 
would be compelling to a jury. This, he said, includes women who might have had 
other cosmetic surgeries that a jury would consider excessive or whose medical 
complaints may have been caused at least in part by some other physical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said that while previous drafts of the settlement specified ranges of 
awards that would be given to the women, depending on the severity of their 
ailments, the number of women who ultimately will join in the settlement is an 
unknown that could sharply affect payments to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday afternoon, Debbie Wilfert of Buena Park, who says she suffers 
muscle, nerve and joint pain from silicone gel implants, was typing a list of 
questions to ask her lawyer about the settlement. She said she found the last 
draft of the settlement "very confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfert said she is very skeptical that anyone will receive the maximum 
amounts written in the draft, because she believes the number of women opting 
for the settlement will swell. 
</P>
<P>
 "If many more file, we could get as little as $10,000 each," she said, "which 
would not even cover the cost of surgery to get the implants out." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbie Clark of Anaheim, a self-employed court reporter who says her career 
has been jeopardized by silicone that migrated from her breast implants into 
her wrists, said she distrusted the manufacturers' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly think they want to get this thing settled before research finds a 
lot more problems," she said. Although the global settlement agreement provides 
a fund for future claims, she questioned the feasibility for women who accept a 
settlement now to apply for more money if their disability worsens. The 
manufacturers "are already disputing what is related to silicone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the decision women must make within the next few months about 
whether to opt for the settlement is "very scary."

A TOWN FOR THE BIRDS (CRANES, TO BE SPECIFIC) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the swallows have come back to San Juan Capistrano, eh? Thousands of the 
dainty little creatures are making their annual pilgrimage to the old mission 
once more, are they? Well, put down that bucket of soapy water and stop hosing 
off your windshield for a few moments and read about some real birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Manly birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cranes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandhill cranes, to be specific. Big, monster birds. Eight feet tall. 
Sixty-five pounds each. Wingspans of 32 feet. Eat jack rabbits and young elk. 
Beaks powerful enough to snap barbed wire; drag down the fence posts, too. 
Drive the cattle right off the ranch. Birds so massive they can . . . 
</P>
<P>
 OK, sorry. Someone would probably check on things like that and write a letter 
and, well, all hell would break loose, so let's do that one over. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the cranes are about four feet tall. Weigh about 12 pounds each. 
Wingspans of six feet. Eat grass. 
</P>
<P>
 But the point here, I'm almost certain, is that if you're going to make a fuss 
about birds showing up someplace every year, why not pick a bird other than one 
from the Tweety category? Why not pick a bird you can at least see before it 
lands on you? A bird big enough that when it does you-know-what on your 
windshield you can hear a thud . 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the folks in this tiny southern Colorado town figured. More or 
less. For decades, gigantic flocks of cranes have used the Monte Vista Wildlife 
Refuge as a stopover on their spring and fall migration along the North 
American Flyway. Mostly sandhills. But mingled in are the nearly extinct 
whooping cranes -- stunning, five-foot-tall white birds with black trim. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, 11 years ago, the townsfolk, who spend nearly all their time either 
planting or digging up potatoes, came up with Crane Fest. Well, actually it was 
-- as odd as this might sound -- the Chamber of Commerce that devised the 
shameless selling of the idea to lure tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Crane Fest was born. And the townsfolk have just gone head over 
heels for the festival -- to some degree. They paint cranes on their storefront 
windows. They hold pancake breakfasts. They . . . did we mention that they 
paint cranes on their storefront windows? 
</P>
<P>
 They also run bus tours through the wildlife refuge. And during Crane Fest 
'94, which ended Sunday after an oh-so-brief four-day run, those buses were 
packed with visitors. Crane people. An estimated 5,000 crane people. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of people? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, old. 
</P>
<P>
 How old? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say that Crane Fest organizers likely have never had to throw 
anyone off a bus for smoking pot. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses, ranging from old school buses to really old school buses, cruise 
the refuge's dirt roads as the passengers crane their necks searching for some 
of the nearly 10,000 birds. 
</P>
<P>
 When not watching for cranes, most are rubbing their eyes and moaning in pain. 
That's a fairly common ramification of having a set of binoculars pressed 
firmly against the eye sockets when an old school bus drops into a three-foot 
pothole. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leading one tour during Crane Fest '94 was college student Jackie Smith, a 
young woman who knew very little about cranes and had never even been on the 
wildlife refuge before. You knew all this because of what she said as the tour 
began: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi. My name is Jackie Smith. I know very little about cranes and, actually, 
I've never even been on the refuge before." 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied that the tour director knew far less about the whole thing than they 
did, the crane people settled into their rock-hard bus seats. Quickly, they 
were rewarded for their suffering; just a hundred yards into the refuge, a huge 
school of cranes nibbled the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 School? Did we say school of cranes? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry again. Better let a professional handle this. 
</P>
<P>
 "There," shrieked Miss Smith. "There's a big herd of cranes in the field.' 
</P>
<P>
 Honest. She said herd . 
</P>
<P>
 The crane people started laughing and, for the next 90 minutes, several 
refused to let go. When Miss Smith mentioned that elk also live on the refuge, 
one man howled: "Oh, probably a whole flock of elk." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Smith, who volunteered her time to help out Crane Fest, smiled at the 
taunting. But it was apparent in her eyes that at least a small part of her 
brain was actively wondering what the penalty is in Colorado for slamming a 
school bus window shut on a 70-year-old man's head. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour continued. 
</P>
<P>
 And soon it became apparent that this was Crane Central. Mecca. At every turn, 
to the passengers' delight, hundreds of sandhill cranes appeared. Some fed on 
the wild grasses. Some stood still, acting as sentries against the coyotes and 
eagles and other predators that stalk them on the marshlands. Some mated. (The 
cranes, not the passengers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Amid one group of sandhills, a whooping crane stood, head held high, searching 
the mountain plateau for any sign of danger. (You'd likely do that, too, if 
there were only 16 humans left on Earth just a few decades ago. The whooping 
crane population now stands at about 200, still teetering on the edge of 
extinction.) 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the bus rolls again, leaving behind the lone whooper. But the sandhill 
show continued, the birds appearing at times in huge waves, a fact most 
certainly appreciated by festival organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine all the planning and advertising we do and the cranes don't 
show up?" asked a Chamber of Commerce rep. "There wouldn't be much to show 
these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, nonsense. There's always the town's potato-storage facility, with hundreds 
of thousands of potatoes piled inside a really big shed. As a matter of fact, 
tours of the spud shed were officially added to this year's fest. 
</P>
<P>
 Not today, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we'll come back next year and see if Jackie Smith can show us that big 
herd of potatoes. Rest Stop 
</P>
<P>
 Four-foot-tall sandhill cranes stop off in Monte Vista, Colo., during their 
spring and fall migrations.

A FOUNTAIN OF TROUBLE; HIGH HOPES FOR DR. JOHN ZANE'S INJECTIONS MADE HIM A 
HERO TO SOME IN PALM SPRINGS. NOW, HE FACES TRIAL ON VARIOUS CHARGES -- 
INCLUDING FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW HELLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. John Zane arrived in the desert around 1989 with credentials as an 
attorney and a physician -- and a treatment that sounds like something out of 
the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 He charged up to $1,500 per injection with a serum that would "cure everything 
from hangnails to cancer," a deputy state attorney general said in a court 
brief last year. Zane found dozens of customers from the Palm Springs area, 
many of them socially prominent, some of whom swear by the doctor and his 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 By last December, however, Zane had resigned from the California State Bar and 
his medical license had been revoked. An expert for the state wrote in a report 
to the Medical Board of California that Zane had engaged in "charlatanism" by 
peddling a serum that did little more than fuel a brief high. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board's investigation, in part, led law-enforcement authorities to 
charge Zane with two counts of fraud related to his claims about the shots. He 
is also charged with embezzling from three legal clients, with trial on all 
five felony counts scheduled for April 25. He has pleaded not guilty; if 
convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 David Kogus, one of Zane's lawyers, said last week his client had declined a 
written request for an interview with The Times. "He's coming up so close to 
trial he doesn't want a whole lot of publicity. I think that's wise," Kogus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Goldsmith, who investigated Zane for the state Medical Board, said the 
case points up how even in these supposedly wiser times elderly residents of 
affluent resort communities can be vulnerable to a skilled salesman promising a 
Fountain of Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's most unique is he was able to convince so many people that this stuff 
was going to cure so many different things," Goldsmith said in an interview. 
"And then they paid so much money for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zane, 62, is seeking to have his medical license reinstated. "I never promised 
to cure anyone," he said in a declaration filed in civil court last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not stupid," he told The Desert Sun newspaper last May. "I'm not about to 
tell you what I can cure for you." Some patients may simply have mistaken his 
enthusiasm and optimism for a guarantee, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, a psychologist testified at a Medical Board hearing that if 
Zane had stretched the truth, it was because he was suffering from a mental 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane's defenders range from a former congressman and an actor to a bishop and 
two men who are HIV-positive. They portray him as more New Age than Old West, 
an advocate of alternative medicine whose treatment really works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zane, a Polish-American native of Detroit whose real name is Zabinski, sold 
Cadillacs and storm windows to pay his way through college. He earned a 
bachelor's degree at Villanova University and then received his medical 
training at Wayne State University in Detroit, graduating in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving to California as a urology resident, he built practices in family 
medicine and general surgery in Los Angeles and Anaheim. In the late 1970s, he 
obtained a law degree from American College in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 While pursuing the two careers, Zane and his wife, Gertrude, who goes by the 
name Sunny, lived in the South Bay and joined riding clubs in Rolling Hills. 
They became co-chairs of the Polonaise Ball, an annual Polish-American charity 
event held at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his physician's role, Zane ran into trouble. In newspaper ads, he 
promoted a test that could "detect cancer risk far faster and far more 
accurately than any conventional test." The test, the ads said, involved taking 
a blood sample from the earlobe and putting it through a computerized 
diagnostic machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Medical Board was not impressed. Ruling that Zane had "engaged in 
gross negligence and incompetence," it placed him on probation for seven years, 
effective in late 1982. Around the time that probation expired, he moved to 
Palm Springs, where he and Sunny had often spent vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the desert, he quickly built a legal practice specializing in plaintiffs' 
personal-injury cases, airing commercials on local radio and TV that emphasized 
his dual credentials, according to local lawyers. His Yellow Pages ad shows a 
logo of the scales of justice superimposed on the insignia of the American 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the biggest hook he had," said a former associate who asked not to be 
identified. "His medical knowledge was supposedly so vast that he could help 
you on both ends of your case." 
</P>
<P>
 The pitch paid off. According to interviews with local lawyers, he captured 
about a third of the Coachella Valley's total caseload of personal-injury 
cases. But the work was hardly glamorous and he told one associate that he did 
not care for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he asked me, 'Do you really like this law stuff? . . . I hate it,' " 
Marsha Ciniello, who was a paralegal in Zane's office, recalled in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane became interested in alternative medicine in the late 1970s after 
researching the relationship between stress and disease, he told The Desert 
Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Stress, he said, triggers the secretion of hormones that can cause disease. 
His goal was to find something that would inhibit that process. "I think by the 
grace of God I fell into something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his shots consisted of vitamins, amino acids, zinc, chromium and 
Xylocaine, a common anesthetic. In Palm Springs, they were his only form of 
medical practice and patients came from all walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were legal clients, some were clergy -- Zane, a devout Catholic, prided 
himself on attending Mass every day -- and others met Zane at parties and 
charity events. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to all the social functions," Cindy Dawson-Austin, a Rancho Mirage 
resident active in local charities, said in an interview. "He didn't just go to 
enjoy himself, he went to get business." 
</P>
<P>
 By late 1991, Zane was talking about opening a chain of clinics. Sand-to-Sea, 
the desert's social chronicle, featured a photo of him being received in Rome 
by Pope John Paul II on its November, 1991, cover, and lauded his charitable 
activities in a profile. "You have to give life to your fellow man as well as 
taking from it," Zane was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, he vanished from Palm Springs, having closed his office and 
filed for bankruptcy protection. When he resurfaced in October, 1992, Zane, a 
burly man who was usually photographed in a tuxedo, was wearing an orange jail 
jumpsuit. He had been arrested after a routine traffic stop in San Mateo County 
and sent back to the desert to face a host of troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 He was criminally charged with fraud and theft, and also faced civil suits 
filed by legal clients, and the bid to revoke his license by the state Medical 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal case alleges that Zane embezzled $35,000 from three legal clients 
by pocketing their settlement checks. According to testimony at his preliminary 
hearing, he forged endorsements on checks. The State Bar, meanwhile, says it 
has paid $121,000 from its Client Security Fund to compensate more than a dozen 
clients who claim Zane mishandled their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the serum, Zane is charged with defrauding Colin Webster Watson, an 
internationally known sculptor, and Nelson Cramer, an 83-year-old desert 
resident who testified that he paid $36,000 for 24 shots, thinking it would be 
"beautiful" to feel 20 years younger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board complaint listed several other alleged victims and Goldsmith 
said still more were too embarrassed to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression was the affluent don't like the publicity," the investigator 
said. "Some of them were very prominent." 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board's case against Zane accused him of acting in an 
unprofessional manner, while the criminal case alleges an intent to defraud by 
making unsubstantiated claims for the shots. Patients have testified that he 
also refused to divulge the formula, telling them it was secret and he was 
going to sell it to investors for up to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 According to declarations filed by the Medical Board's experts, the vitamins 
in the serum could have generated a "brief high." But apart from that, the drug 
likely had little effect and, if it contained Xylocaine, could have been 
dangerous, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the desert, it may have been a relatively easy sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that was the lure is that people in the Palm Springs area, they 
want to be young again," said Medical Board investigator Goldsmith. "What Zane 
was offering was not an appearance of youth but actually a youth potion." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, an amiable 68-year-old New Zealander, wasn't interested when Zane 
first suggested the shots to him in late 1990. "I told him, 'Look, I'm a very 
healthy person, there's nothing really to cure,' " he said in an interview at 
his Palm Springs home. 
</P>
<P>
 But the doctor kept promoting the shots whenever he saw the sculptor at 
parties, Watson has testified. They could make him feel healthier and younger, 
clear his bloodstream -- even cure his hernia, Watson said Zane told him. In 
January, 1991, Watson relented. He started taking the serum, paying for 24 
shots with his "Leda and the Swan" sculpture, a piece he valued at $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was partly won over by Zane's faith. "He was always coming from or 
going to church," he said. Moreover, Zane told him he would shortly be moving 
to Mexico to open a hospital there so the shots would not be available much 
longer, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Watson gives Zane some benefit of the doubt. "I don't believe he 
helped me. But always that one little thing comes up -- maybe he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Janis Neuman, an expert who evaluated Zane's treatment for the Medical 
Board, had no doubts. Accusing him of "blatant fraud and charlatanism," she 
said in a letter to the board, "I have never been more shocked by such immoral 
and unethical conduct by a physician." 
</P>
<P>
 Zane has not commented on the legal fraud charges, but he has mounted a 
vigorous defense of his medical practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He got two dozen patients to submit affidavits that testified to the quality 
of his care and the effectiveness of the shots. They include the Most Rev. Juan 
Arzube, a former bishop in the San Gabriel Valley, and Kem Dibbs, 76, a Rancho 
Mirage resident who played Buck Rogers in the 1950s TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 A patient who is HIV-positive wrote, "Dr. Zane's treatment has been a godsend 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick J. Hillings, a Palm Desert attorney and former Republican Congressman 
from Arcadia, wrote, "I have never met a doctor who was more concerned about 
his patients." The shots "may have saved my life," added Hillings, 71, who was 
suffering from heart trouble and high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing in Zane's Medical Board case in September, there came another 
twist. A psychologist who examined Zane testified that if the physician had 
made any grandiose claims for the shots, it was because he was suffering from a 
form of manic depression that made him manic almost constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became so convinced that this was kind of a miracle drug that he didn't 
see the failures," the psychologist, George Demus, recounted later in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Demus said Zane has responded well to lithium and should be allowed to resume 
practicing medicine. "This guy has a genius. He is brilliant. He's got a mind 
you wouldn't believe," Demus said. 
</P>
<P>
 A psychologist testifying for the state disputed the diagnosis. "You can 
account for what he did by his antisocial traits and his narcissism," H. Gordon 
Blount said in an interview later summarizing his testimony. He said Demus drew 
"unwarranted conclusions" from the tests he ran on Zane. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the administrative law judge at the hearing revoked Zane's 
medical license, ruling that Zane had exaggerated the benefits of the shots and 
that such behavior was "not shown to be the exclusive result" of a mental 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Zane, who is free on his own recognizance and has been living with 
relatives in Los Angeles and Palm Springs, faces a criminal trial next month in 
Riverside County Superior Court in Indio. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution case has taken some blows. Cramer, one of the alleged victims, 
died last year, and Watson said he prefers not to testify. "I find this whole 
thing extremely unpleasant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Erwood, supervising deputy district attorney in Indio, said his office 
had considered a deal in which Zane would avoid jail time in return for 
pleading guilty to certain counts and agreeing to make restitution to victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people in Palm Springs think that would be too lenient. "He should be in 
jail for about five years," said a former patient who asked not to be 
identified. Elizabeth Baker, an attorney who represented Cramer, agreed: "I 
don't think restitution is appropriate. Who is he to inject people with stuff 
we don't even know what's in it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said he has no vindictiveness toward Zane. The artist only cares about 
one thing. "I don't mind what happens to him," he sighed, "if I just get my 
sculpture back."

FERRETING OUT THE TRUTH; DEBATE RAGES ON WHETHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD MAKE THE 
NATURAL PREDATOR (WHO IS ALSO SOFT AND PLAYFUL) A LEGAL PET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are either the silkiest, most playful and affectionate pets you could 
ever hope to have, or they're beady-eyed little hellions just waiting for 
nature's cue to ravage a chicken coop or gnaw a baby's ear to shreds. 
</P>
<P>
 And soon, you may be able to have one of your very own. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the opinion, it's certain that the common domesticated ferret is 
definitely capable of sowing confusion in the halls of government. Illegal in 
California since 1935, ferrets may soon be able to curl up on your couch with 
the full blessing of the law if the State Assembly passes a bill that would 
allow Californians to own ferrets as pets. 
</P>
<P>
 But not every lawmaker loves them. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which was recently passed by the Water, Parks and Wildlife 
Committee, ignited polarized debate in Sacramento. Were ferrets gentle and 
fun-loving, or were they a domesticated version of a centuries-old ferocious 
predator? 
</P>
<P>
 Think of "Kindergarten Cop" as a metaphor for the Great Ferret Debate. In the 
film, tough-guy cop turned kindergarten teacher Arnold Schwarzenegger charms 
the kids with his obligingly gentle and lovable pet ferret. The kids pet it. 
The ferret loves it. In the end, however, the ferret leaps at the bad guy and 
bites him in the neck, allowing Arnold to fill him full of lead. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how about it? Do you name your ferret Fluffy or Beelzebub? 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife authorities are less than wild about ferrets. Yes, they say, ferrets 
are natural predators. And, left to their natural instincts in the wild, that's 
what they'll do. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were developed in Europe as a hunting animal," said Bob Schlichting, a 
spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Game. "They're kind of 
cuddly, and they have nice, mink-like fur, but they can be very vicious. Our 
main objection is that they're not native to California, and we'd hate for a 
non-native population to establish itself (in the wild). They're very efficient 
hunters and could wipe out poultry and rabbit farms and compete with other 
natural predators here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrets, Schlichting said, were used for centuries to flush rabbits and 
rodents from burrows, but that wasn't all they were capable of attacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been lots of reports," he said, "of ferrets getting into henhouses 
and killing everything in sight, almost like the feeding frenzy we associate 
with sharks. Ferrets will kill far beyond what they can eat. It's just the sort 
of animal they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said Bob Tetreault, the general manager of Orange County-based Russo's 
Pets and a dedicated ferret fancier who raised ferrets in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a wonderful pet," he said, "a great pet. The reason they're not legal 
is that legislators don't have a clue as to what they're talking about. People 
are under the impression that the ferret is a wild animal that people are 
trying to domesticate, but they're not. The European ferret we're talking about 
has been domestic as long as the domestic cat. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say they're going to take over the countryside. That's not the case. 
New Zealand tried to establish feral colonies of ferrets to control rodents, 
but the ferrets wouldn't hunt. They even dropped food to them. But they died in 
the wild. They aren't used to hunting. There are thousands of ferrets kept as 
pets in this state, and you don't see them in the wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Many thousands, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith (R-Poway), the sponsor of the ferret bill, estimated 
that between 100,000 and 500,000 ferrets are illegally owned in the state. 
(Ferrets are legal in all states except California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and 
Michigan.) Because the owners know they are keeping an illegal pet, they are 
reluctant to approach veterinarians about proper treatment for the animals. The 
bill is backed by the California Veterinary Medical Assn. for that reason, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are all those ferrets coming from? Either from an extensive and 
established black market in animals (everything from parrots to exotic cats), 
or from neighboring states such as Nevada and Arizona, said Richard Evans, a 
veterinarian from Laguna Niguel. Evans, who has raised and sold ferrets outside 
of California and who is the medical director of the Laguna Niguel-based 
Pacific Wildlife Project, said ferrets make good pets but require special care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're playful little guys," said Evans, who, during a tenure at Ralston 
Purina, developed one of the company's more specific foods: Purina Ferret Chow. 
"There's some issue about them biting, but their bite is no worse than that of 
a kitten. They're good pets to the right person, but you have to take care to 
make your house ferret-proof. They like to get into all kinds of things. And 
you have to take care that they don't get out." 
</P>
<P>
 They're not for everyone, said Kent Yamaguchi, curator of education for the 
Santa Ana Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ferrets are very intelligent and easy to train if you have one with the right 
temperament," he said. "But if they're harassed, or their psychological 
well-being isn't taken care of -- just like any smart animal -- they can nip or 
bite. They're real fun to play with, but they have their special needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo, said Yamaguchi, used to keep a ferret that was exhibited at schools 
as part of the Zoomobile program (permits for ferrets can legally be issued to 
exhibitors, trainers and other professionals). However the ferret is no longer 
a zoo resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we were giving a double message to the kids," Yamaguchi said. "It 
would be 'Isn't this a great animal? You can't have it.' If ferrets were made 
legal, though, there would be the possibility that we would use one in our 
Zoomobile program." 
</P>
<P>
 People continue to be curious about ferrets as pets. Forrest De Spain, the 
director of the Orange County Zoo at Irvine Regional Park, said that "a 
significant amount of people come through here and say they have a brother or a 
cousin who has a ferret. They'll also say they saw a ferret in 'Kindergarten 
Cop.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never thoroughly domesticate them," Schlichting said. "They're cute 
and cuddly, but they can turn on you." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, he said, infants may be at risk. Ferrets, he said, will not 
attack an infant without provocation, but "babies can make sounds and movements 
that are similar to young prey" of ferrets. "They can inflict bites with 
machine gun-like rapidity, up one arm and down the other, nibbling real 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 A summary of a 1988 study of ferret attacks on humans by the California 
Department of Health Services is even more graphic. While acknowledging their 
popularity as pets and their playful nature, the report said that "ferret play 
frequently assumes the form of mock attacks, which may result in bites to 
humans. . . . Infants . . . may suffer severe injury as a result of ferret 
attacks. . . . The animals have been reported to then drink the victim's blood 
and eat the shredded tissue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health Services reported that there have been 60 cases in 10 
years nationwide of children being bitten by ferrets. However, Evans said that 
the danger is likely exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any animal, they need supervision around young children," Evans said. 
"It's a very individualistic thing, but as a general rule I'd say that it was 
inappropriate to label ferrets as a nasty animal that likes to bite people, 
especially young children." 
</P>
<P>
 Tetreault was more emphatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "About ferrets biting infants, I don't understand the whole argument on that," 
he said. "You wouldn't leave any animal alone with an infant, with both of them 
on the loose. Why would you do that? It's common sense to have adult 
supervision when you're dealing with animals. All pets can bite. Parrots bite. 
Dogs bite. Cats bite. These things can happen. But the chances of being 
seriously wounded by a ferret are small." 
</P>
<P>
 And what if the bill passes? What can would-be legal ferret owners expect? 
Tetreault said that some ferrets might be sold by private parties for between 
$25 and $50, and a pet store might charge $100 for one that has been de-scented 
(ferrets can emit a musky scent, but the scent glands can be surgically 
removed). They'll eat cat food and vegetables (and, of course, Ferret Chow) 
"and you can potty-train them like a cat," Tetreault said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they'll play for hours. Mine would come when I called him. They're very 
social animals."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; EXCHANGE GIFTS; FOREIGN STUDENTS WHO STUDY HERE 
LEARN ABOUT THE U.S. AND SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR NATIVE LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By KIRAN JAIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Kiran Jain is is a senior at El Dorado 
High School in Placentia.

<P>
 When foreign exchange students come to this country, they have to leave 
friends behind, learn a different culture and language, adapt to a new 
environment and go to a school where they have to make new friends -- not to 
mention live with people they hardly know. It can be an intimidating decision.  
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, do so many students from other countries visit the United States 
annually through exchange programs? 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Magda Sehnalova from the Czech Republic, want to learn firsthand 
about a place she has heard so much about. Others, such as Frank Kaiser from 
Germany, hope to perfect their English. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you ever wondered what life as a teen-ager would be like in a different 
country?  
</P>
<P>
 In countries all over the world, students start learning a foreign language -- 
often English -- long before reaching high school. Imagine school six days a 
week with up to 13 classes a semester. While this may be unheard of in the 
United States, it is common practice in other areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, four exchange students spending a year in Orange 
County shared some of their opinions on the differences between being a 
teen-ager here and in their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
 CECILIA ANDERSON 
</P>
<P>
 Country: Sweden Age: 17 High School: Fountain Valley  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was your impression of America before you came here? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In Sweden, we get all the American TV shows like "Roseanne," "Melrose 
Place," "The Cosby Show" and "Arsenio Hall," so a lot of our ideas about 
America come from these shows. Before I came here, I thought Americans were all 
fat people who ate burgers and drank Cokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What were the first things you noticed when you came to California? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was a real big culture shock. Everything here is so big, like the 
parking lots and freeway lanes. All the stuff is really cheap, too. In Sweden, 
a Big Mac costs $4! The best part about America is seeing people from all 
different cultures living together. That is very impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was something that you were surprised to see in America? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was really surprised to see how nudity is censored here, but not 
violence. In Sweden, we censor the violence and allow nudity on television, 
magazines, newspapers, etc. We have less crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are American teen-agers different than in Sweden? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Teen-agers are so open with each other. They are very nice and easy to talk 
to. Swedes are very quiet, shy and reserved, but they are also more 
open-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is dating in America different than in Sweden? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In America, dating is very complicated. In Sweden, if you kiss somebody, 
that means you are going out with that person. Instead of going out on dates, 
we go out in big groups to dance clubs and parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are relationships with parents? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Swedish parents are very open-minded. If you have a boyfriend, you are 
allowed to spend time with him, alone, in your bedroom. Parents realize when 
you are mature and independent. When they see you can take care of yourself, 
they let you make more decisions. Things like teen-age pregnancies are not very 
common in Sweden, as compared to America, because teen-agers are able to talk 
to their parents about contraceptives and things like that. We are very 
well-informed and open with our parents. 
</P>
<P>
 MAGDA SEHNALOVA 
</P>
<P>
 Country: Czech Republic High School: Aliso Niguel  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you want to study in America? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I decided to visit the U.S. to learn English and to learn about the 
culture. In Europe, we talk about America all the time, but nobody knows who 
the American people really are. I wanted to find out. Everybody in my country 
thinks it is great because of all the American movies they watch. They love the 
movie stars, but that's all they see about America. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are teen-agers in the Czech Republic different from the ones here? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In my country, the teen-agers are not as friendly. They are not very open 
to making new friends. In my school you are with the same 30 students for six 
hours a day, five days a week, and all four years throughout high school. We do 
not change classes like we do here. This is why it is hard to meet other 
people. We do not have sport teams or clubs at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of government is the Czech Republic? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We are a democracy just like America, but we have only been like this since 
1989. Five years ago, our country had a revolution. We switched from communism 
to a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 We have had many changes in the past few years. For example, in school we used 
to learn about communism and the Russian language. We never learned about other 
countries or things that did not relate to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 After the revolution, we were allowed to learn English. I have been taking the 
language for three years. Before the revolution, families were not allowed to 
believe in religion, because it went against community principles. Today, my 
parents are Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad also owns a firm, which was not possible before 1989, because the 
government owned everything. Now, (the government) just own things like the 
railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 FRANK KAISER 
</P>
<P>
 Country: Germany Age: 18 High School: El Dorado  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is your school system different from the one in America? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Our school system is really different. In Germany, teachers change classes, 
not students. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't have electives until the 11th grade. We get 13 classes a semester. 
Not all classes meet every single day. Every second Saturday we have to go to 
school for four hours, but that's only in the "Gymnasium," which is the highest 
out of three high-school levels. We have the "Hauptschule," which is the lowest 
level, and the "Realschule," which is the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of grading from A to F, we have grades from 1 to 6 -- 1 being the 
best. We have 13 years of school when we go through the "Gymnasium," then you 
can go to the University. If you decide to go to a university, the government 
will pay your admission fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you want to become an exchange student? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I like to learn about different cultures. I have been to Russia, England, 
France, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Holland and many other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people who live in Europe travel a lot. That is probably why we 
know more about the world around us, as compared to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to learn about the daily life in an American family. I also wanted to 
come to America to perfect my English, because it will help me get a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you describe the political situation in Germany today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Germany is still going through a lot of changes because of the unification 
between East and West Germany in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like two different worlds coming together. Turning from socialism to a 
democracy was difficult for East Germans. They were not used to the freedoms 
and liberties, which are taken for granted in America. 
</P>
<P>
 MARCELLA BARBOSA 
</P>
<P>
 Country: Brazil Age: 16 High school: Villa Park  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think teen-agers are different here? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think they are different in some ways but, deep down, teen-agers have 
similar problems here and in Brazil. People in Brazil don't care how you dress 
like they do here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What differences do you see between the countries? How is the Brazilian 
government different from America's? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In Brazil, there is a lot of corruption. The politicians know the rain 
forests are being destroyed, but they are paid off by the lumberers, so they 
don't say anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is similar to America because they pay for public education, 
but the schools aren't good. Those who can afford it go to private schools, 
which are usually in the city. The opportunities teen-agers have to go to 
school and be involved are greater in America. In Brazil, if you want to play a 
sport you have to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is family life different in Brazil than in America? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There aren't as many divorces in Brazil as compared to America. Families in 
Brazil are closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the youth of Brazil mainly concerned about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Our generation is more worried about the political problems. Brazil just 
impeached a president. Right now we have no future leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Young students know a lot about world events. American students only know 
about America. They aren't very aware of the world around them.

 Jarrett Seals says he can't begin to enumerate all he learned during a summer 
trip to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "For one thing, I became fluent in Portuguese and learned how Brazilians see 
the world. I began to think globally and started to question things in my own 
life that I had never thought about before." 
</P>
<P>
 Seals, a freshman at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., went to Brazil 
as a 16-year-old as part of World Learning's Experiment in International Living 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent three weeks in Brazil, sharing experiences with a dozen peers of 
various ethnic backgrounds from around the country. Students lived apart, each 
with an assigned family, but met daily for classes, discussion groups and 
sightseeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That summer really broadened my horizons and changed me totally as a person," 
Seals says. "I got to know about another culture, but I also got to know about 
being American." 
</P>
<P>
 World Learning Inc.'s Summer Abroad Program organizes supervised programs both 
at home and abroad -- with language study, community service and ecological 
adventure components. Students age 14 to 20 are eligible, but most are high 
schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program gives young Americans from various socioeconomic and ethnic 
backgrounds a chance to meet each other while they're learning about, are 
saturated in, another culture," says Mike Koonce, director of the Summer Abroad 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the sort of experience that elevates one's sense of identity and 
promotes self-confidence," he says. "It makes goals clearer and motivates one 
to work harder to achieve them." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1932 as the Experiment in International Living, the World Learning 
Inc., a nonprofit group in Brattleboro, Vt., claims 45,000 Summer Abroad 
alumni, including singer Tracy Chapman, Peace Corps founder Sargent Shriver, 
actor Larry Hagman and Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, there are 17 destinations in Africa, Asia, Australia, the 
Caribbean, Europe and Latin America. Program focus varies. For example, you can 
help maintain a baboon sanctuary in Belize; study language, Kabuki, Bunraku and 
temple garden landscaping in Japan; help build a classroom in a remote village 
in Kenya; preserve the fragile environment of the Galapagos in Ecuador; help 
prepare young Cambodians and other political refugees in Thailand for 
immigration to the United States or live and work on a kibbutz in Israel while 
visiting nearby Arab and Druze villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the programs require one or two years of language study. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs last three to five weeks. Most begin June 28, with supervised 
travel from Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, Mexico City and New York, depending 
upon destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees range from $1,900 to $5,000, including round-trip air fare from 
designated gateway cities in the United States, travel within the host country, 
orientation and room and board with host families. Fees also include hotels, 
meals and admission to program-related events while traveling as a group, plus 
health and accident insurance. Round-trip travel between home and gateway 
cities is additional. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholarships, based on need and merit, are available, with a good share of the 
money coming from the DeWitt Wallace Youth Travel Enrichment Fund.

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION BY RUDES OF THE 
ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA SANDERS and Donna Sanders is a student at Capistrano Valley High 
School in Mission Viejo. This article first appeared in the student newspaper, 
the CVHS Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Driving in California is a lot like playing the lottery: Motorists take their 
chances every time they get in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the turn signal has all but disappeared.The turn signal was put on the 
steering column for convenience -- so drivers no longer had to go to all the 
effort of putting their arms out of windows to signal. Now, the flick of the 
wrist seems to be too much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing California drivers, especially teen-agers, seem to do is drive 
emotionally. This means driving when they're angry, crying, depressed or even 
carelessly happy. People pay more attention to their feelings than to the road. 
If a person cuts them off, they have to get revenge or they speed up, just so 
the driver next to them can't get into their lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Speeding has always been a problem. The kind I really mind is when a person is 
speeding recklessly and weaving in and out of traffic. My theory is, if a 
person is late already, does it really matter how late? To put it in even 
simpler terms: If the tardy bell rings, why rush to class when you'll get a 
tardy anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 These statements only sound familiar because people have been saying them for 
years. They aren't nagging; they're common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are another couple of thoughts: Driving is not a competition to see who 
can break the most laws or who can get the best revenge. Driving is a way to 
get from here to there, safely.

LOWERY NOT SELLING HIMSELF SHORT; FORMER TRABUCO HILLS QUARTERBACK TAKING A 
SHOT AT CANADIAN FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If he wears two pairs of socks and thick-heeled shoes, he stands six feet 
tall, and while that still makes David Lowery a mighty short quarterback, he 
plays on. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, who wasn't impressive enough to start until his senior season at 
Trabuco Hills High School and who lost his job as San Diego State's starting 
quarterback last year, has accepted a contract offer from the British Columbia 
Lions in the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still got a lot of heart and determination and the rest of my life to work 
from 9 to 5," Lowery said. "So why not try and do something I enjoy and get 
paid for it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Go ahead, tell him he can't make it. 
</P>
<P>
 There were people who tried to deliver a similar message years ago at Trabuco 
Hills. Primed to start at quarterback his junior season, he was asked instead 
to play linebacker so a transfer -- John Barnes -- could call signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a painfully average linebacker," Lowery said, but he became the state's 
leading passer with 3,325 yards when given the chance to play quarterback his 
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 He guided Trabuco Hills to a Southern Section Division VIII title, but the 
short quarterback failed to measure up to the standards set by recruiting 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the last minute -- the last day -- San Diego State offered a scholarship," 
Lowery said. "It was kind of an iffy thing for them, but I took it and figured 
I'd get a free education." 
</P>
<P>
 He was just happy to be at San Diego State as a freshman, and was overcome 
with joy when allowed to hand the ball off for one play against Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, after a redshirt sophomore season, he was sitting with 
teammates at the Aztec postseason banquet and listening to his name being 
announced as the team's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Man bites dog; David Lowery beats out Marshall Faulk for MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my parents there was no reason to come to the banquet," Lowery said. 
"I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery started that storybook season on the bench, but stepped in to start for 
the Aztecs after 6-7 Cree Morris had flopped. Lowery led his team to a 6-1-1 
finish, including a 52-52 tie with BYU when he threw for a school-record 568 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if I had thrown for 569 yards it could have produced one more point and 
a win," Lowery said. "It's neat to have the record, but big deal. I'm mentioned 
in the media guide, but I don't have a ring for winning a WAC championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery's junior season ended in disappointment once again with a last-minute 
loss to Fresno State, costing the Aztecs a Holiday Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final season at San Diego State he injured his leg in the opener with 
Cal State Northridge, played on against California and Air Force before his leg 
gave way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was broken -- a clean break -- and no one really knew it until I just 
couldn't stand on it any longer," Lowery said. "Guess I was fortunate that 
nobody hit me in the leg and did worse damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, too short to play major-college football, had started 23 consecutive 
games before being sentenced to crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 In late October Lowery recovered sufficiently to return to the lineup, but the 
starting job now belonged to Tim Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 During his three previous years with the Aztecs, Coach Al Luginbill had a 
policy that any injured starter regained his position once healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that didn't apply to quarterbacks," Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from being the guy who has to get ready to do this and that to beat 
the next opponent to being the guy who stops by and says, 'Hi.' I remember 
thinking at the time I could handle it, but looking back it was a harder time 
than I could imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs played New Mexico, Utah, BYU, Fresno State, and Lowery, the 
school's No. 3 passer in yardage, completions and total offense, watched as his 
senior season slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been a banner year for David Lowery," Lowery told the San Diego 
Union-Tribune at the time. "How bad has it been? My girlfriend broke up with me 
the night of the BYU game." 
</P>
<P>
 One more game and one more chance to claim a share of the WAC title, and 
Luginbill turned to Lowery. For one play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He let me start the final game and play one play," Lowery said. "I got 
drilled as I threw the ball. It fell incomplete, and they told me I had a guy 
wide open on the other side of the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for the memories. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final play of the first half, however, Gutierrez suffered a shoulder 
injury, and Lowery was in command for the final 30 minutes of his career. The 
Aztecs trailed 31-17, but Lowery pushed his team into position to win with 15 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming had a 43-38 lead, but the Aztecs had the ball at the Cowboys' 
nine-yard line with two more plays to run. Lowery tried to lob the ball to the 
corner of the end zone to wide receiver Darnay Scott, but his throw sailed high 
and incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final play of the game the same play came in from the sideline and 
produced the same incomplete results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember vividly the walk from the field after the game," said Lowery, who 
threw 44 touchdown passes to tie Brian Sipe in third place on the Aztecs' 
all-time list. "It was the last game of the year, possibly the last game of my 
career, my parents were there, my friends, and I took my time walking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had made up my mind after the game that it wasn't in the books for me to 
play anymore. I was going to graduate in May, go to Europe with some friends, 
travel and get on with my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone say Doug Flutie? 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided Europe will always be there, but the chance to play football 
won't," Lowery said. "I looked at the rosters of the CFL teams and the tallest 
quarterback is like 6-2. Flutie (Calgary Stampeders) threw for 6,000 yards and 
44 touchdowns last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too bad he's so short, or he'd be one of the greatest quarterbacks 
to ever play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 If only Lowery had been taller . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wouldn't be that tall because my mom's 5 feet tall and my dad is 
about 5-11. I always wanted to be 6-2, but I stopped growing at 5-11 and 3/4. 
You can't get mad at what you're dealt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go back home my friend and I look at tapes of when we were juniors in 
high school playing defense. It's pretty incredible what has happened since 
then. I have to pinch myself when I look at what has happened; I just wanted to 
get on the field at San Diego State and I ended up starting 23 straight games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs lost their final four games last season with Lowery on the 
sideline. He has repeatedly declined to criticize the Aztec coaching staff for 
not playing him, and said he is now looking forward to training camp in 
Vancouver beginning June 2 -- two days after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things might not have gone how I would have liked my senior year, but if you 
dwell on negative things you're not going to go anywhere in life," he said. "I 
could be home two weeks after going to Canada and not make it. But you know, I 
was driving back from Orange County the other night after a family outing, and 
I was thinking to myself just how content I am right now. I'm pretty happy with 
the way things have gone."

BREA-OLINDA ATTAINS ITS NO. 1 DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dreams of a No. 1 ranking and "national championship" came true Wednesday for 
the Brea-Olinda girls' basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats (33-0) ascended to the No. 1 position in USA Today's Super 25 
national high school poll, rising one spot from last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea is the fifth team to be No. 1 this season. Ladycat Coach John Hattrup 
said he preferred it this way rather than deal with the expectations a No. 1 
ranking would have put on the team during the season. The Ladycats began the 
year ranked No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's 54-44 victory Saturday over San Jose Archbishop Mitty in the State 
Division III championship game gave the Ladycats their fourth consecutive State 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats received news of No. 1 Pickerington's loss to Garfield Heights 
Trinity, 59-54, in the Ohio Division I championship, while in the interview 
room shortly after their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the pinnacle of my career -- to coach a national championship team," 
said Hattrup, Brea's first-year head coach who directed Mission Viejo to the 
State title game in 1982 and won a Southern Section title in 1987 before 
joining the Brea program as an assistant. "I would say you couldn't do any 
better than this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats are one of six teams in the paper's Super 25 that finished 
unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Players' parents were as eager as the team was to get the official news. 
Colleen Hudson's mother had the poll ready when Colleen woke up, but Sarah 
Beckley's parents couldn't wait, getting her up 30 minutes earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad turned on my light at 5:45 a.m. and woke me up and said, 'Look, look, 
you're No. 1,' " said Beckley, who started in all four of Brea's State 
championship victories. "I think this is the best feeling you can get. We're 
all on a natural high. It's the best thing you could have done at the high 
school level, and it feels really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickerington (27-1) dropped to ninth in the rankings, one behind Trinity 
(26-2). Brea defeated Trinity, 65-55, on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Shreveport (La.) Byrd (35-1) finished No. 2, and Oregon City (Ore.), which 
finished 26-1, was No. 3.

TIMING IS EVERYTHING; FOR GE, THE MOMENT APPEARS RIGHT TO DIVE INTO A MUTUAL 
FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America is aging, retirement savings are growing, and the result is an 
investment boom that has enticed one of the world's largest finance companies 
into making an aggressive bid for one of the country's leading mutual-fund 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 General Electric Capital Services' bid of $2.2 billion, or $55 per share, for 
Kemper Corp. demonstrates GE's conviction that the mutual fund industry will 
continue to be as much a growth industry over the coming years as it has been 
over the last decade, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper, the nation's ninth-largest mutual fund company, also would put GE 
Capital into a one of the few sectors of the finance world where it does not 
have a strong position: individual asset management. As General Electric 
Chairman John F. Welch wrote to Kemper Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
David B. Mathis on March 2, "Kemper would be the flagship of our major thrust 
in the asset management business." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Kemper board and Mathis -- who has won widespread praise for 
his restructuring of the company -- rejected the bid last Friday. So far, they 
have refused even to discuss it further with GE representatives, according to 
spokesmen for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that this is a low-ball bid and they're attempting to steal 
the company," Steven Radis, a Kemper spokesman, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 GE has requested a list of Kemper shareholders, which it is entitled to 
receive, and has retained a proxy-solicitation firm to help present its offer 
directly to owners of Kemper stock. GE also has hinted that it might propose 
its own slate of directors at Kemper's annual meeting in May, during which four 
of the 11 board members -- including Mathis -- are up for election. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid comes against an expectation of continued growth in the mutual fund 
industry, where assets under management in stock and bond funds alone have more 
than sextupled to $1.4 trillion from $220 billion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have an aging population, low interest rates, and a need for retirement 
funding," observed James P. Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder Securities 
in New York. "And there are only 15 to 20 brand names in the (mutual-fund) 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those, Kemper is one of the few publicly held mutual fund operations. 
With $30 billion under management in its 40 equity and bond funds, the company 
is an inviting target for a buyer such as GE seeking to swiftly reach a 
critical mass in the field.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting a mutual-fund business from scratch is particularly difficult, 
industry experts say, because many investors judge funds by comparing their 
five-year records. That places funds with shorter life spans at a competitive 
disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business takes time to build," said John Rekenthaler of Morningstar 
Mutual Funds, the Chicago-based fund-rating service. "You just don't raise $30 
billion in three to four years." 
</P>
<P>
 In those terms, GE's bid resembles at least one other recent mutual-fund deal 
-- the 1992 acquisition of Templeton Funds by Franklin Resources. That 
$913-million transaction gave Franklin a foothold in the international-fund 
sector, where it was otherwise weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a GE-Kemper deal would make a lot of sense, many analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital is one of the country's most successful and aggressive financial 
companies. Created in the 1930s to help Depression-strapped consumers finance 
their purchases of refrigerators and other General Electric appliances, it has 
grown into an institution that resembles a full-service bank and investment 
company -- but is exempt from most conventional banking regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital finances auto, truck, airplane, and computer leases; issues credit 
cards and provides other consumer financing; puts up money for merger deals; 
sells insurance, and brokers stock and bond transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're probably the most profitable bank in the world," said Nicholas 
Heyman, an analyst for NatWest Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital's Kidder, Peabody unit could absorb Kemper's securities brokerage 
arm -- the product of a series of purchases of small regional brokerages in the 
early 1980s, including Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards of Los Angeles. From 1987 
through 1992, that strategy generated $223 million in losses for Kemper, which 
has never made the securities unit a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers also say GE's army of expert real estate executives may be able 
to squeeze more out of Kemper's burdensome portfolio of nonperforming real 
estate than Kemper has thus far. Over the last three years, Kemper has written 
down the properties to about 18% of their invested values, charging nearly $800 
million against profits. 
</P>
<P>
 That has drawn raves from analysts tracking Kemper's long restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the significant deterioration of Kemper's real estate portfolio 
has finally ended, and we believe that the reported losses will decline," wrote 
Merrill Lynch analyst Allen Nadler in placing a buy recommendation on the stock 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kemper management's success in streamlining the company may have 
hardened its stance against a GE takeover. "They've done so much of the hard 
work already," said Keefe, "and along comes GE." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, few expect Kemper will be able to remain independent. Many analysts 
expect the firm to capitulate if GE raises its bid to the $65 range, although 
Nadler has valued the entire company "conservatively" at about the $55 GE 
already has offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kemper hasn't given a reasonable case for saying it's a low-ball offer," 
remarked Heyman of NatWest, noting that no counter-bidder has emerged in the 
nine days since GE made its offer public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is Kemper's worst enemy," he said. "If there was another bidder, it 
would have surfaced by now." GE Capital Guns for Kemper 
</P>
<P>
 Created during the Depression to help consumers finance purchases of General 
Electric appliances, GE Capital today is one of the world's largest non-bank 
finance companies. In promoting GE's bid for Kemper Corp., Chairman John F. 
Welch said the Chicago-based insurance and mutual fund company would be the 
"flagship" of GE's move into the asset management business.

MISSED? 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper Corp., the object of GE's unsolicited bid, has a complicated history. 
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., its corporate cousin, may have squandered a big 
share of takeover booty by swapping some holdings with Kemper Corp. last year. 
A family history: 
</P>
<P>
 1912: James S. Kemper forms company to insure Chicago lumberyard workers. 
Later becomes known as Lumbermens Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 1968: Company splits in two. Kemper Corp. is publicly traded. The rest of the 
business becomes Lumbermens and several other mutual insurance companies, owned 
by their customers. Eventually, these all fall under the rubric of Kemper 
National Insurance Cos., of which Lumbermens is the largest. Lumbermens owns 
about 50% of Kemper Corp.'s stock. Kemper Corp. and Kemper National share the 
same executives and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 1990: Kemper Corp. and Kemper National evolve into completely separate 
entities, with different managements and separate boards -- although some board 
members continue to serve on both. Kemper National continues to own about 40% 
of Kemper Corp.'s stock. 
</P>
<P>
 August, 1993: Kemper National gives up all but a small portion of its Kemper 
Corp. stock. It gives 17.4 million shares, worth $593.8 million, to Kemper 
Corp., lowering its stake to about 4%. In exchange, Lumbermens gets ownership 
of Kemper Reinsurance and a risk management operation. 
</P>
<P>
 March 23, 1994: Value of 17.4 million Kemper Corp. shares at Wednesday's 
closing price of $60.875: $1.059 billion.

NOVELL CAST AS UNDERDOG IN FIGHT WITH MICROSOFT; SOFTWARE: COMPETITION BETWEEN 
THE TWO IS NOTHING NEW, BUT THE PROPOSED MERGER WOULD CHANGE THE DYNAMICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Novell Inc.'s plan to buy WordPerfect Corp. sets up a dogfight with Microsoft 
Corp. that could leave all sides battered. The question is whether Novell will 
survive the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both companies have no illusions," said Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of 
Softletter, a software trade publication in Watertown, Mass. "There's going to 
be a winner and a loser or, like World War I, years of trench warfare where 
everybody gets beat up over a few yards of territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Novell shares took a pounding in Nasdaq trading Wednesday. They closed down 
$1, at $19, after losing $3.75 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to defuse Wall Street's criticism of the deal, announced Monday, 
Novell Chairman Raymond J. Noorda on Wednesday called Microsoft "almost 
indomitable" and played down some analysts' concerns that Novell would wage a 
full-bore attack that could prove to be suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to compete head on with Microsoft," he said in a telephone 
interview, explaining that Microsoft's product offerings are simply too broad. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition between these companies in various niches is nothing new, of 
course. But the proposed union changes the dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Novell has a shot at prevailing, Noorda said, is in products that link 
computers and allow users to share information. Corporations are rapidly moving 
to such systems from stand-alone desktop computing. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Microsoft dominates the global industry overall, Novell, based in 
Provo, Utah, is the undisputed leader in this key networking sector. 
Microsoft's current network offerings haven't had much success; a new Microsoft 
networking product, code-named Cairo, is still in development and due on the 
market late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Novell will be first to the party in 'groupware,' " said Therese Murphy, an 
analyst with the Smith Barney Shearson investment firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 By buying WordPerfect, publisher of the No. 2 word processing program, and 
Borland International's spreadsheet business (a companion deal announced 
Monday), Novell seeks to deliver a package of products that would tie in 
smoothly with the desktop computer networks that run on its Netware and 
Unixware network software. 
</P>
<P>
 These new "suites" would aim to steal business from Microsoft Office and other 
offerings that are increasingly popular with corporate buyers looking for 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of selling products bundled together at a deep discount was 
Microsoft's. With such schemes, the Redmond, Wash., company has continually 
changed the rules of the software game and has ascended to the top of the 
global heap. 
</P>
<P>
 Its approximately $4 billion in sales this year will represent nearly 40% of 
the market for personal computer software. (A combined Novell and WordPerfect 
would move into a distant second place, with sales equal to about half of 
Microsoft's. Lotus Development would be No. 3.) 
</P>
<P>
 Led by its hard-driving chairman and founder, Bill Gates, Microsoft also has 
used price as a weapon, helping to render the industry's formerly cushy profit 
margins a dim memory. And it develops computer operating systems that tend to 
squeeze out smaller players that don't adhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' relentless tactics and winner-take-all attitude have prompted 
government investigations. They contrast sharply with Noorda's and Novell's 
culture of cooperating with rivals to build a market, something Noorda calls 
"coopetition." 
</P>
<P>
 Noorda is on his way out, having announced that he will step down as Novell's 
chief executive in June, when he turns 70. His successor will inherit the 
challenges of merging the companies and grappling with the Microsoft 
juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft views the potential disarray as an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are new businesses for them, and mergers are hard," said Pete Higgins, 
senior vice president of Microsoft's applications business. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Edwards, senior analyst with Robertson, Stephens & Co. in San Francisco, 
gives the Novell-WordPerfect team a slim chance of success against Microsoft, 
even if it does have a head start with its strength in networking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft has made it very clear they're going to be brutally punishing to 
anyone trying to occupy the same space," he said. "(Novell) is having a good 
time in the desktop sandbox, (but) it's Microsoft's sandbox." 
</P>
<P>
 * AMBITIOUS QUEST: Microsoft's Bill Gates aims to be the John D. Rockefeller 
of the information age. A1 How Suite It Is 
</P>
<P>
 "Suites" -- bundled packages of office software including a word processor, 
spreadsheet and other applications -- came into their own in 1993. Price was 
the initial attraction, but customers also like the compatibility, consistency 
and integration. Suites could eventually make stand-alone word processors and 
spreadsheets obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 1993 SUITE SALES* (millions of dollars) Microsoft: $762 Lotus Development: 120 
Borland/WordPerfect: 14 * preliminary 
</P>

TIMING IS EVERYTHING; FOR CORPORATE COUSIN, KEMPER STOCK TRADE COULD PROVE 
COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If GE Capital's offer to buy Kemper Corp. succeeds, another firm -- that until 
August owned nearly 39% of Kemper Corp. -- will have missed out big on a chance 
at windfall profits from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 That company is Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., which as a mutual insurance 
company is owned by its customers -- businesses and individual property owners, 
including thousands in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumbermens last year agreed to trade back to Kemper most of the stake it owned 
in the big financial-services company, in exchange for ownership of two Kemper 
subsidiaries -- one that sells reinsurance, the other a risk management unit. 
Lumbermens was left with about 4% of Kemper's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Although separate companies, publicly-traded Kemper and Lumbermens, both based 
in Long Grove., Ill., share common corporate roots and long have had close 
relations -- including four board members in common when the transaction was 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some analysts question whether Lumbermens board deliberately gave Kemper 
a sweetheart deal at the expense of Lumbermens' owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, Lumbermens . . . has basically done a number of transactions 
to help or benefit Kemper Corp. as a publicly traded vehicle at the expense of 
Lumbermens," according to Michael A. Lewis, an analyst with Dean Witter 
Reynolds. The August swap, he said, was the biggest example so far of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kemper got the better end of that deal," added Robert E. Robotti of New 
York's Robotti & Eng, a securities research and trading firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumbermens is part of a group of mutual insurance companies that go under the 
rubric of Kemper National Insurance Cos. (a separate entity independent of 
Kemper Corp.). Kemper National spokesman Charles F. Johanns insists that 
Lumbermens got a fair deal in the swap. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that an independent investment bank, Lazard Freres, was hired to 
review the trade and gave its approval in a so-called fairness opinion. Johanns 
said the Illinois Insurance Department also approved the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The price was arrived at "through an arms-length process of negotiation," 
Johanns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the deal are coming to light as critics of the insurance industry 
increasingly question whether the management and boards of mutual insurance 
companies adequately look out for the interests of the companies' owner -- that 
is, their policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the value of the Kemper Corp. stake that Lumbermens gave up 
were stirred by GE Capital's announcement March 14 that it was willing to pay 
$55 a share for all of Kemper's stock. Since then, Kemper's stock price has 
risen to $60.875 on the expectation that GE will raise its offer. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lumbermens gave up its 17.4 million shares, that stake was worth $593.8 
million, based on the $34.125 closing price for Kemper the day before the 
transaction closed last year. At Wednesday's closing price, the same 
17.4-million-share stake would be worth nearly twice as much, although a true 
comparison is difficult because Kemper now has fewer shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper's board so far has spurned GE's offer, although Wall Street is betting 
GE will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quite possible GE wouldn't have made its offer if Lumbermens still owned 
a 38.8% stake; part of Kemper's appeal to GE is that no big holder loomed to 
confound the deal. But as things stand, Dean Witter's Lewis contends, 
"Lumbermens is a double loser, because they gave away their (Kemper) shares 
cheap for what they got in kind, and Lumbermens now will hardly benefit if 
Kemper is acquired." 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction last August also could end up personally benefiting directors 
who sat on both companies' boards, if they remain Kemper stockholders. 
(Kemper's most recent proxy statement lists three men who served on both boards 
as holding 2,250 to 20,250 shares.) 
</P>
<P>
 None of those directors responded to telephone messages left with their 
offices Wednesday seeking comment. Johanns declined to say whether they 
participated in the vote on Lumbermens board that approved the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before GE's offer, the Lumbermens-Kemper swap had the potential for 
boosting the value of Kemper stockholders' shares. Kemper retired Lumbermens' 
17.4 million shares, thereby sharply reducing the number of Kemper shares 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Lumbermens' policyholders, one way the swap might end up costing them 
is in the loss of regular or special dividends they might have collected had 
Lumbermens experienced a big profit in selling its Kemper stake. The firm is 
California's seventh-largest workers compensation insurer, and bigger dividends 
might have gone to businesses in the state, among other policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, the profits could have gone into a reserve account assuring the 
company's financial strength and ability to meet future claims.  
</P>
<P>
 In the August trade, Lumbermens got ownership of Kemper Corp.'s reinsurance 
unit, known as Kemper Re, and National Loss Control Service Corp., a risk 
management concern. A spokesman for Kemper Corp. said the combined book value 
of the two at the time was $409.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that alone, the price Lumbermens paid seemed fair -- stock with a 
market value then of $593.8 million, or a relatively small premium over the 
subsidiaries' book value. But shortly before the swap first was announced in 
March, 1993, at least one insurance rating agency, A.M. Best, lowered its 
rating of Kemper Re.

EIGHT MAJOR BANKS RAISE PRIME LENDING RATE TO 6.25%; INTEREST: MOST ANALYSTS DO 
NOT EXPECT THE QUARTER-POINT INCREASE TO ACT AS A DRAG ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC 
RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight big banks nationwide Wednesday raised their prime lending rates to 6.25% 
from 6%, the first general hike in the benchmark lending rate in five years and 
another clear sign that the long decline in consumer and business borrowing 
costs is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwest Corp., a bank holding company in Minneapolis, triggered the increase 
in response to recent steps by the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve, 
to lift market interest rates. The Fed has raised short-term rates twice in 
recent weeks to prevent the growing U.S. economy from overheating and touching 
off excessive inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwest was followed by Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank of California, 
industry leader Citibank in New York, Banc One in Ohio and First National Bank 
of Chicago, among others. Although other major banks did not immediately follow 
suit, some analysts predicted they would shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether other California banks match the increase, the rate 
hikes by the others will create a ripple effect quickly felt in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking companies such as Norwest and Citibank are major interstate providers 
of home equity lines of credit, adjustable-rate credit cards and other 
short-term consumer installment loans that are directly tied to the prime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally people thought of the prime rate as the rate for your best 
corporate borrowers, but those days are long gone," said David S. Berry, a 
banking analyst with the securities firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. 
"The prime today is really a reference rate for consumer loans." 
</P>
<P>
 A key question now is whether the upswing in consumers' borrowing costs will 
delay the long-awaited recovery of California's feeble economy by crimping the 
amount of cash people have to spend on furnishings, cars, apparel and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a quarter-of-a-point (increase) is going to cause any change in 
the timing of the recovery in California," said Tom Lieser, an economist with 
the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. The group expects the recovery to begin 
taking hold in the latter half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hekman, economist at the research firm Economic Analysis Corp. in Century 
City, said "a much bigger factor" in California's economy is that banks and 
other lenders remain skittish about lending to home builders and construction 
companies, regardless of current rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of potential borrowers that would have been happy to pay 
higher rates if they could have gotten the loan," Hekman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and Wall Street, meanwhile, took the prime rate 
increases in stride and focused on the improving U.S. economy. The Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks rose 6.91 to 3,869.46. 
</P>
<P>
 White House spokesman Gene Sperling termed the banks' action "a predictable 
and unalarming consequence" of the Federal Reserve's increase in market rates, 
"which is entirely consistent with our forecast of solid growth and low 
inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that despite the higher prime rate, short-term lending costs in 
general are still relatively low. Indeed, the last time banks nationwide raised 
their prime rates in February, 1989, they were lifted to 11.5% from 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 They also noted that many fixed-rate and adjustable-rate home mortgages, auto 
loans and many business loans are tied to other interest rates and so would not 
be directly impacted by the prime rate change. 
</P>
<P>
 The rates on many home loans, for instance, react to changes in rates on 
30-year Treasury bonds, which are particularly sensitive to the inflation fears 
that the Fed is now trying to calm. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Treasury rates, too, have risen sharply in recent months. "But if the 
Fed is successful" in calming inflation fears, "then long-term rates ought to 
come down," Berry said. "So you might be in a world where rates on credit cards 
might go up, but rates on a 30-year mortgage might go down." 
</P>
<P>
 The prime rate is typically a "lagging" rate, meaning the banks change it in 
response to interest rates in the financial markets. The banks' action came one 
day after the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate -- the rate charged 
on overnight loans between banks -- for the second time since early February. 
The rate now stands at 3.5%, up from 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists worry that if the national economy keeps gaining strength, the 
Fed will keep raising rates, prompting the banks to keep raising their 
customers' borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said competition in the banking industry is so fierce that the 
banks will think twice before charging more. Economists noted that after the 
Fed first pushed the federal funds rates to 3.25% on Feb. 4, the banks kept 
their prime rates at 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime rate had moved steadily lower since early 1989 to the 6% level. Last 
October, Morgan Guaranty Trust in New York and Harris Trust & Savings in 
Chicago dropped their prime rates to a 21-year low of 5.5%. But the rest of the 
industry did not match that move, and the two banks raised their rates back to 
6% earlier this month.

 Trading Group Quits Exchange in Hong Kong: Hong Kong's oldest colonial trading 
group, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., said it would quit the local stock 
exchange in a dispute linked with the colony's 1997 return to China. The 
company said it will discontinue the secondary listing of its ordinary shares 
from the Hong Kong bourse on Dec. 31.Its shares will continue to trade in 
London, where they have had their primary listing since 1992, and on other 
markets. Chairman Henry Keswick denied that the move indicated a loss of 
confidence in Hong Kong. "I would emphasize that our decision is related to the 
regulatory position of the company and does not signal any lack of confidence 
in the future of Hong Kong itself."

 Kodak Video Recording Patent Invalidated: Sony Corp. scored a knockdown in a 
high-stakes patent dispute with Eastman Kodak Co. over a magnetic recording 
system used in camcorders and videocassette recorders.The U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office invalidated Kodak's 1981 patent on the technology, now in wide 
use. At stake are tens of millions of dollars in royalties, analysts said. In 
February, 1993, Kodak sued the Japanese electronics company and its U.S. 
subsidiary, Sony Corp. of America, alleging violation of the patent. However, 
Sony asked for a re-examination of the patent, arguing that similar technology 
was in the public domain for years before Kodak claimed exclusive rights to it. 
Kodak said it plans to appeal the Patent Office ruling.

ASSASSINATION WILL ADD TO MEXICO'S WOES; VIOLENCE: DEATH OF RULING PARTY 
CANDIDATE COMPOUNDS ALREADY GLOOMY CONCERNS BY INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS. 
</P>

 The assassination Wednesday evening of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the Mexican 
ruling party presidential candidate, will aggravate the already serious worries 
that international investors have had about the nation's business climate, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the concerns is whether the attack on Colosio will prove to be an 
isolated event or part of a broad campaign of political violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors have been skittish since a bloody New Years Day rebellion by 
peasants in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of "politically motivated violence is something that no one was 
anticipating at the beginning of this election year," said Wayne Cornelius, 
director of UC San Diego's Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's death will create a "scramble to succeed him" and a "great deal of 
uncertainty," Cornelius added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing most dangerous to U.S. interests, for business and in general, 
would be a long period of unrest and sorting things out," added Colleen Morton, 
a political scientist at the Institute of the Americas, a La Jolla-based think 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Business development and investment in Mexico "have been slowed down due to 
Chiapis and the election, and things will slow down further because of this" 
even if Colosio recovers from the shooting, Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio wasn't generally the first choice among international investors as the 
candidate of the ruling party, known as PRI, to succeed outgoing President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Still, Cornelius said business interests were "quite 
comfortable" with Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton said Colosio was regarded as highly trained and "part of the modern 
Salinas economic team." She said he was expected to continue a policy of 
liberalizing the economy and "extending the benefits to rural communities and 
the urban poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, who has served in Mexico's Cabinet, strongly supported the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's attack follows several weeks of plummeting prices on the Mexican 
Stock Exchange -- sparked by concerns about Chiapis. 
</P>
<P>
 The market began to recover this week, boosted by news that a serious 
political challenger to Colosio, Manuel Camacho Solis, would drop his 
presidential bid to focus on his efforts to negotiate peace in Chiapis.

FORD REACHES AGREEMENT ON JOINT VENTURE IN CHINA; AUTOS: PACT, WHICH STILL 
FACES APPROVAL BY GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING, CALLS FOR PRODUCTION OF VEHICLE 
COMPONENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday that it had reached a tentative agreement to 
manufacture automotive components in China in a joint venture with a Chinese 
parts supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between Ford and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. comes as 
trade relations between the United States and China are strained because of 
U.S. concerns with China's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford trails Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. in gaining entry to China, 
which because of its sheer size is regarded as the most promising auto growth 
market in the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford declined to put a price tag on the agreement, but a spokesman said it 
involved "tens of millions of dollars." The deal must be approved by the 
Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that this joint venture will be good for Ford, good for our 
partner and good for China," said Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, expected to be finalized in several weeks, calls for production 
of interior trim, seats, instrument panels and other plastic parts. The work 
would be done jointly by Ford's plastics and trim unit and Shanghai's Yan Feng 
division, China's largest supplier of trim products. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, which recently set up a separate China management operation, also is 
negotiating a joint venture to make glass, electronics, engine parts and 
air-conditioning components in China. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, it wants to assemble vehicles in China -- something its U.S. 
competitors already are doing in joint ventures. Chrysler is building Jeeps in 
Beijing; GM is assembling pickup trucks in Shenyang. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement is an important first step," said James Paulsen, president of 
Ford's China operations. "We are hopeful it will lead to vehicle assembly 
operations as well."  
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three also are exporting vehicles to China. In the last two years, 
China has spent $309 million on vehicles produced by Ford, GM and Chrysler in 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
 That trade could be threatened by the Clinton Administration's review of 
China's most-favored-nation trade status, which allows it to export goods to 
the United States under normal, low tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Renewal of most-favored-nation status is in jeopardy because of the Chinese 
government's resistance to human rights reforms sought by the Clinton 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Defiant Chinese officials have said revocation of the favorable trade status 
would hurt the United States more than China. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulsen said Ford is concerned with the trade friction but is looking at China 
with a long-term perspective. "If MFN is not extended, there would be some 
disruption," he said. "We hope it would not be a lasting one."

MACY REORGANIZATION PLAN MAY FUEL FEDERATED TAKEOVER; RETAILING: ANALYSTS SAY 
SOME DEBT HOLDERS MAY SEEK A BETTER OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 R.H. Macy & Co. unveiled a reorganization plan Wednesday for the famous 
retailer's emergence from bankruptcy next year that could fuel further 
unwelcome takeover overtures from rival Federated Department Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the controversial plan, which faces a potentially 
protracted review by Macy's many creditors, could spark some unhappy debt 
holders to ask the court-appointed bankruptcy mediator to solicit a better 
offer from Federated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Barnard, New York-based publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, 
said Federated has the financial resources to offer creditors higher payment in 
exchange for control of the parent of the Macy's, Bullock's and I. Magnin store 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan from Macy's directors presented Wednesday to creditors proposed 
repaying $3.6 billion of the company's nearly $6 billion in debt upon emerging 
from bankruptcy next year, with an additional $500-million payment in 1997. 
Macy's filed for bankruptcy protection in January, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Before emerging from bankruptcy, Macy's must reach agreement with creditors on 
the value of its retail operations and negotiate the level of compensation or 
equity that creditors and bond holders will receive in exchange for forgiving 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the plan calls for Federated, which earlier this year purchased a 
substantial secured bankruptcy claim against Macy's from Prudential Insurance 
Co. of America, to be repaid in full. The retailer is making a special effort 
to woo secured creditors -- those with debt backed by collateral -- because 
those debt holders could push the retailer to consider a bid from Federated if 
the negotiations or repayment fail.

WEATHER BLAMED FOR BIG DROP IN ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS; ECONOMY: FEBRUARY 
FIGURES REFLECT A DECREASE IN AIRCRAFT AND DEFENSE ORDERS. ANALYSTS SAY DECLINE 
IS ONLY TEMPORARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Factory orders for big-ticket goods declined sharply in February as a reversal 
in aircraft and defense orders ended six months of advances for durable 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said the decline reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department 
may in part be weather related and is probably only a temporary interruption in 
the upward trend for U.S. manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said orders to factories for durable goods fell 2.5% in 
February, the first decline since July, when the indicator of manufacturing 
growth dipped 2.8%. Orders rose 4.4% in January, revised upward from the 3.7% 
the government estimated a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers were weaker than I thought," said Michael Niemira of Mitsubishi 
Bank in New York City. "But I'm still moderately encouraged. They probably will 
rebound as we move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 "The industrial sector will continue to advance in coming months," said Bruce 
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch & Co. "However, the rate of increase is likely to 
slow to a more sustainable pace." 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said orders for all items expected to last at least 
three years totaled a seasonally adjusted $145 billion. The record, $148.8 
billion, was set in January. 
</P>
<P>
 February's decline was due to a plunge in defense orders, down 30.6%, with 
volatile orders for aircraft and parts leading the way. Aircraft also accounts 
for a big part of the transportation component of the index; that sector 
slumped 9.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding transportation, durable goods orders were unchanged last month, and 
excluding defense orders, dropped 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Car orders rose less than expected in February, analysts said, and many said 
automotive output has peaked and will decline in the next three months. But 
other factory orders likely will continue on the upswing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were big swings in January and February," said Robert Brusca of Nikko 
Securities Co. International Inc. "It tells you weather is really affecting 
this report. There may in fact be more increases in output in March after a 
full recovery from the weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said, "While monthly figures may fluctuate, 
most economic trends still indicate that we are in a period of sustained 
economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists expect growth to be slowed further by the Federal Reserve 
Board's decision to boost interest rates for the second time this year. The 
central bank, seeking to head off inflation, pushed its target for the federal 
funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other -- up a quarter 
percentage point to 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher interest rates could discourage consumers and businesses from 
purchasing expensive durable goods on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Durable goods orders are a key barometer of manufacturing plans for 
production. A decline could dampen production and job growth. Durable Goods

 Crayons From China Recalled: Federal regulators said yellow and orange crayons 
imported from China by Los Angeles-based Concord Enterprises were being 
recalled because they contain hazardous amounts of lead.The Consumer Product 
Safety Commission said it tested the crayons and found too much lead in those 
two colors. "Throw these crayons in the trash can or take them back to the 
store for a refund," CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said in a statement. The crayons 
in question are sold in plastic boxes labeled "12 Jumbo Crayons," "Made in 
China" and "Non-Toxic."

 Grumman Suitor Says Northrop Broke Pact: Martin Marietta Corp., whose takeover 
bid for Grumman Corp. was topped by Northrop Corp.'s $2-billion hostile offer, 
asserted that Northrop's bid violated an earlier confidentiality agreement 
between Northrop and Grumman. In a letter to Grumman, Martin Chairman Norman R. 
Augustine said the agreement prohibits Northrop from making a bid for Grumman 
"unless specifically invited" by Grumman to do so. But Grumman said it has 
complied with the agreement, and Northrop said the pact "became unenforceable 
as soon as Grumman was put up for sale."

 Hartford Hit with $400,000 Fine: Hartford Life Insurance Co., a unit of ITT 
Hartford Group, paid a $400,000 fine for selling modified guaranteed annuity 
contracts in California without necessary Insurance Department authorization, 
state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said.Hartford had contended that 
the contracts did not require approval but stopped selling them when it learned 
of the department's objection, Garamendi said. Hartford, which characterized 
the infractions as "technical," agreed to pay the fine without admitting or 
denying wrongdoing. Hartford since has obtained the authorization to sell the 
contracts.

 Farm Group Opposes New Disney Park: Walt Disney Co.'s proposed history theme 
park would have an adverse impact on rural Virginia from the District of 
Columbia west to the Shenandoah Valley -- jeopardizing 50% of the state's 
orchards and 15% of its farmland, a conservation group said this week. The 
American Farmland Trust, an 18,000-member nonprofit group that gets much of its 
financial support from the Rockefeller family and the Ford and Richard King 
Mellon foundations, urged a halt to the project unless conservation measures 
are taken to protect Northern Virginia's $263-million agriculture industry. 
Mary Anne Reynolds, speaking for Disney's America, rejected any freeze on the 
project.

MARTIN WINS U.S. CONCESSIONS; DEFENSE: CONTRACTOR WILL GET HALF THE FUTURE COST 
SAVINGS FROM ITS PURCHASE OF GENERAL DYNAMICS UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that could cost San Diego 2,400 defense jobs, the Pentagon 
agreed Wednesday to an unprecedented proposal made by Martin Marietta in which 
the government will give back to Martin half of the future cost savings that 
result from its pending acquisition of General Dynamics' Space Systems 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin asked for the extraordinary government concessions last December, 
asserting that it would walk away from the proposed deal unless the government 
shared half of the estimated $450 million in savings stemming from 
consolidation of the two businesses over a 10-year period -- an amount that 
would more than offset the $209-million cost of the acquisition itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch granted Martin's request Wednesday, 
clearing a major hurdle for the acquisition that would reduce the U.S. space 
launch industry from three competitors to two and possibly result in the 
closure of the San Diego plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Defense Department has taken this unusual step in order to save money in 
the long run and support intelligent, efficient downsizing of our defense 
industry base," Deutch said. "This action says the department is willing to 
support the 'right-sizing' of the defense industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal expected to close in March, Martin Marietta would combine its 
Titan space booster business located in Denver with General Dynamics' Atlas 
Centaur booster business in San Diego -- merging two operations that are each 
struggling with excess capacity and high costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But "right-sizing" will mean job losses and economic pain when Martin moves to 
cut excess capacity.  
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta has insisted that it has made no decisions about closing the 
San Diego plant, but it acknowledges that it is considering such a closure 
along with the option of reducing operations at its Denver plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the history of defense consolidations that have so damaged the 
California aerospace industry, independent experts and Defense Department 
insiders say that San Diego is likely to take the hit. Notably, Martin is not 
buying General Dynamics' facilities in San Diego, but rather has agreed to a 
two-year lease on the facility where the Atlas rocket is assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch's decision is certain to raise hackles in Congress, both because a 
major federal acquisition policy will be changed by the decision without 
congressional approval or public hearings, and because California is likely to 
get stung with another huge defense plant closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego), a member of the House Armed Services 
Committee, called the Martin proposal "appalling" in a letter last month 
calling for a congressional investigation after the proposal was disclosed by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all intents and purposes, it would mean that Martin Marietta is asking 
the taxpayers to buy the General Dynamics Division and give it to them," she 
wrote. The Armed Services Committee is expected to hold hearings in several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior official for the Defense Department downplayed the decision 
Wednesday, saying that it does not represent a major acquisition policy change 
and that similar requests from other contractors would be judged on a 
case-by-case basis.

 But a congressional official asserted that Deutch's decision is a major 
departure from the federal acquisition regulations, a massive body of rules 
that govern every aspect of government purchasing.

 Martin holds a contract for 41 Titan IV launch vehicles with an estimated cost 
of $8.9 billion, but will have an expected overrun of $570 million, according 
to a senior Pentagon official. Under existing contracts, the government picked 
up 90% of the overrun, whereas under the new cost-sharing plan, it would pick 
up only 50%. Thus, Martin's risk increases if its costs continue to grow rather 
than decline.

CARELINE OF IRVINE TO BUY 2 FIRMS; HEALTH CARE: PURCHASE OF AMBULANCE COMPANIES 
WOULD CREATE THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMERGENCY MEDICAL OPERATOR IN PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 CareLine Inc., operator of one of the nation's largest ambulance services, 
outbid two competitors for a pair of Philadelphia ambulance companies in a move 
that would create that city's largest private emergency medical operator. 
</P>
<P>
 CareLine, a 2-year-old Irvine firm that began selling stock publicly in 
December, said Wednesday that it signed a letter of intent to acquire privately 
held LifeLine Ambulance and Procor Ambulance for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed takeovers come as the long-fragmented ambulance industry is 
coming together. The nation's three publicly held ambulance companies have been 
in existence for just a few years and are racing to consolidate as national 
health care cost-cutting moves ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really going to give us a significant market share" in Philadelphia, 
said CareLine Chief Executive M. Keith Huzyak, adding that he expects the deal 
to be finalized within 60 days. "We will pick up immediate economies of scale." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements to purchase LifeLine and Procor came after two months of 
outbidding its staunchest rivals -- American Medical Response Inc. of Boston 
and Rural/Metro Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz., analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three companies have been vying to bring together an industry that until 
recently has not had many large regional players. In Orange and Los Angeles 
counties alone, for instance, 43 ambulance services compete for business. 
</P>
<P>
 The push toward national consolidation has increased dramatically, especially 
because of acquisitions by CareLine and American Medical Response, the nation's 
largest ambulance operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1992, CareLine has bought nine small ambulance services 
in San Bernardino, Los Angeles and Riverside counties as well as companies in 
Birmingham, Ala.; Pueblo, Colo.; Atlanta, and Boston. CareLine now has annual 
revenue of $32.3 million and employs about 1,200 ambulance drivers, emergency 
medical technicians and other personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheryl R. Skolnick, a health analyst with the Robertson Stephen & Co. 
brokerage in New York, said the company is well positioned for further growth. 
</P>
<P>
 CareLine stock first sold at $8.50 a share when it began trading on the Nasdaq 
market in December. Shares have traded up sharply since then, to close 
Wednesday at $13.25 a share, up $1.50 a share from Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Skolnick said that the public offering raised about $46 million for CareLine, 
allowing it to clear all debt from its books. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a vision and they are buying a lot of companies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Skolnick cautioned that an overly aggressive buying spree could backfire 
if companies like CareLine do not carefully manage the newly purchased 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've demonstrated that they can buy the companies," she said. "But the 
real challenge will be if they can operate them efficiently, save money and 
improve the quality of care."

BILL WOULD SEND PROPERTY DISPUTES TO MEDIATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New state legislation that would require real estate disputes to be solved by 
mediation instead of lawsuits has been introduced in Sacramento, its supporters 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced by Assemblywoman Julie Bornstein (D-Palm Desert), AB 3272 is 
sponsored by the California Assn. of Realtors and will have its first hearing 
April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 In mediation, disputes are resolved with the help of a neutral person who 
helps the parties clarify issues and explore avenues to a solution.  
</P>
<P>
 "This will create an environment where we can solve these problems. The 
California home buyers, sellers and realtors will all win by this and reduce 
the burden on our overloaded court system," said Garden Grove realtor Pat Neal, 
association president. The California Assn. of Realtors is the state's largest 
trade association, with 115,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal added that the California courts "should be focusing on criminal cases 
rather than resolving typical real estate disputes involving things like leaky 
roofs or faulty hot water heaters." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Trial Lawyers Assn. is expected to oppose the bill but has not 
yet taken a formal position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not made a decision whether to oppose AB 3272 or not," said Nancy 
Drabble, legislative counsel for the trial lawyers group. "We're still studying 
it."

JUDGE OKS RUSTY PELICAN REORGANIZATION PLAN; COURTS: DECISION LIFTS THE SAN 
JUAN CAPISTRANO-BASED UPSCALE RESTAURANT CHAIN OUT OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Wednesday approved the reorganization plan of Rusty Pelican 
Restaurants Inc., officially lifting the upscale dinner house chain out of 
eight months of bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John E. Ryan found that the restaurant chain, 
which is based in San Juan Capistrano, had reached agreement on its debts and 
has a viable economic forecast for the next five years, lawyer Marc J. Winthrop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge found their plan was feasible and (Rusty Pelican) is going back 
into the marketplace and surviving quite nicely," the Irvine bankruptcy lawyer 
said. "They are out of bankruptcy. Go eat at the Rusty Pelican!" 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Pelican, once a high-flying chain that was the envy of the restaurant 
industry, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last July. Company 
officials blamed excessive debt left over from a leveraged buyout and costly 
leases on less-popular restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the filing, the company closed six of its 24 restaurants, 
including Rusty Pelicans in Irvine and Brea, and its Sand Dancer Broiler & 
Rotisserie in Newport Beach. It also sold two other restaurants, but the Rusty 
Pelican in Newport Beach remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the agreement, Rusty Pelican will pay 25% of the nearly $6 
million owed to unsecured creditors. Its primary secured creditor, Heller 
Financial Inc. of Chicago, is providing a $1-million revolving line of credit. 
Heller is also lending $900,000, repayable in five years, according to 
Winthrop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge was very interested in reviewing the projects for the next five 
years and needed to be convinced the plan was feasible, that the company could 
survive," said Winthrop, who added he is "very pleased" at the outcome.

ADVANCED LOGIC WINS COMPUTER PATENT; SHARES RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer maker Advanced Logic Research Inc. saw its shares rise 16% Wednesday 
after the company announced late Tuesday that it had won an important computer 
patent. 
</P>
<P>
 ALR shares rose $1 to close at $7.125 on Nasdaq Wednesday.David Kirkey, vice 
president of worldwide marketing, said the company believes it has an important 
patent for upgrading a personal computer's obsolete microprocessor, or main 
computing brain, to a faster component. 
</P>
<P>
 ALR launched its upgradeable computers in 1989 and has reaped additional sales 
because the technology lets computer users run the latest software programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Safi Qureshey, chief executive of AST Research Inc. in Irvine, said he 
believed AST had its own resources and patents to protect itself in case ALR 
tried to enforce the patent against his company.

DISNEY CALLED THREAT TO VA. FARMS; AGRICULTURE: AN AMERICANA PARK AND RESORT 
NEAR THE U.S. CAPITAL WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE STATE'S CROPS, GROUP SAYS.

 A Walt Disney Co. theme park would threaten rural Virginia west from 
Washington to the Shenandoah Valley, jeopardizing 50% of the state's orchards 
and 15% of its farmland, a national farm conservation group said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Farmland Trust, an 18,000-member nonprofit group that gets much 
of its financial support from the Rockefeller family and the Ford and Richard 
King Mellon foundations, urged a halt to the project unless conservation 
measures are taken to protect Northern Virginia's $263-million agriculture 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The controversy over this project is not just a back-yard squabble; it is 
symptomatic of what is happening all over America," said Edward Thompson Jr., 
the trust's public policy director. "The land that feeds us . . . is being 
taken for granted and . . . paved over indiscriminately." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney announced plans last year for a new, Americana-themed amusement park 
resort in the gentle countryside outside Washington, including such things as a 
World War II airdrome and re-enactments of Civil War battles. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the farmland trust became involved, the project was criticized 
by groups ranging from anti-development forces to history buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no similar outcry has arisen, Disney's proposed Disneyland Resort 
project in Anaheim, centered on a new Westcot internationally themed amusement 
park, would eat up farmland as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels would be built on a Disney-owned strawberry field north of the 
Disneyland hotel. The company had also made repeated attempts to buy another, 
larger strawberry field near the existing Disneyland, but the owner refuses to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
 In Virginia, the trust estimated that there are 6,000 farms making up 1.2 
million acres in 12 counties within 40 miles of the Disney site. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the land accounted for 14% of the state's farmland, worth $2.6 
billion, and $236 million in agricultural production, including 52% of its 
horses, 48% of its fruit, 19% of its cattle and 15% of its poultry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one of the most flagrant examples of the threat of unplanned 
growth that we see all over the country," said trust President Ralph Grossi, 
comparing rural Virginia to California's Central Valley and South Florida's 
sugar cane fields, where sprawling suburbs have gobbled up thousands of acres. 
"Development often causes local leaders to act in too much of a hurry to get 
these jobs. They don't realize what they are giving up." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Anne Reynolds, spokeswoman for Disney's America, rejected any freeze on 
the park and resort project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney and the farmland trust both want responsible growth," Reynolds said, 
but it is unreasonable for Prince William County to be "held hostage to 
decisions outside its borders." 
</P>
<P>
 While Reynolds said Disney would work with the trust for conservation, she 
noted that before Disney announced its plans, Prince William's ambitious growth 
plans already envisioned building on the scale of a new Rosslyn, Ballston or 
Tysons Corner on vacant land west of Manassas. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossi called on Virginia Gov. George Allen and state Agriculture Commissioner 
Clinton Turner to help the counties create large, new agricultural reserves, 
zoning easements and tax and other financial incentives for farmers to keep 
their land rural. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing Disney projections that it will employ the equivalent of 2,700 
full-time workers and build 2,500 residences and 2 million square feet of 
offices and shops, Grossi said the project's spinoff growth "will undoubtedly 
change the face of Northern Virginia."

EXECUTIVES, AWAITING NEW LIVES, JOIN THE RANKS OF TEMPORARIES; EMPLOYMENT: 
WHETHER BY CHOICE OR FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCE, MANY ARE HIRING OUT ON BRIEF JOBS 
-- AND ENJOYING IT.

 Computer consultant Bob Wagner promised himself a decade ago that he would 
spend part of every spring in Paris -- and thanks to his job as a temporary 
executive, he has. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always said there are two great evils in life -- being on a payroll or 
having one. I've succumbed to just one of those," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 His employees "clean up" after Wagner has done the heavy lifting for a client 
in need of his special computer skills. Sometimes he calls in the reserves if 
several clients need him at once, and he usually takes his work with him to 
France in a laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Either by choice or by force of corporate gutting of management ranks, many 
executives have joined the temporary-help movement, once a realm dominated by 
clerical workers and secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "People realize they're going to live their lives in chapters now, so, 
whatever reason, they go into this temporary work force while they're looking 
to start a new chapter," said John Stanek, who heads a Chicago labor consulting 
firm called International Survey Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps the wolf away from the door. And of course, corporations like it," 
Stanek said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Catalyst, a research organization, 3.5 million managers and 
professionals are among the 20 million Americans working part time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some temporary executives are restless retirees, others are career dropouts, 
some want to spend more time at home and others are victims of the corporate 
cost-cutting of the past decade, Stanek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westpacific Search Group in Irvine specializes in placing top executives in 
the insurance and health care fields. Company President Glenn Burnett said his 
3-year-old company placed about 30 executives last year in full-time jobs 
paying $40,000 to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But increasingly, Burnett said, many Orange County executives are looking for 
part-time work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like the fact that it is more results-driven and they don't have to play 
politics," he said. "These are older executives in their late 50s, and they 
enjoy running their own show." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Temporaries, another local temporary agency, has not yet started 
placing executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our clients come to us with a special request for an executive, we will 
jump through hoops, but we have no current placement plans," said Gene Wilson, 
president of Thomas Temporaries in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary workers represent 16% of the nation's work force, and the 
flexibility they provide dovetails with a corporate climate geared toward 
keeping down expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, however, a part-time worker, or one who works full time for 
a set period of time, often gets limited or no health insurance or pension 
benefits. But even permanent employees are seeing those benefits trimmed by 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shortcoming of being temporary, especially at the executive level, is 
a difficulty exerting authority over subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of organizations don't know how to handle a rent-a-brain or a 
rent-an-executive," Stanek said. "It's easier to handle a brain, because you 
just stick him in a closet and let him out when he's finished. But an executive 
is almost like hiring an orchestra conductor." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, companies are hiring executives temporarily to help roll out new 
products or deal with seasonal bulges in demand, according to Andrea Meltzer of 
Executive Options, a Chicago placement firm specializing in upper-level 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary executives are paid, often handsomely, by the hour or by the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend seems to bear out Alvin Toffler's prediction in his 1970 book 
"Future Shock" that specialists from several fields would gather to complete a 
project and then disband. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a temporary worker is addictive -- they do feel sort of a 'gig' 
mentality about it," Stanek said. "They like the fact that they're going to be 
there to do a job, and then they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner said that he grew fed up with the political maneuvering and infighting 
that poisoned his full-time jobs at large corporations, and found that 
switching employers improved his work life. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently working for a small but rapidly growing Chicago-based 
freight-handling firm and other clients, Wagner described himself as a 
"traveling corporate troubadour" with reams of experience to impart to new 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troubadours not only brought entertainment, they brought the news," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Diebert, who like Wagner relies on Executive Options, said she prefers 
the flexibility of part-time work despite offers for full-time positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some companies only have enough work for a part-time person," said Diebert, a 
human relations expert. Pregnant with twins, she said she will cut back her 
schedule when the babies are born this spring.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: DOWNEY; CITY REFUSES PERMIT FOR MCDONALD'S DEMOLITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has refused to issue a demolition permit for a historic McDonald's 
restaurant, forcing the company to delay plans at least temporarily to tear 
down the structure, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had planned to begin dismantling the 40-year-old landmark on 
Tuesday, city manager Gerald M. Caton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant at Lakewood Boulevard and Florence Avenue has been the center 
of a much-publicized tug of war between McDonald's executives and local 
preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists say the restaurant's Art Deco features -- the golden arches 
that pierce the roof and the 60-foot sign featuring "Speedee," the winking 
hamburger mascot -- are icons of 1950s Southern California. McDonald's 
officials have contended that the structure, which lacks indoor seating and a 
drive-through window, isn't equipped to meet the needs of today's consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company maintained that the restaurant was damaged in the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake and closed it. The company has said it plans to build 
elsewhere in Downey a modern restaurant that will replicate the architectural 
flavor of the 1950s stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision has been made to close the restaurant," said Kevin Mazzu, the 
company's Los Angeles marketing manager. "We're going to preserve as many of 
the historical elements, such as the Speedee road sign, as we can at the new 
location." 
</P>
<P>
 But Caton said that since the building is eligible to be listed in the 
National Register of Historic Places, state architects must evaluate earthquake 
damage before the structure can be altered. He said he expects the structure to 
be evaluated within 30 days, but does not know whether McDonald's officials can 
ultimately be persuaded to save the building. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company's request for permission to demolish the building came as 
a surprise. "Quite frankly, we thought we were close to being able to work out 
a compromise between McDonald's and the city," Caton said Tuesday. GREG MILLER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH AREA; NAVAL HOSPITAL DEBATE RAGES AS AN ERA ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A formal decommissioning ceremony, complete with brass bands and Navy 
dignitaries, was scheduled for 10 a.m. today to end the Long Beach Naval 
Hospital's nearly 30 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital, which treated its last patient in December, is among the 
casualties of military cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Long Beach and neighboring cities are waging a heated battle 
over how to use the site. Long Beach wants to build a shopping center there, 
but a coalition of six cities, led by Lakewood, has opposed the plan, saying it 
would destroy nearby businesses. The site at 7500 E. Carson St. is about three 
miles from the Lakewood Center Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from the coalition -- which includes Lakewood, Buena Park, 
Cypress, Hawaiian Gardens, Artesia and Garden Grove -- the Navy decided to 
reopen hearings on how to use the hospital site. The first hearing will be at 7 
p.m. April 5 at Lakewood City Hall, and the second at 7 p.m. April 6 at Long 
Beach City Hall. JOHN POPE

 Lakewood turns 40 next month, and city officials already have begun to 
celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 people turned out earlier this month for a ceremony commemorating 
the city's incorporation on April 16, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 John S. Todd, Lakewood's only city attorney, recalled how officials in Long 
Beach and the county predicted that the city would fail. "Neither I nor anyone 
else imagined we would be this successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials initiated a system of contracting for services, such as police 
and fire, to hold down costs. The system became a model for many other 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the March 9 ceremony, City Administrator Howard L. Chambers was given a 
career achievement award for the 18 years he has served in his position. JOHN

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY ISSUES MORATORIUM ON BUILDING TEAR-DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No historic buildings in Long Beach will face the wrecking ball for at least 
90 days, the City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a three-month moratorium on demolition permits at the 
request of Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal, chairman of the neighborhoods and 
housing committee.The committee will explore other options to destroying the 
buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six historic structures are slated for possible demolition because 
they do not meet the city's seismic-safety ordinance, one of the toughest in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal said the buildings, which include the Masonic Temple, at 835 Locust 
Ave., and the Insurance Exchange, at 205 E. Broadway, are made of sturdy 
steel-reinforced concrete and need only minimal strengthening. He said he 
doesn't want building owners under the gun to demolish structures that could be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these (owners) will tear down buildings not because they want to but 
because they're forced into it," Lowenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal said the housing committee will be looking at the policies of cities 
such as Claremont and Pasadena, which allow demolition only if, after rigorous 
examination, no alternatives can be found. The committee will present its 
recommendations to the council in a few weeks, Lowenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The action may be too late to save the historic Barker Brothers building. A 
demolition permit has already been issued for the structure, but Lowenthal said 
city officials will ask the building's owners not to destroy the building 
before other ideas are discussed. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; PANEL PUSHES TO CUT FEES FOR LIVE-ABOARD SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's Marine Advisory Commission is pushing to implement a discount for 
senior citizens on fixed incomes who live aboard their boats, despite a warning 
from the city that such action could be challenged as discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about hardship cases," said commission chairman Hal 
Lane."People who have been in the marina for some time on fixed incomes and 
would become homeless if they lost their boats." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said the proposed discount rate, which could be set on a case-by-case 
basis, would target senior citizens age 65 and older whose only income source 
is Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 300 people living on boats in Long Beach's two marinas, about 
30 are in some danger of losing their homes to financial difficulties, said 
Russ Smith, a board member for the Long Beach Boat Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the city's Parks, Recreation and Marine department said, however, 
that the state Lands Commission has ruled that a change in live-aboard fees 
based on age or financial status is discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said this week that he still plans to ask the City Council to approve the 
discount in live-aboard fees. Boat owners currently pay $115 a month if they 
live aboard. JOHN POPE

2 LATINAS MAKE STRONG COUNCIL BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two candidates are making a strong effort to become the first Latinos elected 
to the Long Beach City Council, while an incumbent who drew criticism for 
anti-gay remarks last year is facing a serious challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1st District, Jenny Oropeza, the first Latino elected to the Long Beach 
School Board, is waging a well-financed effort to achieve a similar feat on the 
council. The district, which includes Downtown neighborhoods, was redrawn 
nearly four years ago to create a Latino majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Even her two opponents acknowledge that Oropeza is the candidate to beat for 
the seat held by Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who opted to run for city 
prosecutor. The other contenders are Gus Hein, 31, government relations officer 
for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and Dianne McNinch, 50, a retail 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the campaign for the 7th District seat, Tonia Reyes Uranga, former 
president of the Children's Museum, is considered a leading contender to 
succeed Councilman Ray Grabinski, who is running for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga has amassed a bigger campaign war chest than her two rivals -- Mike 
Donelon, 42, a general contractor, and W. Mack Tyson, 52, an insurance agency 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the nine council seats are on the April 12 primary ballot. Incumbents 
are seeking reelection in Districts 3, 5 and 9. If no candidate receives 50% 
plus one vote, the top two vote-getters in each race will vie in June 7 runoff 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In the races for the open seats in the 1st and 7th districts, Oropeza and 
Uranga enjoy wide name recognition as well as fatter campaign war chests. Both 
said their campaigns tout their credentials as community leaders and play down 
their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not asking people to vote for me because I'm a Latina," said Oropeza, 36, 
who cites her school board experience as proof of her leadership capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 1st District candidates also contend that ethnicity should not be a 
major issue in the race.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are more important issues, like people being afraid to leave 
home at night," said McNinch, who founded the Long Beach Grand Prix Charity 
Weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 Hein emphasizes his community activities. He has been chairman for the Stand 
Down Project, offering help to homeless veterans, and vice chair of the YWCA 
Battered Women's Shelter Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza has raised nearly $40,000, more than double what each of her opponents 
has raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga leads her opponents in fund-raising, with about $19,700. The 7th 
District, which covers central and western Long Beach, has been plastered with 
her campaign signs. Donelon has raised nearly $14,000, and Tyson has nearly 
$5,000 in his campaign coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7th District candidates, all of whom are seeking public office for the 
first time, said crime and business development are the most important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon, president of the California Heights Neighborhood Assn., said he wants 
to add 100 police officers to the police force. Uranga said business license 
fees should be lowered to attract more companies, and jobs, to the area. Tyson 
said crime and commerce are both important issues, and that the council 
representative should take personal responsibility for attracting new business 
to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the other council races: 3rd District 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Douglas S. Drummond faces three challengers, two of whom decided to 
run after he made anti-gay remarks during a conservative forum last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond, 56, and a retired police commander, is up against Patty Moore, 50, 
owner of a Farmer's Insurance Agency; Don Tripeny, 64, owner of a real estate 
and development firm, and Anne L. Johnson, 50, a bookkeeper for her husband's 
legal office. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore and Johnson said they decided to run after learning of Drummond's 
remarks during a speech on "family values" to a chapter of the Eagle Forum of 
California in September. Drummond said gays did not concern him because they 
were dying from AIDS, and he supported Cuba's policy of quarantining people 
with the disease. While a repentant Drummond later voted with the council 
majority to censure himself and offered an apology, the damage was done, 
challengers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were very upset about the remarks he made there," Moore said. She also 
is the one challenger who has distributed a lengthy platform statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond is waging an aggressive campaign. Nearly every corner in the bustling 
district, which includes the Belmont Shore and Naples areas, seems to be 
anchored by a Drummond campaign sign. 5th District 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Les Robbins, 45, a Sheriff's Department sergeant, is being 
challenged by Patrick Carabine, 37, a membership director of the Long Beach 
Chamber of Commerce, and Al Stillwell, 57, retired small business owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins has been under fire recently for supporting a plan to close Pioneer 
Boulevard at the border of Long Beach and Hawaiian Gardens to cut off traffic 
in a quiet neighborhood. Critics have denounced the plan as racist, saying it 
attempts to cut off access to a wealthier Long Beach enclave from poor 
neighborhoods to the north. The closure has been stalled pending a trial in 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins defends his position. "This street closure is indicative of how I 
stand up and do the right thing, whether it's politically correct or not," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Carabine says the road should remain open. But he places more emphasis on 
business issues, advocating aggressive marketing to attract more commercial 
flights into Long Beach Airport, which is in the district.  
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell, a two-time candidate for county supervisor, said he would 
concentrate on attracting and keeping small businesses in the area. "The city 
government completely destroys and disillusions any small business," Stillwell 
said. 9th District 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference four years makes for incumbent Warren Harwood, who is 
seeking a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman, who ran unopposed in 1990, is facing six challengers this 
time. All have criticized Harwood's reputation as the council naysayer, the 
council member most likely to cast the lone dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The challengers are Jerry Shultz, 47, a sheriff's deputy; Edd Bond, 30, 
manager of a commercial printing company; Richard F. Cook, 57, a quality 
representative for an aerospace company and retired U.S. Navy chief; Terry 
Rouch, 27, a bank branch manager; Rod Givens, 35, owner of an accounting firm, 
and Felix Babauta, 48, a retired supervisor at the Long Beach Navy Shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's alienated all his council colleagues to the point that if he's for 
something, they're against it," Shultz said of Harwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of odd man out, Harwood prefers to consider himself the conscience of 
the ruling body, he said. He admits this has not made him popular with 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a little effort by City Hall types and others to recruit 
challengers to run against me," said Harwood, 54, a projects coordinator for 
the County Department of Health Services. "It's because I speak my mind. Some 
people think that takes courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate, Norma Mower, has withdrawn from the race, although her name 
will appear on the ballot.

USUALLY QUIET RACES HEAT UP FOR A CHANGE; CITY PROSECUTOR AND CITY AUDITOR 
INCUMBENTS FACE SERIOUS CHALLENGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two hotly contested races have surfaced in a surprising quarter in Long Beach 
as the incumbent city auditor and city prosecutor face serious opposition.  
</P>
<P>
 Most years, the races for these offices and that of city attorney generate 
little more than a collective yawn as incumbents run unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, Councilman Evan Anderson Braude is providing the first 
challenge in 16 years to City Prosecutor John A. Vander Lans. In the city 
auditor's race, incumbent Gary L. Burroughs is opposed by Willy Molnar, who 
owns an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the city attorney's race is holding true to form. Incumbent John R. 
Calhoun, who is seeking his third term, is unopposed in the April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the auditor's race, Burroughs and Molnar have traded barbs over experience 
and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Molnar distributed a letter from a former employee in the 
auditor's office, accusing Burroughs of pressuring city employees to sell Amway 
products for him on city time four years ago, when he was assistant city 
auditor. Molnar said he received the unsolicited letter recently from Chris 
Kikuchi Kamens, a former auditor in the office. Molnar called for Burroughs to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs denied selling or asking anyone to sell cleaning products on city 
time. His wife has an Amway distribution business, but Burroughs said he is not 
involved in it. He said the allegations were made by a disgruntled former 
employee.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the campaign, Molnar successfully fended off a legal effort by a 
Burroughs supporter, former city auditor Robert Fronke, to have Molnar's name 
removed from the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contended that Molnar failed to meet a City Charter requirement 
that the city auditor have at least five years' experience as a certified 
public accountant. Molnar earned a CPA certificate in Michigan in 1987, but had 
let it lapse when he moved to California in 1989. A judge ruled that Molnar was 
qualified.  
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs, 50, says experience is the most important campaign issue. He was 
appointed to his post after Fronke retired in 1992, and is seeking his first 
full term. He joined the auditor's office in 1986. Molnar, 34, cites ethics and 
trust as the paramount issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the prosecutor's race, Braude has accused Vander Lans of being soft on 
slumlords and code enforcement cases, which usually involve dilapidated 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of 16 prosecutors, there is only one deputy assigned half-time to code 
enforcement cases," said Braude, 47, a former city attorney for Los Angeles. "I 
would assign at least one full-time, maybe two people. These cases have to be 
prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
 Vander Lans, 63, denies there is any problem with the way he runs his 
29-employee office, which prosecutes misdemeanors for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm told that we don't have any slumlords in Long Beach," Vander Lans said, 
adding that his office is diligent in prosecuting city code violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there are only two candidates running in both the races for auditor and 
prosecutor, the April 12 election will determine the winners.

CANDIDATES FOR CITY COLLEGE BOARD SEE FEE INCREASES AS OVERRIDING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six candidates -- including one incumbent -- are running for two seats on the 
Long Beach City College Board of Trustees in the district's last at-large 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 William Millington, a board member since 1990, is seeking another term. Board 
member Donald Weaver decided to step down after serving six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The challengers, who are seeking office for the first time, are printing 
salesman Steven Alari, attorney Katherine Aschieris, property manager Ginny 
Leibrich, legislative consultant Valerie Martinez and Charles G. Townsend, a 
retired naval technician. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two vote-getters in the April 12 election will serve two-year terms. 
Trustees will be elected by district in 1996, and all five seats will be on the 
ballot then. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates agree that the key issue facing the college district is 
providing access to classes despite increases in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how we can realistically cut those fees," said Aschieris, 37. 
"But we do need to make sure that everyone who wants to attend city college is 
able to do so, through the use of scholarships and grants." 
</P>
<P>
 Several candidates said they support expanding the existing ties between the 
college and the business community, especially for retraining the hundreds of 
laid-off aerospace and high-tech professionals who live in the district.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of my goals is to stop looking to Sacramento for financial help," said 
Leibrich, 43, the owner of a Long Beach property management business. "I think 
the business community is ready to step in and help." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, 25, a legislative consultant to Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los 
Angeles), wants to set up an employment pipeline from the college to the 
business community by training students for specific jobs with various 
employers throughout Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 But other candidates said the college also should continue to prepare students 
to go on to four-year colleges and universities.  
</P>
<P>
 "Job training is important, but we also have to support and educate the 
students who want to transfer to universities," said Alari, 36, who attended 
Santa Monica City College before completing his bachelor's degree at Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, a past president of Long Beach's chapter of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People, said he believes it's time to diversify the 
five-member board, which has never had a minority trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is changing ethnically, and we have the same old thing of 
representation. It really doesn't matter what color you are to do a good job on 
the board, but let's face it, you need several perspectives to represent this 
city," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; PORT ACQUIRES 725 ACRES FOR $405 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move designed to position Long Beach as a leading shipping center in the 
next century, the port has completed the largest land purchase in its 83-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The port bought 725 acres of land straddling the Cerritos Channel in the north 
harbor area from Union Pacific Corp. for $405 million.When developed, the land 
will increase the size of the harbor by 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider this a milestone," said port spokeswoman Yvonne Avila. "All 
predictions show that by the year 2020 we're going to double the amount of 
cargo coming through Long Beach. To accommodate that growth we're going to need 
more land." 
</P>
<P>
 The port plans to build shipping terminals to handle cargo ranging from 
clothing and electronics to such "breakbulk" items as lumber and steel, she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Avila said there are more than 300 oil wells on the property, of which 90 are 
active. The port has contracted with Long Beach-based Tidelands Oil Property 
Company to operate existing wells until the property is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we develop the land those oil wells will be taken out of production," 
Avila said. "They're not real moneymakers at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Escrow on the sale closed Tuesday, ending at least two years of negotiations 
between the port and Union Pacific. Under the agreement, the port paid $280 
million this week, including $150 million from reserves and $130 million raised 
by selling short-term commercial paper. GREG MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS: BELL; PLAN TO REOPEN CASINO STILL ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plan to reopen the Bell casino may be troubled but it is still ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, two investor groups pulled out of a deal to open the beleaguered 
poker parlor and the city has returned a $500,000 deposit to Worldwide 
Entertainment Centers of Carlsbad and California Casino of Bell, a Los Angeles 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 James Knapp, the casino building's owner, has submitted a gaming license 
application to the city along with a $500 processing fee, said Robert Rizzo, 
chief administrative officer. Knapp has also submitted a license application to 
state officials, a process that could take as long as six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp has leased the casino to other operators for 14 years, Rizzo said, and 
"now he wants to try it on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The first deal folded because investors could not front the $1.35 million in 
good-faith money that the city required, Councilman George Cole said at the 
time. It is unclear whether the city would require Knapp to pay the same kind 
of deposit, Rizzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Werrlein Jr., who managed the formerly successful card club until he 
pleaded guilty in 1984 to mail fraud and owning an illegal gambling business, 
is still contracted to monitor casino operations, Rizzo said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA FE SPRINGS; SCHOOL DISTRICT BANS SMOKING ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Little Lake City school district has joined the growing ranks of area 
districts to ban smoking on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's school board has voted unanimously to ban smoking on school 
grounds, including in private vehicles in school lots, beginning July 
1.Employees who are caught smoking will receive warnings and could be suspended 
or fired if they continue to light up, officials said. Visitors will be warned, 
then removed from the premises if they refuse to comply with the no-smoking 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which has elementary and junior high schools in Santa Fe Springs 
and Norwalk, will offer assistance to employees who want to stop smoking, Supt. 
Maria Ott said.  
</P>
<P>
 Guidelines for the new policy were drawn up by a committee of parents and 
smoking and nonsmoking employees, Ott said. 
</P>
<P>
 By July 1, 1996, all school districts that receive state money aimed at 
educating students in tobacco-use prevention must have tobacco-free campuses, 
according to state Department of Education regulations.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; HEADMISTRESS GETS FINE, PROBATION FOR SPANKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The founder of a private school for girls has been placed on probation for a 
year and fined $100 for spanking a former student at a birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Margaux, founder and headmistress of the Chrysalis School for Girls, 
pleaded guilty Monday in Long Beach Municipal Court to disturbing the 
peace.Judge Gary Ferrari dismissed a misdemeanor battery charge in exchange for 
the guilty plea, said Ron Brodsky, deputy city prosecutor. Margaux also agreed 
not to contact the former student or her mother, Brodsky said. Margaux said 
Tuesday that she pleaded guilty to avoid a trial. She said she spanked the 
child because the girl was being incorrigible at the Aug. 20 party. She 
contends the incident was blown out of proportion.

COVER STORY; MAYOR: 13 CANDIDATES VIE TO LEAD LONG BEACH; A BAKER'S DOZEN VIE 
FOR AN OUNCE OF POWER; CANDIDATES FOR LONG BEACH MAYOR MAKE THEIR PITCH FOR A 
JOB THAT LACKS CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who occupies the mayor's chair must feel that he's wearing a 
straitjacket at times. 
</P>
<P>
 As the leader of California's fifth largest city, Mayor Ernie Kell is faced 
with the ills common to a major urban center: A record homicide rate, a looming 
budget deficit, neighborhood blight, potholes -- all these headaches, and more, 
land on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Long Beach residents expect Kell to lead the ship of state through 
angry shoals, he must do so without oars. He has no vote on the nine-member 
City  
</P>
<P>
 Council. Most of his vetoes can be overridden with a simple majority. In 
short, it's a job that carries little official power. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kell and 12 other candidates are vying for the mayor's job. The 
challengers are an eclectic lot, including two City Council members, a real 
estate magnate, a former city college president, a Marxist, a former minister 
and a 20-year-old college student. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many candidates running, it is unlikely any will garner the necessary 
majority -- 50% plus one vote -- required to win the April 12 primary. In that 
case, the two top vote-getters would meet in a June 7 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates brush aside the question of mayoral powerlessness, saying they 
will overcome this obstacle to beef up the police force, cut red tape and bring 
national recognition to Long Beach. In forums across the city, challengers have 
railed against Kell for failing to create a vision for Long Beach. These 
critics charge that for six years, Kell has governed this port city as a sleepy 
seaside town. And they say his few initiatives have been restricted to downtown 
and the wealthier Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell says critics overlook his tireless lobbying efforts in Sacramento and 
Washington on behalf of the city, and he wonders if his opponents are simply 
grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leadership is not standing on a soapbox, taking credit for everything you 
do," said Kell, who earns $84,057 as mayor. "I'll match my personal success 
with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's race comes at a time when Long Beach is in transition -- its 
bustling harbor, gleaming downtown skyscrapers and struggling shopping 
corridors are all on the cusp of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a predominantly white suburb of Los Angeles, a bastion of Navy and 
defense industry employees, only a shadow of Long Beach's former image remains. 
The naval hospital on the city's Eastside has closed, and the Navy base 
continues to scale back its operations. Defense plants, once the bulwark of a 
solid middle class, have laid off thousands, throwing the city's economy into a 
tailspin. Immigration has created cultural enclaves within the city, a 
cacophony of new languages and values. 
</P>
<P>
 As Long Beach sheds its Iowa-by-the-Sea image, most candidates say the mayor 
must be an ambassador to business, create more jobs, fill this port city's 
newly expanded Convention Center, its sleek downtown hotels, theaters and 
boutiques. And the mayor needs to be a diplomat to unite disparate 
neighborhoods. In this climate of rapid change, several candidates see an 
opportunity to reshape the skyline, to leave their own sprawling signatures on 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like someone is giving you a huge canvas, like 20-feet-by-200, and you 
can do anything with it," said Ray Grabinski, who is giving up his City Council 
seat after two terms to run for mayor. "You can leave one dot on it or create a 
major landscape." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the mayor will actually be given the paint and brushes to leave a mark 
has been a matter of some contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Long Beach voters elevated the job from a ceremonial post 
rotated among council members every two years to a full-time elected position. 
A citizen's task force that recommended the changes wanted to give the mayor 
veto powers that would have required a two-thirds council vote to override. But 
the council watered down the measure that voters ultimately approved, requiring 
a simple majority to deny most vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the mayor can propose ordinances and policy changes, but cannot vote on 
them. The city manager draws up the annual budget, although the mayor presents 
it to the council with his own recommendations. On budget issues, the mayor has 
a stronger veto, requiring a vote of two-thirds of the council members to 
override. Kell has used his veto twice -- to block a package of budget 
increases and to force a proposed downtown apartment complex to reduce its 
number of units. The council voted to override Kell's veto on the budget issue, 
but he prevailed on the development dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor also makes appointments to the city commissions that oversee 
multimillion-dollar projects in redevelopment, planning and the harbor. But the 
mayor doesn't exert any real authority over those agencies, the commissioners 
say, and his appointments must be approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to expand the mayor's clout, Kell recently supported a proposed 
ballot measure to give the mayor a council vote. But council members -- 
including mayoral candidates Grabinski and Vice Mayor Jeffrey A. Kellogg -- 
rejected the plan, saying it could tie up city business with 5-5 deadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg said he prefers that the mayor be given stronger veto powers. A vote 
of two-thirds of the council members should be required to override all vetoes, 
he said. Grabinski favors a mayoral vote on the council, but only if the number 
of council seats is changed to ensure an odd number of voting members. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell has vowed to lead a grass-roots initiative to put such a measure on the 
ballot in the future. "The system needs to be changed," Kell said. "There's no 
way the mayor can operate (effectively) without legislative power." 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor has the potential to wield influence beyond the authority that 
is defined in the City Charter, Kell's challengers say. The job can be used as 
a bully pulpit to attract new business and bring prestige to a city that for 
decades has lived in the shadow of Los Angeles. Most challengers insist that 
Long Beach needs a brand-name mayor -- such as a Tom Bradley -- who will work 
to make Long Beach a nationally recognized urban center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Ernie Kell has been an effective spokesman outside the city 
limits," said Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal State Long 
Beach and an adviser to mayoral candidate Frank Colonna. "Long Beach is not a 
(real) presence in Sacramento or Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Kell, political insiders say, remains part of the old Long Beach -- a city 
that survived on revenues from a booming oil industry and was proud of its 
self-sufficiency. Now that state lawmakers have begun slashing funds to cities 
to help balance the state budget, Long Beach can no longer afford to be 
independent or aloof. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city will never be what it was," said candidate Beverly O'Neill, retired 
Long Beach City College president. "I think people look at us as provincial, 
but we're becoming international." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents complain that Kell doesn't even attend national mayoral conferences. 
Kell says they are a waste of time and taxpayer money. Critics contend he 
doesn't bother to attend meetings of the city's most powerful commissions. Kell 
says he doesn't want to grandstand, and he is more effective behind the scenes. 
For example, he says his quiet lobbying trips to the nation's Capitol have 
helped save the Navy shipyard from closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) said Kell and other city officials have worked 
to keep the shipyard off the Pentagon's closure list. Horn, who is not 
endorsing a mayoral candidate, said Kell has led several delegations to lobby 
Navy brass in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell, 65, will admit he's more comfortable in back rooms, behind the scenes. 
He learned politics as a boy growing up in North Dakota, where he saw his 
paternal grandfather (a Republican) defeat his maternal grandfather (a 
Democrat) for a seat in the state House of Representatives. After moving to 
Long Beach in 1953, he waged six successful campaigns for council and mayor, 
building a strong support base. He believes that support will carry him into 
office again. 
</P>
<P>
 He recites a list of achievements during his tenure: The $111-million 
Convention Center expansion; two new police substations, and expansion of the 
police force. At his urging, a curfew on teen-agers was revived in January, 
which he predicts will reduce crime dramatically. The City Council is 
considering a Kell proposal to fine parents whose children violate the curfew. 
Kell prefers to talk about what he and most of his challengers agree are the 
key issues in this campaign: crime and jobs. He said he wants to continue 
adding officers and reservists to the police force. He also says he will 
continue to push ahead with plans to convert the site of the closed Naval 
hospital on the Eastside into a huge discount shopping center and develop the 
city's waterfront into a major tourist attraction, projects that he estimates 
would create thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 At neighborhood forums across the city, most of the candidates -- squeezed 
shoulder to shoulder in metal folding chairs -- -- begin and end their 
two-minute messages with a promise to hire more police. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg and O'Neill pledge to put 100 and 150 more officers on the streets, 
respectively. Both agree the new salaries could be paid for by privatizing some 
city services, such as the city's janitorial services or the police helicopter 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonna favors tripling the number of volunteer reserve officers. He also 
wants to move the downtown police headquarters into the city's center -- a plot 
of city-owned land virtually surrounded by Signal Hill -- and introduce mobile 
substations into the most crime-ridden neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski puts his emphasis on funding more gang intervention and youth 
recreation programs, but also advocates an increase in the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Perennial candidate Thomas (Ski) Demski, a Santa Claus look-alike, would pay 
for additional officers by selling the Queen Mary, which he describes as a 
costly albatross around the city's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that more police are the answer to crime, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "History has proven you only make problems worse with more oppression," said 
candidate Lee Chauser, a Marxist and high school English teacher. "It's like 
throwing gasoline on a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 G. Juan Johnson, an Amtrak employee, favors more counseling for the homeless 
and impoverished residents who might commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chauser and others stress jobs as one answer to reducing crime. El Nora 
Willingham, a self-employed motivational specialist, would create marketing 
councils to welcome new business; 20-year-old "youth candidate" Terry J. 
Stidom, a Long Beach City College student, would lower business permit fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Westerland, who headed the city's Redevelopment Agency board for 6 1/2 
years, criticizes Kell and City Hall for stifling new business. He would reduce 
the number of permits required for business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most government people don't have a ghost of an idea of what the business 
person needs," said Westerland, a former minister who runs Family Service of 
Long Beach, a counseling agency. "I'm talking about changing the culture at 
City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Rosenberg, a retired teacher and longtime council critic, wants to 
eliminate several city commissions to free up funds for city services. 
</P>
<P>
 While the candidates seem passionate about these issues as they campaign at 
chicken-dinner fund-raisers and walk door to door, some political insiders 
complain that most are trudging a well-worn path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one candidate has come up with a new or fresh approach to government," 
said Jeff Adler, a veteran of several Long Beach campaigns -- including Kell's 
two previous mayoral bids. "I don't think you've heard one big idea. Everyone 
wants to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the candidates are scrambling to put their names before the voters -- 
often repeating the same stump speeches at forums night after night -- they 
reveal little about their personal histories and motivations. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Ronnie Barnes. An ordained deacon in a small church and a legal 
investigator who runs his business from home, he has eight children to support. 
Yet he plans to spend $5,000 to $10,000 of his own money to convince voters 
that God intends him to be the next mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proclaiming victory now," Barnes said. "I can do that because I am 
obedient to my creator." 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski grew up on the rough side of the tracks. Born on Chicago's South 
Side, he lived in East Los Angeles, Compton and North Long Beach, along the way 
acquiring a tattoo that graces the middle finger of his right hand -- a crude 
bluish dot to show others he was protected by buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, Grabinski said, he found opportunities waiting. He opened three 
restaurants and won a seat on the City Council after playing a key role in a 
neighborhood group's fight to block a refinery in the Wrigley district. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly O'Neill grew up in another working-class neighborhood in central Long 
Beach. Her mother worked in a laundry. O'Neill helped out by working at the 
local J.C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
 She enrolled at Long Beach City College and, four decades later, became the 
school's president. After retiring last June, friends convinced O'Neill she 
could repeat her success in the role of mayor. 
</P>

 For Colonna, leadership is an old dream. In high school he says he was the 
"short, fat kid in horn-rimmed glasses and a buzz cut." But even then, when 
girls danced with him only out of sympathy, he says, he had this future mapped 
out: a successful business, a family, and then, when the time was right, he 
would step forward to lead. The role model of his dreams is apparent in the 
large, framed photograph of John F. Kennedy hanging in his campaign office.

 Kellogg, a six-year member of the council and vice president of a commercial 
real estate brokerage firm, is the youngest in a family of success stories. One 
brother is a U.S. Army general stationed in Europe, another played football for 
the Denver Broncos and a sister is a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Kell bristles at the mention of someone new moving into his 14th 
floor City Hall office that overlooks a downtown skyline he helped shape. He 
dismisses claims that he is vulnerable to anti-incumbent sentiment or wealthy 
challengers. Four years ago, he beat five other hopefuls in the primary, then 
slipped past Councilman Tom Clark by 670 votes to win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The resilient mayor, who has sat on the council nearly 20 years, says he needs 
another term to finish his work on the Naval hospital project and other 
redevelopment plans beyond downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the one who started the job, I should be the one to finish," Kell said of 
the Convention Center expansion and other projects initiated during his tenure. 
"There's something to be said for experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Kell says it's easy for challengers to point their fingers at a sitting mayor, 
but questions whether they have offered innovative ideas to address crime, 
joblessness and other key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to throw the criticism of him back at his challengers, Kell asks:

5 MAYORAL CANDIDATES EXCEED $100,000 IN THE RACE FOR CASH 
</P>

<P>
 Five Long Beach mayoral candidates had raised more than $100,000 each for 
their campaigns by late last month, and a sixth contender was nearing that 
figure, according to campaign disclosure documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Frank Colonna led the pack in fund-raising and spending.He had 
raised $199,907 and spent $121,984 through Feb. 26, the end of the last 
reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates who had raised more than $100,000 were Mayor Ernie Kell, 
Jeffrey Kellogg, Beverly O'Neill and Don Westerland. Ray Grabinski had raised 
$98,599. 
</P>
<P>
 The other seven candidates are operating on a shoestring, or with no campaign 
budget at all. Lee Chauser said he has spent less than $100, and Dan Rosenberg 
has vowed not to accept or spend money.  
</P>
<P>
 The modestly funded candidates refer to themselves as "The Long Beach 7," and 
complain they haven't received as much attention as the six adversaries with 
larger war chests. "If money is such a big issue, why don't we pick the person 
who has the most and skip the election?" asked challenger G. Juan Johnson, who 
expects to spend less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has filed a lawsuit seeking damages against the Long Beach Junior 
Chamber of Commerce, which invited six candidates considered the front-runners 
to a forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the organization, Joe Ponepinto, declined comment because of 
the pending lawsuit. EMILY ADAMS and DUKE HELFAND

STAGE REVIEW; LA MIRADA'S 'CAMELOT' HAS TROUBLE WITHSTANDING THE TEST OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Camelot," currently at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, is 
sufficiently audience-friendly, conveying a poignant King Arthur, a Clark 
Kent-like Lancelot, and snatches of pageantry mixed with lowbrow comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even an English sheep dog that appears to have wandered in from a 
production of "Annie." 
</P>
<P>
 The production, kicking off the 41st season of the Whittier-La Mirada Musical 
Theatre Assn., is a lush fairy tale enchanting enough to convey the political 
idealism behind Camelot's application to a whole American presidency. With 
happy timing for John F. Kennedy, this tale of a lovable, visionary king 
premiered on Broadway a month after his 1960 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show hasn't entirely withstood the march of time. Then, as now, it's a 
mishmash of styles, striving to be too many things and reach into too many 
genres (comedy, pageantry, romance). 
</P>
<P>
 What holds the show afloat is its chivalrous idea of a Knightly Round Table 
(it is never actually dramatized) and lilting Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick 
Lowe songs such as "If Ever I Would Leave You" (about love's constancy). The 
meditative "How to Handle a Woman," is touchingly rendered by company veteran 
George Champion as King Arthur, and impressively accompanied by a formally 
attired 23-member pit orchestra under the baton of musical director Gary 
Gothold. 
</P>
<P>
 The casting, a combination of amateur performers and Equity guest artists, is 
vocally and dramatically appealing. Janine L. Benson plays Queen Guinevere, who 
is helplessly in love with knight Lancelot, a ramrod stiff, thankless role 
sturdily played by Jeff Weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Also diverting is Hank Wilson's crusty Pellinore, a stock royal hanger-on and 
bushy-browed jester who wanders onstage with the sheep dog, called Horrid -- 
strictly a crowd pleaser. You can be sure there was no dog in the Richard 
Burton-Julie Andrews Broadway original. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest supporting performance is delivered by David O'Shea's dangerous 
villain Mordred, King Arthur's bastard son. He rats on the queen's secret 
affair with Lancelot and precipitates the concluding clash of arms, offstage. 
</P>
<P>
 As King Arthur, Champion mirrors grace, luminosity, hope and, finally, a 
classy king who discovers his queen's indiscretion but opts to grin and bear it 
for the sake of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on T.H. White's book, "The Once and Future King," "Camelot" tends to be 
all spectacle without much movement. It's a writer's show, not a dancer's show. 
Even the battlefield finale goes undramatized. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge painted background scrims (uncredited) are moodily evocative of great 
English myth while the costumes (also uncredited, meaning they were rented) 
fall into orthodox realism. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenly felt is King Arthur's fade-out as he knights the earnest 13-year old 
Gabriel Kalomas in the pre-dawn of battle and sings the undying words, "Don't 
let it be forgot/that once there was a spot/for one brief shining moment/that 
was known as Camelot. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 One quibble, at least for patrons down front: The actors are body-miked, and 
electrical cords were visible curling under their ears and down their necks -- 
an off-putting anachronism if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>

 SPEED RACER 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Granville makes his outdoor track debut for Bell Gardens High this 
afternoon in the Lancers' Almont League meet at San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore set his second indoor national record in the National 
Interscholastic Indoor track and field championships March 12 in the Carrier 
Dome in Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, 16, won the 800 meters in 1 minute 51.11 seconds to smash the 
6-year-old record of 1:54.28 held by Steve Adderly of Del Ray Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet record was less than a second off the all-time high school record of 
1:50.7 and ranks as the third-fastest ever. For his performance, Granville was 
selected as the boys' outstanding performer of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some pretty steep competition and I didn't know what to expect," 
Granville said. "I got fired up drawing off all the energy." 
</P>
<P>
 The record was the latest in a long list of accomplishments for Granville, who 
placed third in the 400 meters at the 1993 state meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena Feb. 19, Granville ran 57.7 to 
set the national sophomore 500-yard record. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville also set the national freshman indoor record at 500 yards (1:00.01), 
the national freshman 800-meter record (1:51.03) and the state freshman 
400-meter record (47.24). 
</P>
<P>
 "Why have one piece of cake when you can have them all," Granville said. "I'm 
proud of all the records. I'm using the indoor races as a steppingstone to 
better myself. I think this is going to be a pretty good year." MARCH MADNESS 
</P>
<P>
 The Lynwood High girls' basketball team has won a State Division I title, two 
Southern Section I titles and 63 of 65 games the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-time San Gabriel Valley League champions, though, were unable to add 
another state championship to the list Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum, losing 
to Sacred Heart Prep of Atherton, 59-53, in the Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators (38-0), who won the State Division V title in 1993, won its 75th 
game in a row and set a CIF record for most wins in a season. Lynwood, whose 
only other loss was to Brea Olinda -- the top-ranked team in the nation by USA 
today -- finished 32-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Timicha Kirby had 18 points and 11 rebounds for Lynwood. Tawana Grimes and 
Monique Matthews scored nine and eight points each. SERIES RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Long Beach baseball set a three-game series home attendance 
record at Blair Field last weekend against visiting Wichita State. 
</P>
<P>
 The series against the 1993 NCAA runner-up drew 3,895 fans and nearly doubled 
the previous record of 1,609 set against Florida in 1993. Sunday's game alone 
attracted 1,287 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-ranked 49ers (18-5) weren't as successful on the field, losing its 
first series of the season against the No. 8 Shockers (11-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Liefer drove in five runs, four coming on a grand slam, to lift Long 
Beach to a 7-1 victory in the opener. The 49ers, though, suffered 4-1 and 9-4 
defeats to the Shockers on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which rallied to defeat Cal State Northridge, 5-4, in a 
nonconference game Tuesday on a 10th-inning home run by Nate Vopata, will open 
Big West play at Nevada for a three-game series beginning Friday. HOOKED ON 
CLASSICS 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Pando and Brooke Mabe were victorious in 3,000 and 5,000 meters in 
10:06.14 and 17:47.55, and Jennifer Kump won the high jump at 5-foot-1 to lead 
the Long Beach State women to a third-place finish in the seven-team Collegiate 
Classic at home on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge won with 97 points followed by San Diego State and Long 
Beach with 63 and 43 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Barragan won his specialty in 10.46 and placed second in the 200 in 
21.20 for the Long Beach, which placed fifth in the men's competition won by 
Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 Barragan, a sophomore clocked a school-record 10.38 in the 100 against Cal 
State Los Angeles and host USC March 5 to provisionally qualify for the NCAA 
championships. The mark eclipsed the previous record of 10.48 set by Anthony 
Ford in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers have also qualified 13 athletes in 18 events for the Big West 
Conference championship May 13-14 at New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Barragan, the qualifying men include Adam Herndon (800, 
1:54.10); Jason Hinkin (pole vault, 15-6); Patrick Scott (long jump and triple 
jump, 24-9 and 48-3 1/2); Geoffry Vaughn (long jump, 23-8) and Hector Sanchez 
(193-4) and Bill Mell (193-8) in the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
 Pando and Le'Grita Hinds, who have qualified in four and three events each, 
head a contingent of six women who have attained conference championship 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Pando has qualified in the 800 (2:16.68), 1,500 (4:42.29), 3,000 (9:52.84) and 
5,000 (18:06.9). Hinds has attained marks in the in the 100 hurdles (13.8), 400 
(57.7), 400 hurdles (1:04.95). 
</P>
<P>
 The other 49ers are Lisa Bower in the 1,500 (4:45.30) and 3,000 (10:31.97); 
Mabe in the 3,000 (9:59.33) and 5,000; Laite Pale in the shotput (41-1 3/4) and 
discus (141-11) and Lisa Moxley in the 100 (12.1) and 100 hurdles (14.6).

EDUCATION: WEIGHING MERITS OF STATE MATH TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California State Department of Education recently released the results of 
the 1993 California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) test (Times, March 10). 
The overall results of the mathematics section were reported as dismal, with 
70% of the students statewide scoring in the lowest (1-2) range. The more 
detailed report provided by the state contains some information that makes 
these results suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 First, of all the fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grade gifted students assessed in 
the state of California, not even 1% could score a 6, the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, groups of eighth-grade students who were able to score at the highest 
levels on the State Department of Education's Golden State Exam in algebra were 
apparently unable to earn a 6 on CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, groups of 10th-graders who scored well on the State Department of 
Education's Golden State Exam in algebra and the Golden State Exam in geometry, 
and who scored well in mathematics on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test 
(PSAT), were unable to score 6 on the mathematics section of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, elementary schools that scored at grade level or above on the 
mathematics section of the California Achievement Test (by the same publisher, 
CTB/Mc Graw Hill) scored mainly in the 1-2 range of the CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth, the time students spent on homework in mathematics showed little 
relationship to CLAS mathematics performance. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these discrepancies should raise serious questions about the 
mathematics section of the CLAS. Most of us remember (not too fondly) certain 
instructors who devised "killer" tests that were not necessarily valid measures 
of student learning. Is the mathematics section of CLAS such a test? 
</P>
<P>
 I believe it is the responsibility of the California Department of Education 
and its test publisher to prove, not just state, that this assessment is an 
accurate measure of student achievement and reflects an effective expenditure 
of millions of taxpayers' dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators encourage valid, meaningful evaluation of student progress and the 
effectiveness of the schools. Is the mathematics section of CLAS such a 
measure?

MOBIL SEEKS $2-MILLION TAX REFUND IN CITY SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mobil Oil has sued the city of Torrance, asking for a refund of $2.2 million 
in city taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say Mobil owes the city $1.2 million more on the purchase and 
transport of natural gas for the Torrance refinery and $500,000 in penalties 
and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began with an audit of utility taxes paid on the natural gas piped 
into the refinery between Jan. 1, 1990, and July 30, 1993. The city hired 
Municipal Resource Consultants in 1992 to review Mobil's records. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the review of the records that Mobil discovered it was due a 
refund, said company spokesman Barry Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
 In its lawsuit, Mobil claims that natural gas for the refinery was purchased 
from an entity other than a gas public utility, and therefore should be exempt 
from tax under Torrance law.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously to assess the tax and penalties at a March 
1 public hearing.

DESIGN: FINDING BEST ARBITERS OF STREET'S IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do a church and a martial arts supply store have in common? They occupy 
major floor space on Bellflower Boulevard, and therefore will have a 
preponderant voice in helping to determine the new look of the street in 
conjunction with design guidelines for downtown being discussed this month. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pity that the most important issue affecting Bellflower in a generation 
will be left to merchants who allowed a black and white checkerboard storefront 
indefinitely.Worse yet, City Hall can't come up with a suitable image. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone has the right to decide, it should be a select group of businessmen 
who have been planted downtown since 1967 when the community actually profited 
from its commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. I suggest someone 
take into account who's painting the picture. There's a world of difference 
between a Monet and a Dali.

MALAYSIAN CENSORS MOVE TO BAN 'LIST'; MOVIES: GOVERNMENT BODY IN MUSLIM NATION 
CALLS SPIELBERG'S HOLOCAUST FILM 'PROPAGANDA.' JEWISH GROUPS ARE OUTRAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Steven Spielberg's movie "Schindler's List" may have won seven Academy Awards, 
but the film has been banned from being shown in the Muslim nation of Malaysia, 
provoking outrage among Jewish groups around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 United International Pictures, the film's distributor overseas, Wednesday 
released a letter from the Malaysian board of film censors that said the film 
reflects "the privilege and the virtues of a certain race only." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which was written in the Malay language and translated by the 
company, called the movie "propaganda with the purpose of asking for sympathy 
as well as to tarnish the other race." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's film, which was named best picture at Monday's Academy Awards, is 
the World War II story of a Gentile businessman who saves more than 1,000 Jews 
from being sent to Nazi extermination camps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The government's film censor, Zainun Bin Saleh, said that Malaysian 
regulations required 25 deletions involving "scenes of sex, cruelty, horror and 
obscene dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Williams-Jones, the president of United International, said in a 
telephone interview from London that he found the Malaysian decision shocking. 
"The reasons given were very, very troubling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pollock, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture Group, said of the Malaysian 
ban that "we don't believe in censorship in any territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollock said that films "get banned all the time" but rarely on the kind of 
grounds cited by the Malaysians. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia, a nation of 18 million people, is about 60% Muslim. The government 
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed has been an especially outspoken critic of 
Israel and Zionism. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban provoked an immediate outcry from Jewish groups stretching from Los 
Angeles to Australia. The American Jewish Committee described the decision as a 
"shock and an outrage." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are saddened but not surprised by this deplorable decision, which is in 
keeping with the longstanding anti-Semitism expressed by the prime minister of 
the country," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal 
Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said that Mahathir served as an example of "anti-Semitism without Jews" 
because only a handful of Jews live in Malaysia. "For years now, the Jewish 
people and Judaism have been vilified by his bigotry," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Wednesday about whether he approved the banning of the film, Mahathir 
said he wasn't familiar with the specific details of the case. But he added, 
"It is our right to ban any film in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment on allegations that he is an anti-Semite, Mahathir replied, 
"I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Zionist expansionism and conquest of Arab 
territories by the Zionists," he said. Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said 
later Wednesday the ban would be reviewed. "It was the view of the censorship 
board and I think some of us will have to take it up. I don't think that is the 
final decision," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the nations of Southeast Asia, even including such free-wheeling 
countries as Thailand, impose film censorship in some form. Explicit sex and 
extreme violence are either chopped out, or films are banned outright. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Philippines initially refused to allow "Schindler's List" to be 
shown without deletions of bare breasts and a scene showing a couple making 
love. Spielberg refused to permit deletions in the film, and it was going to be 
withdrawn until President Fidel Ramos overruled the censorship board and 
ordered it released. It is showing to capacity audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, has yet to decide whether to 
allow the film to be shown. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore, which also imposes strict censorship, is showing the film uncut, 
though it has an adults-only rating because of the sex scenes. Singaporeans 
appealed in the press Wednesday for the age to be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
 A Malaysian newspaper, Utusan Malaysia, published a column under a pseudonym 
in which the author urged the government to reverse its decision and permit the 
film to be shown. 
</P>
<P>
 The columnist argued that what happened to the Jews under the Nazis is 
"currently happening to Muslims in Bosnia," and therefore the Malaysian people 
should have a chance to see what "ethnic cleansing" is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 United International said the company has appealed the ban and a hearing will 
be held on April 12. Company officials said that a number of films had been 
banned in Malaysia in the past for sexual content or graphic violence, and that 
the company had withdrawn others rather than submit them to extensive editing. 
</P>
<P>
 The company added that "Schindler's List" is currently drawing capacity 
audiences in Turkey, another Muslim country, but said it has not submitted the 
movie to Persian Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

PROMISED LAND TO LAND OF PROMISE; MATTI CASPI, ONE OF ISRAELI POP'S SEMINAL 
FIGURES, FINDS A NEW LIFE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON TEITELBAUM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The modest ad in a local Hebrew language weekly announced the impending 
arrival of one Matti Caspi, singer, producer, composer and arranger. As of Jan. 
20, it said, Caspi would be available for private and group lessons in piano, 
guitar, voice and acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
 Noam Niv, a Tarzana resident and onetime Israeli impresario, read the notice 
with incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't be him," Niv said. "It's as if you were living in some backwater 
suburb of Tel Aviv, and you saw an ad saying that Elton John was available to 
teach songwriting." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet there he is. Matti Caspi, easily the most seminal figure in 25 years 
of Israeli pop history, turned up in Los Angeles three days after the 
Northridge temblor sent lesser stalwarts scurrying across the continent for 
solid footing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the man who spent several weeks during the 1973 Yom Kippur War at the 
front performing with Leonard Cohen -- and whose work has been covered by such 
disparate talents as Herb Alpert and Petula Clark -- hopes to open a modest 
conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to deft advance work by a handful of local friends, things already 
appear to be popping for this doleful and doe-eyed Hebrew vocalist. Caspi's 
concert schedule in North America is booked for the next six months. Friends 
are trying to involve him in an Israeli Consulate-sponsored benefit concert for 
victims of the Jan. 17 shaker.  
</P>
<P>
 Caspi, meanwhile, has been looking into composing a joint paean to Middle East 
peace with a top-flight American performer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We waited 50 years for the Handshake," he said. "But sometimes a handshake 
can only bring a handshake. Creating understanding and reconciliation between 
people is something else. I want to write a song that lets both sides to the 
Arab-Israeli conflict see themselves as winners, not as victims." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If he were prone to self-pity, Caspi might tell stories about his own recent 
victimization. He fled his native country seven months ago after professional 
and marital difficulties fueled a feeding frenzy within the voracious Israeli 
press. Distastefully, he acknowledges the role those difficulties played in his 
departure. But also at play here, he says, is the wanderlust that afflicts so 
many Israelis at a younger age, generally after they've completed three or four 
years of army service. 
</P>
<P>
 Caspi didn't traipse off to Nepal or Australia after his tour of duty with the 
Israel Defense Forces Southern Command Entertainment Troupe. By the time he 
demobilized, he says, he had already become ensconced in the Israeli music 
scene.  
</P>
<P>
 "But now it's my turn to throw on a backpack," Caspi insists.  
</P>
<P>
 Although he stayed put after leaving the army, Caspi learned how easy it was 
to fall out of favor in a market he readily characterizes as "provincial." 
Unlike a pantheon of Israeli performers whose names have almost completely 
receded from memory, Caspi paced himself. Working with acclaimed pop lyricist 
Ehud Manor, he released albums roughly once every three years. He deliberately 
refrained from becoming a fixture on Israel's sole TV channel.  
</P>
<P>
 Caspi never achieved the raging popularity of some of his airwave-saturating 
colleagues. But he had staying power. His craft influenced virtually everyone 
who came later, if only by inspiring rebellion.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Caspi who, late in the '70s, triggered a sustained Israeli rage for 
Brazilian music with a radio show of artists, including himself, who performed 
translated tunes. The radio program spun off into a best-selling stage show, 
tour and two top-selling records. He did something similar for Gypsy music 
when, much later, he produced a best-selling collection of Hebraized Romany 
pieces by another artist. Caspi's wizardry at staging unlikely comebacks 
garnered further currency after he returned another Los Angeles exile, female 
pop vocalist Ricki Gal, to the Israeli limelight.  
</P>
<P>
 Caspi also made a bid to become his country's answer to Canadian children's 
performer Raffi. He wrote, produced and performed in a stylish, expensive and 
critically acclaimed video collection, "Boobah Matti" -- "Matti the Doll."  
</P>
<P>
 Caspi hopes to further his work with children here by teaching music. Already, 
his calendar has been filled up by the children of Israeli emigres whose 
parents could not believe their own good fortune at finding someone of his 
caliber to teach piano and guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer teaching children," he says. "It's always more fun to teach someone 
who doesn't know anything." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, while the Intifada raged and front-ranking Israeli performers 
like Hava Alberstein, Shlomo Artzi and Nurit Galron began for the first time to 
engage in protest music, Ehud Manor declared that "with the exception of 
literature, pop music has become the most advanced art form in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Manor has long played Bernie Taupin to Caspi's Elton John. But Caspi does not 
share his partner's enthusiasm. The country is too young, Caspi says. The 
globalization brought on first by radio and TV and later by satellite 
broadcasts, MTV and digital sampling blew it out of the water before it could 
develop a distinctive sound.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is no Israeli music, and no such thing as an Israeli style," he says. 
"There are only Israeli musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure this is such a tragedy. Music is an international language. If 
you are competent and talented, you can contribute to it, wherever you come 
from and wherever you live."

ELVIS HAS LEFT THE RESUME; MOVIES: ALTHOUGH PRISCILLA PRESLEY KEEPS A HAND ON 
THE KING'S ESTATE, SHE'S FINDING HER OWN LIMELIGHT WITH THE 'NAKED GUN' 
COMEDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Priscilla Presley's life has been such a public drama revolving around her 
teen-age involvement and marriage to the out-of-control King of rock 'n' roll, 
that six years ago she was the last person you expected to see in a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV projects she had produced, an adaptation of her memoirs, "Elvis and 
Me," and "Elvis," a series about his life, seemed much more appropriate for 
rock 'n' roll's most famous widow, a role she's played despite their divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, though, she took a chance with comedy by co-starring as Jane Spencer, 
the sincere if hapless love interest of detective Frank Drebin, played by 
Leslie Nielsen, in the first "Naked Gun" film. Three years ago, there was 
"Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear." And now she is back as Jane in the third 
installment, "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult," which routed the competition 
at the box office in its opening weekend last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they told me they were doing a third one," she says in a sweet, even 
voice on a recent afternoon at a midtown Manhattan hotel, "I had to wonder, 
what's left to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 As fans of these intentionally broad, physical comedies know, though, there 
are always new silly things to do to the cast, and Presley has been pretty game 
about embarrassing herself -- by singing a particularly raucous off-key version 
of "The Way We Were," by clumsily falling down a flight of stairs. This time, 
she tries to seduce Frank (who is now her husband) by wearing a negligee 
emblazoned with what seem to be all the lights in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorite stunt, however, didn't make the final cut. "There's a scene where 
I'm angry and I throw my wedding ring at him," she says. "Then I do a couple of 
back flips across the room." She smiles. "I practiced like crazy! I can't 
believe they took those out." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what finally made it to the screen, Presley, 48, admits that 
this time she felt more comfortable doing the comedy; she was petrified the 
first time around, even a little mystified that she was cast. 
</P>
<P>
 To director David Zucker, that was one of the reasons he chose her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd done five years on 'Dallas,' but she'd never done a comedy," he says, 
"and if you have no expectations of people being funny, then the jokes are more 
of a surprise. Plus she seemed like she'd have good chemistry with Leslie. And 
there was a bit of glamour to the name. You always look for a little spin in 
casting." 
</P>
<P>
 Much to Zucker's surprise when he met her, she wasn't at all what he imagined. 
"She's so normal, so much like the girl next door," he says. "What she must 
have been through seems to have had no effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Presley had well-publicized difficulties as a single mom with her and Elvis' 
daughter, Lisa Marie, who is now 26. And she admits that life on her own was 
tough in the beginning. "I had to find myself, prove myself as a person," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She had to prove herself professionally as well, first as a co-host of the 
series "Those Amazing Animals" and then in "Dallas." With the exception of the 
"Naked Gun" films and the Andrew Dice Clay bomb "The Adventures of Ford 
Fairlane," however, she's been spending more of her time in the world of 
business, marketing two fragrances -- Moments and Experiences -- and 
soon-to-be-released clothing and skin-care lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Her skill as a businesswoman was called upon a few years after Elvis died, 
when she was co-executor of the Presley estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I fought it a little since I was trying to go on my own," she says. 
"But I've come to terms with it, out of respect to the family." And undoubtedly 
to her daughter's legacy. Her plans for the estate, including opening Graceland 
as a museum, multiplied the estate's value to more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Elvis-related activities have to be handled carefully, however, so as not 
to affront the current man in her life, Brazilian screenwriter-director Marco 
Garibaldi, with whom she has a son, Navarone, 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows it's part of the business. I have my office and that's it," she 
says. "It's a lot of juggling egos and sensitivities." 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that she immerses herself totally in family life when she's not 
working, including spending time with Lisa and Lisa's nearly 5-year-old 
daughter, Danielle, so close in age to Navarone that the two children regard 
each other as siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really great to have them so close in age, to raise them together," she 
says. "But Danielle looks so much like Lisa that sometimes I look at her and 
forget." She smiles. "For a second I feel like I've gone back to my past."

YES, YOU HAVE SEEN THE RINK IN 'D2' BEFORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "D2 The Mighty Ducks" gets to its climactic scenes, local hockey fans may 
find themselves doing a double take. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's big game, in which the Ducks square off against the imposing 
Icelandic team in an international tournament, was filmed at Anaheim Arena.The 
rink is home to the first-year National Hockey League team known as the Mighty 
Ducks, the Walt Disney Co.-owned franchise named after the company's 1992 
sleeper film hit about a misfit, overachieving crew of young skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "D2," opening Friday, is the sequel to that film. This time around, the young 
bunch is tapped to represent the United States in the Junior Goodwill Games and 
heads from its native Minnesota to Southern California -- only to be seduced by 
the local lifestyle, leaving coach Emilio Estevez to whip them back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 The production was filmed at Anaheim Arena for several days in July, drawing 
some 12,000 unpaid extras for one day of shooting when filmmakers needed a full 
crowd. The crew returned to re-shoot a few scenes in August, temporarily 
displacing the professional Mighty Ducks during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the Mighty Ducks -- the NHL team -- can hardly have missed the fact 
that the sequel is coming. A lengthy promotional trailer for the film has been 
a featured attraction at home games.

COUNTRY HIT 'INDIAN OUTLAW' HITS A NERVE; POP MUSIC: SOME NATIVE AMERICAN 
GROUPS SAY THE FAST-RISING SINGLE FROM TIM MCGRAW'S 'NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON' IS 
STEREOTYPICAL AND ASK STATIONS TO BAN IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tim McGraw's "Indian Outlaw" is the fastest-rising country single on the pop 
charts since Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky Heart" in 1992, but not everyone is 
celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Two country radio stations in Minneapolis are refusing to play the song after 
complaints that some of the lyrics are offensive to Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People up here are really upset," says WaBun-Inini, president of the 
Minneapolis-based National Coalition of Racism in Sports and the Media and a 
national representative for the American Indian Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition has also been active in the protests against the Atlanta Braves' 
fans' "tomahawk chop" gesture and the use of Native American characters for 
sports team mascots, such as the Washington Redskins and the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheap Hollywood music like the tomahawk-chop chant or the old Hamms beer 
song," WaBun-Inini says of the McGraw hit. "They got by with that then, but 
they won't now." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is one of several Native American groups that has officially 
protested the song and called for radio stations to stop playing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our most-requested song, but we're not in the business to irritate 
people," says Bob Wood, program director of Minneapolis' WBOB-FM, which stopped 
airing the song this week at the request of WaBun-Inini, a Chippewa who is also 
known as Vernon Bellecourt.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Mr. Bellecourt sent us a letter nicely explaining his feelings about the 
song," Wood continues, "we decided to take it off the air." 
</P>
<P>
 At Orange County country station KIK-FM (94.3), program director Craig Powers 
said it has been heavily requested by listeners. "It's good pure pop country 
music, just like Brooks & Dunn. . . . It's a novelty record not meant to be 
taken seriously. It's a fun record that puts a smile on your face." 
</P>
<P>
 But he predicts its popularity, and the controversy, will wane as quickly as 
they have risen. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone from an Indian organization called me and was angry that we were 
playing it," Powers said, "I'd be glad to sit down with them. But by that time, 
the record will be over with." 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, a Louisiana native who lives in Nashville, is a bit flustered by all 
the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're concerned any time somebody doesn't like something you do, but you're 
never going to please everybody," says McGraw, 26. "A lot of times a song or 
something like the 'tomahawk chop' isn't the real issue, but a means to an ends 
(for the protesters), a way to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 The single, written by Tommy Barnes and Gene Simmons, was released in early 
February and has climbed rapidly up both the country and pop charts, last week 
moving from No. 28 to No. 19 on the Billboard pop chart. It is featured on 
McGraw's second album, "Not a Moment Too Soon," released this week by Curb 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The song, ostensibly a light-hearted character study, utilizes a laundry list 
of media-created stereotypes about Native Americans and the kind of 
pseudo-tribal beat and melodies associated with old movie Westerns. It contains 
such lines as "You can find me in my wigwam/I'll be beating on my tom-tom," and 
also incorporates the chorus of "Indian Reservation," a 1971 pop hit written by 
John D. Loudermilk and recorded by Paul Revere & the Raiders (that song's 
subtitle, ironically, is "The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian"). 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw met with protesters at a recent Tulsa concert but declined their 
request that he stop performing the song.  
</P>

COUNTRY HIT 'INDIAN OUTLAW' HITS A NERVE; POP MUSIC: SOME NATIVE AMERICAN 
GROUPS SAY THE FAST-RISING SINGLE FROM TIM MCGRAW'S 'NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON' IS 
STEREOTYPICAL AND ASK STATIONS TO BAN IT.

 Tim McGraw's "Indian Outlaw" is the fastest-rising country single on the pop 
charts since Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky Heart" in 1992, but not everyone is 
celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Two country radio stations in Minneapolis are refusing to play the song after 
complaints that some of the lyrics are offensive to Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People up here are really upset," says WaBun-Inini, president of the 
Minneapolis-based National Coalition of Racism in Sports and the Media and a 
national representative for the American Indian Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition has also been active in the protests against the Atlanta Braves' 
fans' "tomahawk-chop" gesture and the use of Native American characters for 
sports team mascots, such as the Washington Redskins and the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheap Hollywood music like the tomahawk-chop chant or the old Hamms beer 
song," WaBun-Inini says of the McGraw hit. "They got by with that then, but 
they won't now." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is one of several Native American groups that has officially 
protested the song and called for radio stations to stop playing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our most-requested song, but we're not in the business to irritate 
people," says Bob Wood, program director of Minneapolis' WBOB-FM, which stopped 
airing the song this week at the request of WaBun-Inini, a Chippewa who is also 
known as Vernon Bellecourt.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Mr. Bellecourt sent us a letter nicely explaining his feelings about the 
song," Wood continues, "we decided to take it off the air." 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, a Louisiana native who lives in Nashville, is a bit flustered by all 
the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're concerned any time somebody doesn't like something you do, but you're 
never going to please everybody," says McGraw, 26. "A lot of times a song or 
something like the 'tomahawk chop' isn't the real issue, but a means to an ends 
(for the protesters), a way to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 The single, written by Tommy Barnes and Gene Simmons, was released in early 
February and has climbed rapidly up both the country and pop charts, last week 
moving from No. 28 to No. 19 on the Billboard magazine pop chart. It is 
featured on McGraw's second album, "Not a Moment Too Soon," released this week 
by Curb Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The song, ostensibly a light-hearted character study, utilizes a laundry list 
of media-created stereotypes about Native Americans and the kind of 
pseudo-tribal beat and melodies associated with old movie Westerns. It contains 
such lines as "You can find me in my wigwam/I'll be beating on my tom-tom," and 
also incorporates the chorus of "Indian Reservation," a 1971 pop hit written by 
John D. Loudermilk and recorded by Paul Revere & the Raiders (that song's 
subtitle, ironically, is "The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian"). 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw met with protesters at a recent Tulsa concert, but declined their 
request that he stop performing the song.  
</P>
<P>
 Program directors at Los Angeles country station KZLA-FM and Orange County's 
KIK-FM say that they have not received any calls or letters protesting the 
song, but that they would be sensitive to any objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty much a novelty record and a lot of people want to hear it," says 
KZLA's R.J. Curtis. "But listening to the song I see that (the protesters) have 
a legitimate beef. It's very stereotypical." 
</P>
<P>
 KIK's Craig Powers, too, says he would be happy to consider any objections to 
the song, but that it could be a moot point because the novelty nature of the 
hit means it will probably have a short-lived popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 John Brown, vice president of promotion for Curb Records in Nashville, says 
that even among Native Americans opinions are split on the song. While he's 
been receptive to protest letters from WaBun-Inini and from Wilma Mankiller, 
principal chief of the Oklahoma Cherokee, McGraw has also received a letter of 
support from Gerard Parker, vice chief of the North Carolina-based Eastern Band 
of Cherokee Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on who you're speaking with," Brown says. "And it's a pretty 
minimal amount of complaints versus the Native Americans we know who are 
attending Tim's shows and buying the record."  
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he would object to a song portraying Louisianians as ignorant 
rednecks, McGraw replied, "It happens in country music every day. I understand

THE AHMANSON TAKES A MORE ADVENTUROUS PATH; THEATER: NEW SEASON HAS U.S. 
PREMIERE OF A DAVID HARE PLAY, A NEW MUSICAL, AN ADAPTATION OF 'THE WOMAN 
WARRIOR,' A NEIL SIMON HIT AND 'MISS SAIGON.'

<P>
 After a year of presenting only established Broadway shows, the Ahmanson 
Theatre's 1994-95 season will take a more adventurous approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The American premiere of a David Hare play, a new musical revue devoted to the 
work of Los Angeles-based songwriters Leiber and Stoller, and a stage 
adaptation of Maxine Hong Kingston's "The Woman Warrior" will join Neil Simon's 
latest Broadway hit and the already announced "Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
 The first production on the list, Hare's 1990 play "Racing Demon," is being 
offered as a preseason bonus for three weeks only, Oct. 5-23, as part of a 
citywide UK/LA Festival. The production is from the Royal National Theatre 
Company, directed by Richard Eyre, and will feature Oliver Ford Davies and 
Michael Bryant, who won Olivier Awards for their performances in London. The 
play examines tensions between a skeptical vicar and an evangelical young 
curate in an urban parish of the Church of England. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Celebration of the Songs of Leiber and Stoller" will arrive at the 
Doolittle for a Nov. 10-Jan. 22 run, following its premiere in Chicago. The 
focus of the tribute, songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, are known for 
such hits as "Spanish Harlem," "Jailhouse Rock," "Is That All There Is?" and 
"Stand by Me." Otis Sallid conceived and will direct and choreograph the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for "Miss Saigon," all of the shows will be presented at the Doolittle 
Theatre in Hollywood instead of the Ahmanson itself. The Ahmanson is currently 
being refurbished and won't reopen until the Jan. 17 preview of "Miss Saigon." 
The show officially opens Jan. 25 and continues through Oct. 25, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice during the mid-'80s, the Ahmanson's sister theater, the Mark Taper 
Forum, announced an adaptation of two Kingston books, "The Woman Warrior" and 
"China Men," under the title "The Woman Warrior." The project was twice set 
aside because of adaptation problems, Center Theatre Group producing director 
Gordon Davidson said. Last December, a new adaptation by Deborah Rogin was 
workshopped at the Taper's New Work Festival, and Rogin has licked the script's 
previous problems, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woman Warrior" will be a co-production with Martin Rosen, Berkeley Repertory 
Theatre and Huntington Theatre in Boston. Because director Sharon Ott is 
staging it first for the proscenium stage at Berkeley Rep, where she is the 
artistic director (followed by the Huntington), Davidson has changed his 
previous plan to present it on the Taper's thrust stage and moved it to the 
Doolittle's proscenium stage for a Feb. 16-April 23 run.  
</P>
<P>
 The season will conclude with Simon's Broadway hit about an early TV comedy 
series, "Laughter on the 23rd Floor," May 4-July 9, 1995.

CENTERPIECE: OUT ON A LIMB; MISTAKES ARE FORCING CITIES TO CUT DOWN MANY TREES 
IN THEIR PRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed with a chain saw, shredding machine and death warrant, a Ventura city 
work crew showed up at the Stoults' house recently and turned the curbside 
ficus tree into sawdust 'n' chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The towering tree was removed to free the sewer line from pythonesque roots 
that had persisted in backing up the Stoults' plumbing, even after being 
assaulted by $2,200 worth of Roto-Rooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking out their living-room window when the demolition was finished, Paul 
and Betty Stoult were saddened to see a hole in the view. The city-owned tree 
-- planted by the Public Works Department about 25 years ago -- was a stately 
specimen and one of the main reasons that the retired couple bought the house 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody ever told them that root problems had caused the demise of similar 
trees up and down the street, they said. But while Paul is philosophical about 
the loss of his neighborhood's urban forest -- calling it "one of those unlucky 
things that happen between a sewer and a tree," Betty is alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they take all the beautiful trees down, this neighborhood will be a mess," 
said Betty, 73. "Why couldn't they have planted a tree without big roots?" 
</P>
<P>
 They did. It's just that trees have this annoying habit of growing . 
</P>
<P>
 Once planted in the ground, a sapling that began life in a five-gallon 
container will develop a root system that mirrors its branch structure. The 
Stoults' tree, an Indian laurel, had a 40-foot-wide crown and flying-buttress 
roots that extended far into the earth. It should have been given plenty of 
space, but the city stuck it in the four-foot parkway between the front curb 
and the sidewalk, directly above the Stoults' sewer line, a mistake that 
inevitably doomed the tree and cost the Stoults their curb appeal, not to 
mention $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why'd they plant a tree like that over a sewer in the first place?" Betty 
Stoult wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, indeed? 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be going out on a limb to say that every city in the county has 
had a knack "for putting ridiculous trees in ridiculous places," said Jim 
Downer, a horticulturist at the University of California Cooperative Extension 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past half-century, thousands of city-planted trees have been cut down 
in their prime because they became intrusive, bothersome or a potential 
insurance liability, experts say. In Thousand Oaks, scores of Monterey pines 
that could not handle the arid climate were weakened by disease, attacked by 
pine bark beetles and taken out by the city. Simi Valley had to whack hundreds 
of ash trees because they damaged sidewalks. In Ventura, dozens of Indian 
laurels have been removed, mostly because of sewer problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistakes made 20 or 30 years ago are costing us now. Aside from affecting 
the resale value of a house, the removal of a large tree also depletes city 
coffers. The job can cost a city as much as $1,000 per tree, not counting 
sidewalk repair, said Dan Condon, city arborist in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor planning long ago is also causing cities to spend extra money today to 
keep problem trees from growing out of control or becoming dangerous. A city 
spends about $200 to prune a large tree, Condon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, the ubiquitous coral tree has grown into a maintenance 
nightmare. Camarillo, Oxnard and Santa Paula, like Ventura, are having problems 
with Indian laurels needing an inordinate amount of attention to prevent them 
from clogging sewers, buckling sidewalks and overrunning neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid destroying a tree, city crews -- along with private companies -- 
sometimes sever main roots to save a sidewalk, or they might top an unruly 
crown. But radical pruning mutilates a tree and often leads to its premature 
death, horticulturists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem trees, it seems, can be found throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's hardly a tree species in Southern California that hasn't been removed 
for heaving walks or causing problems with sewer lines," said Alden Kelley, a 
Fullerton arborist who champions the cause of threatened trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many residents, the trees that populate our streets and medians are 
probably from somewhere else. When the first Europeans journeyed across the 
county a few centuries ago, they saw a landscape blanketed by coastal and 
valley live oak -- the Conejo Valley was a solid oak woodland -- as well as 
sycamore and alder, but they didn't see Indian laurel, palm, eucalyptus, 
Monterey pine, pepper, coral, ash or any of the dozens of other foreign species 
now growing in our soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranching took a toll on native trees earlier this century -- untold numbers 
were removed to open up land for cattle grazing -- and thousands of oaks and 
sycamores were intentionally destroyed after World War II to make room for 
developments during the housing boom. In their place, cities planted 
fast-growing imports to fill in the barren scenery and provide homeowners with 
immediate gratification. Fed by garden sprinklers, a tree such as a eucalyptus 
could double in size in a year, creating a pleasing look but a potential 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take a eucalyptus tree that can survive in impossible drought conditions 
and put it on a residential street and give it a lot of water, it literally 
turns into a giant weed," said John Sevier, a San Diego eucalyptus expert. 
"Unless you're prepared to do a lot of maintenance on a regular basis, you have 
a time bomb on your hands -- your tree can blow over in a big wind or drop 
branches." 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, cities usually selected a tree based on its availability, without 
doing much research, if any. Not every tree would turn into a boondoggle, "but 
it's always risky to use new plant material because you don't always know what 
the future holds," said Jerry Revard, longtime arborist for the city of 
Ventura. "You take a plant from another part of the world and introduce it into 
our climate and soil, and the result is unpredictable. What's not a problem 
there could be a problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 No other tree is as troublesome as the Indian laurel, "our No. 1 concrete 
buster," Revard said. Native to India, the tree is one of 350 species of ficus, 
or fig tree. Size-wise, it is not quite in the same league as its cousin, the 
giant Moreton Bay fig (see related story), but it comes close. Left unchecked 
on city parkways, a mature Indian laurel will blot out the sun with a 
100-foot-wide canopy. If it avoids the executioner's chain saw, it can live 
more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian laurels should be trimmed every two or three years to keep them from 
erupting into giant specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't keep Indian laurels sheared, they grow to their natural size, 
and that is huge," said Santa Paula Public Works Director Norman Wilkinson, who 
blames "budget constraints" for hindering his city's ability to keep its Indian 
laurels from running wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian laurel was introduced into Ventura in the late '60s, "touted as a 
very good replacement for the citrus-tree look," Revard said. With smooth gray 
bark and a tangle of thigh-size limbs spiraling upward into a dark cloud of 
shiny oblong leaves, the tree stands as proud as any oak or maple in a 
picturesque Midwestern town. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike an oak or maple, however, the Indian laurel doesn't shed all its leaves 
in the fall -- it sheds them year-round, creating a perpetual autumn in front 
of your house. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Lynote lives on a Ventura street lined with mature Indian laurels, 
their gangly branches embracing rooftops. Almost every day if the wind is 
blowing, she has to rake the blizzard of leaves blown into her yard from Indian 
laurels across the street. Lynote, who has owned a home on this street for 25 
years, rejoices during Santa Anas, which reverse the flow of leaves, sending 
hers tumbling into neighbors' yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, this side of the street is getting a break, but when the wind 
changes, we'll be getting everybody's leaves," she said. "Keeping the yard 
cleared sure is a full-time job." 
</P>
<P>
 Along her street, unraked leaves turn brown and brittle, crunching beneath 
tires and shoes. Light rain doesn't penetrate the canopy, but a downpour will 
wash the leaves clean and saturate the leaf dust on the ground, creating 
something akin to wet sawdust that invariably gets tracked into the house. 
</P>
<P>
 But as maddening as the leaves are, it's the berries that can make a homeowner 
crazy. Once or twice a year, the pea-size berries will dribble much as faucet 
drips, day and night for a few weeks, mounding at the curb and peppering front 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 To June and Greg Gonzales, who own a duplex a few houses down from Lynote, the 
onslaught is oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides needing constant sweeping, those berries ruin the grass and are a 
pain to clean off your car," Greg Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents are unable to get the city to trim the overgrown trees -- 
it will be four years in August since they were last trimmed, according to the 
city -- they still have an abiding affection for the Indian laurels. "They sell 
the houses here," Lynote said. "Without them, this street would be nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian laurel is Santa Paula's signature tree, but it's on the verge of 
annihilation. In the late 1960s, 140 were planted along Main Street and other 
downtown streets. Liking the look, scores of homeowners planted their own 
laurels. But when the trees were about 12 years old, they underwent a sudden 
growth spurt, becoming overpowering and overbearing. Shop owners complain that 
branches camouflage store signs and that berries are tracked in by customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are messy, destructive, overgrown and, in general, highly unsatisfactory 
street trees," Wilkinson told the Santa Paula City Council two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after the city spent $21,000 to trim the trees, Wilkinson issued an 
ultimatum: If the trees continue to grow wild, they will be converted to 
firewood and mulch. "Nobody wants to see the trees go," he said. "They're a 
major part of downtown. But if they continue to be a nuisance, we won't be able 
to live with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme, however, has to live with its problem tree. About 15 years ago, 
the city decided that it needed a "theme tree" and planted 163 Kaffirboom coral 
trees on street corners and medians. A spectacular tree with orange-colored 
flowers, the corals turned out to be fast-growers with brittle limbs and large 
root systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trees were planted before anybody knew they'd be a problem," said Ken 
Cuilty, the city's landscape maintenance manager. "They're a really, really 
high-maintenance tree and are hard on curbs and sidewalks like the Indian 
laurel." 
</P>
<P>
 But the city is stuck with them. "We're too far along to change now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City arborists are always on the lookout for the perfect street tree. Current 
favorites around the county are the Canary Island pine, queen palm, New Zealand 
Christmas tree, Victorian box and Chinese pistache. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rule of thumb, said Ventura's Revard: "There is no such thing as the 
perfect tree. They all have advantages and disadvantages." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley, the Fullerton arborist, hopes that today's tree crop fares better than 
yesterday's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trees have been misused out of ignorance, stupidity and greed," Kelley said. 
"Considering the stress we put trees under, it's a marvel we have any left on 
the planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Meyers has a love-hate relationship with the Indian laurel in front of 
his house. Santa Paula Tree Is as Big as They Come 
</P>
<P>
 There may be a taller pine or a sycamore with longer limbs somewhere in the 
county, but no tree is bigger than Santa Paula's Moreton Bay fig tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The 115-year-old specimen stands 85 feet tall, has a 131-foot-wide canopy and 
a trunk with a 9-foot diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 Running a close second is Ventura's 120-year-old Moreton Bay fig at 73 1/2 
feet tall and 139 feet wide with an 8-foot, 8-inch trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county has these two elephantine trees to brag about, Santa Barbara 
has the mother of all Moreton Bay figs. Although only a mere 76 feet tall, the 
114-year-old tree has a 172-foot-wide canopy and a trunk with a 12 1/2-foot 
diameter. One Way to Clear the Line and Save a Tree 
</P>
<P>
 Tree roots don't breach sealed sewer lines, but old terra-cotta lines often 
develop leaks that roots zero in on like heat-seeking missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a tree finds a leaky line, it sends hair-like roots into the tiniest 
opening. Soon, life erupts inside the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 When McRooter's Mike Wilsey examined the four-inch clay line that had been 
invaded by Paul and Betty Stoults' Indian laurel, he found "a whole tree system 
in there, roots the size of my thumb and four or five feet long." 
</P>
<P>
 The tree was removed so that Wilsey could safely excavate beneath it to 
install a new sewer line. The Stoults say neither the city nor the plumber gave 
them an option to save the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Horticulturists, however, say techniques are available that might have solved 
or avoided the Stoults' problem without destroying the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1931, for instance, the town of Ridgewood, N. J., has successfully kept 
sewer lines from clogging with copper-sulfite flushes twice a year. The 
chemical kills the roots inside the sewer line but doesn't harm the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilsey is spending $20,000 for a Hydro Jet machine that blasts invasive roots 
with water delivered at 4,000 pounds of pressure per square foot. He hopes that 
the spray will wipe out stubborn roots better than blades. 
</P>
<P>
 But plumbers say neither chemicals nor high-tech Roto-Rooters are always 
effective solutions once the roots inside the pipe are allowed to get too 
large. Then the tree usually has to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think trees are beautiful," Wilsey said. "It's a shame to take them down."

 Discrimination suit -- The Times incorrectly reported last Friday that the 
Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University had settled a sex 
discrimination lawsuit in which it agreed to pay $900,000 to Dr. Heidi 
Weissmann.Montefiore Medical Center, where Weissmann was employed, is 
responsible for the settlement award, not the college. The college has an 
affiliation agreement with the hospital and Weissmann had unpaid faculty status 
at the medical school because of her employment with Montefiore. The article 
also misidentified hospital attorney Philip R. Forlenza as counsel for the 
college.
