 SITTING PRETTY: California Rideshare Week kicks off today, and transit 
officials are encouraging motorists to use the new "Smart Traveler" program as 
a way to share their space with fellow commuters. . . . Under the program, 
kiosks have been set up at 77 sites, including Simi Valley Hospital, The Oaks 
mall and the Thousand Oaks Library. . . . The touch-screen computerized service 
helps commuters scope out the best driving routes or get matched up with riders 
who are going their way. 
</P>
<P>
 SERRA SALUTE: Ventura is getting yet another statue of Junipero Serra, the 
Franciscan priest who founded California's missions. . . . The life-sized 
bronze cast is on the campus of Holy Cross School on Main Street. "We think 
it's a fitting addition to the downtown area," said Msgr. Patrick J. O'Brien, 
who will bless the statue in a ceremony Tuesday, the day of the feast of St. 
Francis of Assisi. . . . Serra's a candidate for sainthood, but his work has 
come under fire for causing the deaths of many Native Americans in the 18th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 FORWARD MOVE: It's an experimental program with a noble aim: crossing cultural 
lines and saving lives (B4). . . . Adelante ( forward in Spanish) was started 
by Ventura County sheriff's officials in Moorpark to explain law enforcement to 
recent Latino immigrants. Many have negative images of authority -- a holdover 
from their lives in other countries. "The government, to them, is not the good 
guys," Deputy Jerry Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 POLISH CONNECTION: A delegation of 21 Polish business executives arrives in 
Simi Valley this week to learn about effective decision-making, U. S.-style . . 
. Their leader will be John Cullen, a retired Cal Lutheran University business 
professor. Between daily seminars and speeches from local business leaders, the 
group will tour the usual Southern California sights: Disneyland, Universal 
Studios -- and a K mart near their hotel. "They love to shop," Cullen 
explained.

 Californians who register by Oct. 11 will be able to vote in the Nov. 8 
general election. We asked young immigrants and children of immigrants if 
they've registered, and if they plan to vote. ASMAT BININASHVILI 
</P>
<P>
 18, freshman, Santa Monica City College, emigrated from the former Soviet 
Union, became a citizen in 1989  
</P>
<P>
 I haven't had time to register. Maybe I'll do it in a week or two. But I 
really don't care about the gubernatorial election. Maybe for the presidential 
election I'll register. I became a citizen more as an economic decision than to 
vote. CARLEN LE 
</P>
<P>
 17, El Rancho High School, Pico Rivera, parents from Vietnam 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's important to register. I want to make a difference. If you 
complain that the government isn't doing anything and you didn't vote, you 
shouldn't complain. My parents are from Vietnam but now they are citizens. They 
say we are the future. I think it's important to be aware now and later on make 
a difference in other people's lives. NATALIE RODRIGUEZ 
</P>
<P>
 17, senior, San Pedro High School, parents from Argentina 
</P>
<P>
 I want to register, mainly out of curiosity. It's important to vote because if 
you don't, the older people will choose for us. I only know one other person 
that probably voted before. Some people think nobody running is good enough. My 
mother is a citizen. She understands and speaks English, but she doesn't know 
what is going on with the elections. I am the only one in my family that wants 
to. I want to motivate other students to vote because society puts so much 
emphasis on this. ELIZABETH GONZALEZ 
</P>
<P>
 16, senior, El Rancho High, parents from Mexico 
</P>
<P>
 Once I register, I'll be able to say I helped get things passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is really the most important thing for me. I want to see the money 
go to where it was promised to go, (to classrooms), and not see it go to 
(administrative) salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 With immigration, this country has already said "Give me your hungry, your 
poor" and we made a mistake in saying that. We should have made it clear on 
what we meant a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is important to me because I've seen good people that I've known since 
my kindergarten years turn bad and join tagging groups and gangs and totally 
lose touch with people that are important to them just because they've found 
this new "family." It's sad. My parents came here from Mexico legally. But they 
are not citizens yet. They wish they could vote. RICARDO TORRES 
</P>
<P>
 19, Los Angeles, parents from Mexico 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't had a chance to register. I am not really interested and I haven't 
really thought about voting. JUAN FAVIER 
</P>
<P>
 17, senior, El Rancho High, parents from Cuba 
</P>
<P>
 I get excited about politics. I'd like to be a senator someday. A few of my 
friends feel the same. The rest don't really care.  
</P>
<P>
 So far Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown are acting the same. But it's true that 
California needs a change. The press has not covered the election well. They 
need to talk about it more, have more programs on it. A lot of people don't 
even know who is running for governor.  
</P>
<P>
 My mom talks about becoming a citizen but hasn't. Personal rights are 
important to me, but so is immigration. At first I thought Mexicans shouldn't 
be allowed to come here, that they should close the borders. But my views are 
changing because some of my family from Cuba wants to come and they can't. 
JUSTINE UNG 
</P>
<P>
 18, senior, Alhambra High School, emigrated from Vietnam in 1988, to be sworn 
in as a citizen in November 
</P>
<P>
 I plan on registering to vote so I can support a person who I think would do a 
good job in government. Immigration is important to me because I am an 
immigrant. I want immigrants to have rights in society because they are always 
made scapegoats. Whatever the problem is, people tend to blame on immigrants 
and they can't do anything about it because they can't vote. Most of them are 
not citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents are going to become citizens as well but I don't think my parents 
see voting as important as I do. They don't know a lot of English and they 
don't watch TV a lot. They don't go to school like I do and listen to the 
teachers talk about voting.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON WHO 
O.J.'S 'REAL ME' COULD BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON J. TAYLOR, Dr. Myron J. Taylor is minister of Westwood Hills Christian 
Church. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once agan, our city and the nation are obsessed with the O.J. Simpson case. We 
are all getting an informative lesson in how our system of justice operates. 
Indeed, it will be up to the courts to determine whether the famous athlete 
committed the brutal double murders. 
</P>
<P>
 But I keep recalling that Friday afternoon in June when Simpson was on the 
run. Before taking to the freeway, he took time to write a letter that was read 
to the public. Simpson said: "I've had a good life. I'm proud of how I lived. 
My Mama taught me to do unto others. I treated people the way I wanted to be 
treated. Don't feel sorry for me. I've had a great life, great friends. Please 
think of the real O.J. and not this lost person."  
</P>
<P>
 Is he that poor boy reared by his mother? Or is he the wife beater and 
possible enraged murderer? I am not trying to pronounce judgment. I am merely 
asking which is the real O.J. Simpson? 
</P>
<P>
 We tend to judge people by the worst mistake they ever make. A person proves 
unfaithful, so we say that is the kind of person he or she is. A person steals 
something, so we say that person is a thief. A person commits a murder and we 
say that person is a monster, a cold-hearted killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is not necessarily the case. If you take 30 minutes out of many 
criminals' lives, they are just like the rest of us.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not saying there aren't real perverted people. Rather, we are all capable 
of doing hideous things under certain circumstances. It is easy to believe in 
the dark side of human nature. Look at Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, child abuse, 
spouse abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe we are a three-storied kind of creature. We live on the first floor. 
The dark side is the basement. There is also a higher floor that beckons us to 
be what we are meant to be -- that is, like God. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the place I think Simpson was referring to when he said, "Please think 
of the real O.J. and not this lost person." He believes that down deep in his 
soul he is the person his mother taught and who so many people knew and liked.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if O.J. is guilty, which the jurors will decide, he is still a child of 
God. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean that those who have commited heinous crimes should not be 
punished. But if we are to rise to that better self -- the real self -- we need 
to remember that when God finished creating man and woman, He said "it was very 
good," higher praise than for His other efforts. That gives us self-respect. 
When we have that, we bring dignity to our work, our relations with other 
people, which, in turn, gives meaning to our existence. All people have value 
and dignity -- that is what the drug users, liars and murderers forget. We must 
find a way to help all people believe in their better self -- the real self -- 
the self they were given life to be.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC; WHEN 
THE NEEDS OF SMALL BUSINESS COLLIDE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION, DOES ONE 
SIDE HAVE TO LOSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American dream means just one thing to many people: owning a business. The 
dream is not an impossible one. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California alone, there were more than 330,000 businesses with 
fewer than 50 employees in 1991, the latest year figures are available, 
according to the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, ask entrepreneurs to describe what it's like to run those 
businesses and you're likely to get an earful about rules, regulations and 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Working People, restaurant/gas station owner Noel Anenberg details 
the pitfalls of small business -- crime, poverty, gangs -- and the one thing 
that truly drives up his blood pressure: government inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Anenberg is not the only small business owner to complain about California's 
myriad air quality, health and safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses do move out of Southern California -- but just 44 in 1993, 
down from 140 in 1992, according to the EDC. No matter what the numbers, 
finger-pointing still goes on, and most are pointed at the difficulty of 
meeting regulatory requirements, particularly environmental laws. It is these 
complaints that L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan and other local officials say they 
are trying to address by helping small businesses navigate bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people believe the regulations are not destroying business. Rather, new 
businesses that help clean the environment are thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain businesses that used to be very attractive for the 
individual, such as gas stations or auto body painting shops," says Jon 
Goodman, director of the entrepreneur program at USC. "Now where you're seeing 
a lot of small businesses growing is in waste management and asbestos removal." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, says Goodman, is the quality of life: "A lot of the problem 
in California, and Los Angeles in particular, is a function of people choosing 
to live in an environmentally fragile ecology. My personal philosophy is that 
no one has the right to pollute the environment just to put food on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many business owners support anti-pollution regulations but criticize 
redundant bureaucracy. "I live here, I've got my children here, my 
grandchildren. I want the air to be clean," says Bob Varela Sr., president of 
Tape and Label in Santa Fe Springs and treasurer of the Latin Business Assn. 
"What's killing businesses is the over-regulation" adds Varela. "There are too 
many agencies duplicating everything -- the state board of health, the county 
board of health, the fire department. The record-keeping alone is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 State and local officials say government is responding with "one-stop shops" 
where owners can apply for all needed permits in one place. "We do regulate 
more small businesses than ever before," says Claudia Keith, spokesperson for 
the regional Air Quality Management District. "But we've created a 
small-business assistance office to work one-on-one with them."

 In the first three months of operation of the new Los Angeles Drug Court, 
about 100 people have avoided jail by agreeing to participate in a year-long 
outpatient treatment program run by Impact House in a special Downtown 
facility. A similar program is to begin in Orange County in January and others 
could follow with the help of funds in the recently approved crime bill. 
Officials and participants share their experiences and hopes about the program.

 STEPHEN MARCUS 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Court judge who oversees the program 
</P>
<P>
 This is a potential antidote to the jail overcrowding that's a byproduct of 
the "three strikes law." What we are doing here is largely pulling out the 
nonviolent drug offender and giving him an opportunity to change his life. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the guiding principles is that we intervene early. We take a person 
who's in a crisis situation, who's been arrested, and force that person to 
undergo treatment which is in his best interest. In the drug court program in 
Florida they call it "tough love" and that's what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 If jail is the only thing a judge has in his toolbox then he is clearly going 
to have trouble making an impact on the community. We're using a whole array of 
techniques. Jail is the last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 CARL C. HOLMES 
</P>
<P>
 Chief public defender, Orange County 
</P>
<P>
 We know that what we've done in the past doesn't work. Drug rehabilitation, if 
effective, provides its own justice. If the client's rehabilitated the system 
can expect not to have that individual back in court. So we save not only the 
time that might be involved in the current cases; we also save the time 
incurred if the person comes back into the justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 A consensus is starting to develop in the country that rehabilitation not only 
works, it is cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 ALAN SLATER  
</P>
<P>
 Executive officer, Orange County Superior Court 
</P>
<P>
 One thing we've learned from looking at drug courts in Portland, Oakland and 
Miami is that it needs a lot of support. It has very heavy resource 
requirements from probation officers, law enforcement, the marshal, the DA, the 
public defender, court clerks and other support personnel -- and, of course, 
the health care agency -- to keep it running. In some of the other drug courts, 
their case load is very heavy -- 80 a day in Miami, for example.  
</P>
<P>
 This program is more cost-effective than incarceration, although it's loaded 
up in the front end. It costs $25,000 or more a year to incarcerate somebody in 
county jail. Based on evaluations on programs already operating, this can run 
as little as several thousand dollars. The Participants

 The traditional drug diversion was too expensive for the person with the 
limited funds I had. It was also hard to find a place in my area.  
</P>
<P>
 They've got people who know about the situation, have hands-on experience. 
They test us every day. It's a friendly atmosphere of people who work with you. 
They go the whole nine yards for us. It's not about money with them. They gave 
me the feeling it could work if I wanted it to -- and I do.

 FREDDIE BALICTAR 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I'm trying to get off alcohol and drugs. What I wanted to get out of the 
program was education, information, a little bit of living a sober lifestyle, a 
chance to turn in a new direction. I couldn't do it on my own. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been doing pretty good. I'm in my fifth month. I'm the only client that's 
traveling this far, all the way from Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 JUAN RODRIGUEZ  
</P>
<P>
 37, Echo Park 
</P>
<P>
 I asked to be in the program. I'm doing what I'm supposed to do now, following 
my steps. I got a sponsor -- someone that helps you, that you talk to. You call 
him, talk to each other and he helps you with your problem. I go to my meetings 
Friday and Tuesday nights. I talk to other addicts. We all seem to have the 
same thing. Just to be clean for all my life, stay clean; that's what I hope to 
get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 JOSE BIRAMONTES 
</P>
<P>
 24, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Right now I'm frustrated. I was clean for 30 days and then I went out and I 
relapsed. Like the judge says, he gave me one more chance. And that's good. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to live in Lincoln Heights. I was a gangster. I'm not trying to be the 
same person I was: aggressive, bad attitude. Basically, I want to think 
positive. I want to set an example to the youngsters that it's not worth being 
in the streets because all you're going to do is end up in jail and it's not a 
pretty sight.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MODEST PROPOSAL; 
GUMP'S 'SIMPLE, NOBLE' BUS STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PAUL CASEY 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles resident, student at University of Chicago 
</P>
<P>
 "Forrest Gump" appeals to us because it shows that a simple life defined by 
severe limitations can be led with great dignity. We see him go many places, 
even make lots of money. But the one thing we never see him do is drive: He 
exemplifies the millions of Americans who, for one reason or another, depend on 
other means to get around. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining one's sense of dignity while waiting for the bus is an integral 
part of the transit experience. Gump seated, waiting, does not have to place 
his feet on the edge of the gutter. His knees are not inches from speeding 
vehicles. The pedestrian space has not been whittled away for turning lanes and 
"improved traffic flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the bus stop itself ennobles his character. The bench is simple, without 
artifice; one plank for the seat and three for the back. Monumental shade trees 
provide a pleasant backdrop. The bus stop is elevated, slightly but distinctly, 
on a brick platform surrounded by a clean white border. The subliminal message 
is very clear: This space is special. It is for people who ride the bus and 
they have status.  
</P>
<P>
 But on the streets of Los Angeles, the picture is quite different. Passengers 
often wait curbside, close to the fragrant fumes of passing traffic, with no 
place to rest out of the sun or rain. One of the few exceptions is West 
Hollywood, which has interesting looking, brightly colored, comfortable bus 
benches, complete with arm rests. These benches suggest that people who 
exercise a sense of taste in their daily lives can also ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it is time for Hollywood creative types to do for Los Angeles transit 
what they did for Georgia in Gump: Send in the set designers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the successful precedent of Metrolink, the commuter train service 
which held a design competition for their color scheme and logo. The 
attractive, periwinkle blue and white trains with the distinctive logo were 
designed by an art student for a cash prize of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about those shrill toots that Red Line trains make as they enter each 
station? A competition among the many sound-effects wizards in town would 
certainly produce a warning sound that was effective, pleasing, even 
entertaining, and distinctly identifiable by world travelers as belonging to 
the Los Angeles Metro. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a chance for Hollywood to have more than a fleeting role in the lives of 
real-life Forrest Gumps whose dramas unfold on public transit every day.

HAPPINESS AT THE 11TH HOUR; KANTOR ANNOUNCES NEW JAPAN TRADE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The series of very substantial trade agreements reached over the weekend 
between the United States and Japan were not simply about opening up Japan to 
more American goods and services. The eleventh-hour deal was also about opening 
a much-needed new chapter in U.S.-Japan relations. As Clyde Prestowitz, a 
former U.S. trade official and frequent critic of Japanese trade practices, put 
it, the understandings "put U.S.-Japan relations on a new plane. It's a win-win 
proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Japanese won't think so, because despite the milestone 
market-opening agreements in insurance, glass, medical and telecommunications 
equipment, Tokyo may yet face U.S. trade sanctions. The two countries did not 
resolve their longstanding dispute on Japanese barriers to American cars and 
auto parts, which account for two-thirds of America's $60-billion annual trade 
deficit with Japan. Consequently, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is 
taking steps that could lead to possibly imposing sanctions. But many months 
have to pass before that happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, what was achieved in these difficult talks was remarkable. The long 
pattern of superficial U.S.-Japan agreements has been broken.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States, which under the Clinton Administration has been taking an 
uncharacteristically firm line with Japan, had put Tokyo on notice that it was 
seeking a "results-oriented" policy. The American strategy was not to allow 
Japan to defuse and obfuscate the issue of results in addressing the chronic, 
intolerably high trade imbalance.  
</P>
<P>
 The two sides agreed to what Washington certainly hopes is objective, 
enforceable criteria to measure progress, but specific numerical targets were 
tip-toed around, as the Japanese preferred. Over the past 15 months an impasse 
over how to measure results had been a major hurdle. Now the big question is 
whether U.S. insurance companies will, in fact, find it easier to sell products 
in Japan; whether the Japanese government actually buys U.S. medical and 
telecommunications equipment, and whether U.S. makers of flat glass used in 
automobiles and construction truly find Japanese buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fragile government of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama will now want to 
follow through with other programs, such as domestic deregulation and tax 
reform. The United States sees efforts on these fronts as crucial to 
stimulating the Japanese market for foreign goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there is still the prickly issue of autos and auto parts. Detroit 
has made some progress in penetrating the Japanese market, but more needs to be 
done by Tokyo, especially when it comes to auto replacement parts. The specter 
of sanctions puts pressure on the auto talks to produce results. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Tokyo is now committed, at least in principle, to eroding some 
structural barriers to foreign goods and services. That is progress. If the 
auto sector were somehow included in this new phase of cooperation, that would 
really signal a sea change in the U.S.-Japan relationship.

SECONDHAND SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are several trendy restaurants on Sunset Boulevard situated within view 
of a sign that reads: "Secondhand Smoke Kills."Outside those restaurants, 
tables are set up on the sidewalk, some as close to the curb as four feet. 
</P>
<P>
 On one particular evening, as I was driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic down 
Sunset at the dinner hour, I noticed that most of those outdoor tables were 
filled.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there wasn't a cigarette in sight. But I wondered how many of 
those alfresco diners were aware of the auto exhaust poisons they ingested and 
inhaled with every bite and breath.

 Re "Gang Fighter," Sept. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 How many articles have been written, how many speeches have been uttered on 
the subject of taking the streets back from the drug dealers, drive-by 
shooters, gang members and various other scum that have terrorized many people 
and neighborhoods? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here is Clyde James, a senior citizen, willing to risk his life to stand 
up for what he thinks is right, live a peaceful life in the northeast Los 
Angeles home he has resided in for many years, and all he gets is lip service 
from fearful neighbors and the community advocate (from Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg's office), with the tune that he has to get along with all the 
neighbors.Scuse me . . . was it neighbors who stoned his house for five hours? 
I rather doubt that many of us would have put up with that kind of treatment 
for that long. 
</P>
<P>
 What will the police, the council office and the neighbors do -- wait until 
this 83-year-old loner becomes another victim of the scumbags harassing him, 
and another statistic for the Los Angeles crime scoreboard?

CRIME AND POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's interesting to attempt a comparison between the Sept. 22 Column Right by 
David Horowitz ("A '60s Revival We Don't Need: Black Panthers") and the Column 
Left by Alexander Cockburn ("Feed a Vagrant, Go to Jail in San Francisco"). 
</P>
<P>
 Horowitz is right to criticize people who threaten mayhem unless the 
government gives them jobs.But it's also wrong, as Cockburn points out, to have 
so criminalized poverty that Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco and petty 
bureaucrats across the country gain political capital by persecuting and 
harassing not only poor people, but those who attempt to alleviate their pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The real fault lies in an economic system that strives to eliminate jobs in 
the name of efficiency and profits. To the extent that labor-intensive 
production is eschewed, world poverty will increase, criminalized or not, and 
fear-mongers will incite people to do anything to change their circumstances.

EDUCATION FOR CHANG CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone looking for the perfect encapsulation of what is wrong with our 
educational system and our society need read no further than the Column One 
article of Sept. 14, "What's Best for Young Geniuses?" on the Chang sisters, 
the preteen students taking (and excelling in, by all accounts) classes at 
College of the Redwoods in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time excellence, studiousness, self-discipline, and hard work were 
honored (indeed, expected) in our society.No more, obviously. I was sickened by 
the comments of the so-called "educators" cited in the article (starting with 
the college president), who seem concerned with everything else but education. 
</P>
<P>
 These educators believe the Changs belong with their peer group. I don't 
suppose it matters a whit to them that those peers often beat up the Changs' 
brother for no other reason than his grades. And what would they absorb from 
their peers these days, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters are too "immature" for college, the educrats say. If "maturity" is 
exemplified by the typical amoral, hormonally overactive, unstudious college 
student of today, I hope the Changs never reach "maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 And even if their father is using them for self-validation, so what? That is 
none of the school's business. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The article describing the difficulties College of the Redwoods is having with 
the children of John Chang is disturbing. The United States needs intelligent 
young people but the college appears to consider them a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns Hopkins University has a special program for the social and academic 
needs of talented youth. Schools usually are given money for a program for slow 
learners, but gifted children do not receive adequate support. Local schools 
should contact the National Assn. for Gifted Children.

 At last! It's hard to believe that you finally published an article on 
prostate cancer ("Prostate Cancer Needs Early Detection," by Mary Lou Wright, 
Commentary, Sept. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 It is concise and right to the point and deserves a follow-up by The Times. 
Compare your editorials and countless articles about breast cancer to the 
almost no attention to the dangers of prostate cancer, which kills almost as 
many as breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 You definitely should ask for more attention to research and funding for that 
purpose. Listen to a victim who has been through the mill with colostomy, 
radiation and chemotherapy and the aftereffects.

HOME INSURANCE COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Some Leadership in the Home Insurance Mess," editorial, Sept. 11: 
</P>
<P>
 New claims may be only part of the household insurance problem. I recently 
received a letter stating that my insurer of eight years was going to cancel my 
standard policy because of "evidence of lack in pride of ownership and poor 
housekeeping." They sent an inspector out a month ago, at a time when most of 
us were still undergoing recovery. My house had been completely repaired and 
upgraded at that time, yet they still plan to cancel my policy. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that you should review cancellations based on absurd reasons. These 
untimely inspections are giving the insurance companies a way to discriminate 
against those of us living in areas such as Sherman Oaks. My insurer seems to 
be trying to revoke my policy for bogus reasons because I have now requested 
earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 BONNIE FLAMER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Your editorial praising Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's proposal for 
dealing with the problem of earthquake insurance availability ignores reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The looming crisis is caused in part by inadequate rates for homeowners 
insurance and earthquake insurance. Garamendi's proposal does not address 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary reason homeowners insurance is less available is the excessive 
exposure to earthquake losses created by California's mandatory earthquake 
offer law. Many insurers have far more exposure to earthquake losses on their 
books than they can safely handle. Expanding the California Fair Plan does 
nothing to alleviate this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers are attempting to get a handle on the property insurance they sell 
and their excessive earthquake exposure in order to minimize the risk of 
insolvency should another major quake hit a densely populated area. Fair Plan 
losses are paid by private insurers and their policyholders. Expanding the Fair 
Plan increases the risk of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way companies can decrease exposure to earthquake insurance losses is 
to discontinue selling homeowners insurance policies. Expanding the Fair Plan 
discourages companies from selling homeowners policies because the larger the 
market share, the larger your Fair Plan assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's proposal ignores all this and puts the future financial stability 
of insurers at greater risk when adequate rates and removing the mandated 
earthquake coverage offer could resolve the problem.

 The Times stated that the Legislature "ducked its responsibility" to act in 
response to the growing homeowners insurance crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 As the author of AB 1388, I believe I am entitled to respond that it was not 
for lack of leadership, nor lack of work, that serious legislative efforts 
addressing the problem failed. Throughout the closing days of the legislative 
session, I, along with my Insurance Committee consultants, legislative staff 
and all interested parties, put in long hours in an attempt to hammer out a 
solution. Senate Insurance Chairman Art Torres conducted an extraordinary night 
hearing of his committee on the next-to-last-day of the two-year legislative 
session in a last-ditch effort to pass legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, our efforts failed because there was simply lack of 
agreement among the parties most directly involved as to the best course of 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that AB 1388 was credible compromise legislation aimed at relieving 
the crisis. It would have allowed insurers to satisfy the existing mandate to 
offer earthquake coverage by offering a policy written through the California 
Fair Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 While I respect the insurance commissioner's efforts to provide some interim 
solution, I am convinced that no unilateral action by his department can 
provide an adequate solution.

CAMPAIGN WATCH; TRUTH IN ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are not so naive as to think that candidates vying for political office 
trade only in the unvarnished truth. As long as there have been elections, 
candidates have promoted themselves with half-truths, shades of gray and 
outright lies.But that said, the advertisements that Republican Senate 
candidate Mike Huffington unveiled last week are simply beyond the pale. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's television and newspaper ads try to paint his opponent, Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, as soft on crime because she voted to confirm judges he 
attacks as too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 His prime target is U.S. Appeals Court Judge Rosemary Barkett from Florida. 
Huffington charges Barkett overturned the death penalty "over 100 times," and 
that Feinstein voted to confirm Barkett's appointment to the appellate court. 
Ergo, Feinstein is a bleeding heart.  
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's ad doesn't mention that 60 other senators, including Florida's 
Republican Sen. Connie Mack, also voted to confirm Barkett. Nor do his ads 
mention that Barkett, a former nun who earned the American Bar Assn.'s highest 
rating when she was nominated for the court, upheld the death penalty more 
often than she voted to overturn it. 
</P>
<P>
 Appellate court judges are supposed to review lower court decisions to 
determine whether the law was properly applied in a particular case and the 
trial conducted fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Huffington charging that Judge Barkett is soft on crime because she doesn't 
want to execute everyone who appeals to her? If so, that perspective reflects a 
misunderstanding of the principles of our judicial system.

A SIGALERT ON THE HIGHWAY BILL; DISPUTE BETWEEN HOUSE, SENATE CHAIRMEN RISKS 
BILLIONS IN FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fight between Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) and Sen. Max Baucus 
(D-Mont.) has bottled up billions in national highway funding for what looks to 
be the remainder of the congressional session. But that could be the least of 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If allowed to drag on past the Sept. 30, 1995, funding deadline, the skirmish 
could end up costing the 50 states $6.5 billion, and California as much as $546 
million. The result would not only be lost jobs but lost opportunities to cut 
freeway congestion and pollution, save fuel and increase the nation's economic 
viability by improving our transportation infrastructure. That need not happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mineta believes the government should directly fund specific projects. Baucus 
wants states to choose worthy projects by themselves. Both positions have 
merit. But the two lawmakers, chairs of the House and Senate Public Works 
committees, respectively, should put aside their philosophical differences and 
get down to negotiating the real issue: money. 
</P>
<P>
 As it now stands, the House appropriation for the national highway system 
bill, which passed 412 to 12, contains funding for special transportation 
projects. Forty of these, including Los Angeles' Alameda Corridor and upgrades 
for parts of the I-5, I-15 and 710 freeways, are in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legislators, especially those from smaller states, argue that funding 
special projects reduces the national pool of highway money and ultimately 
hurts their states. But delaying final action on funding much longer stands to 
hurt every state. Especially if Congress must go back to the drawing board next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Baucus and Mineta agree that Congress should pass legislation that designates 
money for the nation's most heavily traveled roads. They agree there's a need 
to modernize and otherwise improve 159,000 miles of the roads that make up the 
national highway system. Now they must agree on how to fund it.  
</P>
<P>
 All motorists pay into the massive national highway trust fund through gas 
taxes and other fees. They deserve a smooth ride from Congress, not gridlock. 
And breaking gridlock is an outcome that's in the best interests of both 
California and Montana -- and the rest of the nation.

DIALING FOR DOLLARS; COMMUNICATIONS: THE BABY BELLS ARE PURSUING AN AGENDA FOR 
TOTAL MONOPOLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. MICHAEL NOLL, A. Michael Noll is a professor at the Annenberg School for 
Communication at USC. He writes frequently about the telecommunications 
industry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ingeniously invoking the name of competition, the Baby Bells are really 
seeking a total monopoly on the distribution of all local telecommunication, 
from telephony to television. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baby Bells seem to have entered their rebellious teen years and have 
become unregulatable. Their quest to be free from strong regulation has been 
successful; in exchange for the lack of control, they have promised that local 
rates will not increase any more than the rate of inflation and they promise 
lower long-distance rates if they are allowed into that market. They also 
promise a cornucopia of new services, including holographic videophones, 
automatic language translation and video-on-demand. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a case of having too much money and searching for ways to invest it. Last 
year's profit margins ranged from 10% to 13%, with pretax profit margins for 
some Baby Bells as high as 18%. These profit margins have been stable during 
the 10 years since divestiture. Given the Baby Bells' monopoly on providing 
telephone service and protection from competition, such high profit margins are 
unwarranted.  
</P>
<P>
 The profits of the Baby Bells should be subject to regulation, and local rates 
should be reduced. In the 10 years since divestiture, interstate long-distance 
rates have decreased dramatically by 50% to 80%. During these same 10 years, 
the total charges for local service have increased about 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all their technological advances, the Baby Bells have failed to 
provide universal telephone service. Last year, more than 10% of the households 
in three states had no telephone service. Touchtone service, though more than 
three decades old, has market penetration of only about 75% and still costs 
extra in many areas. The Baby Bells charge so much for services such as 
call-waiting and voice mail that most people do not have them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baby Bells accuse AT&T of being an oligopoly, yet AT&T's long-distance 
market share was just 60% last year, while the Baby Bells have nearly 100% 
control of local service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baby Bells publicly embrace competition and lobby Congress to free them to 
enter new businesses. Yet their actions show their real monopolistic intent. 
After promising competition with CATV, the Baby Bells attempted to buy up 
existing CATV companies to extend the monopoly of local telephone service. More 
recently, the Baby Bells announced plans to combine many of their 
cellular-telephone operations into super cellular companies, again reducing 
competition. In some ways, these mergers imply that the old Bell system is 
beginning to come back together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baby Bells have been protected from the real world for so long that other 
than mouthing the word competition, they seem to have little understanding of 
consumers, markets, finance, science or any of the factors affecting 
competition. The former Ma Bell, AT&T, however, has had to learn all about the 
real world and faces stiff competition in its long-distance and manufacturing 
businesses. The only thing that the Baby Bells seem to understand is the 
lobbying of legislators and governors. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent lobbying campaigns of the Baby Bells at the state and federal 
levels demonstrate far too much influence that is counter to public interests. 
The Baby Bells have duped many legislators and are ignoring their 
responsibilities to the public as utility providers of an essential service. 
However, their anti-competitive actions ultimately risk the attention of the 
Justice Department. One solution? Break them up into a number of smaller local 
companies, each serving a small geographic area. Another solution? Re-create 
the old Bell system under the central control of an AT&T with strong 
regulation. Given today's chaos and greed, perhaps the old Bell system wasn't 
so bad after all.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; SCALING THE HEIGHTS OF IRRATIONALITY; A VOTE TO 
JAIL PEOPLE FOR WORKING AND SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL IS A VOTE FOR 
FISCAL AND MORAL BANKRUPTCY.

Gov. Wilson in June.

 In 1942, during a period of sharp wartime hysteria, Californians blackened our 
state's good name by overwhelmingly endorsing the imprisonment of all Japanese 
Americans, most of them native-born U.S. citizens and nearly all deeply loyal 
to America. Only one member of Congress, Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio, the leading 
conservative Republican of his day, opposed this measure directed against 
"enemy aliens," which otherwise passed unanimously. Robert Taft had principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today in California, the current political hysteria about illegal immigration, 
inflamed by cynical politicians who believe in nothing except their own 
election victory, has brought us to a similar moral precipice. Recent polls 
show strong public support for Proposition 187 -- the "Save Our State" 
initiative -- directed against illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the measure, which prevents illegal immigrants from receiving 
public services, might appear quite attractive to opponents of California's 
overgrown social-welfare state. After all, if rolling back the tide of wealth 
redistribution has to start somewhere, why not with recipients who aren't even 
legal residents? Add to this California's horrendous budget deficits, and any 
measure that purports to save tax money sounds extremely attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is extremely attractive, until one actually reads the measure. 
In practice, 187 would be an unimaginable disaster for California, with regard 
both to personal liberty and to state finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider a few simple facts. Illegal immigrants are already ineligible for 
state welfare assistance or food stamps, and their estimated use of the medical 
services that 187 would prohibit is quite low, just a tiny fraction of 1% of 
California's huge budget. The only substantial government cost associated with 
illegal immigration is through the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants make up perhaps 5% of California's population and most are 
in their prime working years, 25 to 40; those with children obviously make use 
of the public schools, and the sums involved are sizable. So one of the central 
thrusts of Proposition 187 is to root out these immigrant children (most of 
whom are U.S.-born citizens) from the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 How to do this? By turning teachers and administrators into de facto INS 
agents, forcing them to investigate the family background of each and every 
child in their school, at enormous effort and expense, and report to the 
authorities those whom they suspect may have a father or mother who entered the 
country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Having schools encourage small children to inform on the status of their 
parents has heavy totalitarian overtones; even the Soviet Union abandoned this 
practice after Stalin's death. In recent years, we all have heard reports of 
school drug-education programs that proudly persuaded students to turn their 
parents in for drug use. And Christian groups have expressed alarm over 
attempts by the schools to monitor home religious practices. Officially 
establishing our public schools as agencies of family investigation and arms of 
government law enforcement, as Proposition 187 would do, is not a happy 
precedent for us to set. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative only gets worse. Since the authors view immigrant workers with 
as much alarm as they do immigrant layabouts, the measure mandates a five-year 
prison sentence (or $25,000 fine) for any illegal immigrant who uses false 
identity papers in pursuit of gainful employment. A state that pays generous 
welfare benefits to those unwilling to work and imprisons those who do work 
defies rationality. 
</P>
<P>
 Although estimates vary, perhaps upward of 1 million of the illegal immigrants 
currently employed as California's gardeners, housemaids, hotel workers or 
construction laborers have some form of false identity document. At the same 
time, California's bloated and inefficient prison system has average annual 
costs of $23,000 per inmate. Turning hundreds of thousands of our hard-working, 
tax-paying, minimum-wage gardeners and nannies into prison inmates at a cost of 
tens of billions of dollars hardly seems a sensible means of solving our 
state's budget problems.  
</P>
<P>
 And Proposition 187's school-monitoring provisions would only increase the use 
of false papers. To prevent their 6- or 7-year-olds from being expelled from 
school, many immigrant mothers will undoubtedly acquire false documents and 
risk a five-year prison sentence. Imagine a California that sends mothers to 
prison for trying to keep their children in school! 
</P>
<P>
 How do the principal advocates of the initiative respond to such criticism? 
One of them told me that much of the initiative is "obviously unconstitutional" 
and would be thrown out by the courts. Another was confident that judges would 
refuse to enforce the parts of the law that are obviously unjust. A fervent 
grass-roots activist had the simplest defense: 187 was intended to be 
unworkable and bankrupt the state, thereby forcing Washington to finally "do 
something" to stop illegal immigration, such as putting land mines along the 
border.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's immigration troubles are an inevitable consequence of our having built 
a social-welfare state in which newcomers are mouths to feed rather than hands 
to work. But instead of rolling back government spending, Proposition 187 would 
extend government control and investigation into all of our daily lives and 
those of our children while bankrupting our state several times over. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Californians view illegal immigrants as unwanted house guests. One very 
effective means of getting rid of such guests is to set your house on fire and 
burn it to the ground. This is Proposition 187's solution to illegal 
immigration. It would be a financial and social disaster for California, and 
the worst moral disaster for our state since the internment of Japanese 
Americans. No decent Californian should support it.

SARAJEVO: A REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS CHOCOLATE; BEYOND THE IMAGE OF A WAR-TORN 
CITY, MEMORIES CLING OF COURAGEOUS PEOPLE MAINTAINING A GENEROUS CIVILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

returned from a year in Zagreb as a Times special correspondent.

 "Will you remember us when you're gone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dzenita Fakic's words haunt me still, long after she ventured outside to 
retrieve water and lost both legs in a shelling attack on Sarajevo. The shy 
psychology student sat on her hands and looked me straight in the eye, waiting 
for my answer. But then, as now, I was struck by the fact that in the news, 
Sarajevo looms only as a city of battered people encircled by a military noose 
relaxed or tightened according to the political whim of the moment. I remember 
something more. 
</P>
<P>
 To explain this, I must talk about chocolate. More particularly, a chocolate 
cake that Stojanka Hodzic whipped up using stale bread and cocoa and other 
items gleaned from humanitarian aid packages. She enhanced its sweetness by 
sharing it with elan, using the family silver and royal blue cups steaming with 
a black market treasure -- Turkish coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The glass coffee table, the cream-colored carpet and the volumes on the 
bookshelves added to the surreal aspect -- a recollection of a time when 
sharing did not mean overwhelming sacrifice, when she and her husband Teufik 
did not have to carry water in 20-liter jugs up the stairs of their apartment 
block, when they didn't have to use a jury-rigged conduit to tap into the 
natural-gas line, a time when the city equated itself more with Squaw Valley 
than with Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Hodzic apartment block overlooks a freshly tilled graveyard and a 
city racked by the contradictions of multistoried buildings with no rooms, 
apartments with plastic sheeting for windows and people who keep trying to hold 
on to what is normal in a place where nothing seems to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people clinging to a remnant of civility refused to leave though they 
were able to do so. Some, like poet Ferida Durakovic, insisted on remaining 
with her family, worried that renewed fighting might prevent her from returning 
to care for them. Her city's struggle inspires her, and she equates continuing 
to exist with continuing to write. Her poetry was published before the war, and 
she gave me one of her books. That would not be so unusual had it not been that 
most of her copies were destroyed during a shelling. "Don't worry," she said, 
justifying the gift by adding, "Your Library of Congress has a copy of every 
book ever printed." Perhaps, she explained, she would borrow her own books when 
the war was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Sarajevans, like Vesna Musovic, adapted to losses of a different kind. 
The telephone operator lost her arm during a mortar blast, but said she felt 
lucky because she didn't lose both arms. With one, she could still work on the 
switchboard, still wash her face in the morning, still write a letter to her 
family. I walked around the city for weeks, gazing at my hands, wondering 
whether I would feel so blessed to proclaim my good fortune should one be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Most acts of courage were more simple, more a struggle for the retention of 
familiarity like the chocolate cake, a good book, a sense of safety and a level 
of civility contrary to the simplistic analysis that paints Balkan combatants 
as barbarians bent on ethnic annihilation. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Bosnian War is considered the best example of what horrible things 
human beings can do to one another, the tenacity of people in Sarajevo also 
exemplifies the best of what makes us human, the dignity of spirit and the 
stern resilience of pride that refuses to crumble despite death and anguish. 
Bosnia truly exemplifies mankind at its worst. But in less-heralded moments, it 
also exemplifies people working hard to live their best. That much I will not 
forget.

COMMENTARY; DESPITE ADVANCES IN TV, SPORTS GOING DOWN TUBES FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was to be one of the more memorable weeks in the history of sports and 
TV. A new satellite dish -- which could break up more relationships, cause more 
insomnia, and be responsible for more undone homework than ESPN ever dreamed -- 
is coming on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 For less than $1,000, we're going to be able to buy a digital satellite 
system, a dish only 18 inches in diameter that's small enough to sit on a 
windowsill. It's being referred to as DirecTV. 
</P>
<P>
 With a clear path to the southern sky, we're promised 150 channels with 
something close to a laser-disc-quality picture. Oh sure, people can pull down 
movies and specials and educational shows. But DSS means one thing to the 
sports fan: 
</P>
<P>
 Games. 
</P>
<P>
 And more games. Games 'round the clock. Games from the West Coast, games till 
you drop, games till your spouse walks. So what, you'd apparently have to pay a 
couple hundred bucks for available NFL games. You'd never need a local TV 
guide. What can we watch? Whatever I want to watch!!!! 
</P>
<P>
 Don't want to see what they've got on TNT? Wait for the Warriors vs. the Suns 
at 11:30 Eastern. Don't want to see what the NBC and Fox affiliates are 
deciding you should watch, with all those network restrictions? Let's go to the 
Niners at the Chiefs. Imagine the possibilities: the Ducks vs. the Flames, 
Sonics vs. Rockets, Kings at Canucks, Nuggets at Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no games. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't see what TV can't show. 
</P>
<P>
 No baseball, no hockey, maybe no pro basketball. At the moment, we're all 
weekend warriors, because there are no sports on TV from Tuesday through Friday 
nights. You know what they showed on ESPN the other night? Chain-saw assembly. 
Seriously. ESPN cut away from Gary Bettman's news conference Friday to return 
to ... "Racehorse Digest." Talk about lean. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, we don't even need cable, much less a dish, even one the size of a 
small birdbath. If somebody doesn't settle a strike soon I'll have watched 
every episode of "Saved By The Bell" twice by the end of October. The other 
night I switched over to HTS out of habit and, lo and behold, they were showing 
Knicks vs. Bulls, Game 3 of the 1994 NBA playoffs, better known as the Scottie 
Pippen "If-I-can't-be-the-hero-I'll-take-a-seat-with-1.8 seconds-left" game. 
Just what we needed to see: another work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a true team sports fan, this is traditionally one of the best times 
of the year. They're usually playing everything. And anything not being played 
is about to be played. By the time baseball was scheduled to end, the NBA was 
scheduled to tip off. Instead, it's become the most disappointing time in a 
long time. Whatever happened to the late box score? 
</P>
<P>
 The villains in all this, the people who have me watching reruns of 
"Bewitched" on Nick at Nite, are getting easier to identify: 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody associated with Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody in NBA management who wants to close up the "loopholes" in the salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with the NHL, which was supposed to begin its 78th season last 
night. It's obvious you can't blame all of baseball's problems on the absence 
of a commissioner because the NHL has one, and he might just manage to alienate 
all the players and half the fans, many of them new ones still growing 
comfortable with Canada's game. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what hockey's lockout boils down to, plain and simple: The union was 
willing to negotiate in good faith, having promised not to strike at any time 
this season, and start the season on time. Bettman was not. This rivals the 
highest level of baseball's arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the players have promised not to strike-and there's absolutely no reason to 
think they're packing a sucker punch-what's the point of a lockout? 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman's taking a big gamble. If they get this thing settled and open the 
season within two weeks, he will have rolled a seven. If he's blown his sport's 
only chance to monopolize the airwaves and cable through the month of October, 
he's just Bud Selig Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman says the league has "profound economic problems." It'll have even more 
when there's a smaller pie to slice up after all the lost gate receipts. By 
announcing the players would not strike at any point of the season if the doors 
opened on time Saturday, union chief Bob Goodenow took the high road, which 
also puts pressure on Bettman. A long strike hurts baseball; it could kill the 
NHL. At least in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA, which was perceptive enough to realize its game might not survive a 
work stoppage more than 10 years ago, is now looking at its own lockout. 
Players are asking to do away with the salary cap while owners want most of the 
"exceptions" abolished. Trust me, the players are a lot less adamant about 
having no cap than the owners are about trying to almost redo much of the 
original cap agreement that the players simply used to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more than the proliferation of all-sports radio stations and Joe Fan's 
wanting more and more games, these mega-labor disputes show how much is at 
stake and how ridiculously important the sports industry has become to the 
culture of the late 20th century. And until all these groups of haves figure 
out how to divvy up their pies, we poor slobs who are willing to pay to 
literally pull images of these games out of the sky are going to have to settle 
for learning how to assemble a chain saw.

GIANTS STILL CAN'T GET BY THE BYE; NFC: NEW YORK, WHICH HASN'T WON AFTER A WEEK 
OFF SINCE 1990, LOSES TO NEW ORLEANS, 27-22, MAKING SAN DIEGO THE ONLY 
UNDEFEATED TEAM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An off-week seems to always lead to an off week for the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely let the Giants shut down for a game and they'll no doubt shut down the 
next game. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the way it seems. On Sunday, as they have following their last 
five weeks off since 1990, the Giants lost, 27-22, to the New Orleans Saints, 
leaving only San Diego undefeated in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants -- players and coaches -- were not buying into a bye-week jinx. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we were 3-0 was that we had done the things you need to do to win 
games and not make mistakes," Coach Dan Reeves said. "We made way too many 
mistakes and the Saints capitalized on them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants got no breaks. Trailing, 27-13, with 11 minutes to go in the fourth 
quarter, the Giants had third-and-17 on the New Orleans 45 and Dave Brown 
completed a pass to Chris Calloway on the four-yard line. But a defensive pass 
interference call was offset by an unsportsmanlike call when Calloway spiked 
the ball in cornerback Carl Lee's face to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 The second foul took precedence, officials said, and the ball was moved back 
to midfield. On the next play, Brown's pass was incomplete, and the Giants were 
forced to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Calloway should not have spiked the ball, Reeves said. The excitement of 
overcoming the Saints' interference and making the play that put the Giants 
into a position to score overwhelmed him, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a great job of making rules in this league," Reeves said. "But we do a 
great job, too, of making sure our players don't have fun enjoying what they 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' troubles began to multiply when Saint linebacker James Williams 
scored on a 33-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints' defense held the Giants -- again playing without injured Pro Bowl 
running back Rodney Hampton -- to 202 yards total and only 50 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints (2-3) intercepted two passes by Brown, sacked him seven times and 
knocked him down repeatedly. Frank Warren, 35, a veteran of the Saints' 
defense, later blocked a field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett completed 20 of 30 passes for 249 yards and one touchdown. Morten 
Andersen kicked field goals of 29 and 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants staged a late rally, going 55 yards on 11 plays before Dave Brown 
connected with Mike Sherrard on a three-yard touchdown pass that made it 27-22 
with 2:04 left. A two-point conversion try failed.

EAGLES RUN YOUNG, 49ERS RAGGED, 40-8; NFC: ROOKIE CHARLIE GARNER GAINS 111 
YARDS, SCORES TWICE AS PHILADELPHIA HANDS SAN FRANCISCO ITS WORST DEFEAT IN 
EIGHT YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Randall Cunningham and newcomer Charlie Garner rode roughshod over 
San Francisco's supposedly stellar defensive cast in a 40-8 beating Sunday that 
got so bad the 49ers all but conceded the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With Philadelphia's defense teeing off and Steve Young taking another beating 
behind a makeshift line, 49er Coach George Seifert lifted Young with 4:09 left 
in the third quarter following William Fuller's sack. It was the third 
consecutive shot on Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably should have changed earlier," Seifert said. "When he took that 
shot in the shoulder, I said, 'The hell with it. I'm not leaving him in.' We 
have a lot of football left.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The change was made with Philadelphia leading, 33-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being replaced by Elvis Grbac, Young threw two interceptions and was 
sacked by Fuller for a safety in one of his worst outings in four years as San 
Francisco's starter. By the fourth quarter, the 49ers were playing reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as total team effort, I have to say this is the best we've ever 
played," Fuller said. "Was it a fluke? Were they banged up? It's of no concern 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Young was upset over being taken out, but acknowledged he has been taking a 
pounding while playing behind an injury-racked line. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a player you want to go the distance. There's never a time when you say, 
'Well, this game is over,' " Young said. "I would much rather beat myself to a 
pulp trying to get back into the game than have to wait until next week." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst regular-season loss for San Francisco since a 59-14 defeat by 
the Dallas Cowboys in 1980, and the worst overall since a 49-3 playoff loss at 
the New York Giants in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I was very surprised and it wasn't easy," said Cunningham, who completed 
20 of 29 passes for 246 yards and two touchdowns. "What happened today was we 
used our talent like we never used it before. . . . This game should give us 
respect and it should be a real confidence booster." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner, making his NFL debut, ran for 111 yards and two touchdowns. He also 
caught a 28-yard pass. He had missed the past six weeks with a rib fracture and 
left in the third quarter with a back bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie jump-started our running game," Philadelphia Coach Rich Kotite said. 
"He's so quick getting into the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner had been increasingly frustrated while waiting his chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tedious doing the same thing over and over for weeks," said Garner, 
who had been sidelined since an Aug. 13 exhibition game against the New York 
Jets. "The treadmill, the films. It got kind of depressing after a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first action I've had in a long time. It's been a long time 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was Garner pleased at being taken out. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I was thinking about was getting a couple of more carries," he said. "I 
was angry I wasn't going back in. Every small back has to prove his durability. 
In my case, even more, because I've already been hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco, which hired seven key defensive free agents, began the game 
without its latest acquisition, cornerback Deion Sanders, who sprained his left 
ankle during Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Eagles marched down the field on their opening possession, 
Sanders returned to right cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Sanders joining a lineup that includes such Pro Bowl acquisitions as 
Rickey Jackson and Ken Norton, there was no stopping the Eagles -- on either 
side of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not in my wildest dreams did I think this could happen," said San Francisco 
safety Tim McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakdowns in San Francisco's patchwork line, though, were no surprise, and 
the 49ers never hit their offensive stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an explosive group. It almost seemed surreal the way it went," Young 
said.

COWBOYS GIVE SHULER GAME TO FORGET; NFC: REDSKIN QUARTERBACK'S FIRST NFL START 
IS A ROUGH ONE AS DALLAS OVERWHELMS WASHINGTON, 34-7.

 Redskin quarterback Heath Shuler will have no fond memories of Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler, making his first NFL start, completed only 11 of 30 passes for a mere 
96 yards as the Dallas Cowboys, behind Troy Aikman, trounced the Redskins, 
34-7, at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Aikman said he knew exactly how Shuler felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I told him after the game, there are better days ahead," said the Dallas 
quarterback, who began his career in 1989 with a 1-15 season. "Sometimes, it's 
hard to have faith when you start like this, but I had several (games like 
that). He's an outstanding player and a good kid. I think he's going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 There were some bad times for the Cowboys too, as Emmitt Smith left the game 
at the end of the first half because of a strained hamstring and did not 
return. Dallas trainer Kevin O'Neill said it would be a few days before he 
could gauge the seriousness of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 With Shuler replacing John Friesz, the Redskins fell apart completely -- 
committing penalties and turnovers that enabled Dallas to take a 31-0 lead by 
halftime. It was the Redskins' worst start in a game since Nov. 9, 1980, when 
Chicago led, 35-0, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we were playing, we couldn't beat anybody, and we were playing the 
world champions, we were playing the best team in football," said Redskin Coach 
Norv Turner of the team he helped to two Super Bowl titles as offensive 
coordinator before being hired by the Redskins last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to put it in a nutshell: my job is to get the team ready to play, 
and they were not ready to play, so I didn't get my job done today." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler said he was overanxious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had so much adrenaline built up inside, I kept on throwing them high, high 
and out of bounds, but I can work on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's running game told the story: 18 carries for 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Redskins took themselves out of the game with mistakes, they 
also were outclassed by a clearly superior and motivated opponent. The Cowboys 
were coming off a 20-17 overtime loss to the Detroit Lions on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played the running game well today," said Dallas Coach Barry Switzer. 
"Their offensive line couldn't block us and they didn't have Barry Sanders." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Coleman was the Cowboys' workhorse of the offense, carrying 22 times 
for 74 yards and one touchdown. Smith carried 16 times for 48 yards and two 
touchdowns before being hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman completed 20 of 28 passes for 181 yards, one touchdown and one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures Shuler would have been happy to have.

BEARS' WALSH TAKES PLUNGE, COMES UP WINNER; INTERCONFERENCE: QUARTERBACK SNEAK 
ON FOURTH DOWN HELPS CHICAGO TOP BUFFALO, 20-13. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There was no fear of fourth-down failure Sunday for the Chicago Bears and 
Steve Walsh. No way, even though they were stopped on their first try early in 
the game against the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have the opportunity on the goal line and not get in, but to overcome that 
when an offense could easily go in the tank, we fought back through it," said 
Walsh, whose fourth-down sneak with 11:25 left lifted the Bears to a 20-13 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were disappointed early in the game when we didn't get it in. We got back 
down there and we got some points." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh's one-yard score put Chicago ahead, 17-13. Later, he passed for 12 yards 
on fourth-and-three, setting up a field goal by Kevin Butler with 3:08 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills were without running back Thurman Thomas, sidelined by a sprained 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Davis filled in for Thomas and gained 78 yards on 18 carries, but it 
wasn't enough. Buffalo had the ball for only 6:28 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh started for Erik Kramer, out with a separated shoulder, and will get the 
call again next Sunday against New Orleans. He led a go-ahead drive of 16 plays 
that covered 69 yards and took 9:03, completing five of six passes for 51 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth down, Walsh wedged into the line for the lead. In the first quarter, 
Chicago had taken a chance on fourth-and-one at the two, but Bruce Smith 
stopped Lewis Tillman short. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little bit of a second effort," Walsh said of his first NFL 
touchdown. "I got some good push from (Mark) Bortz and (Andy) Heck on that side 
and I was able to push it over." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Bear Coach Dave Wannstedt: "Obviously, you've got to have enough 
confidence in your team and give your players enough confidence. You'd like to 
think you can make a fourth-and-one." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bill nose guard Jeff Wright: "They were relentless. The coach made a lot 
of gutsy calls. When they make it on fourth down like that, you have to 
regroup. We didn't."

CARDINALS FINALLY WIN ONE; NFC: SCHROEDER AND A TOUGH DEFENSE LEAD A 17-7 
VICTORY THAT ENDS MINNESOTA'S THREE-GAME WINNING STREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals finally figured out what BuddyBall is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 After an 0-3 start and facing a road trip to Dallas next week, the Cardinals 
-- picked by Coach Buddy Ryan and many observers as a playoff team -- couldn't 
afford another loss Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't get one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was going to be there," Ryan said of his first victory with 
Arizona. "I just didn't know when. But we beat the best team we've played. 
There's no doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Schroeder threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Derek Ware and set up Larry 
Centers' six-yard scoring run with a bomb to Randal Hill, and the defense made 
a few key plays as the Cardinals ended Minnesota's three-game winning streak 
with a 17-7 victory over the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ware, a third-year player who had caught just four non-scoring passes in his 
career until Ryan made him the starting tight end, said the elements of a 
strong team were coming together. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get everybody involved," Ware said. "On my touchdown, there 
wasn't anyone near me. They didn't show me any respect, and they paid for that. 
I don't think they'll make that mistake again. 
</P>
<P>
 Going long to Hill was another part of Ryan's master plan, but there was 
little sign of it until Schroeder, who didn't sign with Arizona until Sept. 5, 
began working with the first unit last week during a team bye. Early in the 
fourth quarter, Schroeder lofted a 45-yard pass that Hill caught on the 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Centers circled left end on the next play, and the Cardinals had their 
10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Davis broke a 7-7 halftime tie with a 46-yard field goal earlier in the 
fourth quarter. His kick ended a short march set up when Minnesota's Mike 
Saxon, holding for a 40-yard field goal try by Fuad Reveiz, lost control of the 
snap. James Williams of the Cardinals pounced on it at the Arizona 45-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt completed a nightmare for Reveiz, who had made five of seven 
attempts in four previous games, but missed from 30 and 47 yards earlier 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Moon's 13-yard pass to Jake Reed in the second quarter stood as the 
only Minnesota score. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon was effective through most of the game, throwing for 355 yards against 
what had been the NFL's top pass defense. Cris Carter had 14 receptions for 167 
yards, but the Vikings were unable to make a first down on their first three 
possessions of the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not a big deal. We're just trying to win, trying to score points. 
Unfortunately, the passes weren't there for us when we needed them," Carter 
said.

TURNER SPARKS TAMPA BAY, 24-14; NFC: HIS 80-YARD PUNT RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN IS 
THE FIRST FOR THE BUCCANEERS. SANDERS GAINS 166 YARDS, BUT LIONS LOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the last 25 yards of Vernon Turner's sprint up the sideline, the only 
question was whether he or Tampa Bay special teams coach George Stewart would 
reach the end zone first. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner ran a punt back 80 yards for a touchdown -- the first kick of any kind 
the Buccaneers have returned for a score in the club's 18-year history -- to 
provide the spark for Sunday's 24-14 victory over the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-year pro, criticized the first month of the season for spending too 
much time running from sideline to sideline, settled under Greg Montgomery's 
50-yard punt at his own 20 and used a stutter-step move to get past the first 
wave of defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned up the right sideline and got key blocks from Jeff Brady and former 
USC tailback Mazio Royster, who knocked Montgomery out of the play, and scored 
untouched. Stewart, who was racing up the sideline alongside Turner, tackled 
the former Detroit return man in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 38,012, aware of Tampa Bay's history, roared. It was the 1,320th 
punt by a Tampa opponent and the 705th punt the team had returned. Later, 
Rogerick Green blocked Montgomery's punt and Brady recovered at the Lions' 
2-yard line in the third quarter. That was Tampa Bay's first blocked punt in 
five seasons and the celebration was on again. 
</P>
<P>
 Errict Rhett scored two plays later for a 24-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit threatened to come back in the fourth quarter, but Jason Hanson missed 
a 26-yard field goal attempt with 6:28 left and Brett Perriman lost a fumble at 
the Tampa Bay 4-yard line about two minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit (2-3) unleashed Barry Sanders and cut its deficit to 17-14 at the 
half. But the blocked punt, missed field goal and Perriman's fumble killed the 
Lions' hopes of coming back all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders set up Derrick Moore's 5-yard touchdown run with an 85-yard sprint -- 
the longest run of his career -- up the right sideline. He had 166 yards in 20 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Sanders' seventh 100-yard game against the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions are 4-3 in those games but they've lost in four of their last five 
visits.

TURNER, CLEVELAND TROUNCE JETS; AFC: SAFETY KEYS DEFENSIVE GEM AND OFFENSE 
SCORES THREE RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS. JETS DROP THIRD CONSECUTIVE GAME.

 The Jets have landed.  
</P>
<P>
 After beginning the season with a 20-point victory at Buffalo, followed by an 
overtime victory against Denver, they've lost to Miami, Chicago and Sunday to 
Cleveland, 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Metcalf scored one of Cleveland's three rushing touchdowns and Eric 
Turner had an interception, a sack and forced a fumble in a game dominated by 
the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland improved to 4-1 for the first time since 1979 and are on top of the 
AFC Central Division.  
</P>
<P>
 And they have done it with defense. Through five games this year, the Browns 
have yielded just 58 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we had the ability to be a great defense," said Turner, a first-round 
pick in 1991 who has four interceptions this season, including one in each of 
the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets (2-3), playing without injured Boomer Esiason, lost their third in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked that this happened," Coach Pete Carroll said. "I'm shocked that 
this is what we look like today. All I can tell you is, we're still standing. 
We will not accept it. The players will not accept it. I can't. The coaches 
can't. We thought we had ourselves ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 About the best thing the Jets could say for themselves is that they spoiled 
what would have been Cleveland's second consecutive home shutout when Rob Moore 
made a one-handed, diving catch of a 24-yard pass from Jack Trudeau with seven 
minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first touchdown allowed by the Brown defense at home in nine 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the players the Jets have at the skill positions, it's nice to hold them 
to seven points," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows how good we can play? We want to find out and continue to get 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Testaverde exploited the Jet secondary, which was giving huge cushions 
to Cleveland receivers throughout the first half, and completed 21 of 36 passes 
for 257 yards without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pretty much had their way throwing the football against us today," 
Carroll said. "Our pressure was not good on the quarterback. Vinny was clean 
almost all day long, which made it easy for him to succeed in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, a rookie, caught seven passes for 105 yards for his second day with 
more than 100 yards this season.

COLTS' DAWKINS CATCHES ON; AFC: AFTER LECTURE ON SIDELINE LAST WEEK, HE 
RESPONDS WITH TWO KEY RECEPTIONS THAT SET UP TOUCHDOWNS IN 17-15 VICTORY OVER 
SEAHAWKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sean Dawkins learned his lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 He was lectured on the sideline last week after repeated drops and missed 
signals, but he set up two touchdown runs by Marshall Faulk with big catches 
Sunday as the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts (2-3) snapped a three-game losing streak, holding Seattle (3-2) to a 
pair of field goals by John Kasay and a safety through the first three 
quarters. The Seahawks got a 30-yard touchdown pass from Rick Mirer to Kelvin 
Martin on the second play of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins caught five passes for 99 yards from Jim Harbaugh, including a 
49-yarder that set up a five-yard touchdown run by Faulk late in the first 
quarter and a 36-yarder that led to Faulk's second touchdown in the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk, the AFC's leading rusher, gained 90 yards on 26 carries. He has run for 
459 yards this season; Pittsburgh's Barry Foster, who plays tonight against 
Houston, has 403. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbaugh, who angrily shouted at Dawkins after his miscues in a 21-14 loss to 
Cleveland, had no hesitation going back to the second-year receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't throwing the ball well and Sean caught some badly thrown passes," 
Harbaugh said. "He's a great receiver and for him to come back and have a great 
game proves that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dawkins: "There are obvious reasons . . . frustration, that's why people 
yell at each other. Those are the situations that were happening. The best 
thing to do is reconcile your differences and come back and talk about your 
problems and work through them. That's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 With Indianapolis leading, 10-8, Harbaugh hit Dawkins with the 36-yarder on 
the Colts' third play of the second half. A 14-yard pass to Roosevelt Potts and 
an 8-yard run by Harbaugh helped Indianapolis to the Seattle 3, and Faulk 
scored from the 1 on a fourth-down run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks pulled within two points on Martin's touchdown catch on a 67-yard 
drive late in the third quarter. Seattle reached the Indianapolis 33 with five 
minutes to go before Mirer was sacked on fourth down by Tony Siragusa. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of blitzing, which we didn't see them do a lot on the film," 
Mirer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they were going to keep doing it until we made them pay. They did it 
pretty well and got to us and made us make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle twice reached the Indianapolis 10-yard line in the first half but had 
to settle for field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kasay kicked a 42-yard field goal, the Colts tied the game on the next 
possession with a 45-yarder by Dean Biasucci. That drive was kept alive when 
Ronald Humphrey recovered a deflected Indianapolis punt for a first down.

FAIRPLEX; SOUTHERN WISH SEWS UP VICTORY IN THE POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard J. Stephen, a clothing manufacturer from Manhattan Beach, is a 
hands-on owner who likes to make his own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that trainer Wally Dollase had to persuade him to claim 
Southern Wish for $75,000 last February. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me this horse could become a stakes winner," Stephen said. "I said, 
'But he isn't one now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He is now. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old son of Lyphard's Wish ran on or near the lead the entire way 
and held off Seahawk Gold, ridden by G.F. Almeida, to win the $150,000 Pomona 
Handicap by one length at Fairplex Park on Sunday. Nancys French Fry and 
Fernando Valenzuela finished third in the 1 1/8-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Wish stalked pace-setter Lyphard Legend for the first half-mile, 
which was run in 47 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "With those kind of fractions down the backstretch, I knew they had to come 
catch me," said Corey Nakatani, who had the winning ride.  
</P>

 David Flores, who has clinched his sixth consecutive riding championship at 
Fairplex Park, was thrown from his mount, Kata Did, after the ninth race and 
took the rest of the day off. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old mare bobbled while taking a bad step during her cool-down, then 
galloped off after Flores was thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores got up under his own power and, although he received no treatment, he 
said his right hip was bothering him. He added that he hoped to ride today, the 
final day of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who had a winning ride aboard Something Nice in the seventh for his 
42nd victory of the 19-day meeting, leads Fernando Valenzuela by 13 winners 
going into the final day. Horse Racing Notes

BOOK REVIEW; A SOUTHERNER'S LIFE JUDGED TOO HARSHLY; IN THE TENNESSEE COUNTRY 
BY PETER TAYLOR ; ALFRED. A. KNOPF $21, 221 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gentility is like paint: It hides flaws without making them disappear. Writers 
in the genteel tradition, such as Peter Taylor, have always derived their power 
from this. The whiter and smoother the paint, the more shocking it seems when 
we finally glimpse cracks and rot underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Tennessee Country," Taylor's first novel since the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning "A Summons to Memphis," opens promisingly. The narrator, Nathan 
Longfort, grows up nearly smothered in gentility -- in Civil War nostalgia, in 
the privileges accorded a family that has produced a Tennessee governor and 
U.S. senator -- so it's natural that he should brood over symbols of escape and 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Among these are folklore tales of "vanished men." A banker walks out of his 
office on his lunch hour, leaving his top hat behind, and never returns. A 
farmer sets fire to his house so his family can collect the insurance and runs 
off with a woman from a neighboring farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Aubrey Bradshaw, sired out of wedlock by the brother of 
Longfort's maternal grandfather, the senator. Even though Longfort meets 
Bradshaw on only a few brief occasions -- most notably on the funeral train 
bringing the senator's body home from Washington, D.C., to Knoxville in 1916 -- 
he becomes obsessed with "Cousin Aubrey" as a kind of shadow self. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong train journey is an epic that Longfort, then 4, remembers all his 
life. The train hits a calf that has wandered onto the tracks; fires and 
derailments force halts; Longfort's uncles, who will die young of dissipation, 
get so drunk that at one point they are left behind. But Longfort's chief 
memory is of Bradshaw, the outsider, whose ostentatious grief irritates the 
adults and who glares at the boy with undisguised malevolence. 
</P>
<P>
 Why such anger? Longfort has to spend his childhood deciphering codes. 
References to Bradshaw's "irregular kinship" are only one of these. An uncle's 
suicide -- he shoots himself -- is called an accident. Longfort's father dies 
of a disease that is never named. His mother goes into ecstatic trances when 
reciting a romantic poem whose heroine, free and passionate, seems to be her 
alter ego. But why? 
</P>
<P>
 Only decades later does she tell Longfort that Bradshaw asked her to elope 
with him when she was 14. Longing for the intellectual life that Bradshaw 
seemed to represent, she agreed -- but Bradshaw, out of a mixture of cowardice 
and loyalty to his sole benefactor, her father the senator, backed out at the 
last minute. After that, she disdained him; Bradshaw, after the senator's 
death, himself became one of the "vanished men." 
</P>
<P>
 Longfort, encouraged by his mother, tries to become an artist. Instead, he 
winds up as a professor and a noted art historian. He views this as a terrible 
failure. Casting back for reasons, he speculates that having so many relatives 
die when he was a boy numbed his feelings. In high school and college, 
pressured to conform, he "learned too early that I was able to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 When his son does become a serious and successful painter, Longfort is doubly 
shamed. Retired by now, he intensifies his search for Bradshaw, who, he 
believes, has bravely taken the road less traveled, "plunging into the terra 
incognita from which no man willingly returns." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is where the novel falters. Longfort judges his life too harshly -- this 
is clear to us, but he doesn't seem to realize it even after exhaustive 
reflection. "In the Tennessee Country" can be read as the story of a neurotic, 
unbalanced by his mother's thwarted ambition and by a past so vivid that he can 
hardly get a grip on the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for a neurotic, Longfort has done amazingly well. He is a good husband and 
father; his academic career is more substantial than anyone could achieve 
without using his primary talents.  
</P>
<P>
 If we can't take Longfort's "failure" as seriously as he does, it's equally 
hard to think of so intelligent and likable a man as simply deluded. And if the 
modern-day scenes seem pale after Taylor's rich evocation of old-time 
Tennessee, it may be the author's grip that has loosened.

 The Great Mosquito Hunt aboard space shuttle Endeavour is over. The insect was 
sucked into the filter of a fan and squashed, astronauts reported to the 
Kennedy Space Center.They had been looking for the intruder since first 
spotting it after they arrived in orbit Friday. The insect interlude did not 
interfere with the mission of the shuttle's powerful radar system to examine 
the Earth's surface. The radar scanned more volcanoes, including Sicily's Mt. 
Etna and Hawaii's Kilauea.

 The White House and Democratic lawmakers bemoaned President Clinton's slumping 
political standing, angrily blaming his problems on voter anxiety and critics 
who appeal to the worst in people. In an off-color shot clearly aimed at 
Republicans, Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said Clinton's foes take the easy 
way out by blocking reforms."My Italian father used to say that the toughest 
thing to do is to try to build a barn. Any jackass can knock the barn door 
down. And we've got a lot of jackasses out there trying to do that." He did not 
name any names, or specifically mention the GOP. Republicans responded that 
their most visible effort to block the President's agenda was popular with 
voters and good for the nation. "Defeating the President's health care plan was 
the most positive thing that this Congress did. I'm proud of our role in it," 
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley."

NEWSWIRE: BODINE LAPS FIELD IN EASY VICTORY

<P>
 Geoff Bodine lapped the field Sunday on the way to victory in the Tyson-Holly 
Farms 400 at North Wilkesboro (N.C.) Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodine earned his third victory of the season and the 17th of his NASCAR 
Winston Cup career. He led 335 of the 400 laps on the five-eighth-mile oval, 
including the last 301. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time a driver has won by more than a lap since Harry Gant's 
dominating victory in September of 1991 at Dover, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great team," Bodine said. "The car was about as fast as I needed it to 
go all day. The setup was perfect, and that's what you need on these short 
tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Labonte, who won the April race at North Wilkesboro, finished second 
Sunday. He passed Bodine's Ford Thunderbird to regain his lost lap on lap 366, 
but fell back again as Bodine shot past on lap 382. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got outrun," Labonte said. "Our car was really good on longer runs, 
but I guess the No. 7 (Bodine) was too." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Winston Cup championship race, Rusty Wallace never was able to make up 
for an unscheduled tire stop that put his pit stops out of sequence early in 
the race. He wound up behind third-place Rick Mast at the end, and a late-race 
incident cost Dale Earnhardt some valuable ground as he slipped to seventh, two 
laps behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, who led early in the 400-lap race, got the five-point bonus for 
leading at least one lap and lost only nine points to Wallace, who now trails 
by 208 with four races remaining.

280.02, and earn his second victory of the season.

 Cruz Pedregon of Moorpark surprised John Force in the funny car final. 
Pedregon secured the victory in an Oldsmobile Cutlass when Force's Chevrolet 
Lumina broke at half-track.

 Despite the loss, it was a productive weekend for Force, who clinched his 
fourth NHRA funny car championship and earned a $50,000 bonus for setting an 
NHRA elapsed-time national record of 4.939.

 Scott Geoffrion of Aliso Viejo, Calif., earned his fifth pro stock victory of 
the season by defeating his Dodge teammate Darrell Alderman in the final. David

MONTREAL OUSTS THE SALSA FROM APSL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Salsa stretched Montreal to the limit, but the Impact held on to win, 2-1, 
in a sudden-death shootout of a mini-game that decided the American 
Professional Soccer League semifinal series Sunday night at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Diote's overtime kick sent Montreal into the APSL championship game 
against Colorado, Oct. 15 in Montreal. The Salsa's season comes to a 
frustrating end. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were tied, 1-1, at the end of the first shootout. Lloyd Barker gave 
the Impact a 1-0 lead, but Paulinho's kick tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa had won the regular game, 3-0, behind two goals from Paulinho, then 
battled the Impact to a scoreless tie in the 30-minute mini-game before 
Montreal wound up with its fifth victory over the Salsa this season in as many 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa Coach Rick Davis was disappointed it came down to a shootout. "I didn't 
like shootouts when I was a player in the old North American Soccer League," he 
said. He likes them even less now. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we ended up seeing was two evenly matched teams," he said. "In this 
scenario, Montreal prevailed. In another, the Salsa might have prevailed." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he also was disappointed because he was "delivered the best 
collection of players in the entire league . . . and we under-achieved from 
that standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis left his future as coach of the team undecided until he meets with team 
owner Dr. William De La Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he had to go all-out as a coach in the regulation game, while 
Montreal's one-game lead gave the Impact more opportunity to rest players for 
the mini-game. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal had defeated the Salsa, 2-1, Friday night in Montreal to take the 
advantage in the two-game semifinal series. The Salsa dominated the second 
semifinal game. The Salsa scored in the 40th minute of the first half when Thor 
Lee connected on a low, skidding kick that went in untouched. Lawrence Lozzano 
had the assist on a pass from the side that Lee took at mid-goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulinho controlled the second half. He scored the Salsa's second goal on a 
free kick in the 78th minute that sailed over the wall and bounced off the hand 
of Impact goalkeeper Pat Harrington. A foul by Impact defender Randy Doliscat 
set up the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulinho added another goal on a header into the left corner of the goal in 
the 86th minute, assuring the Salsa a victory in the regular game. Yari Allnutt 
had the assist on the goal.

ANN CONWAY: CELEBRATING IN LAP OF LUXOR-Y

<P>
 Sporting tuxes and furs fresh from the vault, the opera crowd celebrated the 
opening of the season on Saturday when they swept into the IBM Plaza in Costa 
Mesa for a "Supper on the Nile" following the production of "Aida" at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Opera Pacific supporters gathered under the stars to dine on "Nile 
Valley greens" and "Cairo pasta" at tables draped in black cloths and festooned 
with white orchids and gilded palm fronds. Even the black dining chairs had an 
Egyptian motif -- their tall backs were fluted, like lotus blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Overhead, a gold and black image of King Tut smiled at the throng -- who 
compared operatic notes and danced to the Clark Keen Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 (Minutes before guests arrived, Keen, who has played for "everybody from the 
Queen of England to Jimmy Stewart," he said, discussed with his band members 
which tunes he could theme toward the Nile-flavored event. "Let's do 'You 
Belong to Me,' " said one musician, singing, "See the Pyramids along the Nile . 
. . " They did.) 
</P>
<P>
 Guests included arts philanthropist Zee Allred (wearing mink over a pink 
Chanel), who returned recently from a trip to Egypt with the Orange County 
Protocol Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had lots of suppers on the Nile there," she said. " But we had to watch 
everything we ate and drank." 
</P>
<P>
 Opera buff Susie Meindl -- Opera Pacific's Guild Alliance Tours chairwoman -- 
spoke of her plan to take 14 guests to Egypt in November to watch an opening 
night performance of "Aida" at the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut in Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're even going to a black-tie gala with the president of Egypt that night," 
she said. "It is a dream come true for 'Aida' lovers." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of "Aida" lovers, arts activist Elaine Redfield, who has seen the 
Verdi masterpiece in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, pronounced the 
Costa Mesa version "the best ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Price, a self-proclaimed opera critic, "loved it," she said. "It was a 
very hung-together performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who thought there would be elephants or camels in the production came 
away disappointed. Not one beast marched across the stage at Segerstrom Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This production doesn't call for it," said Opera Pacific spokesman Tim Dunn. 
"We have loads of people on stage and incredible sets. Animals are rarely used 
on stage in opera these days." 
</P>
<P>
 ("Animal-rights activists go nuts," confided one guest. "Not to mention how 
expensive it is to feed, transport, protect and train the animals.") 
</P>
<P>
 Making her "Supper on the Nile" entrance with her daughter, Sally, was 
Jeanette Segerstrom, who underwrote the production with a hefty donation made 
in the memory of her late husband, Hal Segerstrom Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that blood and thunder in 'Aida' tonight," Jeanette Segerstrom said, 
smiling. "All of that pageantry! Hal would have loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests were gala co-chairwomen Karen Hardin and Marla Patterson; 
Gayle Widyolar (who is co-chairwoman of Opera Pacific's Impresario Circle with 
Segerstrom); David DiChiera, executive director of Opera Pacific; Gloria Gae 
Gellman, president of Opera Pacific's Guild Alliance; Eugenia and Don Thompson, 
who underwrote the performance's sur-titles; Connie and Karl Bergstrom, who 
underwrote the youth-night dress rehearsal for "Aida"; and voice teacher 
Maurice Allard. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 St. Joseph Hospital benefit: The more than 600 guests at Saturday night's 
"Renaissance Ball" on behalf of St. Joseph Hospital in Orange got two desserts 
instead of one at the event held at the Anaheim Hilton & Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 First up: cappuccino mousse served with edible chocolate cup and spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Second: songbird Melissa Manchester, who thrilled the black-tie crowd with 
mega-hits that included "Midnight Blue," "Theme from Ice Castles," "Whenever I 
Call You Friend," and "Come In from the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Gala guest Patty Mears, for one, was ecstatic. "The 'Theme from Ice Castles' 
is my favorite Manchester song," she said. "Whenever I think of that movie and 
that lovely blind girl twirling and twirling on her skates, I get motivated," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Headliners who charge thousands of dollars for their performances have been 
the hallmark of the St. Joseph Hospital gala since it was founded in 1973. Bob 
Hope was the first to entertain guests. In the following years, Dionne Warwick, 
Tony Bennett, Davis Gaines, Pam Dawber and the Pointer Sisters have taken their 
turns on the benefit stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We select the entertainer by committee," said Phil Schimmel, event chairman. 
"People love great entertainment and we want to give them what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Net proceeds of $150,000 from the $300-per-person gala will go toward the 
renovation and expansion of the hospital's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a fund-raising goal of $5 million for the emergency room expansion," 
Schimmel said. "We reached the $4-million mark in June. Now, we're shooting for 
five." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets were an easy sell for this year's event. And so was underwriting, 
Schimmel said. "I don't know if that means the economy is getting better or 
not. But I do know it was a great event last year (featuring Davis Gaines and 
Pam Dawber) and people couldn't wait to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Serving on the committee were Robert Armen, Kitty Bellis, Tania Bridgeman, 
Patricia Buttress, Beth Collins, Deborah Dickson and George Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other committee members were Amy Johnston, Donald Kiely, Melvyn Lieberman, 
Dennis Monge, Cindy Moore, Carol Richmond and Eugene Spiritus.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: HOME CONSTRUCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 FRAMED: This week, Freda Miller moves into her new house -- the first in 
fire-ravaged Laguna Beach to be rebuilt with a frame and roof made of steel 
instead of wood. . . . The 2,200-square-foot home on Skyline Drive, which 
replaces the one Miller lost last Oct. 27, was built more quickly and cost 15% 
less than a wood-frame house, says contractor Dieter Himmler of Curtiss 
Development. "I wanted everything to be fireproof as much as possible," says 
Miller. But the contractor notes that if the same intensity of fires hit Laguna 
again, the house would still burn. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW MODELS: Home buyers shopping in new developments in Orange County might 
find themselves looking at a computer rather than parading through model homes. 
. . . In an attempt to save money and sell homes fast, some Orange County 
builders are delaying the construction of models and instead using computer 
renderings designed by Headrick Chase & Associates, a San Juan Capistrano 
company. "We just developed this and the response has been great," says 
spokesman Brent Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "LOFICE": Increasing demand by buyers for home offices has prompted Mike 
Woodley of Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. to design a new room called a "lofice" -- 
a combination loft-office space. . . . The small, airy rooms, centrally located 
on a home's second floor, are offered in the California Coventry project in 
Foothill Ranch. Woodley says he got the idea in Mexico, where many houses have 
upstairs TV rooms. "The nice thing is that it's not isolated from the rest of 
the house," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 PALATIAL: One of the largest homes under construction in the county is located 
at 13 Harbor Island Drive, Newport Beach, according to city building director 
Raimar Schuller. The 6,200-square-foot home, owned by Rusty and Carol 
McDonnell, is being designed by local architect Eric Mossman. . . . The house 
is located down the street from the biggest home in Newport Beach, a 
12,000-square-foot house owned by investor George Yao. It's on the market for 
$13 million.

STREET SMART: LETTER PROMPTS REALIGNMENT OF TRAFFIC LIGHT ON EDINGER AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We want to alert you and your readers to a hazardous traffic light situation 
we've noticed in Santa Ana. At Edinger Avenue, there are two sets of signals 
with left-turn arrows that control traffic turning onto Ritchey Street. 
Left-turn lights control traffic onto both north and southbound Ritchey. 
</P>
<P>
 One set of left-turn lights for westbound Edinger to southbound Ritchey is 
suspended by a pole hanging across Edinger. The pole is short so the light ends 
up facing directly in front of fast-lane traffic westbound on Edinger. 
</P>
<P>
 We have seen many instances when opposing left-turn arrows appear at Ritchey 
and drivers in the westbound Edinger fast lane see this same arrow directly in 
front of them. They apparently mistake it for their own green light and go 
through the intersection and nearly collide with cars making their controlled 
left turn from eastbound Edinger onto northbound Ritchey. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a matter of time before an accident happens at this intersection. 
Who is responsible for making the traffic lights at this intersection safe? It 
seems the problem could easily be solved by simply pointing the confusing 
signal light toward the left-turn lane so westbound traffic doesn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed and Debbie Reyes 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of your letter, Santa Ana's traffic engineering department 
investigated the signals at Ritchey and Edinger and found that you were right. 
Vinh Nguyen, associate engineer of transportation for Santa Ana, said the 
westbound left-turn arrow signal was out of alignment.  
</P>
<P>
 City workers realigned the signal Sept. 22, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There have been accidents and near accidents traveling east on the Riverside 
Freeway while starting to enter the Costa Mesa Freeway. Lineups of autos often 
occur suddenly at this right-hand lane as autos quickly swerve from the middle 
lane into this exit lane to get into the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Other autos miss the lineup and slow down in the middle lane to cut into the 
exit lane traffic. Perhaps a sign is needed saying "Enter exit lane for Costa 
Mesa Freeway" about half a mile before the exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Willey 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 The transition from the eastbound Riverside Freeway to the southbound Costa 
Mesa Freeway is a temporary detour during the construction of the State Route 
91 (Riverside Freeway) toll road that connects with the Costa Mesa/Riverside 
Freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 A long white "V" was painted on the road indicating that drivers heading for 
the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway needed to merge into the far right lane, said 
Rose Orem, a spokeswoman for Caltrans. That striping was added to discourage 
motorists from cutting across at the last minute, she said. Caltrans also 
placed several guide signs before the interchange, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two large overhead signs at 1 1/4 miles and at three-fourths of a 
mile ahead of the interchange, Orem said. Another posted sign reads "55 Freeway 
to Newport Beach only" and has an arrow directing drivers to the far right 
lane, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a portable orange sign has been placed on the right shoulder 500 
feet before the connector, Orem said.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, she said, has done everything it can.  
</P>
<P>
 The construction project at the interchange should be complete by late 1995, 
Orem said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Can anything be done about the Raymond on-ramp to the westbound Riverside 
Freeway? It's a short ramp with a white line at its beginning that fools people 
into the idea it's for two cars.  
</P>
<P>
 I know this because I've seen many people nearly collide side by side. 
(Granted, that happens because some drivers are idiots, too.) Please have 
somebody check it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Rogers 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans believes that even though the ramp is short, the distance is 
sufficient for drivers to merge before they get on the freeway, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency will continue to monitor the on-ramp to determine if 
improvements are needed, she said.

GEORGE RAMOS: A SCHOOL OF HOPE IN NEIGHBORHOOD OF POVERTY, FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hope is a tough thing to come by on the streets of the Westlake district just 
west of Downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos, a 12-year-old who loves the Dodgers, hates to walk to school because 
he's constantly bothered by drug dealers and prostitutes. Amalia, a 7-year-old 
girl with expressive eyes, knows never to go out after dark because she's 
afraid she'll get shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Bayles, a 42-year-old aspiring merchant who would like to start a small 
dry cleaning business in Westlake, looks over prospective locations on 7th 
Street but shakes his head at the graffiti. "This is going to be tougher than I 
thought," he murmurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it is here that residents have banded together with the cops and 
area merchants to try and turn Westlake around. The effort to clean up the 
community is centered around a place that literally means hope -- Esperanza 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the effort are obvious. Westlake is one of the poorest, most 
densely populated neighborhoods in Southern California. Mostly comprised of 
Spanish-speaking immigrants, it's plagued by drugs, prostitution and street 
gangs. Rampart station officers -- who say more crime is committed in their 
patrol area than anywhere else in L.A. -- report shootings are common in 
Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will even steal clothes off the clothesline," says Rosa, a longtime 
area resident. So fearful is she and her neighbors near Union Avenue that they 
wouldn't talk unless a reporter promised not to use their full names. 
</P>
<P>
 When Esperanza opened last year, it became clear that a lot would have to be 
done to prevent the bad side of Westlake from swallowing up the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the narrow streets near it require widening to accommodate school 
buses. Used condoms and soiled syringes routinely turned up not far from 
Esperanza. School officials worry about some vagrants living in a vacant lot 
across an alley from the school. And there's the matter of making Wilshire 
Boulevard and 7th Street safe enough for the kids just to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents' fears were underscored earlier this year when a youngster, 
Kimberly Lopez, was struck by a car and killed at 7th and Union Street, in 
plain view of Esperanza. While they wait for proper speed signs lowering the 
speed limit on 7th, a homemade sign was erected near the spot where the 
youngster was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slow down," the sign pleads, "there is a school here." 
</P>
<P>
 The parents have decided they must protect their kids and the new school. "My 
commitment to this community is for my kids," one woman told me the other 
afternoon. "It's for them that I care what happens here." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, property owners such as Cathy Lee, whose family has owned 
businesses and buildings in Westlake for three generations, echo the concerns 
of area residents. "We want the area to be clean and safe," she says. "I'm 
afraid of the drugs and the gang activity. The police have been very 
cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she adds, "Right now, the cops are outnumbered by the gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 Past efforts to clean up Westlake have failed miserably, either because 
residents were afraid to speak out or they couldn't sustain their 
crime-fighting efforts. At times, area residents and merchants eyed each other 
with suspicion. "Some merchants just cheat you," Westlake resident Juan Pedroza 
lamented as he ignored the panhandlers on Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, promises community activist Berta Saavedra, things will be 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone understands this is going to be a long-term thing," she says. "The 
businesses are interested in making it a reality. The parents will be here (to 
help) because their kids are here." 
</P>
<P>
 Saavedra has helped organize community meetings at Esperanza to tackle 
numerous issues, including finding open playground space near the school and 
encouraging merchants and parents to meet informally to tackle nagging problems 
such as the dumping of trash at street corners. They talk up the school garden 
where donated flowers and plants are steadily growing. Another meeting is 
scheduled for this Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone I talked to admits that the new effort in Westlake faces an uphill 
struggle. With Los Angeles police resources already stretched to the limit, it 
will be left to the sometimes frightened parents, the gang-weary merchants and 
their allies to carry the day. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a lot of incentives for this fight. And I heard them the other 
afternoon as I fended off the druggies and the streetwalkers on Burlington 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a lawyer," 9-year-old Sergio says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be President of the United States," 6-year-old Ana Maria giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want a business of my own," admits Bayles, the would-be dry cleaner. 
"I want to be a part of something."

<P>
 During the housing boom of the 1960s, county officials changed the names of 
many roads to make them consistent throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads originally named after tiny towns and junctions -- such as Wintersburg, 
Smeltzer and Delhi -- were among those changed. The goal of the name changes 
was to make it easier for drivers to find their way around the county. Here are 
a few of the name changes: 02,31,22 Old name Current name Smeltzer Avenue 
Edinger Avenue Bay Boulevard Seal Beach Boulevard Stanton Avenue/ Beach

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
SHELTER PARTNERSHIP: 'LIFE-PRESERVER' KEEPS HOMELESS AGENCIES AFLOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The homeless population in Los Angeles has grown an estimated 10% annually for 
the last several years, according to figures from various city and county 
agencies. There are scores of missions, shelters and social service providers 
trying to stem the tide, despite unpredictable public and private funding and 
wavering support from a citizenry weary and impatient with an unending social 
crisis. One steady helper that the shelters and agencies can depend on is the 
Los Angeles-based Shelter Partnership, established in 1985 with the help of 
United Way and then-Mayor Tom Bradley's office. It has offered assistance to 
more than 200 homeless shelters and organizations throughout Southern 
California by finding grants and donors, acting as a clearinghouse for donated 
goods and services and developing community support. HOW THE PARTNERSHIP HELPS 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter Resource Bank 
</P>
<P>
 Solicits and distributes new, surplus merchandise from donors who receive tax 
deductions and free up warehouse space. Nearly $30 million in merchandise, from 
shampoo to socks to mattresses and bedding, has been distributed to more than 
200 social service organizations and shelters since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term, transitional and permanent housing development 
</P>
<P>
 Helps groups apply for private and public funding, secure zoning approval and 
building permits and establish other needed services such as job training, 
child care, drug rehabilitation and mental health care programs. Partnership 
efforts have linked more than $300 million in public and private funds to 
nonprofit homeless service providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Donor matchmaking 
</P>
<P>
 Connects private donors with nonprofit homeless service agencies. An annual 
"wish list" project, co-sponsored with such organizations as the L.A. County 
Bar Association, provides scores of agencies with donations of large-scale 
goods like refrigerators, computers, sewing machines and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Education and outreach 
</P>
<P>
 Conducts research and publishes studies about the homeless in Los Angeles 
County and sponsors events to educate local, state and national officials on 
the issue of homelessness. PRAISE FROM A PARTNER 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Singer, director of Jewish Family Services' Gramercy Place Shelter, a 
social service agency and shelter that's been open to homeless families 
throughout Los Angeles County since 1987, comments on Shelter Partnership 
support and resources: 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do they bring providers goods and supplies -- that alone has been 
worth many thousands of dollars to us, but they also point providers like us 
toward funding for services. They've helped us stay afloat on more occasions 
than one. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're an intervener, a connector -- that's their service. The partnership 
is a life-preserver for our families. They've linked us with some county 
rehabilitation money, and we're now adding onto our shelter 15 new beds, a head 
start site and an early infant development room." TO GET INVOLVED 
</P>
<P>
 Call (213) SHELTER, which translates to (213) 743-5837.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A MODEL FOR HOMELESS HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't obvious from the outside, but two Westminster buildings are a 
lifeline for eight families down on their luck. The housing is the result of a 
partnership among the city government, the private sector and community 
volunteers that should be studied by other public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For families without money, the housing is free, but tenancy is limited to six 
months. For those able to pay, a two-bedroom apartment rents for only $360 per 
month, with a maximum one-year stay.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials emphasized from the start that the housing was transitional, 
giving families a temporary place to stay while they got their lives in better 
shape. The limited stays are a good incentive for residents to get new or 
better jobs and move into more permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster City Council made the right move last year when it bought 
three rundown apartment buildings for $300,000 each. Volunteers from the 
community and from a builders' group called HomeAid renovated the buildings 
inside and out. Work on the third building is expected to begin shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the city's first good job helping the homeless or those about to 
lose shelter. Last May, Westminster found additional temporary housing for a 
dozen homeless people whom Caltrans evicted from a makeshift outdoor shelter 
near a San Diego Freeway exit. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeAid, too, has been an asset. A nonprofit offshoot of the Orange County 
chapter of the Building Industry Assn., it has built housing for hundreds of 
people threatened with homelessness. Unfortunately, a task force last year said 
that thousands are homeless in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Homelessness is a regional problem, and the other cities in the county seeking 
solutions should look at the Westminster example.

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: MORE WIDE RECEIVERS NEEDED 
</P>

<P>
 It's not just John Madden with his new $8-million annual paycheck to broadcast 
football games who is benefiting from the National Football League's decision 
to shift its NFC games to Rupert Murdoch's Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
 The move also has triggered an unexpected surge in demand for newer and bigger 
television antennas. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that most Fox affiliates remain on weaker UHF stations rather 
than VHF ones. 
</P>
<P>
 So football fans who don't have cable, and who live in areas where where the 
UHF signal is weak, are being pitched new antennas in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to Fox even prompted electronics retailer Radio Shack to launch a 
campaign directed at football fans that asks "Is your NFL on UHF?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rick Borinstein, vice president of merchandise marketing: "We wanted to 
have some fun with this." Fun, Fun, Fun in Court 
</P>
<P>
 A rare live "performance" by Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson took place in 
Downtown Los Angeles on Thursday. Only a handful of people where there, even 
though it was free. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that Wilson, who has rarely performed live during the past 30 
years, was a witness testifying in U.S. District Court during a pretrial 
hearing involving a lawsuit filed against him by Mike Love, his cousin and 
fellow Beach Boy. Love is seeking royalties and credit for songs he says he 
helped write. 
</P>
<P>
 During questioning over the writing of the song "Good Vibrations," Wilson 
asked U.S. District Judge William J. Rea: "Is it appropriate in this situation 
to hum a melody to get a point across?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rea gave his consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, according to a court transcript: "witness sang melody." A Banner Day for 
NBC 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's 40-foot scaffolding tower erected in Downtown Los Angeles for use in its 
O.J. Simpson trial coverage has attracted a lot of attention from passersby, 
not all of it the kind the network welcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a banner appeared briefly on the tower reading: "No Contract, No 
Viewers." 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out the message is courtesy of the National Assn. of Broadcast Employees 
and Technicians, whose members are working without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesting members of the union also have been visible lately through the new 
street-level window behind NBC's "Today Show" set. Briefly. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino promises it will use "only nontoxic, 
biodegradable cleaning products in its rooms, casino, restaurant and laundry 
facilities." . . . A Geritol-sponsored survey found that three out of four 
people answered "Bob Barker is the TV game show host most likely to take 
Geritol." . . . Weirdest investment of the week: A subsidiary of media giant 
Capital Cities/ABC has become the largest minority shareholder in a fresh 
flower distributor. . . . The Learning Annex is offering a course in November 
on becoming an independent contractor titled "Fire Your Boss."

 Carl's Jr./Green Burrito to Open: The Orange County-based Carl's Jr. and Green 
Burrito fast-food restaurant chains will open their first joint eatery 
Wednesday in a Carl's Jr. restaurant at 21704 S. Avalon in Carson.The store is 
one of six being converted to sell both Carl's Jr. hamburgers and Green 
Burrito's Mexican-style food. Executives at Anaheim-based Carl's Jr. said the 
experiment will be considered a success if the combined menus bolster overall 
revenue without siphoning off existing sales. Several regional fast-food 
companies, including Long John Silver's and Arby's, are experimenting with 
serving two brands of food under the same roof. The idea of putting Carl's Jr. 
and Green Burrito under a single roof was a pet project of Carl's founder Carl 
N. Karcher. He believed in the idea so strongly that it cost him the 
chairmanship. The board of directors voted to replace him last October after it 
initially refused to go along with the idea of testing Green Burrito operations 
in their restaurants. Karcher was later restored as chairman emeritus, and the 
company relented on the Green Burrito test idea in June.

 Sam's Club Workers to Vote on Union: About 150 workers at Sam's Club in 
Fullerton will vote Friday on whether they want to be represented by the 
Teamsters union. If the majority votes for representation, the store will be 
the first owned by retail giant Wal-Mart Inc. to become unionized. 
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, which operates 430 Sam's Club membership warehouses 
and 2,300 Wal-Mart discount department stores nationwide, has so far defeated 
all efforts to organize its workers.

 Furniture Makers Workshop: The Assn. of Woodworking and Furnishings Suppliers 
is leading a workshop today to explore water-based adhesives for furniture 
manufacturers as an alternative to the popular but environmentally harmful 
adhesives now in use.The conference, designed to help Southern California 
furniture makers comply with environmental regulations, is co-sponsored by the 
Institute for Research and Technical Assistance and various environmental 
groups. The Air Quality Management District has pressured furniture 
manufacturers to abandon the use of volatile organic compound-based adhesives, 
which contribute to smog levels, and to phase out the use of 
trichloroethane-based adhesives, which contribute to ozone depletion. The 
workshop will begin at 8:15 a.m. at the Southern California Edison Customer 
Technology Application Center in Irwindale.

THEATER REVIEW; RECAPTURING 'SHOW BOAT'S' POWER, GLORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WINER-BERNHEIMER, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wooden water barrels are clearly marked -- "colored only" and "whites 
only" -- at the start of the massive Harold Prince reconsideration of "Show 
Boat," which opened Saturday night with a record $75 ticket top at the Gershwin 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours (and 40 years of progress) later, the clothes are freer and the 
dances are cheekier, and most main characters have grown wiser with their gray 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a sign at the boat's box office -- "colored only balcony" -- to 
signal what has not changed by the close of this landmark musical of 1927. It 
seems racism, like the "Ol' Man River" used with such head-banging frequency 
through the production, also keeps rolling along. 
</P>
<P>
 And here we have the hinge that holds this superficially old-fashioned revival 
together with such moving and unsanitized modern power -- and what makes the 
racial protests against the show in Toronto last year so terribly misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, who has directed only new material until now, takes on America's first 
serious musical as a haunting study in parallel universes, the separate lives 
of African Americans and whites together. As the song says (and says, and 
says), "Colored folks work while the white folks play."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, political context is hardly unexpected from the director of 
"Sweeney Todd" and "Cabaret." What is surprising, however, is the bold 
plainness of the production, the resistance to conspicuous gizmos and gadgets 
from the man who gave the world "Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince has done much intelligent interpolating and exhaustive shuffling of 
Jerome Kern's wonderful songs and Oscar Hammerstein's sprawling book, 
researching almost a dozen different versions, including the three movies, to 
strengthen the narrative, telescope the unwieldy second act into two montage 
fashion shows, and enrich the orchestrations.  
</P>
<P>
 The results are less revolutionary, on the surface, than what we might 
anticipate in this era of mega-shows and flashy revivals. Instead, this "Show 
Boat" is more of a thoughtful restoration, a solid structural girding, than the 
sort of exquisite reinvention playing up the block at "Carousel." Along with 
Eugene Lee, his designer from "Sweeney Todd," Prince has chosen to show us how 
rough-hewn and unglamorous these "floating theater palaces" really were. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage is flanked by huge sepia-and-black scenes of the Mississippi levee, 
stern but evocative images suggestive of daguerreotypes. The boat is made of 
raw wood and, except for some rippling water projected on the facade and one 
starry night for courtship, life on the river, even for whites, is pretty short 
on magic. 
</P>
<P>
 This feels right. The story, after all, has always been fraught with 
contradictions -- the tension between the operetta style and profound emotions, 
the evolutionary pull between unmotivated musical-comedy entertainment and the 
great musicals to come. Jovial Cap'n Andy keeps saying what a "big happy 
family" he has in his theatrical troupe -- while bigotry, abandonment and 
miscegenation tear five couples apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince makes us feel all this in the contrasting performance styles, the 
strict rhythmic boundaries in the white operetta and vaudevillian world, the 
elasticity in the black songs. A highlight is "Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun," a 
stunning dirge of foreshadowing for Queenie (the terrific Gretha Boston). 
</P>
<P>
 Queenie, you may recall, is married to Joe, the stevedore and one-man Greek 
chorus bestowed with the show's most enduring anthem, "Ol' Man River," which 
Prince uses as the connective tissue of the piece. If Michel Bell were not so 
sensitive and his bass-baritone so formidable, his spectral omnipresence -- 
amplified to resonate with what seems to be a microphone down his throat -- 
would be more than a little shameless. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the cast is utterly competent, a few are considerably more. Lonette 
McKee has a husky, earthy beauty as Julie, the performer doomed by her mixed 
blood, but not before she is elegantly ripe in "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" and 
rips us quietly apart with "Bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Luker has a graceful intelligence and understated vibrato as Magnolia, 
the prized daughter who runs off to temporary ruin with the dashing gambler, 
Gaylord, but not before they sing "Make Believe" and "You Are Love" and 
introduce the delightful -- and surprisingly racy -- "I Have the Room Above 
Her" (from the admired 1936 film). 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Jacoby seems a bit mature to star on the boat as the juvenile lead, but 
he has a dark, focused voice and the persuasively rakish charm of a sympathetic 
river rat. John McMartin, the serious actor who replaced Robert Morse as Cap'n 
Andy, is game, but pretty forced, in the physical comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The marvelous and gritty Elaine Stritch is underutilized and stuck in a 
straitjacket in the Miss Grundy-as-mother character, Parthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Stanley and Joel Blum aren't especially funny as the second bananas, 
but she can sing ("Life Upon the Wicked Stage") and he can dance. And what a 
pleasure to have Prince working with a gifted choreographer for the first time 
since he had Michael Bennett. Susan Stroman's big, strapping dances actually 
seem to bubble up from the stage, as cakewalks turn to cancans and white people 
steal the Charleston from the blacks. Also Florence Klotz's hundreds of lavish 
costumes artfully reflect the passage of time, at least as effectively as does 
Prince in his montages. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince loads the stage at times with unnecessary crowd business, and we do get 
worn down by sincerity overload. But he has given us a "Show Boat" that fills 
us with awe about the masters working on Broadway 16 years before "Oklahoma!" 
This is more than a curious missing link in the development of the American 
musical theater. It is a primary source of American life.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; A NIGHT OF SPIRIT, WARMTH AND 'ANGELS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neil Young's annual Bridge School benefit concert is about as close as you can 
get in contemporary pop music to actually meeting performers without having a 
backstage pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians don't stroll the grounds of the outdoor Shoreline Amphitheatre 
between sets the way they do at some folk festivals, but the most imaginative 
of the artists, free of pop's normal commercial considerations and restraints, 
use their half-hour on stage to reveal themselves in ways that make you feel 
you have shared a personal moment. 
</P>
<P>
 And those warm, enriching instances abounded on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking sequence in the five-hour, mostly acoustic affair began near 
the end when Young played "Sleeps With Angels," the bittersweet song he wrote 
for Kurt Cobain following the Nirvana leader's suicide in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Young followed with an emotionally charged version of "Hey Hey, My My," the 
1979 song that includes a line quoted by Cobain in the latter's suicide note: 
"It's better to burn out than to fade away." 
</P>
<P>
 Though over the years Young has frequently denied the self-destructive 
interpretation that many young rockers have given those words, he has refused 
to discuss the meaning of the song since Cobain's death. 
</P>
<P>
 But he sang it with such biting authority on Saturday -- forcefully countering 
the quoted line with the words "once you've gone, you can't come back" -- that 
it was a clear rejection of the "live-hard, die-young" philosophy. The song 
instead stood as testimony to the positive, liberating qualities of heartfelt 
rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The song took on an even greater note of celebration on this night because of 
the generosity of spirit that the event is founded on. 
</P>
<P>
 The rear of the stage was occupied throughout the evening by more than a dozen 
students from the Bridge School, most of them seated in wheelchairs with family 
members and school staff at their sides. Young's wife Pegi co-founded the 
school in 1986 as a way to provide tailored educational programs for children 
with severe speech and other physical impairments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Young began this acoustic concert series eight years ago to help 
fund the school, audiences have been treated to all-star guests delivering 
adventurous half-hour sets, most of them highlighted by new songs or 
seldom-heard old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the guests over the years have included such top names as Bruce 
Springsteen and Elton John, the chance this year to see Young alone would have 
been worth the $25 admission. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran rock singer-songwriter, whose "Sleeps With Angels" album is one of 
the year's most acclaimed works, hasn't toured since last fall. One reason is 
that the album, a series of reflections on love and the deaths of some people 
close to him, is so personal that he felt uncomfortable doing anything that 
looks like promoting its sale. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year's concert lineup was so strong that the organizers added a 
second show for Sunday at the 21,000-seat venue, and it too sold out. Besides 
Young, the bill each day included Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, who haven't 
toured since 1991; the industrial rock band Ministry, which has been off the 
road since 1992, and -- most important -- Pearl Jam, which hasn't stepped on 
stage since a brief spring tour. 
</P>
<P>
 After conventional opening sets by singer-songwriter Pete Droge and Mazzy 
Star, Ministry's Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker stirred things up with one 
who-would-ever-have-guessed selection after another. The set began with 
Jourgensen -- the master of sonic assault -- leading us through a 
psychedelic-tinged rendition of Bob Dylan's tender "Lay Lady Lay." The 
singer-guitarist proceeded through numbers by Ten Years After and the Grateful 
Dead and topped things off by playing harmonica (!) on "Midnight Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the middlebrow musings of the Indigo Girls, Petty and the 
Heartbreakers played in a much harder and more satisfying style than they have 
on their recent recordings. The set's highlights were "Time to Move On" and 
"You Don't Know How It Feels," songs from an album due next month. Both exhibit 
the tension and introspection that recall Petty's best '70s and '80s work. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam largely sidestepped its familiar material in favor of one new song, 
"Corduroy," and rarities from the Seattle group's repertoire that have never 
appeared on album, including a disarming daydream about Christmas memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significantly, singer Eddie Vedder seems to have recovered nicely from a 
period of self-exile. The usually active performer sat motionless on a stool 
the entire set, but he sang with renewed passion and determination. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the group's hit "Daughter," Vedder offered a few lines from 
"American Pie," the 1971 Don McLean song about the death of rock star Buddy 
Holly. In this context, Vedder used it as both a sweet ode to Cobain and as a 
reflection on his own disillusionment in the weeks after the suicide -- a time 
when the pressures on him made him question his own musical future. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Jack Irons, a longtime friend of the band, sat in on percussion, there 
is apparently no decision on a permanent replacement for drummer Dave 
Abbruzzese, who left the band earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by the trio Crazy Horse, Young devoted his set to songs from "Sleeps 
With Angels." He was joined by Pearl Jam for the finale, "Piece of Crap," the 
marvelously lighthearted tune about how hard it is to get anything of honest 
value these days, whether in music or in the neighborhood hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a moment of supreme irony. In a contemporary rock world where loyalties 
are normally divided across both generational and stylistic lines, Young is 
someone all fans can believe in. It's his vital, creative spirit that helps 
make the Bridge School benefits arguably the most consistently rewarding event 
on the pop calendar.

THEATER REVIEW; A DANCING ODE TO THE MUSIC OF WORK; 'STOMP' OPENS THE NEW 
SEASON OF THE UCLA CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS WITH A HUB CAP SERENADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 If "Stomp" -- the dance/theater/bang-or-jump-on-what-ever-you-find ode to 
rhythm -- is about anything, it's about finding unexpected music in everyday 
tedium. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-percussive, new vaudevillian theater piece began in the early 1980s as 
part of the act of a British busking band called Pookiesnackenburger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stomp" had its official premiere at Edinburgh in 1991 and has since played 
much of Europe and been a hit off Broadway. On Friday at the Wadsworth Theater, 
it opened the 1994-95 season of the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts as part 
of UK/LA '94; next is a 19-city American tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight appealing performers all dress in work boots and the clothes of 
people who labor with their bodies and hands. But their real bond is in their 
curiosity and their joyful response to the potentiality of sound that they find 
in virtually every object on the littered stage. They make symphonies from hub 
caps, brooms, newspapers, trash cans, the tat-tatting of wooden matches rubbing 
against their paper boxes, even from a corrugated metal wall. Although their 
music is more dance club than theater music, the spirit is pure Gershwin (Ira, 
that is), as in, "I got rhythm . . . who could ask for anything more?" 
</P>
<P>
 The dramas are tiny; the human interaction minimal. One dancer may bristle at 
another's hot-dog moves or lack of ingenuity, but essentially they enjoy 
playing together, displaying the power of people who move well and love doing 
it. No whistles are thrown at the two women; no distinction is made between 
their innate sexuality and the men's. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers never give their names; they come to be known to us, variously, 
as the cute one with the curly hair, the angry one with the flip in his bang, 
the tomboy, the womanly one, the goofy one with a flat-top cut, the guy with 
earring and ponytail, the embittered Bolshevik. 
</P>
<P>
 The group leader, an angel-faced, ruddy-cheeked Brit named Luke Cresswell, has 
the Bill Irwin gift of silently manipulating and engaging an audience. 
Cresswell co-created "Stomp" along with co-director Steve McNicholas. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nods to the great, inventive dancers of the past; dances on sand and 
in little puddles of water recall, for instance, Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. 
"Stomp" also has links to more narrative, contemporary Broadway choreographers 
such as Susan Stroman who haul found objects into numbers just for the hell of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the performers retain their idiosyncrasies when executing simultaneous 
steps, so too do the standard-issue objects that they stomp with come in 
different shapes and materials and, most importantly, different timbres. While 
others push average mops, the Bolshevik (perhaps to ease his inferiority) 
enters with a super-sized, two-handled one, which he commandeers like a dog 
sled. A bunch of workers soon discovers that rubber tubes of different lengths 
produce different notes when banged on the floor, providing percussive melodies 
that surprise and delight.  
</P>
<P>
 Other numbers evoke war dances, sword fights, childhood games of chicken with 
made-up rules. In the most electrifying bit, two men strapped like window 
washers by belts and a rope to a high grid rappel their way down it, swinging 
like Spiderman, drumming every object in sight, dancing in mid-air, floating on 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 In another, the men strap huge oil drums to Robocop boots and stride, 
thundering, across the stage. This dance says something about the ability to 
soar above hard labor, about not letting anything weigh you down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stomp" is a meditation on the primal desire to entertain ourselves, on 
camaraderie and natural artistry. But it has the most to say about manual work 
-- the joy in work, the power in work and the music in work. It says the music 
is always there if you can find it. It proves every theory on tedium and 
uniformity wrong and triumphs in the infinite variety of the human experience. 
</P>

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; A PEACEFUL EXISTENCE ON 'ECHO STREET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to taking risks, public television usually teeters perilously on 
the cutting edge of convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, public-station KCET's decision to air Susan Mogul's "Everyday Echo 
Street: A Summer Diary" is as refreshing as her 1993 film itself, in which she 
and her Highland Park neighbors co-star as an extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of "family" we should be seeing more often to offset TV's constant 
depictions that equate Angelenos with warring factions in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing praise at Mogul's film can raise unrealistic expectations for such a 
low-budget ($20,000), inelegant documentary whose very petiteness is what makes 
it perfectly tailored for the small screen. Yet this video journal -- or 
"docu-poem," as Mogul calls it -- is indeed something to cheer, at once loads 
of fun and the kind of intimate insider's journey through a Los Angeles 
neighborhood that you seldom see on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mogul said by phone recently that her film has no social agenda, it 
tends to unify segments of society rather than polarize them. It's 32 minutes 
of seductive ordinariness -- an affirmation, home-movie style, of just how 
transfixing the peaceful, everyday trivia of life can be. 
</P>
<P>
 More transfixing even than nightly news footage showing Angelenos as victims 
or oppressors. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Mogul is a kind of outsider/insider, a former New Yorker who has 
lived in Los Angeles for more than two decades, the last 13 years alone in a 
one-bedroom apartment on largely working-class Echo Street, a rare Jew in a 
section of town that is predominantly Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Participant as well as observer, she is seen leaning out her window in a sort 
of signature stance, as if inhaling the neighborhood that she is about to 
chronicle so affectionately on videotape with her hand-held camera. "My name is 
Susan, and I live alone," she says at the start of the film. "I'm 43, and I've 
spent most of my adult life living alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Well . . . not entirely alone. In addition to the 13-year-old neighbor 
practicing her violin, we meet Mogul's friends, the Sanchezes, who operate 
nearby Armando's restaurant, and Eddie (the Animal) Lopez, a talkative 
ex-heavyweight boxer with spaces in his front teeth beneath an enormous 
mustache. We meet the guys at Abdul Shell station, the Gonzalez sisters, the 
"UPS guy" and the mailman. 
</P>
<P>
 And we see Rick -- who "lives there across from the mail boxes" -- ask Mogul 
out for a platonic evening of country dancing. She accepts, and this scheduled 
date provides an opportunity for her to tenderly recall the death of a 
boyfriend in a car crash years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone on camera here seems remarkably loose, as if speaking only to Mogul, 
not her lens. "I was dealing with people who are a part of my life," Mogul said 
on the phone about the comfort level of her subjects. "And I don't think people 
took me seriously. You know, here was little Susan with her camera. Sometimes 
being a woman can work to your advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 More than merely a friendly neighborhood tour, though, this is a highly 
personalized film threaded by the filmmaker's self-effacing wit and candid 
introspection about her life as she settles into middle age.  
</P>
<P>
 Mogul's exploration of her self-identity began at an early age, as evidenced 
by old home-movie footage of her parents' 35th wedding anniversary party that 
introduces a separate, unaired video sampler of her other films. While dancing 
with her mother in front of the camera her father is operating, a 6-year-old 
Susan suddenly lifts her dress and pulls down her underpants. 
</P>
<P>
 Her self-exposure now assumes a different form. From her window tonight, she 
observes male and female pigeons "doing it," and jokes (apparently) about being 
jealous. "They have such a good sex life. They have a sex life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, we're introduced to a man Mogul met in the produce section of 
Ralph's. He becomes a romantic interlude, although Mogul frets when he waits 
more than a week to phone her after their first date. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the film's whimsical charm comes from Mogul's willingness to face the 
camera herself in unflattering moments. Looking like a candidate for embalming, 
she says after pulling herself from bed: "It's 8:30 in the morning . . . 
without coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 No one else does that in front of a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work has never fit neatly into any category," Mogul said when asked to 
define what she does. "It's really about filming this everyday banal stuff and 
looking at the uniqueness of it, the absurdity of it, the humor of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Uniqueness, absurdity, humor -- presented by Mogul in ways that are accessible 
to middle-brow audiences. Maybe that's not so risky after all. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Everyday Echo Street: A Summer Diary" airs at 10:30 tonight on KCET-TV 
Channel 28.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; AFTER SOLID BEGINNING, BLUES FEST FIZZLES IN DANA POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a full day of predominantly solid and gratifying blues, the second 
annual Orange County Blues Festival limped to an unsatisfying finish Saturday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of building to a rousing climax, closing sets by James Cotton and the 
Brian Setzer Orchestra were sabotaged by uneven pacing and mismatched 
instrumentation, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, the first installment of the two-day, 20-band event showcased a 
variety of worthwhile local and national acts and was a relative bargain. Held 
at Doheny State Beach on two stages, the opening day went smoothly, with each 
band performing as scheduled for about an hour. A VIP weekend pass went for 
only $25, or one-day tickets were available in advance for $10. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated crowd of about 6,000, including families with small children, 
were seen wandering freely, checking out a variety of arts and crafts. The food 
offerings -- including catfish, barbecued meats, pizza, burgers and cuisine 
from Jamaica, India and Lebanon -- sent a wonderful aroma floating through the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 There was good music in the air, too, especially from the Long Beach-based 
Rhythm Lords. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating the release of its excellent debut CD, the band delivered an 
inspired afternoon set of roots-rock, blues and rockabilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering a mixture of Los Lobos, the Wild Cards and Cadillac Tramps, the 
quartet -- led by songwriter-guitarist-vocalist Dale Peterson -- brought a 
large crowd to its feet, dancing and singing along from the opening, "Wait on 
Time" through the set-closing "Can't Deny the Past". 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting a plain white T-shirt, goatee and wide grin, Peterson projected a 
modest, unassuming presence as he reeled off his spirited guitar licks.  
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Max Bangwell and his self-titled three-piece band played an aching set 
of straight-ahead Chicago blues, highlighted by gritty versions of "Spoonful" 
and "Kill the Rooster." When hearing his coarse but emotive voice, one could 
practically feel the veins bulging in his neck as he reached for each note. 
</P>
<P>
 Bangwell's band was joined around mid-set by Mississippi Millie McLaine, a 
Delta blues singer who added some sassy sensuality with her charismatic 
strutting and dancing. Her elastic, booming vocals during "Done Somebody Wrong" 
and Jimmy Reed's "Shame, Shame, Shame" created a rush of excitement both on 
stage and in the attentive audience. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mississippi Millie burned up the stage, pop-jazz-blues artist Maria 
Muldaur was equally enchanting but more relaxed in serving up a warm, enriching 
set of both new and old blues-based material. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly effective from her earlier albums were J.J. Cale's "Cajun Moon" 
(in which Muldaur's evocative crooning was complemented by guitarist Jon 
Woodhead's sharp but eerie licks) and Percy Mayfield's "Please Send Me Someone 
to Love" (a slow-burning ballad of longing and desperation). 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of songs drawn from her new "Meet Me at Midnite" release, the Bonnie 
Raitt-ish "Trouble With Love" and the title track (no, not that other "midnite" 
song, which she bypassed this day), emphasized a demanding but earnest lover's 
call for respect and tenderness. Even though Muldaur now strains to sing the 
high notes, she has lost little of the fire and grainy texture that makes her 
voice so valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-billed James Cotton, the 59-year-old Mississippi native and premiere 
harpist, was a big disappointment. His singing, robust and focused throughout 
his new "Feel the Blues" release, was rambling and muddled on this night. His 
normally emotionally charged vocals were undecipherable at times, and were 
particularly frustrating during his old favorite, "Rocket 88." 
</P>
<P>
 Also problematic was the set's full-throttle, take-no-prisoners pace. Racing 
through their set, Cotton and his band rarely downshifted during songs 
requiring slower nuances, such as "Oh Baby, You Don't Have to Go." Cotton's 
guitarist, Reco McFarland, didn't help matters either, by constantly reeling 
off rapid-fire licks void of emotion and imagination.  
</P>
<P>
 Only briefly, during his signature song "Mojo", was Cotton able to capture the 
magic for which he's known. Full of emotional intensity and flair, his 
harmonica came alive, sending notes skyward to the heavens above.  
</P>
<P>
 Closing the first day's performances, the Brian Setzer Orchestra deserves 
points for effort and experimentation, but received failing grades for delivery 
and execution.  
</P>
<P>
 Combining rockabilly with big-band swing, Setzer now plays guitar and sings 
while fronting a 17-piece band, known as his "Rockin' Big Band." While the 
former Stray Cat's passion for this musical style is admirable, he may want to 
retool his sound in search of more complementary interplay among the players. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, the native New Yorker's stinging guitar leads frequently overpowered 
the softer shadings of the horn and rhythm section. Once, during "Sittin' On It 
All the Time," the disparate sounds collided, resulting in a shrieking collage 
of out-of-sync noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Also appearing on Saturday were the King Brothers, Barrelhouse, the Lifters, 
Robert Lucas and Tyrone Anthony.

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; RED RIBBONS OF AWARENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the West Coast chairpersons of the Ribbon Project, we must comment on 
Michael Kearns' Counterpunch about the 46th annual nighttime Emmy Awards ("Take 
the 'A' Word Out of the Closet," Sept. 19). We know and respect Kearns and even 
agree with him that the word AIDS was conspicuously missing from the broadcast. 
However, this is no reason to bash the red ribbons, and certainly no reason to 
bash the people who wore them. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure it is true that there are some celebrities and production personnel 
who wear the ribbons without thought for their meaning and without doing 
anything else for the cause. However, we believe this is the exception, not the 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight against AIDS has been going on for more than 13 years, and very 
little has been accomplished in the way of a cure. To stop wearing the ribbons 
now would send a message of defeat. Remember, we are not wearing these 
AIDS-awareness ribbons to impress each other; we are trying to reach the public 
around the country and the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time a ribbon makes someone think about the disease, make a donation, 
volunteer time or even have some compassion for a person with AIDS, then the 
ribbon has accomplished its goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Michael, don't bash Angela Lansbury, who has donated countless hours to 
this cause. Don't bash Aaron Spelling -- he got "And the Band Played On" on the 
air . And don't bash Faye Dunaway, who arrived wearing her ribbon without 
having to be reminded. 
</P>
<P>
 And please don't confuse the issue of AIDS awareness with the issue of gay 
rights. Both issues are extremely important but completely separate. To combine 
the issues negates all the work we've all done making the public understand 
that AIDS is not "the gay disease," that AIDS does not discriminate by race or 
gender or sexual preference. 
</P>
<P>
 We applaud the people who still wear a red ribbon at a public event, and we 
ask those who have stopped to please reconsider. If the award-show producers 
are not going to "say the word," then the ribbons may be all we've got. We must 
all imagine, demand and work for a cure.

OPERA; VERDI'S 'AIDA' LUMBERS BACK TO ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opera Pacific was never what one would call an adventurous company. Still, 
David DiChiera and friends used to take an occasional cautious step away from 
the so-called standard repertory. Not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The season opened Saturday night with Verdi's "Aida," just as it had -- under 
better conditions -- in 1988. Other beloved, emphatically familiar warhorses 
monopolize the horizon at the Performing Arts Center: "La Traviata" in January, 
"Madama Butterfly" and "The Magic Flute" in March. The modest survey of French 
masterpieces has been put on hold, and the 20th Century remains uncharted 
territory in deepest, darkest Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain of hyper-timidity might have been mitigated, to a degree, by a 
brilliant inaugural performance. But this "Aida" -- gaudily decorated, clumsily 
staged and badly sung -- didn't even come close. The push-button cheers of the 
dressy, not-too-attentive first-nighters were inspired, no doubt, by Verdi, not 
by his local violators. 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive aspect of the production, for better or worse, involved 
Douglas Schmidt's lavish, fussy, cumbersome, pretty-pretty sets, designed for a 
staging by Sam Wanamaker at the San Francisco Opera in 1981. With their 
constantly rearranged, constantly glowing pillars, their endlessly ornate 
frippery indulgences and pompously portentous statues, the designs suggest 
nothing so much as quaint illustrations from a very old edition of the Victor 
Book of the Opera. Memphis, Thebes and the Pharaohs looked a lot better here 
six years ago in the spacious, stylized decors of Wolfram Skalicki. 
</P>
<P>
 The costumes seen on Saturday, attributed to Lawrence Casey, look like the 
result of an indiscriminate warehouse raid. Aida self-consciously modeled a 
thigh-baring sarong (her alternate in the role, who can conjure no images of 
Dorothy Lamour, must wear something else). The princess Amneris strutted her 
ample stuff in voluminous evening gowns. The others settled for generic 
postcard-exotica. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ross A. Perry was listed as stage director, he functioned essentially 
as traffic cop. Given the hand-me-down Vegas ambience, principals culled mostly 
from the stand-and-lurch school of operatic acting and a chorus that seemed 
reluctant to move and sing at the same time, one couldn't blame him. 
</P>
<P>
 No one bumped into anyone, and no one fell down. Even though a man-drawn 
chariot began its exit in the Triumphal Scene before discharging its heroic 
passenger, there were no obvious accidents. One had to be grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 John DeMain conducted with stoic rigidity, unfazed, it would seem, by the 
silliness on the stage, by the inequities in the pit, by the chatter out front, 
by the tenor's rhythmic liberties, by the soprano's limited breath, by the 
mezzo's pitch problems, by the baritone's wobble under pressure or by the 
chorus' instability. At the very least, this maestro has strong nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Bell brought a firm, resonant, pliant basso to the brief rantings of the 
high priest of Egypt. Unfortunately, when the best singer in the cast is 
Ramfis, you know the cast shouldn't be singing "Aida." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Guleghina, a Bolshoi Aida in the agonized Vishnevskaya tradition, cut an 
appealing figure in her tight little spangly dress and bare feet, though 
crawling on her knees in the Nile Scene represented something of a challenge. 
Her big, bright and sometimes beautiful soprano encountered difficulties with 
the arching line, however, and her ability to float ethereal pianissimo tones 
proved unreliable. Like many a Verdian slave before her, she nearly came to 
grief on the cruelly exposed C that caps "O patria mia." 
</P>
<P>
 Lando Bartolini partnered her as a loud, crude and apparently bored Radames 
whose chief distinction seemed to be the highest elevator-shoes this side of 
Giulietta Simionato. 
</P>
<P>
 Tichina Vaughn introduced a loud, dull and shrill Amneris who began to take 
measure of this great challenge at the end of the Judgment Scene. Too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert McFarland, the visually imposing Amonasro, seemed to be yet another 
lyric baritone straining to sound dramatic. The effort doesn't augur well for 
his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Cook as the woolly-toned king, Anita Protich as the invisible priestess 
and Christopher Campbell as the fleeting messenger did what they could. In 
context, it wasn't much. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula Washington provided some unintentionally hilarious, anti-musical 
choreography, dutifully executed by members of her L.A. Contemporary Dance 
Theatre. In place of "the sacred dance of the priestesses," she mustered a 
beefcake routine for a tall fellow in a golden jockstrap and, echoing James 
Penrod's dubious work for the Costa Mesa class of '88, an utterly irrational 
human-sacrifice pantomime. These inspirations, it should be remembered, 
embellished a scene for which the composer specifically demanded "all the 
solemnity and weight possible." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, this was poor Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Aida," presented by Opera Pacific at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $18 - $85, at box office and 
commercial agencies (TicketMaster (714) 740-2000). Remaining performances with 
opening-night cast: Wednesday and Saturday at 8 p.m.; with Camellia Johnson 
(Aida), Eugenie Grunewald (Amneris) and Vladimir Popov (Radames) on Friday at 8 
p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; TRIBUTE TO CARPENTERS OPENS NEW HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a palpable feeling of nostalgia in the air at Saturday's official 
opening of the Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center at their alma 
mater, Cal State Long Beach -- and an equally powerful sense of loss. 
</P>
<P>
 With a tuxedoed and gowned audience, a large orchestra and a fast-paced show, 
the center premiered with all flags flying. 
</P>
<P>
 What was missing was Karen Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 It says a great deal about the late singer's talent that her voice and visual 
image on film dominated a program primarily devoted to a retrospective of songs 
she and her brother recorded in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Other versions of Carpenters hits ranged from the bizarre ("Yesterday Once 
More" by Jeff McDonald and Gere Fennelly of the Los Angeles rock band Redd 
Kross) to the unexpected (the female a cappella group For Real's fascinating 
take on "I Won't Last a Day Without You"). 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Coolidge did her best with "Superstar," the American Youth Express 
performed "Sing" and Richard Carpenter's piano was featured in a medley based 
on such classics as "Close to You" and "We've Only Just Begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Alpert, Lalo Schifrin, John Byner, Marilyn McCoo, Freda Payne and several 
CSULB student singers and dancers also performed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show really came alive whenever Karen Carpenter appeared on film -- 
sweetly youthful in the earliest views, more poignantly world-weary in later 
years. The most touching moment came when Richard provided live piano 
accompaniment for a film clip of Karen singing "From This Moment On." Her 
deceptively simple but emotionally complex reading of the Cole Porter standard 
underscored the creative sophistication that was emerging in her work in her 
later years.DON HECKMAN

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; FRENTE! QUARTET HITS HARDEST WITH NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If rock's goal were to be as cute and fuzzy as a pink Care Bear, Frente! would 
be worshiped like Elvis. The Australian quartet hit big this year with a light 
and soulless rendition of New Order's "Bizarre Love Triangle," filling it with 
ineffectual, baby-talk vocals and soft, wafting acoustic pop. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Palace on Friday, the band confirmed that it needs the guidelines of a 
classic song like that to be even slightly noticeable, as its short set 
wandered numbly between sugar-coated pseudo-jazz and hook-less pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Angie Hart stood in one spot, slapping her hand on her hip and cooing 
into the microphone. Her precious, high-pitched vocals were virtually empty, 
lacking the ethereal, crystalline peaks of the Cocteau Twins or even the flow 
of the Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The directionless songs were often underscored by the more dynamic chatter of 
the audience. Frente! tucked its MTV hit unassumingly into the middle of the 
set, toning down the number's impact and highlighting the fact that it has no 
other songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from the fiery impact of its namesake, Nicaragua's Sandinista Army, 
Frente! instead packs all the punch of a powder puff hitting pampered 
skin.LORRAINE ALI

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; MOODY BLUES WRING BEST OUT OF OLD SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 30 years now, the Moody Blues have been venting pop passions by way of 
earnestly intense, high-concept art-rock compositions. They've created many 
moments of musical splendor, but they're also responsible for a fair amount of 
pretentious twaddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of their recorded material seems quaintly out-of-date these days, but on 
Saturday, in the first of two nights at the Hollywood Bowl, the band enjoyed a 
kind context in which to wring some new feeling out of the old hits.  
</P>
<P>
 Founding members Graeme Edge and Ray Thomas, and long-timers Justin Hayward 
and John Lodge, along with some back-up players, shared the stage with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic, under the direction of the Moodies' touring conductor 
Larry Baird. On many songs, the grand pairing seemed to be a lot of effort for 
little effect, as synthesizers and a pair of drum kits often drowned out the 
orchestra's contributions.  
</P>
<P>
 But on several memorable songs -- "Tuesday Afternoon," "Question," and that 
rhapsodic perennial "Nights in White Satin" -- the group's ambitious melodies 
and fervid lyrics were greatly enhanced by the dramatic orchestrations. 
Straight-ahead, synth-driven tunes from the group's later albums were bland at 
best, but they did get sparks to fly from some of their early rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 In their fourth decade, the Moody Blues still play to an enthusiastically 
responsive crowd. The sheets aren't fresh, but apparently the Moodies have a 
few good satin-draped nights left in them. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; YELLOWJACKETS STEAL HIROSHIMA'S THUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday night at the Greek Theatre was supposed to belong to Hiroshima. The 
L.A.-based pop-fusion band has been touring in support of its new 
"Hiroshima/L.A." album and, said leader Dan Kuramoto, was anxious for play for 
the hometown crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Yellowjackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the visiting team that trounces the host at a homecoming football game, 
the jazz-fusion quartet opened the concert and stole Hiroshima's thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 On a strictly musical level, the bands were in completely different leagues. 
The Yellowjackets are a driving, inventive jazz band that Friday built a high 
degree of excitement and interest via both ear-pleasing songs and the regularly 
riveting solos of sax man Bob Mintzer and keyboardist Russell Ferrante. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tunes as "Run for Your Life," a mad scamper through a variant on the 
classic "I Got Rhythm," and the more pop-bent "Clare's Song" were showcases for 
Mintzer's shouting-then-calm essays and Ferrante's nimble mix of chords and 
swirling lines. On the bottom were Jimmy Haslip's firm bass lines and the 
ferocious drumming of William Kennedy, who lit one propulsive fire after 
another and kept them all burning. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Hiroshima blended Asian elements -- June Okida Kuramoto's 
koto was often the band's lead instrumental voice -- with lightweight pop 
melodies on such songs as "One Fine Day" and "Tabo." These melodies didn't 
stand up to the numerous repetitions they were given, and there was no dynamic 
soloist to offer relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hiroshima is a solid show group, playing with precision and employing 
dramatic effects -- one number had 20 kimono-clad dancers on stage -- that kept 
their loyal fans asking for more. ZAN STEWART

DANCE REVIEWS; LEWITZKY'S WORK STILL THE CENTERPIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a hint of a sea-change ahead when the Lewitzky Dance Company offered 
two works by younger choreographers on Friday in the Keck Theater at Occidental 
College in Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Bella Lewitzky is now 78 and has been laboring in the bitterly unrewarding 
vineyard of Los Angeles dance since 1966 (with the formation of her own 
company) and since 1946 (when she first began dancing and co-founded the Dance 
Theater of Los Angeles). Even her most demanding supporters must acknowledge 
that burdens should be lifted from her, although her creativity, much as Martha 
Graham's, ought to continue for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, the most powerful work on the program was hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nora Daniel, 38, Lewitzky's daughter, opened the evening with the West Coast 
premiere of her "Sextet." Susan Rose, a member of the dance faculty at UC 
Riverside who has created several works for the company, closed it with the 
first performance of "Tail Tale Signs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sextet" is a pressureless work in which movement impulses are skillfully and 
not obviously shared, transmitted and reshaped among the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 It deals with Lewitzkian sculptural concerns but without her visceral impact. 
It was danced airily by Roger Gonzalez Hibner, Walter Kennedy, Nancy Lanier, 
Diana MacNeil, Diana Vivona and Karen Woo. David Stanton Bryant wrote the 
brightly percussive score. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's "Tail Tale Signs," a five-part company piece, wittily plays with the 
conventions mostly of the tango to create a work with irresistible popular 
appeal. Macho stances, unpredictable and shifting partnerings, a Tharpian 
interest in movement complexity and distribution across space ensured continual 
visual interest. Evan Lurie wrote the seductively appealing cabaret dance 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewitzky provided the heavyweight center of the program with her 
fierce-informed 1982 "Confines," an ensemble piece that decries women's and 
men's entrapment by the environment and, worse, by roles imposed by society. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-part work moved from the Edenic opening with MacNeil and Kennedy 
enwrapped (trapped, too?) in each other to final images of the whole company 
entrapped in Donald Knaack's ominous, combat-training frame structure. Knaack 
and Robert Morin produced the sound score. 
</P>
<P>
 If much of the protest against women as music-box and fashion industry 
ornaments and men as cannon, factory and sports fodder has been absorbed into 
contemporary consciousness, the dance is only a reminder of how early Lewitzky 
was working with these ideas before the rest of us. CHRIS PASLES

DANCE REVIEWS; PHOENIX DANCE RISES IN L.A. DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So many things can happen on your way to your theater seat. When a good 
performance begins, the nastier things fade. Which is what happened Saturday 
night, during the riveting L.A. debut of Phoenix Dance Company. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the current UK/LA Festival, the 13-year-old troupe from Leeds, 
England, inaugurated the Harriet and Charles Luckman Fine Arts Complex, on the 
campus of Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 To understate, the university and the theater, although completed, were not 
ready to host an audience. Fortunately, fine dancing can mitigate 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 To be brief, some advice: Leave lots of time actually to find the theater on 
the spacious, often unpopulated, dark and unmarked campus. And bring $5 exact 
change for the parking attendant, or else you will be turned away.  
</P>
<P>
 But if you find the theater, your first reward is the impressive colonnade 
approach, a series of tiered columns the color of pale-red earth. The main 
lobby is an unfortunate shade of mauve, but inside a degree of intimacy is 
achieved. In various configurations, the theater seats 520, 640 or 1,170. For 
the Phoenix performance, the balcony was closed off with a mesh curtain, a 
method designed to preserve the sound integrity of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the program, "Shaded Limits" provided a rich statement of company 
hallmarks. The 10-member group displayed a seamless coalition of contemporary 
techniques.  
</P>
<P>
 There is also, in each piece, a fluid articulation of primary emotions that 
arrive one moment on cat's feet, the next with a sometimes literal one-two 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Limits," by company member Chantal Donaldson, changed moods effectively with 
its recorded score. In clearly phrased solos and duets, dancers seemed to light 
up from within, then menace crept into their lifts, falls and supports. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful vocal rhythms of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. inspired Gary 
Lambert's "Longevity." Booker T. Louis and Ricardo Goodison sized each other 
up, tried out synchronicity, physical support and slackness, and spun into 
their own worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Darshan Singh Bhuller's "Heart of Chaos," set in a two-sided boxing ring, 
alternated punishing bouts with ballroom dancing. Although the evolution of 
bobbing and weaving into another kind of performance had promise, the piece 
rambled and lost power. 
</P>
<P>
 No such trouble with Philip Taylor's "Sacred Space," in which dancers made 
temples of their bodies and the space. After breaking out of a reverently 
clustered choir with gestures of despair, they framed the stage on their knees 
and took turns to "testify" in solos of diverse, effective intensity. JENNIFER 
FISHER

TV REVIEWS; 'CHINA' EXAMINES SLICE OF CITY'S EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER * "China: Beyond the Clouds" airs at 8 tonight and Tuesday on 
KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 7 tonight and Tuesday on 
KVCR-TV Channel 24. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first few minutes of Phil Agland's two-part, four-hour film "China: 
Beyond the Clouds," the perpetually snow-capped Jade Dragon Mountain towers 
above the small city of Lijiang like an ancient sentinel. Agland's wide-screen 
landscapes (broadcast in letterbox) suggest that the gigantic vistas of 
southwest China will dwarf the petty concerns of the people of the Lijiang 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been so in traditional Chinese scroll painting, in which 
landscape and people had equal importance. But Agland, who is British, zooms in 
on the people, and he finds himself a welcome visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Agland shoots the daily and dramatic events of a few of the area's families 
with the clinical observation of filmmaker Frederick Wiseman, only lit with the 
artfulness of Vermeer. This is one of the few television series all year that 
could be shown on a movie screen; indeed, Agland's film seems crimped by the 
small tube. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges is a social tapestry of a slice of China in the 1990s, in which 
old ways uneasily coexist with new troubles ranging from unemployed youth to 
increased heroin-related crime. Lijiang even has an "old town" and a "new town" 
-- the former the home of traditionalists like the kindly Dr. Tang and the 
short-tempered butcher (and ostensible central character) Mr. Mu. The latter is 
popular with kids at night, but the bars have become drug centers, and trouble 
eventually erupts. 
</P>
<P>
 By Los Angeles standards, the gang murder of 17-year-old Asan (Mu's nephew) is 
very mild stuff. In a culture like China's so recently under tight security 
controls, though, the crime sends shock waves across Lijiang. Just as Victor 
Hugo used a crime plot to examine social conditions, Agland studies the town -- 
and Chinese national policy -- through Asan's tragedy: The flawed police and 
court system, the new lenient policies toward juveniles, the rising popularity 
of capital punishment, the frustrations of a grieving family facing a 
bureaucracy (Mu's harsh treatment by hospital staff makes U.S. health care look 
heavenly). 
</P>
<P>
 Even with four hours, Agland takes on more than he can handle, cutting back 
and forth across several families, including the Lu family who live in the 
mountains above Lijiang. The Lus are part of the Yi ethnic minority group, 
enslaved until the 1950s and now able to send their children to only one 
secondary school in town. We're seldom able to dwell upon any family member for 
long in Agland's overly ambitious cinematic embrace, but such facts remind how 
medieval China recently was. 
</P>
<P>
 With narrator Lisa Lu's lilting voice and George Fenton's lyrical flute theme 
coursing through it, "China: Beyond the Clouds" comes dangerously close to 
prettifying a country enduring a harsh evolution. It is intimate, but big as it 
is, this film isn't the whole picture.ROBERT KOEHLER * "China: Beyond the 
Clouds" airs at 8 tonight and Tuesday on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 
15, and at 7 tonight and Tuesday on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

SCREENING ROOM: 'NEWLAND' TO OPEN ISRAELI FILM SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 11th annual Israel Film series will open Thursday at the Music Hall, but 
will be launched Wednesday at 7 p.m. across Wilshire Boulevard at the Academy 
of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences with a gala premiere of Orna Ben-Dor Niv's 
"Newland." 
</P>
<P>
 Both this film, which will receive three more screenings, and Leonid Gorovets' 
"Coffee With Lemon" (Saturday at 5:30 p.m.) deal powerfully with the immigrant 
experience in two different eras -- and both suggest that Israel is no earthly 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 A leisurely, poetic film, "Newland" is set in a rural refugee camp in 1950, 
where a 14-year-old boy, Yan (Michael Phelman), and his 7-year-old sister, Anna 
(Ania Bukstein), have arrived from Eastern Europe and are hoping to locate 
their mother somewhere in Israel. In the bleak atmosphere of the ramshackle 
camp, Yan, mature and resilient beyond his years, looks to the future while 
little Anna clutches the past as tightly as her ragged teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
 As a commentary on the impact of war upon children, "Newland" -- actually, 
"New Land" would be a far more sensible title -- brings to mind the classic 
"Forbidden Games." The film's ending is totally surprising and confounding, and 
it expresses a decidedly ambivalent view of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coffee With Lemon" opens with a Russian actor, Valery (Alexander Abdulov), 
receiving a standing ovation in a large and elegant theater. Tall, handsome and 
charming, he later looks out from a skyscraper tower over Moscow, realizing 
that in a sense he's king of all he surveys. However, at that very moment he's 
preparing to renounce his theatrical throne, for he's afraid for his wife and 
small son to the extent that he has decided they must emigrate to Israel as the 
Soviet Union is on the verge of crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in a mobile home that is part of a stark mountaintop settlement on the 
outskirts of a major city -- it's either Jerusalem or Tel Aviv -- Valery again 
has a spectacular view -- but he has come to a place where he has some renown 
but can't speak Hebrew, which he finds difficult to master.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually reduced to doing a vaudeville turn as a curtain-raiser for his 
friend from Russia, who has developed a phony psychic act, Valery's boyish high 
spirits and hearty sense of humor begin to fail him; before we are barely aware 
of it, "Coffee With Lemon" has become progressively darker. This splendid 
film's finish offers a different kind of jolt from that of "Newland." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Setton's taut and comprehensive documentary, "The Hunt for Adolf Eichmann" 
(Thursday at 7:30 p.m.), manages to make suspenseful a real-life undercover 
operation of which we already know the outcome. Setton meticulously tracks what 
happened to the elusive Adolf Eichmann, one of the principal architects of the 
Final Solution, and his eventual sighting in Argentina years after the end of 
World War II.  
</P>
<P>
 Setton combines a masterful use of the camera with the words of the men 
involved in the kidnaping of Eichmann in order to put him on trial in Israel; 
we quite literally retrace every step of the daring, dangerous and ultra-secret 
operation. Narration by Gregory Peck is superlative in every way, lending 
dignity and eloquence to a mission of immense symbolic meaning and impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Most films will be repeated.

 Resisting Hitler: Michael Kloft's "Widerstand" (Goethe Institute, 5700 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 110), a wide-ranging, consciousness-raising documentary 
on the largely unfamiliar German resistance to Adolf Hitler, screens in two 
parts, Tuesday and Thursday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first offering in the "Widerstand" ("Resistance") series, 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the nearly successful plot to kill 
Hitler.

TV REVIEWS; 'RORY' BEST OF NEW CROP OF KIDS SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY * "Fox's Cubhouse" airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on KTTV-TV Channel 
11. "Old MacDonald's Sing-a-Long Farm" airs weekdays at 8 a.m. on Lifetime. 
"Rory and Me" airs weekdays at 8 a.m. on the Learning Channel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to recent congressional prodding, what's hot in children's TV 
programming this fall is a dash of education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox Children's Network, notorious for "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" 
but lauded for its animated version of "Where in the World Is Carmen 
Sandiego?," follows the trend this week with a mixed bag of "edutainment" shows 
for children ages 2 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the umbrella title, "The Fox Cubhouse," three different shows will air 
weekdays in rotation, with brief, superfluous wraparound segments featuring a 
human host and puppets in a clubhouse setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The series begins today with "Jim Henson's Animal Show," which will be seen 
Mondays and Fridays. Kudos for a great idea, but the first segment of this 
Muppet/live-action nature show -- hosted by Jake, a stuffy polar bear, and 
Stinky, a wisecracking skunk -- is surprisingly listless. It serves up lots of 
info-bits and shots of real-life animals, but much of the dialogue and 
commentary is forced, not witty.  
</P>
<P>
 The second series, "Johnson and Friends" -- which will air Tuesdays and 
Thursdays -- is about toys (actors in costume) in a playroom, and fares better 
with creative simplicity and relaxed, child-friendly pacing. In the opener, 
pink elephant Johnson and three new pals discover the stars outside the 
playroom window and learn that nothing fearsome lurks under the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not available for review was the third show in the series, "Rimba's Island," 
featuring characters based on Oaxacan Indian designs teaching preschool 
concepts. It will air Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Also beginning today is the Lifetime cable channel's first children's series, 
"Old MacDonald's Sing-a-Long Farm," a live-action show with costumed animal 
characters, puppets, storytelling and songs.  
</P>
<P>
 For a truly top-notch show to grow by, however, tune in to "Rory and Me," a 
gentle mix of live action, puppetry, tuneful songs and traditional and computer 
animation that debuted on cable's Learning Channel two weeks ago. It features 
children's singer Rory, an appealing performer with a sweet, girlish voice and 
comfortable charm. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" fashion, the low-key show follows careful 
tenets of early education, even allowing wordless, music-less moments for the 
contemplation of such sights and sounds as the wind in the trees and deer 
running on a hillside trail. LYNNE HEFFLEY * "Fox's Cubhouse" airs weekdays at 
2 p.m. on KTTV-TV Channel 11. "Old MacDonald's Sing-a-Long Farm" airs weekdays 
at 8 a.m. on Lifetime. "Rory and Me" airs weekdays at 8 a.m. on the Learning 
Channel.

USC GALLERY'S 'BIG PRINT' MESSAGE IS A LARGE ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This century found itself confronted by the most crucial of human issues. The 
question was, which would dominate, the mind-set of the collective or that of 
the individual? It was a central theme for fine artists, individualists by 
definition. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the time winds down, it appears the big guys won. Soviet communism 
collapsed, to be sure, but its urge to homogenize remained rampant in 
corporations and the media. Even though today's popular retreat into 
subcultural groups seems fragmenting, from the point of view of the 
individualist, it is collectivist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the arts, Walt Disney and Hugh Hefner loom larger than Andy Warhol or Allen 
Ginsberg. But so what? Isn't there a place for singular souls in the chinks 
between the massive granite slabs of a monolithic culture? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably -- but according to "The Big Print," a traveling exhibition of 
lithographs on view at USC's Fisher Gallery, that chink is neither large nor 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was organized by New York University art administrator Leonard Lehrer 
and Ernst Quensen, proprietor of the German lithographic workshop that produced 
the large prints. This sampling includes some 40 sheets by 20 artists. More 
than a dozen countries are represented, but more than half the artists are 
German. 
</P>
<P>
 At a glance the show radiates a nice cheery '60s glow. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few minutes of viewing brings on the feeling that something went 
seriously sour in the meantime. Virtually no artist here seems to try anything 
that he, she or art in general hasn't done before. The Brit Allen Jones' kinky 
Pop imagery was bracingly irreverent 30 years ago. Today his "One Night Stand" 
is like a nostalgic tune played in a piano bar. Germany's Johannes Grutzke 
confronts us with the powerful image of a male nude in Lucifer's embrace, but 
the composition is a frank gloss on the great Expressionist posters of the 
Weimar era. 
</P>
<P>
 What is going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 A clue is provided by Michael Mathias Prechtl's offering. It includes a 
disturbed group of illustrative figures. In one corner a levitating Einstein 
plays the fiddle. In the other Groucho tries to read his newspaper while a kid 
with a Walkman dances and a man in high heels grimaces behind his camcorder 
urged on by Mickey Mouse. Everybody is tangled in wires ending in microphones 
and telephones leading to the central figure. The piece is titled "mixed 
media." It says that everybody including fine artists have succumbed to the 
seductions of the collectivist electronic media. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pop era, fine artists celebrated graphic design. Graphic artists 
responded gleefully by imitating innovations introduced by the fine artists. 
Fine artists then imitated themselves being imitated by the media until the 
whole thing turned into one vast cultural copying machine copying itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In such an ambience, it's tough to maintain lithography's status as a fine 
arts media. It looks too much like reproduction. This blurring of the boundary 
between art and graphics created a serious identity pickle for a certain stripe 
of individual artist. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few ways out of this impasse. Artists can continue to cling to the 
idea that they are different by staying inside their subculture, working in 
traditional media like paint and bronze and cultivating wealthy collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes just copping an attitude does the trick. Malte Sartorius' still-life 
of a basket of onions does it, so does Leonard Lehrer's view of a formal garden 
at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who wants to fit in has to deal with reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The new signal is clear. You can be an outlaw graffiti writer, or you can take 
your portfolio to an art director who will put you on a team to make multimedia 
music videos seen by millions. 
</P>
<P>

POLLUTION'S EFFECT ON SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT FIRES DEBATE; HEALTH: SOME BIOLOGISTS 
BLAME CHEMICALS FOR FERTILITY PROBLEMS, DISEASED ORGANS. OTHERS DENY A PROBLEM 
EXISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Every man sitting in this room today is half the man his grandfather was. And 
the question is, are our children going to be half the men we are?" 
</P>
<P>
 In all likelihood, that alarming testimony -- from a reproductive biologist at 
a congressional hearing on the hazards of pesticides -- is hyperbole. Even so, 
it readily dramatizes the fears of many scientists that environmental pollution 
could be warping human sexual development. 
</P>
<P>
 Many biologists theorize that man-made pesticides and industrial chemicals 
that mimic hormones in the womb might be lowering sperm counts, triggering 
diseases in ovaries, breasts, prostates and testes, and perhaps even retarding 
penis growth and causing children to reach puberty prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a link, however, remains highly speculative and fiercely debated, with 
some biologists maintaining that the small concentrations of man-made chemicals 
consumed by most people in their diets are harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists promoting the theory believe it could explain the puzzling 
array of trends in reproductive disorders that have surfaced since the advent 
of modern pesticides and industrial chemicals after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Sperm counts seem to have dropped by almost half in the past 50 years, 
according to the one highly disputed study on males in the general population. 
Endometriosis and breast cancer are detected in women in record numbers, and 
prostate and testicular cancer rates have at least doubled among men in 
industrialized nations in recent decades. Some fertility experts also believe 
more men are experiencing fertility problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the possibilities for human health effects remain theoretical," 
there is a "growing sense that some diseases or dysfunctions" could be caused 
by pollutants that act like hormones, John McLachlan, scientific director of 
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, reported in a journal 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, billions of pounds of pesticides and industrial compounds that 
imitate estrogen or inhibit testosterone -- hormones vital to human sexuality 
and reproductive health -- are sprayed on crops and yards and released into 
waterways in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 These chemicals routinely contaminate food in small amounts, with a few -- the 
pesticide DDT and industrial compounds called PCBs -- so pervasive that every 
person on Earth is believed to carry at least a trace in their bodies. Fish in 
many waterways are tainted with DDT and PCBs, a contaminant called dioxin is 
found in some beef and other animal fat, and some produce contains small 
amounts of pesticide residues. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there is evidence of these commonly used chemicals disrupting 
sexuality in animals. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can disrupt human hormones, that raises the possibility of infertility 
passing unrecognized from one generation to the next. Parents exposed to a 
slight amount of a man-made hormone in their food would be unharmed, but could 
transfer sperm problems or disease-causing defects to their children that 
wouldn't surface until sexual maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the mother was exposed to . . . could have an effect on their children 
30 years down the road," said Ohio University reproductive biologist Brent 
Palmer. "It is so insidious. The adults appear healthy, but our children may be 
the ones who wind up infertile." 
</P>
<P>
 Some toxicologists and chemical industry representatives say the threat to the 
general population is pure conjecture, raised by many scientists and 
environmental advocates to force restrictions on chemicals. They hope a panel 
about to be convened by the National Academy of Sciences will end the 
speculation within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting the estrogen scare of the week and it's making your head spin," 
said John McCarthy, vice president of science and regulatory affairs for the 
American Crop Protection Assn., which represents major pesticide manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speculation is going on all over the place, especially when it comes to sperm 
counts. Will the real information please stand up? Let's take a look at the 
science and do this right." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A & M University toxicologist Stephen Safe also is highly skeptical that 
the chemicals are affecting human health, explaining that people constantly are 
bombarded with potent, naturally occurring hormones in their food that seem to 
cause no ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is running around saying the male is doomed. But the evidence does 
not support an effect in the overall human population," Safe said. "I'm not 
saying ignore it, but let's have some more information." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the concern has grown out of the research on animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies on animals from Florida alligators to Southern California sea gulls 
that depend on highly contaminated waterways show these hormone-like pollutants 
are tampering with embryos, blurring the lines between the sexes in newborns. 
Tests on laboratory rats confirm that when pregnant animals are exposed, their 
offspring often are born with half-male, half-female sex organs and defective 
sperm. 
</P>
<P>
 The worries over human reproductive health stem from one basic rule of 
anatomy. People have the identical hormones -- estrogen and testosterone -- as 
a rat, a bird or an alligator, and their fetuses would seem just as vulnerable 
to damage from minute amounts of pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the real-life saga of DES mothers, it might seem far-fetched to 
believe humans could pass sexual disorders on to their sons and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 DES, or diethylstilbestrol, was a powerful synthetic estrogen prescribed to 3 
million to 4 million women between 1948 and 1971 to prevent miscarriages. 
Although the mothers were unscathed, their daughters suffer a high incidence of 
ovarian abnormalities and vaginal cancer and their sons have abnormal rates of 
infertility and testicular disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 But DES is hundreds of times more potent in its estrogenic effects than most 
pesticides and industrial chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Toxicologists -- even skeptics like Safe -- agree the most vulnerable people 
are fishermen, Eskimos and other Native Americans whose diets rely heavily on 
fish and marine mammals gathered from waters contaminated with hormone-like 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the nation's worst contamination has been found in sport fish caught 
close to Los Angeles County's shoreline and in harbors of the Great Lakes, 
which contain DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. The compounds were 
used in large volumes until banned in the 1970s, but high concentrations remain 
in the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The big unanswered question is whether an average person's diet, which is much 
more varied, contains large enough quantities of these and other man-made 
hormones to endanger an unborn child. And, do humans, unlike animals, have some 
defense mechanism that wards off small quantities? 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are struggling with these questions, but the answers, in all 
likelihood, remain years away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly not having massive epidemics," said toxicologist Linda 
Birnbaum at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's health effects 
laboratory in North Carolina. "Whether we're having subtle effects is a more 
difficult question to answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people get a much smaller dose of the chemicals in their diets than 
wildlife such as alligators and birds, which often feed on fish from one 
polluted source during their entire lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt that when given an appropriate dosage level during the right 
phase of gestation, that you can see disruption of sexual development," said 
assistant EPA administrator Dr. Lynn Goldman. "But the doses that humans 
receive are lower. It is a leap to go from that evidence to a conclusion that 
sperm levels are being lowered due to these exposures." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the most disturbing evidence that the general population may be at 
risk comes from rats studied at the University of Wisconsin. Mothers-to-be 
injected with a single, minute dose of one industrial pollutant, dioxin, during 
the onset of their embryo's sexual development gave birth to males with reduced 
sperm counts and malformed testicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The small dose given to the rodents -- measured in parts per trillion -- is 
not much higher than the average accumulation the EPA has found in human 
bodies. Dioxins, which are widely dispersed by the paper industry and in other 
manufacturing processes, apparently block testosterone development. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this work is correct, and I have no reason to think that it isn't, the 
real concern is the general population may be at risk," said Earl Gray, the 
EPA's chief of developmental reproduction and toxicology research. "This data 
is really critical because it's at such low doses." 
</P>
<P>
 Toxicologists suspect if people are harmed, the damage is much more subtle 
than what they are seeing in wildlife and lab animals. Gray said sons born to 
exposed parents might have a slight decrease in sperm count or shortened 
penises. 
</P>
<P>
 While reduced sperm probably would have a minimal effect on overall human 
populations, the result could be tragic for some individuals -- the difference 
between fathering a child or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those men who already have low fertility or borderline fertility, this 
kind of an effect, if it's occurring, could render them infertile," said James 
Overstreet, a UC Davis obstetrics and gynecology professor who directs the 
Institute of Toxicology and Environmental Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians in fertility clinics have long noticed what seems to be a decline 
in male fertility, but say the reasons could vary. More than 2 million couples 
are involuntarily childless, and between 1965 and 1982, infertility among young 
couples increased from 4% to 10%, according to a 1989 National Research Council 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to go extinct," said Theo Colborn, senior scientist 
with the World Wildlife Fund. "But if we don't do something about this, life is 
going to be miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is trying to pinpoint the risk so it can issue advice, especially to 
pregnant women. The most vulnerable stage is the first trimester when the fetus 
develops sexually. 
</P>
<P>
 One general warning, Birnbaum said, is to avoid eating fat -- from beef, fish 
or any animal -- because most pollutants accumulate there and it contributes to 
other health risks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the EPA has not analyzed how much of these chemicals an average 
person consumes, a void which magnifies the uncertainty of how much risk the 
public might face. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, for instance, doesn't know how much residue from a fungicide 
called vinclozolin people are eating in their fruits and vegetables. Rats 
exposed to high doses -- 100 parts per million per day during pregnancy -- gave 
birth to half-male, half-female offspring, according to two recent EPA studies. 
Scientists suspect humans consume far less but have no proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than DDT and PCBs, most hormone disrupters, including vinclozolin, leave 
no trace in the human body. They could inflict hormonal damage on a fetus and 
pass through a parent's body without researchers knowing the person was 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since human experimentation is outlawed, toxicologists say tests on wildlife 
and lab animals are the best -- and sometimes only -- forewarning they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no absolute proof about a human connection, but that's the whole 
basis of biomedical research. You do work with non-human animals," said 
University of Texas, Austin, zoologist David Crews, who found small amounts of 
PCBs produced turtles born with both ovaries and testes. 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue, however, that the rodent and other animal data is irrelevant 
because humans may have a defense system animals lack. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray called that "the last line of defense" from people who have "almost a 
religious" belief that humans are better than animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If humans are at all like rats," Gray said, "they have enough DDT in them to 
really have a reproductive effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Those skeptical of a human connection also point out that most environmental 
contaminants are hundreds of times less powerful than the body's natural 
estrogen, estradiol. Numerous natural compounds in vegetables, called 
flavonoids, also are potent estrogens or estrogen inhibitors and they seem to 
pose no harm to people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because something is estrogenic does not necessarily make it a monster," 
said Safe of Texas A & M. "The important thing is, what is our exposure?" 
</P>
<P>
 The most heated argument, however, is focusing on whether sperm counts are 
actually declining. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, reproductive biologists in Denmark thought they had an answer. After 
examining medical reports on almost 15,000 healthy, fertile men from many 
nations between 1938 and 1990, they found sperm concentrations were almost half 
what they had been -- 66 million per milliliter in 1990 compared with 113 
million per milliliter in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings spurred concern that post-World War II chemicals and pesticides 
were to blame. Researchers already had been worried after small studies showed 
some industrial and farm workers handling large quantities experienced sperm 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But other researchers recently pointed out that the steepest sperm decline 
detected in the Danish study occurred in the 1940s and 1950s, before 
environmental contamination peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This data is very, very suspect," Safe said. "It looks like it is probably 
more fiction than fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many reproductive scientists call the data credible. Even if sperm 
counts are declining, proving the cause may be difficult. Men are exposed to a 
large number of factors that might be to blame, from hot tubs to venereal 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Research into breast cancer has been equally inconclusive. Four separate 
studies show high concentrations of DDT or PCBs in the tissues of women with 
breast cancer, but a study completed this year that was the largest of its type 
found no correlation. The debate continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here again, it's the classic case of one study says maybe and another study 
says no and another says, 'Gee, we're not sure.' We need an answer," said 
McCarthy of the pesticide association. 
</P>
<P>
 Health experts also are studying potential effects on disease immunity and 
brain development, since hormones control how the fetus develops its immune 
system and the behavioral part of its brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who ate fish two to three times a month for six years from Lake Michigan 
before pregnancy gave birth to babies with low birth weights, smaller heads and 
learning and behavioral defects, according to a 1984 study by two researchers 
at Wayne State University in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that we are dealing with a phenomenon in which the basic 
physiological process can be affected," said Glen Fox, a toxicologist at the 
Canadian Wildlife Service. "You may not need large amounts of a substance to 
have an impact, particularly at the stage an embryo is developing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a potential to affect everybody. Not just the guy who applies a 
pesticide. Everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Cleaning up old chemicals and avoiding new problems. Hormones and Humans 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists speculate that human fetuses exposed to environmental 
pollutants that mimic or block hormones might be born with reproductive 
disorders, many of which do not surface until adulthood. These are some of the 
suspected impacts on humans, based largely on animal studies. 
</P>
<P>
 LOW SPERM COUNTS 
</P>
<P>
 A study of medical records over 50 years shows that sperm counts have dropped 
by 40%. Researchers wonder if exposure of the fetus to pesticides and other 
chemicals that disrupt hormones may be a factor. Similar sperm problems have 
been noted in industrial workers exposed to high levels of dioxin, which is 
believed to block testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
 BREAST CANCER 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of this disease have increased by 1% per year over the past 50 years. 
Studies at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine have found high levels of DDT and PCBs 
in the tissue of women with breast cancer. Another recent study in California 
found no correlation. Some researchers believe chemicals that act as estrogens 
might promote breast cancer cells, but studies have been inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER CANCERS 
</P>
<P>
 Testicular cancer, which strikes young men, has tripled in the United States 
and England over the past three decades. Prostate cancer has doubled in some 
countries in 10 years. Researchers say exposure of a fetus to pollutants that 
act like estrogens could be a cause. Cells of men with testicular cancer 
resemble the primitive cells in embryos, which makes scientists believe their 
sexual development was interrupted in the fetal stage. 
</P>
<P>
 UNDESCENDED TESTICLES 
</P>
<P>
 This problem appears to be increasing among newborn boys, although there are 
no statistics available. Exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the environment 
could block development of male reproductive organs, causing cryptorchidism, or 
undescended testicles. In some cases this can lead to fertility problems. 
</P>
<P>
 HYPOSPADIAS 
</P>
<P>
 Young boys and infants can be afflicted with a urethra abnormality which, 
although rare, in extreme stages makes the penis resemble a vagina. This same 
type of "intersex" condition occurs in laboratory animals exposed to estrogenic 
chemicals during fetal development. 
</P>
<P>
 ENDOMETRIOSIS 
</P>
<P>
 This mysterious, painful disease afflicting 10% of women in their childbearing 
years appears to be increasing. Recent studies link it to exposure to dioxin 
and PCBs, both hormone-mimicking chemicals. Symptoms are the worst when a 
woman's estrogen level is highest. Many women who are infertile also have 
endometriosis. 
</P>
<P>
 EARLY PUBERTY 
</P>
<P>
 Girls are reaching puberty earlier, and some researchers suspect that exposure 
to environmental estrogens may be a cause. Studies on rodents exposed to DDT 
and other estrogenic chemicals show accelerated puberty.

SUSPECT LABELS MEXICO SLAYING FIRST OF A PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The assassination of the second-ranking official in the ruling party was the 
first in a plot to kill reform-minded politicians, according to a suspect's 
declaration announced Sunday by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the slain general secretary of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled Mexico for 65 years, was just one 
name on a list of planned victims, suspect Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez told 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Rodriguez Gonzalez outlined a complicated murder plot with 
strong hints of a liaison between politicians and drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that his brother Fernando, a top aide to an important congressman from 
Tamaulipas, had told him: "There is a list of important people in Mexico who 
have to die because they support a series of reforms for the political 
modernization of that country." 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying would also politically weaken the victim's brother, Mario, who is 
the assistant attorney general in charge of anti-narcotics enforcement, 
Rodriguez Gonzalez said his brother told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had questioned and released the congressman, Manuel Munoz Rocha, on 
Friday, after the alleged triggerman, Daniel Aguilar Trevino, said Fernando 
Rodriguez Gonzalez was the person who had shown him Ruiz Massieu's photo and 
identified him as the target of the assassination they were planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general has asked the legislature to revoke Munoz Rocha's 
congressional immunity, thus permitting him to be arrested. Prosecutors also 
added criminal association to the charges against Aguilar Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans had immediately suspected political infighting in connection with the 
assassination of Ruiz Massieu, who was slated to be majority leader in the next 
Congress. Nevertheless, the news provoked shock and indignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is shameful for the nation," said Patricia Ruiz, deputy for the leftist 
opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party. "Congress should be the best the 
nation has to offer, not a den of criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation continued into the second major political assassination 
in just over six months, the judge in the trial of Mario Aburto Martinez -- 
accused of the March 23 murder of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio -- considered a prosecution motion to convict Aburto and sentence him 
to 50 years in prison. Mexico has no death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mexicans suspect there was a plot to kill Colosio, and three men are in 
jail awaiting trial as accomplices. But two successive special prosecutors have 
yet to turn up the kind of testimony Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez has provided in 
the latest case. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, unlike the Colosio killing, in which the history of the gun used remains 
a mystery, the attorney general's office Sunday said it had found the source of 
the weapon in the Ruiz Massieu case. A police officer in Tamaulipas, Jose 
Pascual Alvarez, admitted having sold the handgun used in the slaying to Jorge 
Rodriguez Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Rodriguez Gonzalez told police, he also bought an AK-47. 
Civilians are prohibited from owning such high-powered weapons in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of the gun, according to Rodriguez Gonzalez, was part of a 
carefully planned plot that included obtaining detailed information about Ruiz 
Massieu's habits. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Munoz Rocha contacted his old friend, Abraham Rubio Canales, for 
that information. Rubio Canales is in prison in Acapulco after being convicted 
of land fraud while he was tourism secretary under Ruiz Massieu, a former 
governor of Guerrero. Police have questioned Rubio Canales but released no 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio Canales is also the father-in-law of Raul Valladares, recently arrested 
by Mario Ruiz Massieu on cocaine trafficking charges. Valladares is believed to 
be the lieutenant of Juan Garcia Abrego, accused of heading the powerful Gulf 
cartel. The cartel is widely believed to run Tamaulipas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez Gonzalez said his brother told him in early September to hire two 
bodyguards and bring them to Mexico City. He offered the jobs to Aguilar 
Trevino and Carlos Angel Cantu. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after they arrived in the capital were they told that they had been 
contracted to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Sanchez -- Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez's chauffeur -- told police he was to 
drive his boss to a place near the scene of the killing and to wait for the 
triggerman. But when he saw police cars gathering, he said, he panicked and 
drove to Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez's home. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he was told to meet his boss's brother at a city park. From the park, 
they drove to a restaurant, where Sanchez said he was promised an apartment and 
an unspecified sum of money in return for his part in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a bank security guard had tackled Aguilar Trevino and turned him 
over to police. Aguilar Trevino told police that Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez 
and Cantu had offered to pay him about $17,000 to kill Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantu turned himself in to authorities in the border town of Matamoros late 
Saturday and was being questioned. Aguilar Trevino told police that Cantu went 
with him to the scene of the slaying. Cantu told reporters he believed they 
were going to buy tamales.

NEWS ANALYSIS; U.S.-JAPAN TRADE ACCORDS MEAN BUSINESS FOR CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY and JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The milestone trade agreements reached between the United States and Japan on 
Saturday will open major opportunities for American companies, particularly 
those from California, industry officials and economists said Sunday. But it is 
not guaranteed that U.S. companies will ultimately gain significant market 
inroads, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign sales almost surely will rise considerably in the fields in which 
agreement was reached: insurance, flat glass and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment. That is because current foreign sales 
are so low and Japanese demand is so strong. Tokyo has promised foreign firms 
improved access to markets in these areas, markets that are worth a total of 
nearly $340 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade deal is also expected to prove a boost for the California economy, 
which is more heavily dependent on foreign trade than many other states. 
California is home to many of the firms that could benefit directly, such as 
Beckman Instruments, a Fullerton maker of medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the high-tech stuff that is desired in Japan is made in California," 
said Ed Rozynski, vice president for global strategy and analysis at the Health 
Industry Manufacturing Assn., an industry group based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide range of cutting-edge California companies involved in such fields as 
information technology and multimedia would also gain as the Japanese become 
more familiar with U.S. telecommunications makers and their know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the emerging markets of the telecommunications business, California is 
going to become a major player," said Tahir Andrabi, professor of international 
economics at Pomona College in Claremont. "Any kind of move (to expand the 
telecommunications market) is definitely going to help." 
</P>
<P>
 But through a determined refusal to agree to anything smacking of "numerical 
targets," Japanese negotiators have ensured that much of the burden of breaking 
into the Japanese market will remain on foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
 How Japan implements the agreed changes, how much effort American companies 
exert and how persistently the U.S. government monitors the market-opening 
measures will all have a major impact, according to U.S. business executives in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I've seen so far, this is an agreement we can build on," said 
William Farrell, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in 
Japan. "The industries have got to find out what opportunities are open to them 
and get cracking on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell noted that while the agreements were reached between Tokyo and 
Washington, their provisions apply to all foreign firms doing business in 
Japan. U.S. firms looking for new business thus must worry not only about 
Japanese but also European and other foreign competitors, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not expecting the dawn of a new era as of tomorrow morning," Farrell 
said. "We're going to have to work on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar caution was voiced by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I think there are some loopholes in all this," said Robert Orr, 
director of government relations for Nippon Motorola Ltd., which earlier this 
year was at the center of a bitter dispute over access to Japan's cellular 
telephone market. That argument was settled in March on terms pleasing to 
Motorola and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr said that while there is hope that Saturday's agreements will open 
"substantial new opportunities" in Japan's telecommunications market, this will 
depend on "vigorous U.S. government enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 These agreements, by themselves, are not likely to quickly reduce the U.S. 
trade deficit with Japan, which totaled $60 billion last year. This is because 
they cover fairly narrow fields and because sales growth will be incremental. 
Indeed, the dollar fell against the yen in early Asian trading today on the 
view that the agreements will not do much to reduce Japan's massive trade 
surplus with the United States, although the greenback later recovered after 
Japan's central bank bought the U.S. currency. But Washington chose its 
priority areas partly because of the long-term potential for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The government procurement market in telecommunications and medical equipment 
"is set to explode in growth," said a U.S. diplomat in Tokyo, who spoke on 
condition he not be identified by name. "We just want to make sure we're part 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 By sector, key opportunities for foreign firms look like this: 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecommunications. The total annual telecommunications equipment market in 
Japan is about $18 billion and rapidly growing. The new agreements cover $2 
billion in annual procurement by government agencies and $9 billion annually in 
purchases by Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, which is two-thirds 
government-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign firms will have a better chance to break into these markets by getting 
involved with potential buyers during the design stage, when technical 
specifications for bids are drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical equipment. The overall size of the Japanese medical technology 
market was $13 billion in 1992. As Japan's population ages, this figure is 
expected to rise rapidly. The government market, covered by a new agreement, is 
about $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign firms will now have access to lists of the top 10 medical technology 
products planned for purchase during the year by each government hospital. The 
agreement will especially benefit firms selling expensive, high-quality 
equipment that is competitive on an "overall greatest value" basis. Under 
previous bidding rules, such equipment routinely lost out to inferior but 
lower-priced Japanese products. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurance. Japan has the world's second-largest insurance market, with about 
$320 billion in annual premium income. The agreement in this sector primarily 
concerns deregulation, which should make it easier for U.S. companies to win 
market share by offering new products or reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take a long time before foreign firms win a big share of this market, 
but even a small share is a lot of money. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor said Saturday that the U.S. industry predicts the agreement can lead to 
increased foreign premium earnings of "nearly $1 billion over the next several 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 * Flat glass. This market for glass used in automobiles and construction is 
worth $4.5 billion annually. Saturday's agreement covered only a set of 
principles to provide improved access for foreign firms. The two sides agreed 
to try to reach a final agreement based on those principles within 30 days. 
U.S. firms now hold about 1% of this market. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements pleased U.S. companies, many of whom have failed to crack the 
Japanese market despite success in other nations. While U.S. medical equipment 
and technology firms claim 50% of worldwide sales, their share in Japan is only 
22%, according to industry statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were "better than our expectations," said Rozynski at the Health 
Industry Manufacturing Assn. As a result, U.S. medical equipment sales will 
probably increase by $500 million over three years, and the 10,000 jobs tied to 
U.S. medical exports could grow substantially, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozynski said that Japan's health minister will not only ask the country's 
national hospitals to purchase more foreign products -- as U.S. manufacturers 
had suggested -- but he will also make the same request of the university 
teaching hospitals. "The university hospitals are where the new doctors are 
trained and where they are introduced to medical technology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord comes as Orange County's Beckman Instruments, which primarily makes 
medical diagnostic equipment, expects Japanese demand for medical technology to 
increase as that nation seeks to become more efficient in delivering health 
care to an aging population. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should help boost our international sales," said Beckman spokeswoman 
Jeanie Herbert, whose company relies on foreign markets for more than half of 
its total sales. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. insurers are expected to do well because their experience in the 
rough-and-tumble domestic marketplace has given them a competitive edge over 
Japanese rivals accustomed to a more stable and highly profitable environment, 
said economist Sean Mooney at the Insurance Information Institute, a New 
York-based industry group. 
</P>
<P>
 "A more open Japanese insurance industry would not only benefit Japanese 
consumers, but it would also be a benefit to U.S. companies that have dealt in 
a competitive (domestic) market for years," Mooney said. "If we were to get a 
5% share, that is a significant" amount. 
</P>
<P>
 A key point of negotiating success for the United States, which had demanded a 
"results-oriented" deal, was that Japan agreed that these changes should lead 
to "progress in the value and share" of foreign goods and services in the 
Japanese market. This goes beyond what Japan was willing to agree to earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japan, for its part, succeeded in avoiding any firm guarantees tied to 
specific figures for sales volume or market share. This keeps the pressure on 
U.S. firms to take a major share of the responsibility for bringing about 
increased sales. 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; GINGRICH: AT LONG LAST, POWER; IN A DEMOCRAT'S NIGHTMARE COME TRUE, 
THE FORMER GADFLY IS IN LINE TO BE THE GOP'S TOP CONGRESSMAN -- WITH HOPES OF 
LEADING HIS PARTY'S FIRST MAJORITY IN DECADES.

<P>
 Officially, Newt Gingrich's tenure as his party's leader in the House does not 
begin until the new Congress takes office in January. But in many ways, the 
Gingrich Era has already dawned. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Capitol Dome against a clear blue sky as a backdrop, the combative 
Georgia Republican last week led 300 GOP incumbents and challengers in signing 
what they described as their Contract with America. It is a 10-point program of 
proposed legislation -- largely unfinished business of the Reagan Revolution -- 
that the Republicans promise to enact if they win control of the House this 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 A GOP majority is something that body has not seen since the 1950s. Not a 
single Republican now serving has wielded the gavel during a session of the 
House, or even presided over the most lowly of subcommittees. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican takeover of the House is still a longshot. But for the first time 
in decades, no one is laughing off the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 If Republicans do win a majority of the 435 seats, it will be thanks, in no 
small measure, to public disgust for Congress -- a political brush fire that 
Gingrich has stoked throughout his 16 years as a legislator. Or, as the 
would-be Speaker put it: "I've spent much of my career reporting accurately on 
a Congress that's worthy of being despised." 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, a soured electorate appears poised to give the GOP enough 
additional seats for the fire-breathing Gingrich and his forces to forge a 
working majority on many close issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect has sent shudders up and down the Democratic ranks, and would 
seem to represent Bill Clinton's worst nightmare. But as Gingrich steps closer 
to center stage, some of his colleagues believe that they are seeing -- could 
it be? -- a kinder, gentler Newt. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the Gingrich acolytes who make up the current crop of freshman 
Republicans have any complaint about their hero and role model, it is summed up 
by Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy): "At times, as a member of the leadership, 
Gingrich is softer than a lot of the freshmen want him to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Soft? Newt Gingrich? The man who once called Bob Dole "the tax collector of 
the welfare state?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He's absolutely shifted gears significantly in the last year," said Jerry 
Lewis (R-Redlands), a onetime rival for the top House GOP post whose 1993 
ouster from the leadership was engineered by Gingrich. In Gingrich's view, the 
affable and well-regarded Lewis represented the old-style Republican -- the 
kind whose pragmatism and noblesse oblige would keep GOP House members in the 
shadow of the Democrats forever. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that he is the second-ranking Republican and heir apparent to the 
minority leader's job being vacated by retiring Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), 
Gingrich is confronting the realities of heading a party that still is 40 votes 
short of a majority in the House, and probably will remain at least 15 behind. 
</P>
<P>
 If Gingrich is to get anything done, Lewis pointed out, he will need at least 
a handful of conservatives and moderates on the other side of the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 In their private dealings, the Democratic leadership with which Gingrich will 
have to work has already seen a shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does tend to be very constructive in meetings. He's very different from 
his image outside," one top aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of many Democrats, Gingrich proved a formidable -- and 
reliable -- ally in President Clinton's uphill battle last year for approval of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "His word was good. He worked hard," said Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who helped 
lead the effort from the Democratic side. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been like a Jekyll and Hyde," Richardson added. "When he decides to be 
bipartisan, he is bipartisan, but then he also has the capability of wanting to 
tear down the institution. The real Newt Gingrich is still unclear. I don't 
think he's decided what his strategy is." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer's monumental battle over crime legislation was perhaps the 
ultimate illustration of Gingrich's ability to play it both ways. He rallied 
his troops to a near-unanimous stand against the Clinton crime bill that almost 
killed it on a procedural vote. But in the second round, he risked the wrath of 
many Republicans by giving political cover to the group of GOP moderates who 
negotiated the deal with the White House that saved the bill. Thus, he played a 
role in handing Clinton his biggest congressional victory in what was an 
otherwise dismal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the Republicans who were against the (assault) weapons ban were livid, 
because it meant the bill would succeed," said Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.), who 
favored the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Gingrich brushed off suggestions that he has mellowed, saying he's 
merely getting older -- he's 51 -- and warning: "I'm told that at a later point 
in my life, I become more irascible." 
</P>
<P>
 But then he turned to aide Tony Blankley and asked: "I'm kind of curious about 
this. Do you think I've significantly changed?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You pause before you act," Blankley replied. 
</P>
<P>
 After pondering the question himself for a moment, Gingrich concluded: "One 
thing that really has changed is I've learned to listen a lot more than I did 
10 years ago, or even five years ago. . . . When I was younger, I was a back 
bencher, and to get heard at all, you had to virtually scream." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the driving force in his life has been making himself heard. 
Gingrich's personal epiphany took place when he was 15 -- fittingly enough, on 
the World War I battlefield of Verdun, a name synonymous with pointless 
bloodshed. As he pondered the artillery damage still evident 42 years later, he 
remembered thinking "that civilizations are easily put at risk, and that the 
quality of leadership is a big factor in whether or not they survive." 
</P>
<P>
 His adoptive father's Army career, which had brought the family to Europe, 
would next take them to Georgia. In 1960, Gingrich recalled, it was the most 
Democratic state in the country -- having voted even more heavily for John F. 
Kennedy than Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 To Gingrich's mind, it seemed infinitely fertile territory. 
</P>
<P>
 He even spelled out his life's plan to a high school teacher in Stuttgart, 
Germany. "I would go to Georgia, help create a Republican Party, and win a 
national office," he recalled saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich was elected to Congress in 1978, on his third try, but it was not his 
big ideas that carried the day. He was far behind when he learned that his 
female opponent was planning to commute to Washington, leaving her family in 
Georgia. He quickly came up with a new campaign slogan, one that resonated in 
the traditional South: "When elected, Newt will keep his family together." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened when he got to Washington, however, was the sort of 
contradiction that Gingrich's critics love: Within two years, he had divorced 
his wife of 18 years. (That marriage produced two daughters. Gingrich soon 
married his current wife, Marianne.) 
</P>
<P>
 If his legislative record is to be judged by the important laws that he has 
written, suffice it to say that Gingrich's is virtually zip. But it would be 
hard to find a figure in the last decade who has caused more upheaval in how 
the House does business. These days, it often seems that it is no longer such a 
leap from Gingrich's childhood ambition of being a zookeeper to his current one 
of being Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 To look at him, the doughy former history professor with the blow-dried helmet 
of white hair would have seemed an unlikely slayer of the old order. Imagine a 
Kewpie-doll version of Phil Donahue with a voice that sounds like it is on 
fast-forward. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, Gingrich and a small band of frustrated conservative 
Republicans seized upon a way to bypass the Democratic gatekeepers who kept GOP 
legislation from seeing daylight and present their agenda directly to millions 
of Americans. Every afternoon, after the House had adjourned, they would take 
to the floor and rail for hours before the TV cameras that were reaching a 
growing audience on C-Span. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich went from being a minor irritant to a chronic pain to then-Speaker 
Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.). Then came the day in 1984 when O'Neill could 
take it no longer. His voice thundered across the House chamber as he called 
Gingrich's behavior "the lowest thing that I have seen in my 32 years in 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill was formally disciplined for violating a House floor ban on making 
personal attacks on fellow members -- believed to be the first time that had 
happened to a Speaker since the 1790s. Republicans quickly aired TV ads about 
the incident; Gingrich was their hero. 
</P>
<P>
 The wound he inflicted on O'Neill's successor was a mortal one. It was 
Gingrich's complaint that opened an Ethics Committee investigation against 
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), and it was largely his persistence that kept that 
issue in front of the public. Ultimately, Wright was forced to resign in 1989, 
and a grateful Republican Caucus lifted Gingrich from his unofficial post of 
chief gadfly to party whip, their party's second-ranking post. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's own ethics have come under no small degree of scrutiny; the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee maintains at least six file drawers 
of information on both his public and private life against the day that they 
might have an opportunity to do to Gingrich what he did to Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy centers on what the Atlanta Constitution has called 
Gingrich's "unprecedented multimillion-dollar political empire." Gingrich has 
become the human equivalent of ITT -- a walking conglomerate, with a political 
action committee, a televised college course called "Renewing American 
Civilization," a cable talk show and his very own think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources of funds for this network are murky. His political action 
committee, GOPAC, has refused to disclose its donor list, which Gingrich says 
is legal under a loophole in federal law. The Federal Election Commission is 
suing, and Gingrich's long-shot Democratic opponent, former congressman and 
"Dukes of Hazzard" star Ben Jones, has lodged a complaint with the Ethics 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's 10-week college course had to be moved from a public to a private 
institution after it was revealed that GOPAC helped organize and design it. 
Moreover, he was criticized for using the course to plug some of his large 
donors and their corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge issue, one that's not going to go away," challenger Jones said of 
the ethical questions that are swirling around Gingrich. "He's using this 
district as a means to an end -- and that end is his own ideological agenda and 
his own personal ambition." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, the accusations and insinuations have yet to stick. Gingrich 
and his allies say that the criticism amounts to little more than partisan 
sniping and insist that his outside organizations are merely a means of getting 
his ideas to a larger forum. 
</P>
<P>
 A voracious reader, Gingrich draws those ideas from sources that range from 
management guru Peter Drucker to futurist Alvin Toffler. Ask Gingrich about his 
agenda for the long haul, and his street-fighter bluntness gives way to frothy 
jargon that sounds New Age enough for a Nike commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really about inventing an information-age, third-wave, 
world-market-oriented society, which is a replacement for a bureaucratic, 
second-wave, national-market, welfare state," he said, adding: "Getting people 
so that they get the rhythm of that is weird." 
</P>
<P>
 The flag-waving extravaganza last week on the Capitol steps was a move in that 
direction. Yet even many Republicans wonder whether tying locally elected 
candidates to the broad national platform outlined in the contract -- including 
such ideas as a balanced-budget amendment, line-item veto and a defense buildup 
-- could backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the items on that agenda have at least 60% support in the polls, 
Gingrich contends. But Lewis, among others, noted that some of the items -- 
such as cuts in agricultural programs -- could be controversial in local areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the fact that the most crucial fall election battles will be closely 
fought in swing districts, "already, there's no doubt Democrats are licking 
their chops," Lewis said. "National themes are great for symbolism, but many a 
district doesn't fit that mold." 
</P>
<P>
 And for some GOP incumbents the contract presents awkward contradictions. 
Gingrich, for instance, finds himself advocating that no House member be 
allowed to serve more than six terms -- even as he runs for his ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to explain the apparent double-standard on NBC's "Meet the Press" on 
Sunday, he declined to say directly whether he would step down if the 
term-limits proposal became a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion that everybody who's for something has to offer to commit suicide 
in order for you to think they're sincere, I think is fairly outrageous," 
Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats have promised to hang the contract on vulnerable candidates 
in the fall elections, many of the GOP's young warriors say the commitment to a 
single agenda is just what the party needs if it is to shake its permanent 
minority mentality. "The Republicans can't just say no. We have to tell the 
American people what we're for," Pombo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich is instituting another change that is winning almost universal 
acclaim within his ranks: He is putting members on notice that if they want to 
hold senior positions, they must be willing to raise at least $50,000 each to 
help other GOP candidates win. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I said to them is real simple: If you want to be a chairman (which 
requires being a member of the majority party), you have to work like you're 
going to be a chairman," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyists report that they are being hounded for contributions by GOP 
lawmakers who had never put the arm on them before. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans found the new marching orders unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he asked me to raise this money, I said, 'I can't do this,' " recalled 
Johnson, who sits on the Ways and Means Committee, the mother lode for hauling 
in special-interest money. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added that it has become easier as she has tailored her appeal, 
pointing out that she is "raising money for there to be a new direction in the 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, of course, point out that this "new direction" is being 
underwritten in the most traditional and discredited of manners -- soliciting 
money from people whose financial interests are at stake. Indeed, hours after 
signing their contract, Republicans celebrated at a $500-a-plate fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democratic Party uses soft money, labor unions, trial lawyers, anything 
they can get their hands on," Gingrich said. "For any of them to suggest that 
there's some weird double-standard is silly. We had a standard fund-raising 
dinner -- $500 a plate -- which in a free-market economy is a legitimate way to 
raise money for a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said Republicans are willing to pitch in because they understand that 
this is truly a different kind of election year -- as seen in a recent Gallup 
poll showing that for the first time since 1952, voters for two consecutive 
months have said that, in general, they would rather vote for a Republican than 
a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That suggests something -- maybe something big -- is going on," Gingrich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not big enough, he added, if it doesn't fulfill his dream of a Republican 
majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "To truly achieve the level of change we want, we have to have control," he 
said. "I very, very much want to have the Ways and Means Committee holding 
hearings on Dick Armey's (R-Tex.) flat tax. I very much want to have the Budget 
Committee insisting on the replacement of the (government's) socialist 
accounting system with a free-market model. . . . I very much want the 
Judiciary Committee to have a hearing on school prayer in every state in the 
union in the first six months of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody should think that we're going to be happy if we get 25 
seats," the would-be Speaker concluded. "Until we get control, we don't have 
control."

HAITI CAPITAL PATROLS ARE BEEFED UP; CARIBBEAN: AMERICANS DETAIN A CEDRAS 
CONFIDANT, BUT ARMS RAIDS PRODUCE LITTLE. AS PORT-AU-PRINCE CALMS DOWN AFTER 
FOUR DAYS OF VIOLENCE, A TOUGHER U.S. POSITION IS SIGNALED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of U.S. troops were deployed in beefed-up patrols of Port-au-Prince 
on Sunday, detaining a top aide of Haitian military leader Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras during a weapons search and saturating urban neighborhoods where four 
days of looting and state-sponsored violence had left the capital exhausted but 
peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensified patrols and the detention of Romeo Halloun, a Cedras confidant 
and bodyguard, during one of several mostly unproductive weapons raids 
throughout the capital were symbolic but strong signals that U.S. commanders 
are getting tougher in their increasingly controversial mission to restore 
security and democracy to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attention! Attention! Haitian people! Stop looting! Stop looting!" blared 
U.S. Army special-operations sound trucks that cruised throughout the day in 
the port district, where several privately owned warehouses had been cleaned 
out in previous days both before and after U.S. military police tried to stop 
the looting. 
</P>
<P>
 Army MP patrols also maintained a constant presence on the streets surrounding 
the headquarters of an armed Haitian military front group. It was the first 
show of force there since more than a dozen front members savagely attacked 
pro-democracy demonstrators throughout the day Friday without U.S. military 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no sign that the U.S. forces or the Haitian military had 
disarmed and neutralized the civilian attaches known under the banner FRAPH, 
who lazed the day away playing dominoes and cards on the front porch of their 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the searches for arms caches in the capital Sunday netted little more 
than a single shotgun or pistol. The only report of a significant seizure was 
near the northern city of Cap Haitien in the border town of Quanaminthe, where 
military sources said about 1,000 weapons were recovered late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloun's arrest came during a raid that was otherwise typical of Sunday's 
weapons searches in the capital. It occurred while MPs with dog teams were 
raiding a tomato-paste factory that intelligence sources had said was 
part-owned by Halloun, who reportedly was among the founders of a tough, elite 
attache group known as the Ninjas. 
</P>
<P>
 The MPs stopped and searched Halloun and his car when he tried to enter the 
factory, witnesses said, confiscating a shotgun and a few handguns and 
detaining five people, including Halloun. 
</P>
<P>
 But the witnesses said more weapons were found in Halloun's car than in the 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras' army, which U.S. commanders have instructed to recover all the weapons 
it issued to its civilian allies, did make a small gesture toward disarmament 
Sunday, announcing that it has revoked as of today all the more than 75,000 gun 
permits issued by the military regime. Gun owners will have to bring in their 
firearms for reissue or confiscation. 
</P>
<P>
 But after four days of violence that left at least 13 people dead and more 
than 100 wounded, the Haitian military and its government took no active steps 
to disarm its civilian allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians in the capital did awake to some hopeful sights and sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's voice was broadcast on state radio 
for the first time since the coup that overthrew him three years ago. The radio 
station was seized and secured by the 4th Platoon of the 118th Military Police 
Company (Airborne) early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide appealed to Haiti's impoverished masses, the bedrock of his popular 
support, to stop looting and to patiently await his imminent return in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get hurt when there is plundering," the Roman Catholic priest said in 
a message apparently recorded from exile. "It is trouble that begets trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Aristide's appeal, the U.S. armed forces broadcast a message in 
Creole in an effort to clarify the presence of more than 20,000 U.S. troops 
amid continuing violence and lawlessness that have led many Haitians to 
question the motives of the American mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to speed up the transition to peace," the U.S. military broadcast 
declared. "We are not here as an occupation force. We're not here to impose a 
government that you do not want." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the city, Haitians huddled around radios tuned to the station for 
the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices were also plummeting, with gasoline selling for a third of its 
astronomical official price of $16 a gallon as street merchants attempted to 
sell off stockpiles before the U.N. embargo of Haiti ends with Aristide's 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Port-au-Prince's elite, many of whom have confined themselves to their 
enclaves in hillside Petionville, awoke Sunday to the sight of U.S. patrols, 
which were extended to Petionville and even ritzy Kenscoff Mountain and its 
weekend resorts 8,000 feet above the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other scenes that have become all too familiar during the past 
three years of brutal military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 At first light, residents near the port found two bodies savagely hacked to 
bits with machetes. Witnesses said they were would-be robbers who were attacked 
by security guards when they attempted an early morning break-in at a nearby 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 With such brutal reminders of the difficulty still ahead for the U.S. mission 
to restore Haiti's stability and its brief democracy, popular skepticism 
endured. But it was accompanied by an apparent reservoir of continuing, if 
tenuous, goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I feel safer to see these new American patrols around here," said a 
58-year-old man who lives in a house where Friday's carnage left blood running 
in the street. "But how long are they going to be here doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Standing near the shattered and twisted remains of the sound truck that led 
Friday's pro-democracy march, the man refused to give his name, an illustration 
of the continuing fear. And he said he feared negative public opinion in 
America toward the Haiti mission almost as much as the armed attaches roaming 
freely just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we're still afraid, because the country is still dangerous," he 
said. "And if the Americans leave now, it will be even more terrible than it 
was. The army is watching which people are helping them, listening to those who 
speak out against them. If the Americans pull out before they get rid of all 
these people, they'll come and kill everyone who took a stand." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. soldiers on patrol and guarding the newly seized government 
institutions also reacted to the torrent of criticism of the mission back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing near the barbed wire now sealing off the national radio station, Sgt. 
Ron Underwood appeared flabbergasted at the lack of popular support in the 
United States for his work. He was in the platoon commanded by 1st Lt. Gail 
Yoshitani, who led the operation that secured the station at 4 a.m. Friday. 
Ever since, he said, he had been amazed by the Haitian reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up on the roof yesterday, and we saw a guy through our binoculars 
about two blocks away looking at us through binoculars," the sergeant said. "He 
would look at us, go write some letters on the wall behind him and then look at 
us through the binoculars again to make sure we were still watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he finished the message in English, it read: 'I love the U.S. Army. What 
is your name?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For the 4th Platoon, the support was perhaps more meaningful than that of the 
other units deployed in the streets. Although the members of the platoon 
secured the station without a single shot, three hours later a sniper opened 
fire on them with a small-caliber pistol -- the first such fire directed toward 
the troops since they arrived in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 rounds were fired in all during a two-hour period, Underwood said, 
adding: "Fortunately, he was a terrible shot."

HATRED OF ARISTIDE, FEAR OF POOR UNITE HAITI ELITE; SOCIETY: THE HANDFUL OF 
LIGHT-SKINNED, RICH FAMILIES THAT CONTROL THE ECONOMY EXPECT TO OUTMANEUVER 
U.S.

<P>
 Her face was twisted with rage, her voice cracked with fury, her body cramped 
with hate. "They should be killed, all of them, killed. We will kill them. I 
will kill them." 
</P>
<P>
 The murderous wail was aimed at Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the supporters who 
followed Haiti's first democratically elected president into exile when he was 
overthrown three years ago by the country's army. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are everything that is wrong here," she shrieked as she contemplated 
their return. "They are the mob. They want to destroy us. I have my guns. I 
will use them to protect my property." 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the rant of some uncontrollable eccentric nor the boast of a 
barroom denizen. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the venom spewed from the mouth of a demurely dressed, wealthy Haitian 
woman, a double graduate of one of the best U.S. Ivy League colleges and a 
member of one of Haiti's oddest factions -- what U.S. diplomats call the 
Morally Repugnant Elite, or MREs for short. 
</P>
<P>
 They are by definition rich, sometimes exceedingly so. Most are light-skinned 
or white. Many have been educated in the best American and European 
universities. Several carry U.S. passports. Almost all have a pathological 
hatred for Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Romeo Halloun is the son of a Lebanese immigrant who made a small fortune in 
the import-export business, a fortune converted into a mountain of money when 
the family turned to smuggling during the various embargoes imposed to force 
Aristide's return. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he is a U.S. citizen, Halloun joined the corps of anti-Aristide 
fanatics, organizing a night-riding patrol that terrorized ordinary Haitians 
and tried to intimidate foreigners. He was detained Sunday by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aristide represents all I hate," he once told a reporter as he gambled away 
thousands of dollars at the El Rancho casino, a favorite haunt of young MREs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid to kill to protect what I and my family have." 
</P>
<P>
 Halloun is a follower of Bob LeCord, a former U.S. serviceman and disciple of 
the brutal Duvalier dynasty that ruled Haiti from 1957 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, LeCord led a band of armed thugs who prevented a U.S. Army cargo 
ship from landing in Port-au-Prince as part of an abortive effort to return 
Aristide. He was arrested Friday by U.S. troops for carrying illegal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The loathing is so intense that a few still will not accept that Aristide is 
coming back, despite the more than 20,000 U.S. troops sent here to ensure that 
the president is restored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he isn't coming back," one woman said. "Whoever gets off that plane on 
Oct. 15 (the date most people have set for Aristide's return) won't be 
Aristide. It might be someone altered by cosmetic surgery, it might be a robot, 
but it won't be Aristide." 
</P>
<P>
 The thinking behind such a statement from an otherwise rational person is 
based on a conviction that U.S. officials hate Aristide as much as she does. So 
it can't be the real Aristide that returns, the thinking goes, only some clone 
that Washington will control. 
</P>
<P>
 For the less irrational, Aristide's return is acknowledged as a probable fact 
-- but not an acceptable one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to shoot him," the husband of the excitable, demurely dressed 
woman said as he entertained a reporter by the pool of his relatively modest 
home in the hills above Petionville, a wealthy suburb of the capital. "But I 
have lots of friends who will, and I won't do anything to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 The power behind the MREs lies with a handful of light-skinned, rich families 
who have a monopolistic hold on Haiti's economy and have inherited the racial 
attitudes and fear of the poor from the French colonialists and the mixed-raced 
Haitians who took control after the nation's 1804 revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know why I'm against Aristide?" asked a U.S.-trained economist and 
businessman who has made a sizable profit in league with the military regime. 
"His democracy is the democracy of the mob, the ignorant and dirty mob," he 
said, as his guest gazed at a mansion being constructed on an adjoining 
multi-acre lot owned by the economist. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't ready for democracy. Aristide has told them they have a right to 
what I have, that they have the right to eat off my plate." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, these families keep their hatred of the populist priest to 
themselves, preferring to express it through manipulation of lesser allies such 
as Halloun or through financial and political aid and advice to the military. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these families backed the 1991 military revolt against Aristide, 
according to U.S. diplomats at the time -- then-U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams 
actually named the families the MREs -- and provided the money and expertise 
that thwarted the international sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, some of the most elite of the MREs, the Mevs, Brandt, Madsen 
and D'Adesky families, are now in business with the supposedly hated American 
invaders, renting and selling land and services to the U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 One Haitian political expert, who supports Aristide's return as an exercise in 
democracy even though he dislikes the man and his radical policies, believes at 
least some of these families are subtly engineering a plan that will frustrate 
the Americans and leave the families in eventual control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to appear resigned, if not enthusiastic, about Aristide coming 
back," he said, "but to encourage the looting and lawlessness so that the 
Americans will eventually give up and go away and leave Aristide helpless. Then 
they will have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Aristide's return at least a week or more away, the MREs say they 
are seeing the meaning of his restoration in the streets now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looting, you see the looting," said a businessman who says he is not an MRE 
but associates with them. "That is what Aristide means and what Aristide will 
bring. Your (the U.S. media's) job is to convince him to stop the looting."

CLERGY STRUGGLES TO ADDRESS VOLATILE ISSUES OF PROP. 187; BALLOT: MAIN 
DENOMINATIONS' LEADERS HAVE ATTACKED IMMIGRATION MEASURE. IN PEWS IT'S OFTEN A 
DIFFERENT STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few days shy of a Sunday Mass at St. Mary's in Fullerton, the pastor 
was seething with a quiet indignation more often reserved for mortal sin than a 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be mincin' words on this one," vowed Father Richard C. Kennedy in the 
lilting accent of his native Ireland. "I haven't worked out what I'll say, but 
I'm going to make it clear. Proposition 187 is immoral. . . . This thing is 
completely godless." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the weekend, Kennedy was not ready to deliver his message. He needed 
more time to reflect and consult with other priests on the perils of staking 
out a position on the initiative, which would ban most public benefits, 
including education and basic health care, for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 From pulpits across California, the clergy is suddenly wrestling with 
political strategy instead of conventional demons. The top leaders of all the 
state's major religious denominations have attacked Proposition 187, calling 
for compassion while invoking the Bible: "Welcome strangers, for by doing this, 
some people have entertained angels without knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is the foot soldiers -- the priests, ministers, rabbis and nuns -- who 
are delicately trying to deliver the anti-187 message in a fashion that will 
persuade rather than alienate. The political reality is that members of their 
congregations feel like most of the state's voters: Rightly or wrongly they 
blame immigrants for many of the state's problems and support the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Bible to prick the consciences of their church members, a broad 
religious coalition of 60 organizations has launched a frantic campaign to woo 
them with homilies and house parties, candlelight vigils and forums, Sunday 
sermons and appeals for compassion from top religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Those appeals have grown even more passionate as the leaders have warily noted 
the popularity of the measure in recent polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church needs to be heard on this in public more often. We've got to 
define the issue," said the Rev. Chester Talton, the suffragan bishop of the 
six-county Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. Talton is especially concerned 
about provisions that would cut health and education services to children. 
"Jesus calls on us to care for the child, and as we care for the child we care 
for Jesus himself," Talton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shunning this broad coalition are fundamentalist ministers like the Rev. Lou 
Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition, based in Orange County. He said 
ministers supporting the initiative do not need to organize because "it's not 
considered part of the core doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon publicly supports the crackdown on illegal immigrants, remaining 
resolutely unmoved by the religious appeals to "welcome the stranger." 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal strangers are different than a passing-through stranger who needs a 
night's lodging, food and clothing," Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted the preacher: Biblical teachings do not address "illegal strangers." 
</P>
<P>
 With the sweet, gospel strains of the children's Angelic Choir in the 
background, Gardena pastor Jose Luis Torres nervously prepared to face the 
church leadership at a business meeting of the Pacific Presbytery last month. 
</P>
<P>
 While the children swayed in white robes to a chorus of "Somebody Bigger Than 
You and I," Torres was gathering strength from the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some church leaders had privately warned him about the potential for backlash 
within his own religious community if he forced his fellow pastors to take a 
position against the controversial immigration measure before they were ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week earlier, smaller subgroups of San Gabriel Valley Presbyterian 
ministers took a bold stand against the measure, but Orange County's pastors 
considered the issue too politically hot to handle and refused to allow 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, a Puerto Rican native, insisted on forging ahead. He reminded the 
church leaders that the Bible bars Christians from oppressing "strangers in our 
midst." He warned that the ballot measure would invite discrimination against 
Latinos. Wearily, he confessed, "I am tired. I'm tired of fighting and fighting 
and fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Torres waited, watching in amazement as most of the church leaders -- 
representing 52 congregations from Malibu to San Pedro -- bolted to their feet 
from the pews to signal their opposition to the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting at Westminster Presbyterian Church in central Los Angeles that 
September afternoon also reflected the schism facing many churches. The Rev. 
Mark Nazarian, the pastor at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Redondo Beach, 
stood to oppose the measure, while his two church elders didn't budge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church should not be debating political issues," St. Andrew's elder Dick 
Olson, 61, said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazarian was mindful of the complaint; his vote that day was his first public 
expression against the measure and probably his last. He will deliver no sermon 
railing against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 By longstanding custom, Nazarian said, he tries to "stay away" from politics. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Nov. 8 election approaches, major religious denominations have been 
scrambling to develop a grass-roots strategy opposing the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost weekly, various church organizations representing thousands of members 
are releasing detailed opposition statements. The groups include the 
Episcopalian General Conference, California's Catholic bishops, the 
Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and the bishops of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church of America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the Office of Justice and Peace is 
directing an anti-Proposition 187 speakers bureau, distributing voter 
registration information and offering to train clergy members as they prepare 
to campaign against the ballot measure. Cardinal Roger Mahony, who last fall 
spoke out against immigrant bashing with the call, "In the stranger we 
encounter Christ," also denounced the initiative in a July conference of Latino 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County -- the birthplace of the Proposition 187 movement -- the 
diocese is leaving it up to individual churches to develop their own tactics in 
the battle for parishioners' hearts and souls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has their own niche and is trying to share information," said Msgr. 
Jaime Soto, the Hispanic vicar for the Diocese of Orange. "So, for example, the 
Diocese of Oakland (developed excerpts to be used in sermons) and we're 
distributing that to our churches for suggested readings and bulletin hints." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the statewide religious organizing is being coordinated by the 
Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights, a newly formed collection of about 
60 religious organizations that met in Oceanside in July to plot strategy to 
defeat Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting aside traditional fund-raising efforts for the campaign, the group 
instead has focused on their religious networks to distribute information and 
provide speakers, according to Ed Dunn, a Franciscan brother. He and Terry 
Salkowitz, the executive director of the Northern Pacific region of the 
American Jewish Congress, are helping lead the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 From their San Francisco offices, the coalition's leaders have also been 
organizing small living room parties to encourage people to ponder the issue 
with their friends. At least one house party has grown so large that its host, 
T.J. Anthony, has moved it to a San Francisco restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony, a new board member of the American Jewish Congress, said he has 
invited a guest speaker who is a Holocaust survivor. As a young boy, the man 
and hundreds of other Jewish immigrants were aboard the ship St. Louis when it 
was turned away from the Florida shores and forced back to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Jewish community, there is a very, very strong memory, a long, long 
memory. A lot of people remember the St. Louis and the people who were sent 
back to their deaths in Nazi Germany. You can't forget that," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 25, the Interfaith Coalition is planning its most public display of 
opposition with candlelight vigils scheduled for all major California cities, 
according to coalition leader Dunn. The little money that the coalition has 
raised has been targeted for advertisements that will run in religious and 
ethnic newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The delicacy of the immigration issue has forced many clergy members to choose 
words with the caution of diplomats. They know it is easier to take on the 
devil than a volatile issue that could divide congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of churches are still wrestling with this, especially ones feeling the 
economic crisis in terms of lost jobs and lower incomes," Dunn said. "The 
temptation for some is to say there's not enough to go around. What we try to 
do is engage people in larger reasons for problems in the state. The largest 
corporations and wealthiest families have not paid their fair taxes, and 
therefore the immigrant didn't create this crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Having faced contentious debates within their denominations on sensitive 
issues such as abortion rights, birth control and gays in the clergy, churches 
find their role in the debate over the rights of illegal immigrants even less 
clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and Hawaii -- 
which represents 300 Southern California churches -- voted to oppose 
Proposition 187 in a resolution offered by the organization's Hispanic 
Commission. But the vote came after a decision by a subgroup -- the presbytery 
representing Orange County and eastern Los Angeles County churches -- to quash 
its own discussion on procedural grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The synod's vote does not require the churches to sermonize on the topic 
because, generally, most ministers do not discuss public policy issues from the 
pulpit. But it encourages them to inform their congregations of their 
opposition and to help raise funds for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we should provide education and care for some of those in our 
midst, but at the same time, we have to stem the flow (of illegal immigrants) 
so that we don't end up with no money to provide care to those who are here. 
There is a limit," said the Rev. John Huffman, whose Newport Beach church, St. 
Andrew's Presbyterian, is considered the denomination's largest and wealthiest 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar tensions were evident at an anti-Proposition 187 training session 
organized by the Diocese of San Bernardino for a small group of Catholic 
priests. One of the older priests vowed that he would not speak up because of 
concerns about the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's awkward silence was broken by a younger priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got irritated," recalled Father Miguel Urrea, the pastor of Christ the 
King Church in San Bernardino. "I just said that it's very clearly stated as a 
church that we should not be concerned if people are documented or 
undocumented. If we do, we're losing our whole perspective of why we are 
priests. This is a humanitarian issue. Are we supposed to say, sorry, we can't 
take care of you because you don't have papers? Stand there and bleed to 
death?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a small support group of Catholic priests in Orange County held a 
painful discussion about political tactics. Many preside over rapidly evolving 
congregations that are shifting away from mostly white populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The question, according to participant Msgr. Bill McLaughlin, was the best way 
to preach without alienating some members. McLaughlin formed a committee at his 
affluent Newport Beach congregation at Our Lady Queen of Angels to fight the 
initiative, but even the committee members were apprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
 At their information table outside the church last Sunday, parishioners Juan 
and Patty Carreras distributed a copy of the initiative and nine flyers listing 
arguments against it, but carefully insisted that they were only encouraging 
people to become informed. But that did not prevent a debate at the table after 
one of the Masses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to hesitate to say something about this in a homily," 
McLaughlin said. "I know it will alienate some people, though. This is a 
Republican stronghold. . . . When we do preach what we consider Gospel values, 
some of the community would like to see shortcuts taken. We all know what turns 
people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the president of the Hispanic Commission for the Presbyterian Synod 
senses divisions within his own predominantly Latino congregation in South 
Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every single congregation, no matter what the pastor preaches, two 
(opposing) groups will arise," said the Rev. Nick Aguilar, pastor of Bethel 
Presbyterian Church. "It depends on how life has treated you in the U.S. If you 
have a good job and a good car and savings in the bank, it's hard for you to 
remember when you came to this country. Time and situations change our way of 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 The level of church unity and the passion of sermons are often a reflection of 
the class and ethnic makeup of the congregation itself. 
</P>
<P>
 When Episcopal Bishop Talton took his soft-spoken message of opposition to All 
Saints Church in Highland Park last month, he received only support. The 
struggling congregation -- 90% Latino and so poor that the minister moonlights 
as a Los Angeles public school teacher -- listened silently to a Spanish 
translation of his words. 
</P>
<P>
 A thundering endorsement for the church's position came from one of the older 
men in the parish, Luis Guillermo, an immigrant from Guatemala, who stood up 
after the bishop finished his message. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have listened," Guillermo shouted in Spanish. "All of us know how we have 
suffered here in California. I hope that all of us will vote to survive. . . . 
We are human. We are Christians. We have a heart!" 
</P>
<P>
 For those passionately opposed to the measure, it sometimes seems as though 
they are walking into the lion's den. 
</P>
<P>
 The ecclesiastical and political forces collided one recent Sunday evening at 
a debate sponsored by St. Mark's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, 
considered one of Orange County's more progressive congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension filled the room as the 150-member audience listened to both sides of 
the issue. It appeared that the crowd was evenly split. When one side stated a 
position, the other side groaned. 
</P>
<P>
 Just that morning, the church's pastor, the Rev. Gary Collins, had delivered a 
sermon based on the Gospel of the day: a parable in which Jesus heard his 
disciples arguing over who should be the greatest. Jesus placed a child in 
their midst and told his disciples that whoever welcomes the children welcomes 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of his sermon, Collins asked one panelist, former Border Patrol agent 
Bill King, a question that went to the core of his concern: How does one 
reconcile the Bible with the initiative? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about the Bible. This is politics," Collins recalled 
King answering -- a response that bothered Collins for days. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Proposition 187 is surely a political issue," the minister said, "it is 
surely a moral issue."

JAPANESE AMERICANS REVISIT THEIR PAINFUL PAST; HISTORY: WORLD WAR II INTERNEES 
DISMANTLE BARRACKS AT WYOMING PRISON CAMP AND SEND IT BACK TO L.A.'S LITTLE 
TOKYO AS A PERMANENT REMINDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Running his hand over the 2-by-4 studs, scuffing the years of dust with his 
tennis shoes, Tomo Mukai looked for and found the number on the wall: 22799. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our family number," Mukai, 60, said as he and his son Ron inspected 
the weathered barracks his Southern California family shared in the internment 
camp that confined thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of that number, I think of the way we lived," said Mukai, who 
now lives in Whittier. "I think about what my family had to give up when we 
rode the train out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammers pounded the roof above as Mukai last week viewed his wartime quarters 
for the first time in 50 years. Others who also spent time behind the barbed 
wire and guard towers at Heart Mountain were dismantling the building around 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the structure, about 60 miles east of Yellowstone National Park, sat 
piecemeal aboard a flatbed truck, destined for Los Angeles and perhaps its most 
important duty yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In early November, the building that once housed those forced from their homes 
on the West Coast and has since sheltered farm equipment, will go on display in 
Little Tokyo as a lasting reminder of the only prison camps meant for Americans 
who had not committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the project organized by the Japanese American National Museum in 
Los Angeles, about 25 former inmates last week made an unusual, and this time 
voluntary, pilgrimage to Wyoming and the site of their wartime incarceration. 
They came from California and other states not only to revisit childhood 
friends, but also to take a piece of their history back with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my boyhood home," said Bacon Sakatani, 65, of West Covina, as others 
knocked wall studs apart and pulled nails from the bare floorboards. "Taking 
back this barracks is taking our whole experience back to California for our 
children to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Two barracks will make the trip from Wyoming to Los Angeles. One, where Mukai 
lived, will go on display Nov. 11 in the Downtown museum's new exhibition, 
"America's Concentration Camps: Remembering the Japanese American Experience." 
The other will await resurrection as part of a permanent exhibit in a new 
museum wing set to open in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Though just 8 years old at the time, Mukai remembered his first glimpse of the 
distinctive flat-topped peak that lent its name to the internment camp known as 
the Heart Mountain Relocation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers how winds howled as he, his parents and two brothers found their 
assigned stretch of the freshly built barracks that would be their home for two 
years. A coal-fired potbelly stove offered the sole warmth in the 20-by-20-foot 
room, insulated against Wyoming's frigid winters by no more than tar paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Barracks sat in blocks of a dozen each. 
</P>
<P>
 "Block 30 would be over there," Mukai's friend Keiichi Ikeda told him, 
pointing, as they took a break from prying apart the barracks and walked across 
the fields that once held the internment camp. "You were in block 27? You would 
have lived right over there." 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be a baseball diamond right there someplace," Mukai said, 
aiming his finger beyond. Though they never knew each other during their days 
in the internment camp, Mukai and Ikeda, from Los Angeles, struck up a 
friendship at internee reunions in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ikeda turned, figuring where guard towers stood. "There was one right up on 
this hill behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mukai: "I remember sledding down that hill on a sled I built myself." 
</P>
<P>
 A counterpart of wartime internment centers at Manzanar and Tule Lake, Calif., 
Heart Mountain was one of 10 desolate places where the federal War Relocation 
Authority sent 120,000 Japanese Americans, then thought of as a subversive 
threat to the domestic war effort. More than 60% were Nisei, American-born U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly forgotten now, except by those who lived there, Heart Mountain was the 
fourth-largest camp. Local work gangs lined the sagebrush scrubland with row 
upon row of barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp held as many as 10,767 people, making it the third-largest city in 
Wyoming at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Beet and barley fields now occupy much of the abandoned camp's 740 acres. But 
Heart Mountain remains one of the few camps where original relics still stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Though museum curators considered a replica of the barracks for their upcoming 
exhibit, they decided that an original structure would be far more impressive. 
"When you know you're seeing a real building where real people were forced to 
live against their will, it's that much more powerful," said museum spokesman 
Chris Komai. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Sakatani had returned to Wyoming to erect a memorial to Heart Mountain 
residents who served and died in the war, he knew some barracks survived and 
led the museum's effort to retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
 As the buildings came down last week, a historic preservation architect was on 
hand, numbering each piece to ensure that once they get to Los Angeles, the 
barracks will retain their original look and form. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these years I've tried to forget about it, but now I think it's a history 
lesson," said Doug Sagara of Denver, who was 17 when his family arrived at 
Heart Mountain. "If I just told you we lived in a barracks, would you know 
about the dust, the one light bulb hanging from the ceiling, the holes in the 
walls? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you actually see it, you'll know," Sagara said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Heart Mountain camp closed, the government sold its 540 barracks for 
$1 each. Homesteaders turned the Spartan buildings into stables, sheds and, 
with much remodeling and improvement, even homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonder the wind didn't blow it over," said Tak Ogawa, a Wyoming farmer 
who donated one of the barracks for the museum. He never lived in the 
internment camp, but he did live in the barracks for three years on land he 
acquired after the camp's closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those shunted to the Heart Mountain facility, which operated from August, 
1942, to November, 1945, came from Los Angeles, Santa Clara County and central 
Washington state. Often, families who were neighbors in Los Angeles remained 
neighbors after they were moved. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes, families started there. The parents of Superior Court Judge 
Lance A. Ito, now presiding over the O.J. Simpson trial, met at Heart Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the former internees are retired now. They were in their early teens 
when they lived at Heart Mountain. The forced evacuation left many of their 
parents embittered, but they admitted that their recollections are not 
altogether unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, they recall a kaleidoscope of images: sledding down the first 
snow they had ever seen on toboggans fashioned from discarded scraps of wood; 
sneaking through the fence to collect red-brown chunks of petrified wood; or 
fishing for trout in the Shoshone River. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mukai, that American rite of passage -- getting his first baseball glove, 
ordered from the Montgomery Ward catalogue -- came while he was imprisoned. His 
father, vice president of a Los Angeles import-export company before the war, 
earned $19 a month in his new job as head chef in the family's block of 
barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 As the barracks came apart, they yielded a few clues about their occupants -- 
Japanese figures etched into a 2-by-4, the shapely outline of a woman penciled 
upon the siding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still remember Christmas Eve in 1942, because it was the first time I ever 
heard that song 'White Christmas,' " said George Iseri of Long Beach. "It was 
really snowing, and we all went to mess hall to receive gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a little something for the children. It was just about all we 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all those who made the trip to Wyoming have received $20,000 federal 
reparation payments and a formal apology. But some misgivings remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids, sometimes they can't understand how we let this happen to us," said 
Ikeda, 67. Retired after 26 years with the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, he headed back to Wyoming to help move the barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to see something like this before you can understand what was really 
happening back then," he said, toting planks from the barracks roof to a rented 
moving van. 
</P>
<P>
 As they pulled planks apart, freeing clouds of dust that had gathered in the 
walls of the barracks for decades, some learned much more than they had 
expected about their onetime home. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading for Yellowstone National Park, Larry Nakashima and his wife, of the 
City of Orange, had stopped their motor home for a look at what was left of the 
internment camp where his family was moved when he was 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Other former internees enlisted his help, so the couple canceled their tour of 
Yellowstone and instead turned to pulling out nails. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, they heard all the stories they wanted about life at Heart 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I get up on the roof and pull nails, I think about how little my kids know 
about all this," Nakashima said, the sun casting long shadows beyond the 
barracks. "None of us want to be reminded of it. But the memories we like the 
least may be the ones that are most important."

AMERICANS ARE BEING ASKED TO PUT A PRICE TAG ON NATURE; CONSERVATION: U.S. WILL 
SURVEY 6,000 PEOPLE, ASKING WHAT THEY WOULD PAY TO RESTORE THE GRAND CANYON 
ECOSYSTEM TO PROPER FUNCTIONING. THE PROJECT IS PART OF NEW APPROACH TO 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. 
</P>

<P>
 What's it worth to you, Mr. and Mrs. America, to know that the delicate 
balance of water, rock and life that makes up the Grand Canyon ecosystem is 
functioning the way nature intended? Now, would you be willing to pay that 
amount in monthly installments on your electricity bill? 
</P>
<P>
 Those questions are more than just the idle speculation of economists and 
bloodless policy wonks. The answers could help determine whether Americans' 
love of nature will prevail over their hunger for electricity in a key 
environmental dispute over a hydroelectric dam on the Colorado River -- the 
body of water that is at the Grand Canyon's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the Interior Department is expected to order changes in the 
operation of the 31-year-old Glen Canyon Dam, which is being blamed for 
environmental damage along the Grand Canyon's riverbanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the changes would mark a victory for environmentalists, revisions to 
the dam's operations could also dramatically raise electric rates for 3 million 
customers who rely on the dam for hydroelectric power. Hoping to stem the 
expected public outcry, the federal government is taking a preemptive strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Its proposed weapon? Public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next several weeks, some 6,000 surveys will fall into mailboxes from 
Maine to Southern California, asking Americans how much, in effect, they value 
the Grand Canyon and what they would pay to restore the proper functioning of 
its ecosystem. The responses that pollsters receive could do more than help 
reverse environmental damage there: They may help effect a small revolution in 
the making of federal land-use policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions are part of a new effort to get policy-makers, in decisions 
concerning the management of public lands, to consider the psychic value of 
leaving some natural resources unexploited. Still in its infancy, the 
computation of what economists are calling "non-use value" could hand 
conservationists new ammunition in their fight to keep some lands off limits to 
developers. But it also could have the opposite effect of derailing 
environmentalists' efforts to set aside natural resources if Americans see 
unacceptable costs associated with such conservation decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique, some environmentalists said, could help right a longstanding 
imbalance in policy decisions by placing a monetary value on things -- like 
wilderness -- that economists have never attached value to before. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it raises questions that are deeply unsettling to many green 
activists and anathema to virtually all Native Americans: How, they ask, can 
you put a price tag on the Grand Canyon? And if you can put a dollar figure on 
something like the Grand Canyon's ecological balance, does that mean it's for 
sale? 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists believe that changing water levels caused by Glen Canyon Dam 
are responsible for the erosion of beaches along the riverbanks. Loss of the 
beaches has meant the disappearance of habitats and spawning grounds for many 
of the canyon's native species of plants and wildlife -- including humpback 
chub, razorback suckers, coyote willows, canyon wren and Southwestern willow 
flycatchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The erratic water flows also wreaked havoc for Grand Canyon rafters, who faced 
rapids that were constantly shifting and campgrounds that were in danger of 
dissolving into the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature of the river has dropped significantly as cold water from the 
dam's deep reservoir was released in massive, irregular spurts. The cold water 
favored fish, such as trout, that had been introduced to the river from 
elsewhere. But it appeared to be hurting the Colorado River's native 
populations of humpback chub and razorback sucker, now nearly extinct. And that 
changing balance among the canyon's fish appeared to be causing a cascade of 
changes up and down the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 But while apparently damaging to the Grand Canyon's ecology, the changing 
water flows have been a boon to Western consumers. Whenever demand for 
electricity is highest, the operators of the Glen Canyon Dam can increase the 
flow of Colorado River water through its turbines to generate "peaking power." 
In all, the dam produces 4 billion kilowatt-hours per year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Grand Canyon beaches and the critters that live off them, the resulting 
gushes of water have produced costly negative effects. But for some 3 million 
power users, the dam's operations have brought a cheap, clean and plentiful 
supply of electricity when it's most needed; and for the Western Area Power 
Administration, which markets the power Glen Canyon Dam generates, it's meant a 
steady income flow at premium rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The modest changes expected to be proposed by the Interior Department this 
fall would boost electricity bills throughout the West by about $3 million per 
year, according to current estimates. Beyond that, it could cost taxpayers 
between $60 million and $100 million to fix the water temperature problem. All 
of which raises the question: How much is it worth to Americans to restore some 
measure of balance to a system that few really understand and most will never 
see? 
</P>
<P>
 Even if many will never run the Colorado River's rapids or gaze down on the 
canyon's red limestone cliffs, do Americans still prize the existence of the 
Grand Canyon ecosystem? And if they do, how much do they prize those "unused 
resources"? Two dollars a month's worth? Twenty? Two hundred? 
</P>
<P>
 Translating such values into dollar figures in this case is the job of an 
economics consulting firm in Madison, Wis., named HBRS. It is a new and 
still-imprecise science, and it's provoking a storm of controversy, among both 
economists and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for economists is that restoring the balance of the Grand Canyon's 
ecosystem will cost money. But by traditional economic standards, it will yield 
no return. It won't produce more electricity to light households, ore for 
industry, lumber for houses or fish for the market. By standard economic 
measures, then, fixing the Grand Canyon has no value at all, and clearly should 
not be pursued. Indeed, under these classical economic assumptions, it would 
make sense to dam and inundate the entire Grand Canyon if it could be done 
cheaply and would produce lots of electricity. After all, beauty and balance 
bear no dollar signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often when there's no value presented, a thing is given a zero-value. And 
that's not right," said Mike Welsh, an economist with HBRS and architect of the 
Grand Canyon survey. 
</P>
<P>
 To Americans who prize the Grand Canyon, however, knowing that the area's 
ecosystem is again close to what nature intended may produce a sense of 
well-being, a sense that some wrong has been righted. And that, say economists, 
is a benefit that one ought to be able to put a dollar value on. 
</P>
<P>
 Many environmentalists think so too. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Exxon Valdez ran aground off Alaska and poured 11 million gallons of 
oil into Prince William Sound, few knew how to express the value to Americans 
of the natural beauty that was lost. Most Americans would never venture to that 
remote corner of the country, but it became clear from the public's reaction to 
the spill that Americans felt something valuable had been forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to assess Exxon's financial liability, the state of Alaska turned 
to economists -- for the first time in major accident litigation -- to put a 
dollar figure on the loss of Prince William Sound's pristine condition. A 
non-use analysis, using a survey of 1,000 Americans nationwide, placed a price 
tag of $3 billion on the sound in its unsullied state. Exxon, which was allowed 
to review the results of the economic analysis, settled with the United States 
government for $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called cost-benefit analyses used traditionally by the government have 
"never been able to capture these values," said Raymond J. Kopp, a senior 
fellow at Resources for the Future, a Washington environmental research 
institution that emphasizes economic analysis. "And now you can. That just 
makes this technique a very powerful tool." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, many environmentalists have come to see non-use analysis as a way 
to prove that Americans actually value their remaining islands of natural 
beauty -- that they would be willing to sacrifice something to maintain them. 
</P>
<P>
 A non-use analysis helped persuade Interior Department officials to 
reintroduce wolves into parts of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho -- a controversial 
move expected to cost taxpayers, ranchers and ultimately, consumers of beef. 
And a 1990 non-use analysis led the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict 
operation of the coal-fired Navajo Generating Station in Arizona because its 
emissions were cutting visibility at Grand Canyon National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the EPA is conducting a non-use analysis to help determine what the 
federal government will do to prevent the contamination of underground water 
sources. The regulations could cost affected industries billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the agency will propose such costly new rules, it hopes to prove 
that Americans place an equally high value on maintaining the availability of 
clean water in underground aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the new technique has been used to champion environmental causes, some 
environmentalists fear it could be used to bury part of their agenda and 
belittle the very values they champion. Their concerns are shared by many 
Native Americans, to whom the cold, hard calculation of the earth's value is a 
concept that is alien and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is spiritual," said Ferrell Secakuku, chairman of the Hopi Tribe, which 
considers the Grand Canyon its birthplace and ancestral home. "You can't put a 
price on the spirit. This kind of analysis is like my asking you how much you 
would pay not to have me drive my car through your church." 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists also fear that a reliance on non-use analysis could 
doom some of their priorities. Americans, after all, will not pay unlimited 
amounts to realize all of the environmental community's most cherished dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does put some environmentalists into kind of a difficult position," said 
Paul Portney of Resources for the Future. "Sauce for the goose is sauce for the 
gander: If you're going to use the technique when it works for you, you have to 
be able to live with the results when it works against you."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; TORRES SOFTENS STAND, SAYS 
GARAMENDI OVER-REGULATED INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was nothing unusual for Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush. The Republican 
candidate for state insurance commissioner, appearing before a friendly 
audience of insurance agents, was again assailing the present commissioner for 
over-regulating the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush opposes heavy regulation. Outgoing Commissioner John Garamendi is 
an ardent regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 What was unusual was that Quackenbush's Democratic opponent, state Sen. Art 
Torres, stood before the same group and joined in the criticism of Garamendi, 
agreeing that his attitude toward the industry is too negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' speech more than a week ago to the American Agents Alliance meeting in 
Burlingame struck a new note in his campaign. Before an industry audience, 
Torres suddenly sounded far friendlier than he has when addressing consumer 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents' group provided tape recordings of the speeches of both Quackenbush 
and Torres. Although Torres did say on the tape that serving consumers would be 
his "first priority," he quickly veered to statements suggesting that Garamendi 
had been too onerous a regulator and asserted that "the consumer is not served 
well if the industry is not healthy in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in an apparent adverse comparison of Garamendi with his predecessor, 
industry-leaning Republican Roxani Gillespie, Torres told the agents: 
</P>
<P>
 "I just read that now we are 49th or 50th in the nation in terms of how we are 
perceived (by insurers) in respect to regulation, in respect to price, in 
respect to competition. We cannot afford to continue with that kind of 
attitude, and we need to look for other . . . opportunities to make California 
what it should be and where we were just four years ago, almost at No. 1 in 
terms of a competitive and open place for the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, during audience questioning, Torres pledged to undertake a performance 
audit of the Insurance Department, in part to find out what had become of $23 
million in fines levied by Garamendi against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 If irregularities were found, Torres said, "I'd have to determine whether to 
turn it over to the appropriate prosecuting authority." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic candidate also told the agents, "I'm educated (about insurance) 
almost daily by my brother-in-law and my cousin, who are both agents in the 
property-casualty field."At another point he added, "If it were up to me, this 
office should be nonpartisan." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, provided a transcript of Torres' remarks, said that the $23 million 
in fines went to the state's general fund, and he expressed pride at being a 
tough regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he is referring to the way the insurance industry views my regulation . . 
. it's never been my goal to serve the insurance industry and make them happy, 
but to serve the consumer," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have taken a department that was the lap dog and the lackey of the industry 
and turned it into a growling watchdog for the consumer. I know that the 
industry does not like me, but I never signed on to be their lover. Rather, I 
am their policeman." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Garamendi said he was pleased that Torres had said consumers 
would be his "first priority." 
</P>
<P>
 "He will undoubtedly be a different commissioner than I am, but he will handle 
the task well," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In another remark to the agents, Torres promised if elected to form a 
partnership with the industry, but also said, "That partnership has to be in 
the best interest of the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview later, Torres said he felt that in his speech to the agents 
his remarks were more critical of the Department of Insurance bureaucracy than 
of Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres noted that he refers to the agency's employees as "burrocrats," to 
describe their stubbornness. "We've got a problem with civil servants that 
nobody can control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Democratic candidate also said that Garamendi's regulatory policies 
may be driving insurers out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's no insurance out there, that's not in the best interest of the 
consumer," he said. "Making it affordable and accessible as commissioner will 
be my responsibility."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WORDS TO LIVE -- AND LOSE FRIENDS -- BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like ragging on your friends to a stranger, who has a big mouth. It's 
careless and dumb and -- to use one of Kathleen Brown's words -- raises 
questions of "principle." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Treasurer Brown, some snide comments about Democratic allies 
to a magazine writer have become a defining moment in her campaign for 
governor. They likely defined her for many people as disloyal, insensitive and 
sanctimonious. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what she said, referring to her opposition to the death penalty: 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . In politics it is important to have individuals of principle who don't 
just change to become politically correct. . . . I could have done what every 
politician in California has done. I could have changed my position like Dianne 
Feinstein did and Barbara Boxer did and Leo McCarthy did and Mel Levine did and 
Willie Brown did. Every single one of them changed their position to run for 
higher office. I couldn't do that the way I was raised. I was raised to believe 
that politics was also about principle. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's comments were reported in the Sept. 10 issue of the National Journal 
and widely circulated last week by Gov. Pete Wilson and Rep. Mike Huffington, 
Feinstein's gleeful opponent. Brown blamed "Republican mischief," but she made 
the comments. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilson's attack dog spokesman, Dan Schnur, put it: "Kathleen Brown has 
somehow managed to disparage the integrity of five of the leading Democrats in 
the state of California. I don't think I've ever been able to do that before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, Brown was wrong about her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Feinstein -- regardless of Huffington's TV ads that Brown gave credence 
to -- has embraced the death penalty for 25 years. She didn't run for statewide 
office until four years ago. In fact, she was hurt politically as a San 
Francisco supervisor by supporting capital punishment. The local Democratic 
Central Committee censured her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting out the word that Dianne Feinstein has supported the death penalty 
for 25 years isn't all that bad," her campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, now says. 
But initially he was puzzled and angered by Brown's comment. The senator didn't 
need this in a bruising reelection battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brown issued a statement acknowledging she had been "mistaken" about 
Feinstein. But she didn't offer any apologies for the other four Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Boxer and Lt. Gov. McCarthy, both also from San Francisco, began 
supporting the death penalty in 1985, saying they had been repulsed by heinous 
serial murders. McCarthy ran for reelection in 1986, then for the Senate in 
1988. Boxer didn't run for the Senate until 1992. Neither did former Rep. 
Levine of Los Angeles, who became a death penalty supporter in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Brown never has run for higher office nor intended to. In 
fact, he has never voted for a death penalty bill, although he does favor the 
gas chamber for some "horrible, venal people. . . . There's no way you can 
justify that these cats ought not to be put to death." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, what's the sin in changing your mind? In some fields that can be 
called growing in the job . In politics, there's this bugaboo about 
flip-flopping . Why is being close-minded so principled? After all, the 
citizenry does elect politicians to represent its views. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Californians -- particularly women -- have changed their minds about 
capital punishment in the last 30 years. "Women were somewhat ambivalent. Now 
they see themselves as victims and have become quite militant about the death 
penalty," says pollster Mervin Field. In the mid-1960s, only half the 
California public supported capital punishment; now three-fourths do. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown's death penalty position is the same as her father's and 
brother's when they were governor: She's against it, but she'll enforce it 
because it's the law. But she never has really explained why she's against it, 
other than "my father taught me it was wrong and the religious experiences I 
had reinforced that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has reversed herself on other issues. She supported NAFTA until Labor 
Day, 1993, when she bowed to AFL-CIO pressure and announced her opposition, 
saying the treaty did not protect U.S. jobs. She opposed term limits when they 
were on the ballot in 1990, but this year has talked about their "positive 
results." As a member of the Los Angeles Board of Education in the late 1970s, 
she was on many sides of the hot busing issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Brown assesses her magazine quotes this way: "Kathleen was doing what 
many of us as candidates do when we're facing bad times and the numbers don't 
seem right. . . . Your true abilities demonstrate themselves when you're 
looking at adversity. She just didn't take a deep breath." 
</P>
<P>
 If she had, she might also have said: "Off the record." Chalk it up to 
political inexperience.

 Nicholas Green of Bodega Bay died Saturday in Sicily after being in a coma 
since Thursday, when he was shot in the head while riding with family members 
along a stretch of roadway in southern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight, doctors detached life support equipment and removed 
his heart, liver, kidneys and pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father, Reginald Green, said Nicholas' life was wasted but that he 
and his wife wanted their son's "very strong heart" and other organs donated to 
other children in the land Nicholas had grown to like during his visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas' heart was given to a 15-year-old boy named Andrea Mongiardo, whose 
heart problems have stunted his growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas' liver was donated to a 19-year-old Sicilian woman, and his kidneys 
went to two children from the south. His pancreas went to a diabetic patient in 
Perugia. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Minister Raffaele Costa said he hoped the Greens' example will help 
change attitudes in Italy, which has one of Europe's lowest rates of organ 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad it went well," Margaret Green said, referring to the heart 
operation. "It means his death wasn't meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked him to live a long time. Now I wish the same thing for his 
heart," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green family was vacationing in Italy and heading for Sicily when the 
attack took place in the Calabria region. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian authorities have ordered increased patrols of the stretch of highway 
where the shooting took place, which is known for holdups of trucks and cars.

BRITISH TABLOID PRINTS ALLEGATIONS OF AFFAIR WITH PRINCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former army officer has claimed that he was Princess Diana's lover for three 
years before she separated from Prince Charles, the British tabloid press 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Maj. James Hewitt, an officer in the elite Life Guards of the Royal 
Household Cavalry Regiment, was said to recount the affair in a book that 
reportedly will be dispatched to British booksellers today. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishing circles have hinted that Hewitt, 36, was given a 
multimillion-dollar advance for his story -- which he will seek to confirm with 
love letters sent to him by Diana, 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Other journalists who cover the Royal Family argued Sunday that although 
Hewitt and Diana were close friends, they were not intimate. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Charles admitted on television that he had been unfaithful to his 
wife before their official separation in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tabloid News of the World on Sunday, Hewitt was reported saying that he 
and the princess became close friends when he was assigned to teach her to ride 
horses -- and then became lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were deeply in love," Hewitt reportedly said. "In fact, Diana was so in 
love with me that she even contemplated leaving Prince Charles for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "For three years, I was the man in her life. It got so serious that 
I was warned to stay away from her." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by the paper's reporters if he had ever made love to Diana, Hewitt 
answered with a "terse but emphatic yes," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt's book, prepared with the aid of a ghost writer, is expected to appear 
after a secret writing and printing operation by the publisher, Bloomsbury. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is believed to contain extracts from intimate letters sent to the 
major by the princess during the Persian Gulf War, according to the News of the 
World. 
</P>
<P>
 It is common knowledge that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the princess 
was fond of Hewitt, who served with the Life Guards tank forces in the Gulf War 
and was commended for valor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt returned from the Gulf as an acting major, but he repeatedly failed to 
pass his written examinations for permanent promotion to major and had to 
retire from the army last spring after 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say he has no outside income except for money received from selling 
interviews in previous articles outlining his friendship with Diana. But in 
those stories, he did not claim to have had an affair with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's tabloid press Sunday accused Hewitt of "betraying" the princess and 
quoted Member of Parliament Nicholas Bonsor as declaring: "Hewitt's behavior is 
abominable. He is the biggest bounder I have ever come across. I cannot 
comprehend how he can still look at himself in the mirror."

JUSTICE; COMPARATIVELY YOUNG HIGH COURT EXPECTED TO SHOW CAUTION; IN TERM 
OPENING TODAY, THE JUSTICES FACE TOUGH CALLS ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND RACIAL 
GERRYMANDERING. TERM-LIMITS RULING ALSO DUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Supreme Courts go, the one that takes the bench this morning is young and 
inexperienced, still conservative in its outlook but likely to be more cautious 
than bold in making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the life-tenured justices will consider whether the voters by law 
can limit the terms of their representatives in Congress. They are also set to 
rule on whether the government can give an edge to minorities in competing for 
contracts and whether the states can aid minority candidates in drawing 
electoral boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outcomes are especially hard to predict because the court itself has 
been reshaped in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine justices that open the fall term, six have joined the court since 
1986, a turnover rate more rapid than at any time since President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt replaced the "nine old men" from 1937 to 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 But where F.D.R. transformed the staunchly pro-business court into a 
dependably liberal and pro-labor forum, the recent appointees have come from 
three different presidents who share no common ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the New Deal court, the recently revamped court has yet to establish a 
clear identity. The conservatives, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, 
still have the votes to drive the agenda. But they have been unable to form a 
strong enough alliance that would enable them to rewrite the law in areas such 
as abortion, religion or civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 And this court is unquestionably younger than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, the high court was dominated by aging justices, five of whom 
were 78 or older. Most had gone to law school in the 1920s and had begun their 
legal practice during the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, none of the nine justices has reached age 75, and a majority of them 
emerged from law school after 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an amazing transformation. The court has gotten 30 years younger in a 
decade," Washington attorney Theodore Olson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday marks the debut of 56-year-old Justice Stephen G. Breyer. He will sit 
at the far end of the bench opposite President Clinton's other appointee, 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 61. 
</P>
<P>
 But President George Bush's two appointees are actually younger: David H. 
Souter, 55, and Clarence Thomas, 46. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ronald Reagan's three nominees are moving into their judicial prime years: 
Sandra Day O'Connor, 64; Antonin Scalia, 58, and Anthony M. Kennedy, also 58. 
The court's oldest justice is 74-year-old John Paul Stevens, a Gerald R. Ford 
appointee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their youth, the new justices have not proved especially energetic 
when it comes to deciding cases. So far, the court has put only 36 cases on its 
fall argument schedule, about half the norm of a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Rehnquist, a Richard Nixon appointee who turned 70 on Saturday, the 
court has been stingy in hearing appeals filed by criminal defendants or others 
who claim that they have suffered an injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 When the old liberals, such as William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry 
Blackmun, held sway, the justices kept an open ear for hard-luck stories. The 
prisoner who said he was unjustly convicted, the worker who said his rights 
were unfairly denied, the mother who said her benefits were wrongly terminated, 
all had a chance of being heard. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, most such claims are quickly dismissed. Last week, the court 
met in a brief session and rejected more than 1,700 appeals that had piled up 
over the summer. In all but a handful of those cases, the appeals are read by 
young law clerks and the cases are rejected without a moment's discussion among 
the justices. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal legal activists actually have been cheered somewhat by the court's 
relative inactivity. Two years ago, the conservative-led drive to overturn the 
Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion and to restore some prayer in the 
public schools came up one vote short. 
</P>
<P>
 "The constitutional counterrevolution has fizzled," Steven Shapiro, national 
legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But he may have spoken too soon. Race may emerge as the key theme of the 
1994-95 term, and in that area, the five conservatives tend to agree. 
Rehnquist, Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy and O'Connor have said that affirmative 
action in favor of minorities amounts to reverse discrimination against whites, 
and they may be ready now to put that view into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the court announced that it will hear a Colorado case that 
challenges the practice of preferring companies owned by minorities and women 
for awarding federal highway contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this fall, the court is also expected to plunge back into the 
voting-rights controversy over "majority-minority" electoral districts. In a 
1993 case, the five conservatives joined to rule that "racial gerrymandering" 
is unconstitutional. This term, they need to clarify whether all racially drawn 
districts are illegal, or only those that are "truly bizarre" in appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome in both cases, which will be heard early next year, probably 
depends on Justice O'Connor. Unlike the other four conservatives, she has in 
the past voted for some affirmative action plans if they are quite limited in 
scope and designed solely to remedy past discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 With the anti-incumbent mood sweeping national politics, the court will hear 
arguments in December on whether states can set term limits for their 
representatives in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Several states, including California, have limited the terms of their state 
representatives, and those restrictions have been upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is unclear whether the U.S. Constitution permits the states to restrict 
the terms of its representatives in Washington. Since 1992, 15 states -- 
including California -- have voted to limit House members to three, two-year 
terms, and senators to two, six-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts are split on the likely outcome of the issue before the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, the high court ruled that Congress had to seat embattled Rep. Adam 
Clayton Powell, who had been accused of financial misconduct, because he met 
the qualifications set forth in the Constitution. The Arkansas Supreme Court 
cited this decision in Powell vs. McCormack as precedent for saying that the 
only legal qualifications for national office are those set out in the 
Constitution, such as that U.S. representatives must be 25 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates point out that the term-limits laws simply restrict who can 
appear on the state ballot, and the Constitution clearly says that "the times, 
places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives shall 
be prescribed in each state." If a veteran member of Congress wants to seek 
reelection beyond the term limit, he or she can run as a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown University law professor Susan Bloch said last week that she 
changed her mind about the likely outcome after reading the briefs and the 
court's past rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a close call, but I think they will uphold them (term limits)," she 
said, noting that the court's conservatives are inclined to uphold popular 
state laws. Key Cases Before the Court 
</P>
<P>
 The fall's agenda includes a range of issues, from term limits to 
frequent-flyer rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits: Can a state by law limit the terms of its Congressional 
representatives? The Arkansas supreme court said no. The case of US Term Limits 
vs. Thornton, 93-1456, will be heard in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns at school: Can Congress make it a crime to have a gun near a school? No, 
said a U.S. appeals court in Texas, because states, not the federal government, 
have the power to control routine crime. U.S. vs. Lopez, 93-1260, will be heard 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Free speech: Can Congress bar a government accountant from earning money 
writing weekend articles on dance performances? No, said a U.S. appeals court, 
saying that a broad 1989 government ethics law violated the free speech rights 
of three million federal employees. U.S. vs. National Treasury Employees Union, 
93-1170, will be heard Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent flyer: Can the airlines unilaterally change the terms of their 
frequent-flyer programs? No, said an Illinois court, because it violates an 
implied contract. The appeal in American Airlines vs. Wolens, 93-1286, will be 
heard Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Job discrimination: Can a company defend itself against a discrimination claim 
by relying newly discovered evidence that hurts the worker, such as that he 
inflated his resume? Yes, said a federal court in Nashville. The appeal in 
McKennon vs. Nashville Banner, 93-1543, will be heard Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Political pamphlet: Can a "concerned" citizen by fined for passing out an 
anonymous political tract that opposed a tax increase? Yes, said the Ohio 
supreme court, because state law requires the disclosure of authors of 
political materials. The free-speech appeal in McIntyre vs. Ohio, 93-886, will 
be heard Oct. 12.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; U.S. TROOPS TO BEGIN DISARMING HAITIAN MILITIA, 
SENATOR SAYS; MILITARY: SEIZURE OF WEAPONS IS RISKY BUT NECESSARY, CONGRESSMAN 
REPORTS AFTER VISITING THE ISLAND NATION. 
</P>

<P>
 U.S. troops will themselves begin disarming the Haitian attaches who have 
attacked pro-democracy demonstrators if Haiti's police and military do not, a 
senior senator said Sunday after returning with the first congressional 
delegation to visit the Caribbean nation since U.S. forces intervened there. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficult and potentially dangerous operation, in which U.S. troops could 
be forced to search out not only weapons caches but small arms held by 
individuals, could put the soldiers into direct confrontation with the shadowy 
civilian militia allied with the Haitian police and military. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our forces there are going to take steps in the coming days to disarm this 
crowd, and they'd like to do it working with the Haitian armed forces," Sen. 
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) said. "But . . . if that doesn't work out, 
they're going to disarm them one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. military has avoided that task because of its great difficulty and 
the possibility of sustaining casualties. Before the U.S. intervention, rifles, 
hand grenades and other portable weapons were distributed by the Haitian regime 
among paramilitary forces numbering more than 1,000 and spread throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. military intervention in Somalia, the lack of a successful 
disarmament effort played a key role in the violence and chaos that later 
enveloped the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials directing the Haiti operation are realizing that eventual success 
there now requires that disarmament somehow be accomplished, even at 
considerable risk, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd, interviewed on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," said he believes 
U.S. soldiers will be killed or wounded before the mission, which began two 
weeks ago and which the Senate team said could last a year, is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the congressional delegation is the first official group outside the 
Clinton Administration to visit Haiti for an in-depth assessment since the U.S. 
troops landed, its findings are awaited with interest by both critics and 
supporters of the military operation. Congress is expected to vote this week 
whether to give the Administration a specific date for ending the U.S. 
deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the divided opinion in Congress over the military action, House 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) warned that, in venturing into disarming 
the population, "the Clinton Administration is now on the edge of a disaster. . 
. . We are right now drifting steadily into a quicksand of misery." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), who joined Dodd on the weekend visit to Haiti, 
said in a telephone interview that "no one knows who's calling the shots" among 
Haitian leaders in the transition leading to the return of ousted President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, "and that's not comforting." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he came away concerned that "the end game" -- how to wrap up the U.S. 
military operation and put in place the conditions for democracy -- was 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials stressed that other nations' participation in the 
effort will now begin growing. Samuel Berger, the White House deputy national 
security adviser, said on CNN's "Late Edition" that the first members of an 
international police force of 2,000 from Caribbean nations will begin arriving 
in Haiti today. Officials said the U.S. force now numbers more than 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is that eventually most of the U.S. troops can be replaced by a U.N. 
mission to which 24 nations will contribute soldiers and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. officials said the United States will become more aggressive in 
disarming the plainclothes militia in Haiti, it remained unclear how far they 
will go in this effort and whether it will be far enough to provide security 
for a stable transition. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. soldiers can seize caches of weapons and take weapons from individuals 
who they see carrying them. But house-to-house searches would be almost out of 
the question in the crowded streets and shanties that make up much of the 
attaches' territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd said he believes that the attaches would diminish as a threat if the 
United States manages to capture their key leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real structure here, and if you can get the top people and isolate 
them, capture them and hold them, this structure falls apart," he said. "The 
rest of this crowd will sort of disappear, and the threat of the paramilitary 
groups will dissipate." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee and a member of the visiting congressional delegation, cast a 
skeptical eye on the chances for easy success. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the moment, we are not disarming the attaches unless we see them in a 
violent situation," he said. "It will be very difficult to change the attaches. 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Pell said it is imperative to "make sure we have a vibrant police force built 
up by Americans." Maybe then the attaches "will fade away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One central question hanging over the Haiti operation, and still unanswered, 
is whether Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military leader, will leave the country 
after he leaves office. In meetings with the congressional delegation, he again 
committed himself to stepping down by Oct. 15, but he left it unclear whether 
he will try to remain in Haiti after Aristide is returned to office under the 
accord worked out two weeks ago by former President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate delegation, according to Pell, made clear its view -- albeit with 
the rest of the Haitian high command in the room -- that the general should 
leave Haiti. But, Pell said, "he made no commitment to do that."

 Residents of a halfway house rescued a missing boy and captured his suspected 
kidnaper after the boy's mother, upset by the lack of police action, sought 
help from the ex-convicts in her own search.A dozen halfway house residents 
discovered the 11-year-old boy and his alleged captor wrapped in a blanket near 
the boy's home. The boy was naked and apparently had not eaten since he was 
abducted Thursday while walking to an aunt's house, police said. The boy's 
mother said she turned to the halfway house residents after police told her 
they could not launch an immediate search because the boy did not meet criteria 
for a missing person.

 A body found in a shallow grave near Pine Bluff is believed to be that of a 
16-year-old girl abducted from Texas as she pleaded with a 911 dispatcher for 
help, authorities said. Clothes belonging to Lisa Rene were found on the body, 
said FBI Special Agent Robert Satkowski.The body was sent to a lab for positive 
identification. Three men have been charged in the kidnaping. Lisa was the 
sister of two men who allegedly cheated one of the suspects in a drug deal, 
officials have said. On Sept. 24, while talking to a 911 dispatcher, she said 
men were at her door who had identified themselves as the FBI. "They're trying 
to break down my door! Hurry up!" she said, in the call. A muffled scream is 
heard seconds later, with a man saying, "Who you on the phone with?" The line 
then went dead.

 Federal investigators have found far-reaching fraud and mismanagement in the 
U.S. Agriculture Department aid program that provides billions of dollars to 
farmers who suffer crop losses in disasters such as the Midwest floods of 1993, 
a newspaper reported.Citing reports by the Agriculture Department and Senate 
investigators, the New York Times said many farmers have collected excessive 
payments by inflating crop losses, misstating the acreage they planted or 
failing to harvest crops when market prices fell below the amount paid in 
disaster assistance. The paper said the inquiry by the Senate Agriculture 
Committee was limited to eight crops in nine states. Still, the story said, 
investigators found $92.5 million in questionable payments from 1988 to 1993.

CLINTON'S 1990 CAMPAIGN FAILED TO DETAIL HOW EXPENSE FUND WAS SPENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton's 1990 gubernatorial campaign failed to disclose how it spent 
about $40,000 in expenses, as is apparently required under Arkansas election 
law, the White House said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount is a fraction of the $2.5 million Clinton raised and spent to win 
his fifth term.Bruce Lindsey, an adviser who was treasurer of the 1990 
campaign, attributed the lapse to confusion over an election law that took 
effect a month after the 1990 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the money paid bills for computers, polling and advertising. Records 
are now in the hands of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, who is 
examining the race as part of a broad inquiry into President Clinton's personal 
and political finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in the state campaign law in December, 1990, required detailed 
accounting of expenses. But Lindsey said the secretary of state's office did 
not provide proper forms, so the campaign submitted old forms that did not 
require an accounting of expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded Sunday that the campaign could have disclosed the expenses by 
simply listing the bills on a separate sheet of paper, "if we had thought about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey said there also was some question about whether the new law applied to 
the 1990 election. The state attorney general issued an opinion that did not 
definitively answer the question, but said state officials should presume the 
law was retroactive.

ARRESTS TRIPLE ON FIRST DAY OF CRACKDOWN AT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first day of a major new border-tightening campaign saw arrests of illegal 
immigrants triple over the same one-day period last year, the U.S. Border 
Patrol said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's start of "Operation Gatekeeper" recorded 825 apprehensions in this 
most porous section of the border, compared to 259 on the same day last year, 
said Gustavo De La Vina, western regional commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "What used to be fluid entry into this area . . . we're taking that away from 
them," De La Vina said. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation is the federal government's attempt to duplicate its recent 
border-sealing Operation Blockade in El Paso. More than half of all illegal 
immigrant apprehensions are made along 60 miles of border here. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those stopped were fingerprinted and returned to Mexico, De La Vina 
said, adding that there were no incidents of violence, as some officials had 
feared.

ESTONIANS AND SWEDES MOURN VICTIMS OF FERRY DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People flocked to Estonia's churches Sunday to honor more than 300 relatives, 
friends and compatriots killed in the worst maritime disaster in the small 
Baltic nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tallinn's Karli Church, people sang, prayed and shed tears for those who 
went down with the ill-fated ferry Estonia in the Baltic Sea on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no answer for why this disaster has befallen us," Pastor Gustav Piir 
told the congregation, which was much larger than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is now a heavy burden for this nation," Piir said, his voice booming 
across the high vaulted ceiling. "We feel helpless in the face of something we 
cannot explain." 
</P>
<P>
 In a country of just 1.6 million people, virtually everyone knew a victim -- 
or knew someone who did. It was as if 47,000 people in the United States had 
died in a single accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedes also gathered in churches Sunday to remember more than 500 of their 
compatriots who died in the tragedy. King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia led 
an evening memorial service at Stockholm's Lutheran Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us have lost a neighbor or a work colleague aboard the Estonia. Words 
have little comfort at a moment like this," Ingvar Carlsson, the newly elected 
prime minister, told the congregants, who included several survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari attended a memorial service in Helsinki's 
Lutheran Cathedral, and the Finnish Red Cross and the Lutheran Church took up 
collections for the Estonian victims of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 At the port in Tallinn where the ship began its final voyage, only to sink 
hours later in rough seas, people placed flowers and candles by the departure 
gate. Black ribbons fluttered from the radio antennas of many cars in the old, 
steepled capital. 
</P>
<P>
 At a memorial concert in the Estonia Concert Hall on Saturday, President 
Lennart Meri asked: "Why do we have to drink this bitter glass of pain and 
suffering? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an answer to this eternal question," he said, choking back tears. 
"Through suffering a person gets stronger. A nation gets stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Mart Laar, prime minister of the former Soviet republic, said that the sinking 
of the Estonia was the worst thing to happen to his country since Red Army 
troops invaded in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest exodus of Estonians to the West occurred then, almost 50 years to 
the day before the ferry catastrophe. Scores of refugees went down in stormy 
weather as Soviet gunboats pursued them. Many succumbed in the same area as the 
Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "History has come back to us in a tragic form," Laar said.

CROWDS CELEBRATE TRANSFER OF PRESIDIO TO PUBLIC'S HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In military-speak, a force of "civilian personnel" numbering in the tens of 
thousands "invaded" the U.S. Army's venerable Presidio over the weekend, 
marking the moment when the seaside promontory that is the nation's oldest 
military base fell into the hands of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of planning and discussions, the Army retreated to occupy 
about a third of the sprawling, largely forested facility at the south end of 
the Golden Gate Bridge on Friday. The site has been a military installation 
since Spanish soldiers founded it in 1776, and the Presidio had been in 
continuous use longer than any other in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating the change in stewardship, bike riders, joggers and sightseers 
visited the park over the weekend, warmed by midday sunny skies. About 20,000 
people stopped off at the park's military and civilian visitor facilities, 
which include a museum, Civil War-era fort and park headquarters, spokeswoman 
Mallory Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's new visitor center "was mobbed . . . all day long" both days, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army will continue to occupy about a third of the 1,480-acre site, paying 
rent to the National Park Service for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the change in ownership on the public will be subtle, at least 
at first. The public had always been allowed to visit much of the Presidio, 
which is unusual for military bases. Acreage includes beaches, hiking and 
biking trails, a war memorial and a dense forest of 400,000 pine, cypress and 
eucalyptus trees dating to the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the Park Service has installed signs explaining points of 
historical interest in the park, and soon rangers and docents will offer guided 
tours and walks. Smith said that already, 250 rangers and volunteers were kept 
busy by the curious throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the facility is now one of the nation's largest urban parks, its new 
stewards want to preserve its military history. As an example, Smith said, the 
park service will continue the traditional practice of firing a cannon in the 
Presidio's Pershing Square at 5 p.m. each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Presidio is one of 80 bases being converted to other uses by the Pentagon 
to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ceremony to mark the hand-over was solemn, and some officers and 
enlisted personnel were moved to tears, said Sgt. Donald Banks, a spokesman for 
the 6th U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend's large number of visitors to the park seemed "like an invasion 
from all directions," he said Sunday, and was "somewhat awkward to many of the 
military who still live on the Presidio." 
</P>
<P>
 About 380 6th Army uniformed personnel will continue to live and work on the 
base, occupying more than half of the Presidio's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Banks said, "the change has come" and "this has gone from a place where 
many people trained for war to a place where people are training their eyes for 
beauty."

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS' LUCK STICKS AROUND TO HAUNT RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a touching tribute to the Angels on what should have been the final day of 
baseball's regular season, the Rams showed Sunday that they, too, can blow a 
5-0 lead at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a 2-0 ballgame after Sean Gilbert took Jeff George deep, pounding him 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, Tony Zendejas made it 5-0 with a towering drive to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 But Atlanta rallied for eight in the fourth, and that was that. A sterling 
defensive effort -- just one error -- had gone to waste, and the Rams walked 
away from this one as keepers of another sacrosanct Angel tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Under .500 and in last place on the first Sunday of October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams simply can find no relief. 
</P>
<P>
 They shut out Joe Montana and Jeff George through seven consecutive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 They limit the multidimensional offenses of Kansas City and Atlanta to single 
digits -- a total of eight points in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 They come within 3 minutes 15 seconds of recording back-to-back shutouts, 
which would have been a nine-year first for the league and a 49-year first for 
the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 And then a backup quarterback splits two Ram safeties with a third-down pass 
into the end zone and the Rams wind up with a split, one victory and one 
defeat, and how on earth does this end justify the means? 
</P>
<P>
 Five-nil. "That would have been a great score to win by," said Ram cornerback 
Todd Lyght, who'd just played perhaps the game of his professional career, 
hounding and holding Andre Rison to three catches, 34 yards and no points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played real good," Lyght said, staring at the dressing room floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Expletive), man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know, man. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Among Ram defenders, Lyght was speaking a universal language. What else can be 
said after you shut down Rison, knock George out of the game, make the two 
biggest names in the Atlanta run-and-shoot irrelevant . . . and a couple of 
understudies, Bobby Hebert to Ricky Sanders, beat you on one completion with 
barely three minutes on the clock? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we need to score more points on defense," Ram defensive end Fred Stokes 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we have to shut people out," safety Anthony Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, what more can a defense do? 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes delivered what might have been the NFL hit of the week, a brutal 
head-on assault of George late in the third quarter that left the Atlanta 
quarterback writhing on his back in his end zone, tiny falcons swirling around 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made this kind of . . . sound, " Stokes said of George. "It was kind of 
scary. A loud grunt. I knew that if he was going to get up, he was going to get 
up slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 George had to be helped off the field and into the trainer's room, where he 
was diagnosed with a concussion. Job well done, Stokes thought. The Rams' 
starting quarterback, Chris Chandler, went out earlier with a badly sprained 
ankle. A passer for a passer, Stokes figured, a tooth for a tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that would even things up," Stokes said. "Now, both starting 
quarterbacks were out. It seemed like a good thing, until Bobby came in there 
and started playing." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't often a defensive lineman gets to spike a quarterback in the end 
zone, but the Rams had done it twice. First, Gilbert for a safety. Then, Stokes 
just as soon as George released the ball. "That was hitting it on the sweet 
spot, like a baseball player," Stokes said, savoring the sensation. "That was a 
sweet sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it totally backfired on the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes hit George just hard enough to take the Rams out of the game. On came 
Hebert and there went the Falcons, driving downfield 89 yards for the only 
touchdown of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize Bobby's been in there before," Stokes said. "Unlike Tommy 
Maddox, who was thrown into the fire for us. Which is kind of unfair, when you 
think about it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "You think 'Our starter's out, their starter's out' and things are even. They 
weren't as even as we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 One 13-yard pass from Hebert to Sanders was all it took. Earlier in the week, 
Newman went on record to challenge Rison to "come over the middle," but it was 
Sanders who took him up on it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the middle of the end zone where Sanders caught the ball, between 
the two Ram safeties, Marquez Pope and Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sanders) was on the opposite end of the field," said Newman as he issued a 
plea of not guilty. "I was on Rison. The man to stop down there is Rison. Stop 
him in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, mission accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came this close," Newman said, pinching the air with his right thumb and 
forefinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inches away. Inches away." 
</P>
<P>
 And now? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're nothing," Newman said. "Let me tell you, I'm hurting so much right now. 
I was (ticked) off at the end of the game, but now I'm sad. I don't know what 
to do. I don't know. I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever said ignorance is bliss obviously never played defense for the Rams.

YOUNG SHULA ONLY FODDER TO DOLPHINS; PRO FOOTBALL: MIAMI SEEMS TO TAKE IT EASY 
AGAINST LOWLY CINCINNATI, 23-7, IN FIRST FATHER-SON COACHING MATCHUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 That this night was special could not be determined from Don and Dave Shula's 
pregame hug, seeing as it was announced on a printed schedule and accompanied 
by 57 photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not evident as both men stood solemnly on opposite sides of the 50-yard 
line during the national anthem, seeing as an intruding camera made it 
impossible for Dave to see Don. 
</P>
<P>
 That this night was special did not become clear until three hours later, in a 
scenario that was not made for television, with an act that could not have been 
scripted. 
</P>
<P>
 Through most of the second half of his Miami Dolphins' eventual 23-7 victory 
over Dave's Cincinnati Bengals, Don did not have the heart to knock his son 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe he had too much heart. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing coach through 2 1/2 quarters while the Dolphins took a 17-7 lead 
over the Bengals, Don Shula suddenly played father. 
</P>
<P>
 Five times in the game's final 24 minutes, the Dolphins took possession of the 
ball after a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 But not once during that stretch did the NFL's top-ranked offense capitalize 
with a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Not once did the Dolphins even act like they wanted to score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Only once in that stretch did Dan Marino complete a pass of longer than 10 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven times in the Dolphins' final 28 plays, Shula chose to hand the ball to 
someone named Bernie Parmalee. 
</P>
<P>
 Only twice did they actually score, both times on field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 So upset were the Dolphin offensive players that on consecutive plays midway 
through the fourth quarter, tight end Keith Jackson screamed and shook his 
hands, followed by receivers Irving Fryar and Mark Ingram throwing their 
helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men had been open and in position to score a touchdown. All three 
men had been ignored by Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The strange ending was complete by the postgame reaction of Don Shula's wife, 
Mary Anne. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband had won, yet she was crying. 
</P>
<P>
 And so this first father-son coaching meeting in professional sports history 
was probably as it should have been. About a father and a son. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was hard, very hard," Mary Anne Shula said. "This was very emotional. 
Don is a great defender of all his children." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether her husband had decided to take it easy on his son, she 
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that would be a human thing to do," she said. "But my husband would 
not think like that for one minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet during the postgame news conference, Don did little to dispel that notion 
that he was more concerned about Dave's defeat and 0-5 record than he was about 
his own victory and 4-1 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 You've never heard a team that lost five turnovers and could not move the ball 
past its opponent's 29-yard line after the game's first minute praised so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want me to say, seriously?" Don said. "I'm just very sorry for 
Dave." 
</P>
<P>
 What Don didn't say was that he reneged on his earlier pledge to avoid Dave 
before the game. They were laughing together at a family barbecue on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 And all he needed to say could be found in the performance of Marino, who 
averaged only 7.8 yards on his 26 completions, for only 204 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did what we had to do," Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shula's offense actually ran the ball two more times than it passed, even with 
top running back Terry Kirby out for the season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like we got about 20 points and just shut it down," tackle Ron Heller 
said. "I know everybody is thinking that Don went easy on his kid, but I don't 
know. I think he would have done that against anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 That this wasn't just anybody was evident afterward in the words of Bengal 
tackle Bruce Kozerski. He said what Dave Shula, with eight career victories 
compared to his father's 331, had never dared say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty close with Dave, and I know he wanted this game bad," Kozerski 
said. "I don't think anyone can even say how bad he wanted this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave could say little. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a night where the team had the opportunity to take the crowd and the 
national television and build on it . . . We weren't able to get it going," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he didn't try. 
</P>
<P>
 The game began with the younger Shula acting like any son whose father is 
visiting him for the first time at his job: by showing off. 
</P>
<P>
 Bengal quarterback David Klingler threw a screen pass to Steve Broussard for 
12 yards. Then another screen pass to Broussard for six yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he threw a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darnay Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays, three passes, seven points, for a team with the league's 
second-worst offense. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the Bengals' second drive, they ran a reverse to Scott 
for 11 yards. But at the end of that drive, Doug Pelfrey's 47-yard field goal 
attempt hit the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tough break," Shula said with a frown.  
</P>
<P>
 That was Don talking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins then did what they had to do -- Pete Stoyanovich's 28-yard field 
goal early in the second quarter, then an 11-yard touchdown pass from Marino to 
Keith Byars with 1:14 left in the half. Then nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about this is that now, Don can go back to cheering for Dave, 
checking his scores, asking about his team," Mary Anne Shula said, her eyes 
drying at the end of this special night. "Just like always."

RAMS COME UP SHORT IN BATTLE OF BACKUPS; PRO FOOTBALL: HEBERT RALLIES FALCONS 
TO 8-5 VICTORY IN RELIEF OF GEORGE. MADDOX THROWS KEY INTERCEPTIONS.

<P>
 Blame it on Ram defensive end Fred Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense had scored two points, enough to win Sunday, and it was 
pitching a second consecutive shutout, a feat not accomplished by this team 
since 1945 when it was known as the Cleveland Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons were goners, but then Stokes went helmet to helmet with Atlanta 
quarterback Jeff George, knocking George from the game with a concussion and 
prompting the appearance of Bobby Hebert in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert's 13-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Sanders with 3:14 to play in the game 
and his two-point conversion toss to Terrance Mathis propelled the Falcons 
(3-2) to an 8-5 victory over the Rams (2-3) before 34,599 in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good feeling after knocking George out of the game," Stokes said, 
"because our quarterback (Chris Chandler) was out and now their quarterback was 
out. To say I evened things out, though, was kind of an overstatement on my 
part because Hebert has been there in pressure situations before." 
</P>
<P>
 The same could not be said for Ram quarterback Tommy Maddox, and as a result, 
the battle of backups swung decisively in favor of the Falcons. Maddox could 
not get the Rams into the end zone, and Hebert's fourth-quarter rally negated a 
strong defensive effort, which included five sacks and an interception, 
</P>
<P>
 "What a shame," Ram cornerback Robert Bailey said. "It's like working for 23 
hours a day, they work one hour and get the most pay. It feels like we've been 
cheated, but we have no one to blame but ourselves. If they don't get on the 
board, we win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' final try for a tying field goal or winning touchdown ended when 
Kevin Ross intercepted Maddox's pass intended for Isaac Bruce at the Falcons' 
38-yard line with 1:37 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just threw a bad ball," said Maddox, who completed seven of 15 passes for 
86 yards with two interceptions. "I think I was a little limited; I didn't get 
any reps in practice this week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams started Chandler at quarterback, but he was carted off the field in 
the second quarter with a severely sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller, who had started the Rams' four previous games, lacked the arm 
strength to play against the Falcons because of a shoulder injury suffered 
against San Francisco two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did what I needed to do at halftime to get it ready to go out and not feel 
anything," said Miller, who had taken injections for pain the past few weeks. 
"I don't know how effective I would have been. I hadn't thrown hard since 
Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox stayed with Maddox for the second half despite a costly 
mistake in the final minute of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Marquez Pope's interception and 51-yard return had given the Rams the 
ball at the Falcons' 28-yard line with an opportunity to build on a 2-0 lead. 
After getting a first down at the 17, Maddox tried to go to Flipper Anderson in 
the end zone but the pass was intercepted by cornerback D.J. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just haven't thrown enough balls to Flipper and I was on a different page 
with him," Maddox said. "It's a ball I shouldn't have thrown." 
</P>
<P>
 Another mistake from a backup performer once again cost the Rams a chance to 
score a touchdown in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis plowed his way to the Falcons' one-yard line on the opening 
series of the third quarter. But guard Chuck Belin was caught holding on the 
play, wiping out Bettis' 27-yard gain and forcing the Rams to eventually settle 
for Tony Zendejas' 28-yard field goal.  
</P>
<P>
 Belin was forced into the game because center Bern Brostek suffered sprained 
ankles, which required left guard Tom Newberry to move to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis went over the 100-yard mark for the fourth consecutive week, gaining 
117 yards in 29 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost Chris Chandler and that was a key injury in terms of offensive 
production," said Bettis, who had to leave the game on several occasions 
because of a sore back. "We just couldn't put the points on the board that we 
needed in order to put the game away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense had shackled George and the high-powered run-and-shoot offense 
through three quarters. Norm Johnson's 51-yard field-goal attempt, which 
strayed wide right, on the final play of the first half was as close as Atlanta 
could come to scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Sean Gilbert decked George in the end zone for a second-quarter safety 
and a 2-0 halftime lead, and the Falcons' offense was in disarray. Cornerback 
Todd Lyght's relentless coverage on wide receiver Andre Rison eliminated him 
from the attack, and the play of Ram defenders Jimmie Jones, Robert Young and 
Stokes had George ducking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My worst fear was, yeah, we're shutting them down, but we're just going to 
give up one score and that's going to be it," linebacker Shane Conlan said. 
"The bottom line is we had to shut them down and we didn't when we needed to. 
They don't score and we win."

MIKE DOWNEY: NO PRACTICE DOESN'T MAKE PERFECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After the boys from Georgia beat Georgia's boys, 8-5, in a football game that 
went 56 minutes 46 seconds before anybody figured out how to score a touchdown, 
quarterback Tommy Maddox of the Rams laid all the blame on one person -- 
himself. For what? For not scoring a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play well. . . . I didn't make the plays when I had to. . . . It's a 
tough situation, but one I should have handled. . . . I've been looking forward 
to this opportunity for so long, and then I don't get the job done. . . . I 
expect more of myself. . . . We shot ourselves in the foot. No, I shot 
ourselves in the foot," Maddox said, masochistically. 
</P>
<P>
 He blamed himself for an interception with 1:37 remaining that gave Atlanta 
the game. He blamed himself for messing up a snap count. Maddox blamed himself, 
even though he had scarcely taken a snap in practice. He blamed himself, even 
though the regular Ram snapper, center Bern Brostek, was out of commission with 
sprains of both ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 And did his coach, Chuck Knox, absolve Maddox of any blame? 
</P>
<P>
 He did not. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't say one kind word about him. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't compliment Maddox for going out there on a moment's notice, as a 
replacement for the racked-up Chris Chandler, and for doing the best he could 
under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 No, instead what Knox said was, in language worthy of Casey Stengel, "He 
played about like you would think somebody would play who hasn't played." 
</P>
<P>
 Well. Thanks for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if the coach had better prepared his second-string quarterback for 
Sunday's game, that player would have played better than you would think 
somebody would play who hadn't played. You know? 
</P>
<P>
 Falcons 8, Rams 5 was somebody's fault, but not Tommy Maddox's. He was ill 
with flu Wednesday and didn't practice. He stood around Thursday and Friday and 
watched Chandler take every snap. He stood around watching Chris Miller take 
snaps for the scout team, the offense that masqueraded as Atlanta's. He 
twiddled his thumbs at Saturday's walk-through practice, even though coaches 
had finally gotten around to telling him that Miller wouldn't be fit to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, but don't coaches prepare a No. 2 quarterback for NFL games 
anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 "One-dimensional," Knox knocked the Ram offense after Sunday's loss, because 
the backup quarterback "hadn't played with this offense this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox has been with the Rams since Aug. 27. He has played in 29 NFL games 
since leaving UCLA, 25 of them in relief of John Elway, so he knows how to 
prepare himself to enter a football game. But, see, the Denver Broncos had this 
funny habit of letting their backup quarterback work with the offense during 
practice. Pretty radical. 
</P>
<P>
 So here was Maddox, laboring without benefit of adequate preparation or 
warning, running out onto the field fixing to hand off to Jerome Bettis as 
often as possible, only to discover Bettis in pain from a bruised hip. And at 
center he found Blair Bush, who ordinarily snapped only on kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough coming off the bench at any time, but still we moved the ball," 
Maddox said. "We got down in position once and had a chance to score and ended 
up with a field goal. Then we got in position to get another field goal, but we 
killed ourselves with penalties. And then I threw the interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every play told something new. I never got in a rhythm. I hit a couple passes 
in a row and kind of started moving the ball a little. But, like I said, we 
didn't put any points on the board when we had a chance to. And I'm to blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Like heck. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bettis said of the Falcons: "They came downfield more to stop the run 
because they knew Tommy was in there and hadn't had a lot of practice 
experience." Or as teammate Troy Drayton said: "Tommy just didn't have enough 
reps (repetitions; i.e., practice snaps) to come in and be as effective as we 
wanted him to be. He played well under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 There. Was that so hard to say? 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody has to quarterback this team next year, next month, next season. The 
Rams don't act as though that person will be Maddox, already having granted him 
a contract loophole that will make him available to the highest bidder after 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was awfully thoughtful of the Rams to make a trade that brought Maddox to 
their team. One of these weeks, they might even let him practice with them.

ANALYSIS; WHAT NHL MUST DO, AND SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball players went on strike Aug. 12, leading to the cancellation of the 
World Series for the first time in 90 years. Hockey is in suspended animation 
for two weeks. NFL teams are squeezing under salary caps for the first time. 
NBA officials have talked about locking players out around Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone detect a pattern here? 
</P>
<P>
 Writing sports stories -- and reading them -- requires a degree in labor law. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus here is on hockey, scene of the most recent and most ridiculous 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman calls the two-week negotiating period he ordered 
last Friday a postponement. The players call it a lockout. Either way, it's 
absurd that the season did not start on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 This was hockey's chance to grab the spotlight and shake its old, 
roller-derby-on-ice image. Baseball fans might have tuned in. Advertisers who 
had no baseball games to sponsor might have dropped dollars in NHL teams' 
coffers. The league might have built on the excitement it generated last 
spring, when a competitive regular season was capped by exciting playoffs and 
the New York Rangers' once-in-a-millenium victory. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Bettman had to go and shoot himself in the skates. He is going to get 
owners the salary cap -- make that salary-revenue link -- he promised them or 
he will die trying. Or the NHL will. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., is equally 
responsible for this mess. They had all summer to work on it, yet both chose to 
hide behind technicalities. He didn't respond to our letter, Goodenow says. 
Well, he didn't want to sit down with us 10 days ago, Bettman says. You didn't 
have to take away players' travel expenses and meal money, Goodenow says. Well, 
I had to get you back to the bargaining table somehow, Bettman says. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Day 2 of the postponement, Bettman and Goodenow decided they can't 
meet until Tuesday. What are they waiting for? Will someone please gather 
Bettman, Goodenow and their fleets of attorneys, lock them in a room with a 
phone and a takeout menu and forbid them to leave until they are close to a 
deal? 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the players innocents. Chris Chelios' speculation that someone might 
harm Bettman's family was incendiary and stupid. Montreal defenseman Matthieu 
Schneider had no business writing an offensive message to Bettman on his helmet 
and wearing it throughout a practice while photographers snapped away. Cut the 
derogatory comments about Bettman's short stature and lack of hockey 
experience. Maintain your professionalism and you come out of this with some 
integrity, if there's any left to be had. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman is a businessman. That's what he was in the NBA, that's what the 
owners hired him to be and that's what the NHL needs. You want someone who 
knows more about hockey? John Ziegler had hockey ties, but the game's growth 
outstripped his administrative talent and his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler's idea of a TV contract was SportsChannel America, a cable network 
unavailable in most NHL cities. Bettman got the NHL national, over-the-air 
exposure on Fox. Ziegler was content to run an old boys' club. Bettman has 
enticed Nike -- whose sponsorship fueled the NBA's explosive growth -- and 
other major corporations to back the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for mudslinging. Here are a few suggestions for bridging the gap that 
separates players and management on key issues: 
</P>
<P>
 Players should accept the NHL's entry-level pay scale, which would cover their 
first three seasons. In return, the clubs would be allowed to write into 
contracts substantial bonuses to reward production. What's wrong with making 
unproven players earn their salaries? Players can stipulate that pay increases 
be based on their total earnings, not only their base salary. 
</P>
<P>
 They agree upon unrestricted free agency after age 28, but the NHL wants one 
player per team to be designated a "franchise player" and would give the 
player's old team the right to match offers to him. If he leaves, the team that 
lost him gets a compensatory draft pick. Scrap the "franchise player" idea, the 
right to match and the draft pick. Make free agency free. 
</P>
<P>
 For players ages 22-28, the NHL would give clubs the right to match offers to 
their free agents. Compensation to clubs that lose premier players in this 
category would be two or three first-round draft picks (it's now five). So far, 
so good, but then the NHL wants to eliminate salary arbitration. Players want 
to keep it. We say forget arbitration if the other restrictions are lifted. 
Easier free agency is worth more than arbitration. Two first-round picks as 
compensation is hefty but not prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the tough one: Who pays the freight? 
</P>
<P>
 Owners want a graduated levy on payrolls starting at $250,000 over a set 
limit. Players say that would restrict spending on salaries. They want a flat 
5.5% levy on payrolls and gate receipts. Both sides would pool the money and 
re-distribute it to small-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a very gradual payroll levy, to be adjusted if the resulting pool is 
not enough to help small-market clubs or is more than needed? In addition, a 
hefty percentage of future expansion fees would go into the pool. The Mighty 
Ducks and Florida Panthers each paid $50 million to join the NHL last year, so 
the next entrants are likely to pay admission fees of about $60 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 Put $20 million of that in the pool, and it should work. Expansion is about 
two years off, so that would give the NHL next season to try this plan and 
determine how much expansion money to throw in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Players want a bigger piece of the revenue pie, and they deserve it. But they 
must realize this is still a moderately sized pie. While the Fox deal was a 
breakthrough for the NHL, the $155 million it will receive is merely one-tenth 
the amount Fox is paying the NFL for NFC rights alone. The other major sports 
leagues have lucrative, multi-network deals that climb into the billions. The 
NHL doesn't. You can't share what you don't have. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still reason to believe the season will start Oct. 15. That's because 
Bettman, a caustic but shrewd negotiator, left himself maneuvering room by 
saying he would only have to see progress and "good faith" negotiations to let 
the season start, rather than requiring a deal to be in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman doesn't want to be remembered as the commissioner who canceled the 
season and he doesn't want potential advertisers and expansion owners scared 
off by labor strife. Both sides acknowledge that they haven't made their best 
offer, but they must put it on the table soon. When that happens, Bettman will 
declare enough progress was made to let the games begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, we can only wonder if everyone involved has played too much hockey 
without a helmet.

 When 16-year-old Geoff Bodine told his father he wanted to become a race 
driver, Eli Bodine said absolutely no. 
</P>
<P>
 But Geoff always has been a bit headstrong, perhaps the reason that he's one 
of the best in NASCAR's Winston Cup series. When his father held a Powder Puff 
Derby on the one-third-mile oval, Geoff put on a wig, borrowed a 1956 Chevrolet 
from a friend, and began his driving career. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Geoff's 16-year-old son, Barry, wants to start racing. 
</P>

 "He'll get his chance," said Geoff. "But I hope he doesn't have to put on a 
wig to ride in a Powder Puff Derby."

 Doubles act: Luke and Murphy Jensen, the sometimes goofy brothers of tennis, 
wear black socks, shades and have been known to ride motorcycles onto the court 
for their matches. According to New York Magazine, they busted their rackets 
(like rock musicians who smash their guitars) in a recent appearance on "Late 
Night With Conan O'Brien." 
</P>
<P>
 Luke also broke his right thumb in the process. It didn't matter, though. Luke 
is ambidextrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Kevin McHale, either: Philadelphia 76er Coach John Lucas has written a 
book "Winning a Day at a Time," in which he recounts the 1977 incident when 
Houston Rocket teammate Rudy Tomjanovich was punched in the face by "Kevin 
Washington" in a game against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kermit Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas needs a backup center and a better memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ainge you glad: Danny Ainge, 35, told Jackie MacMullan of the Boston Globe he 
has no problem with the Phoenix Suns being picked to win the NBA Championship.

 Said Ainge: "We'd better win it all because we're running out of chances."

 Viva Vitas: Tennis doyen Bud Collins remembered when the late Vitas Gerulaitis

</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen-hundred celebrants showed up and the fete lasted two days," Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball five: David Halberstam, author of "October 1964," is a baseball fan, but 
that doesn't mean he can't sound a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great mistake to believe that something lasts forever," he 
said. "The game is more in jeopardy than it realizes." 
</P>
<P>
 And four minutes on the Brewers: Ken Burns, the creator of the 18 1/2-hour

GOLF ROUNDUP; ELKINGTON GETS VICTORY WITHOUT TAKING A SWING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The final round of the Buick Southern Open was rained out Sunday at Pine 
Mountain, Ga., giving Australia's Steve Elkington his fourth victory on the PGA 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough morning for me because it was sort of two minds for me," 
Elkington said. "I had a five-shot lead and I felt like all I could do was lose 
it. Then again, I was playing so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Elkington secured the lead at the halfway mark when he posted his second 
consecutive six-under-par 66 on the Callaway Gardens Mountain View course and 
had a 68 on Saturday, giving him a 54-hole total of 16-under 200. 
</P>
<P>
 The final round actually got under way, with four groups on the course when 
play was suspended at 8:27 a.m. About 90 minutes later, it was called off after 
heavy rain left water standing on the greens and in traps. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Former club pro champion Larry Gilbert outdueled Raymond Floyd down the 
stretch, taking advantage of a three-shot swing on the 16th hole to win the 
Vantage Championship at Clemmons, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert shot his third consecutive 66 for an 18-under 198 total and his second 
victory on the Senior Tour this season. He earned $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert and Floyd were tied at 17 under through 15 holes, but it was Floyd who 
flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 After a five-minute wait on the 16th tee, Floyd hit his five-iron tee shot on 
the 183-yard par-three into the crowd. After a free drop, he dubbed his chip 
shot short of the green. His second chip rolled to about four feet from the 
cup, but Gilbert promptly holed his 25-foot putt from the fringe for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd then missed his putt to fall three shots off the lead with two holes to

 Liselotte Neumann had three birdies in a four-hole span en route to a 
two-under 70 and a three-stroke victory in the $500,000 LPGA Heartland Classic 
at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Neumann birdied Nos. 9, 11 and 12 to take a five-stroke lead before faltering 
with bogeys at 16 and 17 for a 10-under 278 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Crosby and Pearl Sinn tied for second at 281.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 This had to be the toughest 8-5 loss ever suffered by a football or baseball 
team at Anaheim Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams came within 3:14 of tying the San Francisco 49ers for first place in 
the NFC West and becoming the first NFL team to record consecutive shutouts 
since the Chicago Bears in 1985. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It might be true that second-string quarterback is the second-most important 
position in pro football and third-string quarterback the third-most important. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The difference Sunday was that the Atlanta Falcons could turn to veteran Bobby 
Hebert after Jeff George went down, while the Rams had to rely on young Tommy 
Maddox, who had thrown one pass since 1992, after Chris Chandler was hurt. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had campaigned for Maddox, previously the third-stringer, to get 
some playing time didn't envision him having to take over in the second quarter 
of a 2-0 game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A one-man offense featuring Jerome Bettis simply won't get the job done most 
days. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams had won, Sean Landeta would have deserved a game ball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 His punts and a couple of penalties left the Falcons on their 9-, 15-, 4-, 5-, 
15-, and 11-yard lines. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Getting his first sack as a Ram was D'Marco Farr. The undrafted rookie tackle 
from Washington wears Deacon Jones' old No. 75 and told Jones during a 
post-game interview on KMPC, "I hope I can live up to your standards." . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Oregon played as well as it possibly could Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But that shouldn't have been good enough to beat USC handily at the Coliseum. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans looked feeble against a team that had been whipped by Hawaii and 
Utah. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The tacklers couldn't tackle.The offensive line that battered Baylor was 
overpowered. Rob Johnson reacted poorly to the Ducks' pass rush. His receivers 
dropped several passes. And John Robinson and his staff got out-coached by Rich 
Brooks and his staff. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojan play-calling was baffling. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A week after Shawn Walters rushed for 207 yards, 57 pass plays and only 17 
runs were called. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and his backup, Brad Otton, threw 45 times, were sacked nine times, 
and scrambled for gains three times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Walters picked up 26 yards on the first scrimmage play of the game, but at no 
time did the Trojans attempt to pound it out on the ground. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, they ran twice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the first time a Robinson-coached Trojan team scored fewer than 10 
points in a game at the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, UCLA should have tried a field goal on fourth-and-inches on the 
Washington nine early in the fourth quarter Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were trailing, 20-10, and needed two scores to get at least a tie. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Audibilizing on the line of scrimmage in the horseshoe end of Husky Stadium, 
like Wayne Cook did, is always a risky proposition. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies' Napoleon Kaufman is as exciting as any running back, college or 
pro, I've seen this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Think the Raiders could use him next Sunday?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Consistency is Wisconsin tailback Brent Moss, who has rushed for at least 
100 yards in 15 consecutive games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This should be remembered as the Saturday when Penn State trailed Temple in 
the second quarter and Nebraska trailed Wyoming in the third quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State's schedule-maker is smarter than Michigan's. The Nittany Lions are 
off next Saturday before playing at Michigan on Oct. 15. The Wolverines must 
face Michigan State, a natural rival coming off a victory over Wisconsin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pernell Whitaker quickly turned what had begun as a competitive fight with 
Buddy McGirt, who decked him in the second round, into a recital of his skills. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He even out-toughed McGirt," HBO commentator Gil Clancy said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Clancy had hyped the fight by saying these were the two best fighters 
pound-for-pound. He overrated McGirt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A Whitaker-Julio Cesar Chavez rematch doesn't appeal to me. Whitaker would do 
a job on Chavez and probably win by split decision. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'd love to see Whitaker move up in weight and fight Terry Norris. You've 
heard about fighters having a puncher's chance. Whitaker would have a boxer's 
chance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Losers Leave Town: USC, UCLA, the Rams and the Raiders all play road games 
next weekend.

<P>
 On his team's third defensive play, Indianapolis Colt defensive lineman Steve 
Emtman tackled Seattle's Chris Warren for a five-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it might have been the play of the year to date. For Emtman, the first 
pick in the 1992 draft, it capped a remarkable comeback from career-threatening 
knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the Colts, the former University of Washington star has suffered 
torn anterior cruciate ligaments in both knees. Last Oct. 10, against Dallas, 
Emtman tore two ligaments and the patella tendon in his right knee. After 
extensive off-season rehabilitation, Emtman returned to practice Aug. 29 and 
was activated this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say Emtman is the first player to play after tearing a patella. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous until the first play was over," Emtman said afterward. "As soon 
as that first play was over, I was just playing football again like I was back 
in high school or junior high or whatever. Football is football at any level, 
that's the way I look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing mostly on third downs, Emtman finished with three tackles and one sack 
in the Colts' 17-15 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Emtman was not motivated by greed. He is due to make $3 million in salary this 
season, but took out an insurance policy with Lloyds of London that would have 
paid him nearly as much had he retired. JOURNALIST JIMMY 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on those of us who thought Jimmy Johnson might use his position as a Fox 
television analyst to wage a personal war against Dallas owner Jerry Jones and 
Coach Barry Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who coached the Cowboys to consecutive Super Bowl titles, said on 
Fox's Sunday morning pregame show he is only doing his job when he offers 
constructive criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was among many who were critical of Switzer, who left town the night 
before a recent Cowboys' game to watch his son play football. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to talk about 28 teams, not 27 teams and avoid Dallas," Johnson 
said. "I'm going to give my opinion, that's what I'm paid to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has apparently so bonded with the First Amendment he is willing to 
risk future employment as an NFL coach to bring you the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned with hiring down the road," Johnson said. "I'm concerned 
about doing the best job I can do right here at Fox with my television work." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's Mike Ditka, another coach-turned-analyst, is another free press patriot 
who puts journalism before personal agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a coincidence that Ditka, in his quarterly report on the NFL, listed 
nemesis Buddy Ryan and his Arizona Cardinals as the season's biggest 
disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most ballyhooed team of the year has been Arizona," Ditka said. "They're 
going to do this, they're going to do that. And they haven't done a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Au contrair e. Sunday, Buddyball got off the snide and beat Minnesota, 17-7. 
BUDDY, CAN YOU SPARE A DIME? 
</P>
<P>
 Who says Ryan is heartless? The Arizona coach did not fine starting safety 
Lorenzo Lynch this week for missing two days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can he get here when he's locked up?" Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. Lynch, an eight-year veteran, was placed on a work-furlough 
program this week when he violated terms of a 1992 misdemeanor assault charges. 
For 30 days beginning last week, Lynch is to be locked up from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 To get Lynch ready for Sunday's game against Minnesota, Cardinal secondary 
coach Rob Ryan, the coach's son, delivered the playbook to Lynch in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan was unaware of his player's criminal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, obviously, was too busy tinkering with the Arizona offense. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's Kevin Butler kicked the first 50-yard field goal of the season. 
Going into the day, the league's kickers had been 0 for 18 from 50 and beyond. 
. . . Barry Sanders' 85-yard run in the second quarter was the longest of his 
career and the longest against the Buccaneers. Sanders' previous long was a 
69-yard run against Tampa Bay in 1991. His 85-yarder matches the second-longest 
in Detroit history. Bob Hoernschmeyer had an 85-yard run for the Lions in 1951. 
He also had a team-record run of 96 yards in 1950. Sanders climbed to No. 20 on 
the NFL's career rushing list with 7,416, passing Cleveland's Mike Pruitt 
(7,278) and Leroy Kelly (7,274). He has gained 1,188 in 10 games against Tampa 
Bay. Tampa Bay not only returned a punt for a touchdown for the first time in 
team history, but Rogerick Green came up with the club's first blocked punt in 
five years. . . . The Browns had three rushing touchdowns against the Jets, the 
first three by Cleveland running backs this year. The only previous rushing 
touchdown for Cleveland this year came on a sneak by Vinny Testaverde. . . . 
The Dallas Cowboys' 34-7 victory over the Washington Redskins was their sixth 
consecutive on the road (including playoffs). Dallas is 20-5 in its last 25 
games away from Texas Stadium. . . . Washington linebacker Monte Coleman was 
the lone representative for his team at the pregame coin flip. Coleman was 
playing his 205th game as a Redskin, tying Art Monk for first place on the 
team's career list. After the flip, his teammates saluted him by holding their 
helmets aloft, a Coleman trademark throughout his 16 seasons with the club. . . 
. Seattle was trying to open the season 4-1 for the first time since 1986. . . 
. Drew Bledsoe moved into sixth place in career passing yards for the Patriots. 
His 334 yards Sunday gave him 4,245 for his two seasons. He passed Mike 
Taliaferro, who passed for 3,920 yards from 1968 through 1970. . . . Chris 
Jacke's four points left him with 541, six short of becoming Green Bay's 
third-highest career scorer. Jim Taylor holds that spot with 546. . . . Green 
Bay and New England combined for 100 passes, the third-most in NFL history. 
Miami and the New York Jets had 104 in 1987 and San Francisco and Atlanta had 
102 in 1985. . . . Reggie White, the NFL's career sack leader, got his 140th in 
the first half, making Bledsoe the 52nd quarterback he has victimized. . . . 
Buffalo, 0-4 against NFC teams in the Super Bowl in the 1990s, lost for only 
the third time in 17 regular-season interconference games this decade. . . . 
Morten Andersen's 29-yard field goal for the Saints in the first quarter 
extended his scoring streak to 163 games, second-longest in history. It also 
was his 39th consecutive field goal from less than 30 yards. Andersen's field 
goal also extended the Saints' scoring streak to 166 games since a 7-0 loss to 
the Patriots on Dec. 4, 1983. . . . Saint quarterback Jim Everett entered the 
game needing 141 passing yards to reach 25,000 for his career. He got 249 to 
move ahead of Ken O'Brien into 33rd among the all-time passing leaders. BACK TO 
YOU IN THE BOOTH 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting live from the huddle, this is Marcus Allen .  
</P>
<P>
 In this age of radio transmitters in helmets, the day is fast approaching when 
NFL players will do color commentary during games in which they participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen might have taken the first step Sunday. The Kansas City tailback teamed 
with Mike Breen on Fox to broadcast the Detroit-Tampa Bay game. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, still an active player, took advantage of his team's bye week to brush 
up on his broadcasting skills. Next week, Allen returns to his day job when 
Kansas City travels to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside to Fox: Any chance Marcus could work a Raider game? COACH, CAN WE TRY 
THIS AGAIN? 
</P>
<P>
 Washington quarterback Heath Shuler took solace in his woeful debut as an NFL 
starting quarterback by seeking out another quarterback who got off to a rough 
start: Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Dallas Cowboys put the big hurt on the Redskins, 34-7, Aikman told 
Shuler to keep his chinstrap up. 
</P>
<P>
 In Aikman's debut for the Cowboys, Sept. 10, 1989, he completed 17 of 35 
passes for 180 yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman's Cowboys' finished 1-15 that season, but both quarterback and team 
eventually worked out the kinks. Shuler's first start was abysmal. The 
Tennessee rookie completed 11 of 30 passes for 96 yards, with one touchdown and 
one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Shuler's debut stack up against the greats? 
</P>
<P>
 In his first start in 1979, San Francisco's Joe Montana completed five of 12 
passes for 36 yards in a loss to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, Dan Marino came out firing in his first start in 1983, an 
overtime loss to Buffalo. Marino completed 19 of 29 passes for 322 yards and 
three touchdowns. RUSH TO JUDGMENT 
</P>
<P>
 No one at Scottsdale Community College in Arizona was surprised that 
Philadelphia's Charlie Garner rushed for 111 yards in his NFL debut against San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In Garner's first start for the school on Sept. 29, 1990, he ran for 394 yards 
against Arizona Western College. Two weeks later, Garner set the collegiate 
rushing record for all levels with 430 yards against Snow College of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the 49ers pretty much held Garner in check. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas tailback Emmitt Smith left the game at the end of the first half with a 
strained hamstring and did not return. Team trainer Kevin O'Neill said it would 
be a few days before he could gauge the seriousness of the injury. The Cowboys 
also lost tackle Mark Tuinei (back injury) and safety Joe Fishback (strained 
hamstring) in the first half. Tampa Bay tight end Jackie Harris sat out the 
second half with soreness in his left knee. . . . Cleveland fullback Tommy 
Vardell was sent to the Cleveland Clinic for further examination after he 
sprained his knee in the first quarter. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody runs on us, no matter where we are. The '85 Bears, the Eagles, the 
Oilers, nowhere -- not even Dallas next week."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Buddy Ryan, Arizona Cardinal coach, after his team's 17-7 victory over 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked that this happened . I'm shocked that this is what we look like 
today. All I can tell you is, we're still standing. We will not accept it. The 
players will not accept it. I can't. The coaches can't."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Pete Carroll, New York Jets coach, after his team's 27-7 loss to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely tougher the second time, especially with all the critics 
and, by the way, all the critics can kiss my . . . I'm back on the field and it 
feels great. "  
</P>
<P>
 -- Steve Emtman, Indianapolis Colts defensive tackle who returned from 
career-threatening knee injuries. TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Houston at Pittsburgh; 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 The offenses are betraying these teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh (2-2) had 452 yards of offense against the Seahawks last week, but 
Neil O'Donnell threw four interceptions. The Oiler offense has not been so 
stark, but it left the defense in bad field position enough times that 
defensive coordinator Jeff Fischer discussed the problem with offensive 
coordinator Kevin Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston (1-3) has held opposing quarterbacks to an AFC-best completion 
percentage of 54.2 and an average of only 147 yards per game. That has helped 
the Oiler defense become the fourth-best in the NFL. The Steeler defense is No. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers miss Warren Moon. Replacement Cody Carlson can't seem to stay 
healthy and Bucky Richardson has been inconsistent. The Oiler line has given up 
17 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzo White will start at running back for Gary Brown, who sprained an ankle 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to do what we did last year, and hope history does repeat 
itself," Houston cornerback Chris Dishman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers are trying to repeat last year's turnaround, when they started off 
1-3 but went on to win their next 11 games and the division title. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night brings out the best in the Steelers: They were 3-0 on Monday last 
season and they've won all four Monday games under Coach Bill Cowher, including 
two shutouts.

A BRUISE TO BETTIS HOBBLES ALL HOPE; RAMS: PAIN IN HIS LOWER BACK THROWS THE 
OFFENSE OFF KILTER WHEN HE IS NEEDED MOST, IN FOURTH QUARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tailback Jerome Bettis had done his best to disguise quarterback Tommy 
Maddox's inexperience in the Ram offense Sunday. All Maddox had to do was hand 
Bettis the ball and get out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple enough, right? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams abandoned their basic but effective strategy late in the fourth 
quarter of their 8-5 loss to the Falcons on Sunday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis carried 16 times for 72 yards in the second half, but with the Rams 
behind and driving with less than two minutes left, Maddox put the ball in the 
hands of jersey No. 36 -- not Bettis, but Falcon defensive back Kevin Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross intercepted Maddox's pass, which was intended for Isaac Bruce, at the 
Falcon 38-yard line and returned it to the Rams' 46. The Falcons ran out the 
clock, dropping the Rams to 2-3 overall and 0-3 against NFC West opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 So why was Maddox (seven of 15 for 86 yards passing with two interceptions) 
throwing the ball instead of handing it to Bettis when the game was on the 
line? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Bettis had given the Rams a first down at the Falcon 27 with a 
10-yard run up the middle, dragging four tacklers with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a hard call to make," said Bettis, who gained 117 yards in 29 carries. 
"I was a little banged up, so you have to take that into consideration. That 
was a decision that they (coaches) had to make in the heat of battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, along with the defense, gave the Rams a chance to win despite three 
key injuries to the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting quarterback Chris Chandler watched the second half on crutches after 
suffering a sprained left ankle in the first half. Starting center Bern Brostek 
sat out the second half because of sprained ankles, and Bettis bruised his hip 
while being tackled on a 27-yard gain early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox became the No. 2 quarterback this week because Chris Miller was still 
suffering from shoulder and rib injuries. Maddox had sat out Wednesday's 
practice because of flu and got only a handful of snaps in practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never got anything going like we wanted to," Bettis said. "We tried to get 
the passing game going, but when Chandler went down, that made things a little 
rougher for us. That was a key injury for us as far as our offensive 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Chris went down, you had to run the football. We couldn't put a lot of 
pressure on Tommy because he didn't have a lot of practice time and reps." 
</P>
<P>
 Which was why Bettis carried eight consecutive times for 44 yards to open the 
second half. He put the Rams in position to score by bursting up the middle for 
a 27-yard gain to the Falcon one, but it was called back because of a holding 
penalty on left guard Chuck Belin and the Rams settled for a 28-yard field goal 
by Tony Zendejas. 
</P>
<P>
 Belin, playing in his second NFL game, said he didn't believe he was holding 
on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy beat me upfield and I moved inside and tried to ward him off," said 
Belin, who came in the game when left guard Tom Newberry replaced the injured 
Brostek at center. "His hand broke through (under Belin's arm) and the official 
thought it was holding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mistake nobody wants to make, and I feel bad about it." 
</P>
<P>
 As the officials marched off the 10-yard penalty, Bettis got up slowly, having 
been hit hard by Vinnie Clark as he was trying to pound his way into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy hit me pretty low, in my upper buttocks and low back," Bettis said. 
"That's how it got bruised. He got me pretty good, and the muscle started 
tightening up. It was rough to keep it loose out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers hurriedly worked on Bettis on the sideline, stretching his legs as he 
lay on the ground. He returned later in the drive, and remained the focal point 
of the Rams' ball-control offense the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis has rushed for more than 100 yards in four consecutive games. But the 
Rams are 1-3 this season and 3-8 overall in his 100-yard games. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rams tied with New Orleans for last place in the NFC West, they need 
a victory this Sunday at Green Bay, where they lost by 30 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Bettis worried? He didn't seem to be Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a pretty good game today even though we lost our starting center, 
our starting quarterback, and I was banged up," Bettis said. "So we're going to 
rebound from this loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we can."

NFL'S TRIAL BALLOON ROUNDLY PUNCTURED; PRO FOOTBALL: TAGLIABUE TALKS OF A 
POSSIBLE NEW STADIUM FOR LOS ANGELES, BUT CITY OFFICIALS ARE VERY SKEPTICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The NFL floated an apparent trial balloon Sunday, saying it might enter into a 
partnership to build a football stadium in Los Angeles to keep a pro franchise 
here and serve as site of the Super Bowl on a rotating basis. But Los Angeles 
officials quickly dismissed the idea as unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tagliabue, the league commissioner, talked of the possible stadium in a 
halftime interview on the Fox television network, which has a contract that 
requires the NFL to keep a team in the Los Angeles area or receive less in 
payments from Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rams and Raiders telling an NFL owners meeting in Dallas last week 
that neither now has a contractual agreement to keep playing in the Los Angeles 
area, Tagliabue said the purpose of a new stadium built in partnership with the 
city or the state of California would be to "keep (the) NFL strong in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think maybe we've got a concept that can work if it's keyed to the Super 
Bowl, playing the Super Bowl on a rotating basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Fox pregame show, a commentator said an 80,000-seat stadium was 
contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
 But a short time later, Greg Aiello, the NFL's director of communications, 
said, "At this point, it's an idea without a great amount of detail." 
</P>
<P>
 It has such little detail, Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro 
said, "that I've never heard anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added, Mayor Richard Riordan left town, leaving Ferraro as acting 
mayor, without mentioning that such an idea exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other officials, who declined to be identified, said they believed 
Tagliabue's comments resulted from a variation of an old negotiating ploy by 
Raider owner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 As new negotiations begin for a long-term Raider contract at the Coliseum, in 
exchange for building luxury boxes there, Davis has, as he has so often in the 
past, started talking about moving elsewhere, one official said. "And the NFL 
is helping him put pressure on us. He always uses such scare tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds so much like Davis in the background," the second official said. 
"He got our stadium rent-free this year, and now he's already pushing us for 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacle to Tagliabue's suggestion of a partnership to build a stadium and 
possibly attract a new team, Los Angeles officials said, is that the city and 
state have no money to put up for such a stadium, and besides, they said, the 
Coliseum could become everything the NFL wanted for much less money. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sheldon Sloan, a Coliseum Commission member: "Every time I hear a story 
about an arena, I stop and think about the real cost of purchasing the 
appropriate land, of building a stadium and providing the parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably well over $250 million, and considering the Coliseum's in 
excellent condition now, and all that's left to do is some miscellaneous stuff 
that probably won't cost $30 million, that's just a wide gap in dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a director of Hollywood Park who declined to be identified said that 
R.D. Hubbard, chairman and chief executive officer there, has had discussions 
with Davis and others about building a football stadium in the Hollywood Park 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could build a 65,000-seat stadium," the director said, "but Davis doesn't 
want 80,000 seats, and why would anyone want to build one for one stinking game 
(the Super Bowl) every couple of years." Tagliabue's comments, he added, "may 
be all PR." 
</P>
<P>
 The new stadium concept came from the league's Super Bowl Policy Committee, 
headed by league President Neil Austrian. Austrian presented the idea to NFL 
owners last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ram President John Shaw: "It's an idea, but they haven't done any 
feasibility study at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 While Tagliabue spoke of a partnership with the city and state, the NFL wants 
to oversee a project in which it would build a stadium and NFL theme park in 
Los Angeles using land and access roads donated by the city, county and state, 
and some corporate and individual investment funds.

RAM NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY; QUARTERBACK SITUATION RAPIDLY DETERIORATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' quarterback options look pretty bleak this week after Sunday's 8-5 
loss to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox's choices: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Chandler, who stood in the locker room with the help of crutches 
after Sunday's loss and offered no prognosis on his sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Miller, a former starter and now emergency quarterback who got a 
pain-killing shot in his right shoulder at halftime Sunday but still didn't 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tommy Maddox, who struggled in his Ram debut after replacing an injured 
Chandler with 4 minutes 27 seconds left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler was hurt when Atlanta safety Ron George hit him from behind just as 
he let go of an incomplete pass to Flipper Anderson on a flea-flicker play. 
Chandler was taken off the field on a cart and although X-rays showed no 
serious damage, he looks to be in no shape to practice anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't break, so that's the good news," Chandler said. "We'll see how it 
is Monday. They shot it up and it feels decent right now. Hopefully, it's 
something that's not too serious." 
</P>
<P>
 "He (George) pulled me straight down and twisted me as I went down. I could 
feel it coming. I'm just glad it wasn't my knee. When I was going down, I 
thought for sure it was something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams billed Maddox as their quarterback of the future when they acquired 
him from Denver in August. He was inactive and ran the scout squad until 
shoulder and rib injuries slowed Miller two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox, battling the flu, had only a handful of snaps in practice, and 
completed only seven of 15 passes for 86 yards with no touchdowns and two 
interceptions Sunday. He killed the Rams' final drive when he was intercepted 
by the Falcons' Kevin Ross at the Atlanta 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had warmed up on the sidelines in the second half after taking a shot 
for his pinched nerve at halftime. But he and Knox were reluctant to have him 
play on the Rams' final drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said Knox told him Friday that he would be inactive for the game, 
saying he needed another week to rest his injured shoulder. Miller started the 
first three games before sore ribs and the shoulder sidelined him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely wasn't strong enough to play in a game situation," Miller said. 
"If I go in there and get hurt and buried, it doesn't do any good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to heal. If I go in and I'm not ready, I'm useless." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will try to get Miller ready this week. But Miller doesn't expect to 
practice until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we'll pump something in there to get it going," Miller said of his 
shoulder. "Maybe some Kryptonite." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute, didn't Kryptonite make Superman weaker?  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Lost in America: NFL security detained the Falcons' bus driver, who turned a 
10-minute ride from the team's Anaheim hotel into a 90-minute sightseeing tour 
that stretched all the way to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Two team buses left the hotel Sunday morning, but only one arrived at the 
stadium on time. The other bus driver got lost, and despite getting directions 
from Falcon officials, continued making wrong turns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Temper, temper: Chandler had some angry words for wide receiver Todd Kinchen 
on a miscommunication in the first quarter. After throwing an incomplete pass 
to Kinchen, Chandler ran up to the wide receiver and screamed in his face as he 
walked off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen said he thought Chandler had audibled to a running play and was 
blocking instead of running his pass route. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to hear at that point," Kinchen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen also was called for a costly 10-yard offensive pass interference 
penalty on the Rams' final drive, moving the ball from the Falcon 27 to the 37, 
and right guard Leo Goeas followed with a five-yard false start penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You make the call: Ram safeties Marquez Pope and Anthony Newman might want to 
add this pass route to their playbook -- 14-special Z-under. That was the pass 
route the Falcons' Ricky Sanders beat them on over the middle for the 
game-winning, 13-yard touchdown reception with 3:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Falcon starting quarterback Jeff George suffered a concussion and a possible 
broken nose when hit by defensive end Fred Stokes in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him coming at me and then I don't remember anything else," George 
said. "It took me a while to get my vision back. I wanted to go back in, but it 
just didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons, though, did have the perfect backup. Bobby Hebert is 7-0 as a 
starter at Anaheim Stadium, including a 13-0 victory last season. He was 6-0 as 
a member of the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert completed 10 of 14 passes for 122 yards and led the Falcons on an 
89-yard drive for the winning touchdown. Hebert threw a 13-yard touchdown pass 
to Ricky Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a close game here," Hebert said. "We always beat the Rams by 
two or three touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A fire near an Anaheim Stadium parking lot Sunday afternoon caused an 
estimated $15,000 damage. Anaheim firefighters responded at 1:51 p.m. to a fire 
on property adjacent to the 2100 block of E. Katella Ave. Firefighters found 
six palm trees and about 150 feet of grass ablaze. Fire and heat extended to 
some 35 vehicles in a dirt field adjacent to the lot. Firefighters knocked down 
the fire and confined the damage to what had already burned. Authorities say 
the fire remains under investigation.

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; NORTH CAROLINA WOMEN TIE, STREAK BROKEN AT 92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It had to end sometime and Sunday was that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of North Carolina women's soccer team, which had won 92 
consecutive games, finally met its match. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that it was Notre Dame that ended the Tar Heels' record streak should 
not have come as any surprise to UNC Coach Anson Dorrance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Notre Dame that ended the UCLA men's basketball team's NCAA-record 
88-game winning streak set between 1971-'74, so the Irish have a history of 
playing the spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Notre Dame held North Carolina to a 0-0 tie after overtime in St. 
Louis to snap the longest winning streak in college sports history. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at us five years ago, or even four years ago, we didn't belong on 
the field with North Carolina," said Notre Dame Coach Chris Petrucelli. "Even 
last year, we couldn't stay with them." 
</P>
<P>
 But North Carolina, which has won eight consecutive NCAA championships and 12 
of the last 13 titles, still has one streak going. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels, whose teams features many of the players on the defending world 
champion U.S. women's national team, are unbeaten in 97 games since tying 
Central Florida in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of 100 still is within reach. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 U.S. national team defender and former UCLA star Mike Lapper set a record of 
sorts in his debut for VfL Wolfsburg of the German second division. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing against Fortuna Koln, the 23-year-old scored a goal on his first shot 
in the league when he fired home a deflected corner kick. First-place Wolfsburg 
won, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Lapper's performance earned him a spot on Kicker magazine's team of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anghel Iordanescu, Romania's national team coach who led his country into the 
quarterfinals of the World Cup, has been rewarded, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Iordanescu has been promoted from colonel to major general in the Romanian 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian prosecutors have been unable to uncover sufficient evidence to keep 
two men in prison on suspicion of ordering the murder of World Cup team 
defender Andres Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
 The men have been released on bail, but Umberto Munoz Castre, the man accused 
of committing the murder, remains behind bars in Bogota awaiting trial. 
</P>

 Miguel Kodja Neto, the president of the Brazilian club Santos, is having 
second thoughts about his criticism of Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 Neto fired Pele from his position as "international adviser" to the club he 
helped make world famous in the 1960s after the two had disagreed over Pele's 
role at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just comes here as a visitor and all he does is complain," Neto said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show of solidarity with Pele, the rest of the Santos board of directors 
immediately resigned, leaving Neto to run the club on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santos has been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately. 
</P>
<P>
 First there was the incident with the club's fiery coach, Serginho, who was 
fined $50,000 for an on-field incident after Santos had been beaten, 4-0, by 
Guarini. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking past the Guarini bench on his way back to the locker room, Serginho 
kicked a Guarini club official in the groin after the man allegedly had called 
him a "cowardly pig." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, during another match against Vasco da Gama in Rio de Janeiro, Santos 
fans became involved in a brawl, the highlight of which, for neutral observers, 
was a Brazilian policeman being bitten by his own dog while trying to quell the 
riot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the "what goes around, comes around" department: Leonardo, the Brazilian 
player whose dangerously thrown elbow felled U.S. midfielder Tab Ramos in the 
World Cup, has found himself on the receiving end of an opponent's anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for his new club, the Kashima Antlers in Japan's J-League, Leonardo 
was sent writhing to the ground in agony after a hard tackle by an Urawa Reds' 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 The tackle injured Leonardo's right knee, which will require surgery and will 
keep him sidelined for two months or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The get-well card from Ramos is in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's World Cup coach, Miguel Mejia Baron, has been given a new, four-year 
contract that will run through the 1998 World Cup in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the agreement, Mejia Baron also will have charge of Mexico's 
1996 Olympic, Under-20 and Under-17 national teams.

PLAYER DIDN'T TELL TEAM OF HIS ARREST; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NORTHRIDGE GUARD 
BEAUREGARD FACING TWO COUNTS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Cal State Northridge football player facing two counts of attempted murder 
for allegedly shooting his ex-girlfriend and her friend has concealed the 
charges from the school's coaching staff since he was arrested more than a 
month ago, police and school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan G. Beauregard, 22, was arrested Aug. 29 in his hometown of San 
Bernardino in connection with the shooting outside the Arrowhead Elks' bar, 
said San Bernardino Police Lt. Jack Griggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after he was released on bail, Beauregard reported to practice with the 
Matadors. Beauregard -- a 5-foot-11, 270-pound offensive right guard -- is a 
second-year starter for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge coaches said Saturday that they did not know of Beauregard's 
arrest. And a conference spokesman said it was unlikely that the school would 
be sanctioned for allowing Beauregard to continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified as Von E. Thompson, 26, of Rialto, a security 
guard at the bar, and Daniella Smith, who investigators said is Beauregard's 
ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Thompson and Smith were shot as they sat in Thompson's truck after 
the bar had closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a minute, here comes Beauregard, he shoots the male victim twice," 
said Detective Roy Izumi, who investigated the shooting. The first bullet hit 
Thompson in the right arm and the second struck Thompson's bulletproof vest 
"right about where his heart would be," Izumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was shot once in the hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was arrested near his mother's home shortly after the shooting. 
Smith told police that Beauregard refused to leave her alone since they had 
broken up, Izumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon at the 
San Bernardino County Sheriff's West Valley Detention Center, but was released 
in lieu of $15,000 bail in a few hours, a source close to the family said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were later upgraded by the San Bernardino District Attorney's 
office to attempted murder, Izumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard attended football practice later the same day, but never mentioned 
the arrest to anyone on the coaching staff, Northridge Coach Bob Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until I know something concrete, it'll be the same as it's always been," Burt 
said before the kickoff of Saturday's game against Chico State University. "If 
we find out Monday that it's factual, we'll decide what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 When reached at his mother's San Bernardino home, Beauregard refused to 
comment on the incident, but confirmed that he did not tell the Matadors' 
coaching staff of his arrest. They did not know about it until questioned by 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Vic Buccola, commissioner of the American West Conference, of which Northridge 
is a member, said the NCAA grants member schools the autonomy to handle 
disciplinary matters on a case-by-case basis. The NCAA's ethical code of 
conduct for student athletes does not address criminal cases, Buccola said, 
adding that sanctions against the school are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard's grandmother is Valerie Pope-Ludlam, a San Bernardino councilwoman 
representing the sixth district.

POWERBOAT RACER CRITICAL AFTER BEING DRAGGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Powerboat racer Don (Rique) Ford was dragged 75 feet and left in critical 
condition Sunday after a thief jumped into his truck at his Norco home and sped 
away as he clung helplessly to the boat trailer undercarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford was in his driveway Saturday preparing his $400,000 boat Ragamuffin for a 
charity appearance when a man jumped into the idling truck and drove off, said 
Sgt. John Horton of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing between the truck and trailer, Ford couldn't escape so he grabbed 
onto the bottom of the trailer and was dragged 75 feet under the 4 1/2-ton 
trailer-boat combination until he finally let go, Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew if he let go he would be run over (by the trailer wheels)," Horton 
said. "And that's exactly what happened. When he couldn't hang on any longer, 
the wheels ran over him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, 33, was in critical condition Sunday at Riverside General Hospital, a 
spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities found Ford's boat abandoned near Chino late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford gave investigators a description of the thief, who could face charges of 
attempted murder, carjacking and robbery, Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford has won numerous races with Ragamuffin. Last year, he took first place in 
the American Power Boats Assn.'s High Points National Championship for his 
boat's class.

CALVARY CHAPEL VOLLEYBALL PLAYS ON A HIGHER LEVEL; PREPS: ATHLETES WHO OPT FOR 
PAROCHIAL ATMOSPHERE HAVE LED EAGLES TO PROMINENCE AND ARE BEING RECRUITED BY 
DIVISION I TEAMS. 
</P>

 Newport Harbor is the No. 1 ranked girls' volleyball team in the county, and 
some might argue the Sailors are the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But just think, the Sailors could have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Courtney Owens, an All-Southern Section Division V selection, 
lives next door to Melissa Schutz, Newport Harbor's highly touted middle 
blocker. Although Schutz and Owens are teammates on the Orange County club 
team, Owens chose to attend Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Owens and Lynn Lovingier have helped the Eagles reach new heights in 
girls' volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, a 5-foot-10 outside hitter, and Lovingier, a 5-9 right-side hitter, are 
two big reasons the Eagles are ranked seventh in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 And the two share higher goals -- such as the school's first State volleyball 
championship -- and higher causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens didn't choose Calvary Chapel to win volleyball championships and 
accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always gone to small, private schools," Owens said. "It's different; 
there's a special closeness everyone shares here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingier transferred to Calvary Chapel after attending Laguna Hills High as a 
freshman and sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two schools aren't comparable," Lovingier said. "I'm more comfortable 
here. There aren't the same peer pressures to deal with and at the public 
schools, you aren't free to worship. Here, in a Christian atmosphere, you can. 
It's like family." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingier and Owens have found a haven at Calvary Chapel, and their off-court 
peace of mind has translated to on-court success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team is very close," Calvary Chapel Coach Jim Downey said. "Courtney and 
Lynn are two of our leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lovingier: "We're all like sisters. Even the new players fit in so well; 
it's the closest team I've ever played on." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Owens: "It's a different type of closeness this team shares. It's not 
just volleyball we share and it's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Owens and Lovingier are being recruited by Division I teams, it isn't 
the first time a small, private school has vaulted to prominence in the Orange 
County girls' volleyball scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 and '92, Karen Benkovsky and Kathleen Bunce led Capistrano Valley 
Christian to consecutive State championships. Both earned Division I 
scholarships, and both left an impression on Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played them in the playoffs when I was a sophomore," Owens said. "They 
beat us pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's the Eagles' turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are ranked No. 1 in Division IV, the Eagles aren't satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the Division V section championship last season, Calvary Chapel 
lost to San Jose Archbishop Mitty in the State final. The disappointment 
carried over to this season when Calvary Chapel, participating in its first 
Orange County Championships, failed to reach the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't meet our expectations," Owens said. "But we came together when we 
won the Redondo tournament last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think last season, we knew we had next year. Now we know we won't get 
another chance and we want to do well in CIF and try to win State. We have to 
take care of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens and Lovingier will have to be at their best if the Eagles are to 
succeed. They have already established they are two of the best to come through 
Calvary Chapel, and both figure to be the first girls from the school to earn 
Division I athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both players are so quick that it's tough for the block to stay with them," 
said Charlie Brande, Orange County Volleyball Club coach. "Lynn is a late 
bloomer and just now she's starting to put it all together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you don't notice Courtney because she's so smooth. It's not only 
her spiking that gets your attention, but the rest of her game too." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado, UC Santa Barbara and San Diego have noticed Owens, and Lovingier has 
recruiting visits planned to Tennessee, Montana State and Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, I'd like to pick a school I'd like to go to even if I didn't play 
volleyball," Lovingier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Owens: "I'd like to stay close to home. I know that academics are the 
most important thing; I can't play volleyball for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the success of our volleyball team is a chance for us to show everyone 
what our whole school is about."

SHOP TALK: RECOVERING CONTRACT PAY MIGHT NOT BE WORTH THE COSTS 
</P>

 Question: I worked for a company as an independent contractor. The job was 
terminated by the company in June. I have two contracts signed by these people, 
both of which have 30-day termination clauses. One also indicates that 
litigation can take place only in Indiana. I was terminated without the 30-day 
notice. When should I start legal action? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.M., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You can start legal action immediately, but you should first think 
carefully about whether litigation is really worth the trouble. It appears that 
the most you could recover in a lawsuit is 30 days' pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent contractor agreements may be terminated for any reason whatsoever 
after giving the prescribed amount of notice. But if such notice is not given, 
all you can sue for is the pay you would have earned during the notice period. 
You cannot collect emotional distress damages, punitive damages or attorneys' 
fees in this type of lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 You should weigh the costs of suing against the amount of money you are likely 
to recover if you win. Costs include hiring an attorney, paying court costs and 
perhaps even traveling to Indiana to sue (although a California court might 
allow you to sue here and apply Indiana law).

 Question: Is it legal for an employer to hire you and indicate throughout the 
year that he is going to give you a W-2 and then around April 15 decide to give 
you a 1099? Is it fair for an employer to do that, and is he subject to any 
penalties? 
</P>
<P>
 -- T.M., Corona 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It is probably not legal for the employer to do what he did. Unless it 
is clearly understood when an employee is hired that he or she is to be an 
independent contractor and the employee truly is an independent contractor -- 
in terms of the nature of the work and how much control the employer exercises 
over the work -- an employer must treat employees as employees. That is, the 
employer must make the appropriate deductions from their paychecks for income 
and Social Security taxes and must provide W-2 forms in a timely fashion. 
Considerable penalties may be imposed on an employer who fails to make and 
report the appropriate deductions for employees.

 Question: My wife is pregnant and works for a bank that is supposed to be sold 
at the end of October. They're telling her that when the bank is sold, she will 
have no rights to insurance or COBRA. In that true? 
</P>
<P>
 -- V.N., Rossmoor 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: COBRA benefits are available to eligible employees to allow them to 
continue health coverage under an employer's group health plan after 
termination of employment. There are no COBRA benefits without a group health 
plan. According to the Office of Pension & Welfare Benefit Administration, if 
an employer discontinues its group health plan, the employees do not have a 
right to continue coverage under the COBRA provisions. If the new owners do 
provide a group health plan, your wife would be eligible for COBRA benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 A union contract might prevent an employer from eliminating or changing a 
group health plan. The new owner may also be obligated to continue the benefits 
if it simply is buying the stock of the existing bank, as opposed to just the 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be able to acquire insurance for your wife under your group health 
plan at your employer. Contact your benefits administrator about adding your 
wife to the policy. Some plans allow you to add dependents to your coverage, 
even if it is not time for open enrollment, if there has been a substantial 
life change. The loss of a spouse's job and insurance benefits sometimes 
qualifies. Also, if your wife finds a new job elsewhere, some insurance plans 
may provide coverage without a pre-existing condition exclusion.

 Question: I run a small business. What is a good, one-stop source for advice 
about personnel issues? Is there a book or a guide available? 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.K. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: My organization, The Employers Group, can assist you in the day-to-day 
management of your human resources activities. The Employers Group, formerly 
the Merchants and Manufacturers Assn., is a nonprofit, member-supported 
organization dedicated to helping employers manage their human resources.

 Question: I'm a licensed real estate agent who works on a commission basis as 
a loan officer. The last two mortgage companies that I've worked for owe me 
thousands of dollars that I cannot collect. Each has found some reason to 
terminate our contract after I have established a pipeline of loans.  
</P>
<P>
 They retain the loan files as company property and promise to pay me the 
commissions I earned once the loans are completed, which never happens. 
Sometimes a company goes out of business and the broker says he's not 
responsible, or the company just refuses to pay me unless taken to small claims 
court. Other loan officers in the industry have similar stories.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Department of Real Estate and the Labor Commissioner's office have 
been unable to help inasmuch as we are regarded as independent contractors. Are 
there any laws to protect us? 
</P>
<P>
 -- E.S., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are no special statutes applicable to your situation. However, 
the courts will enforce promises such as those the mortgage companies made to 
you. Although you might not be able to call on any government agency for 
assistance, you can collect the money owed to you by suing in small claims 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove your case, you will need evidence that you were responsible for the 
loans on which you are seeking commissions. You and others in the same 
situation should keep careful records so that you will be able to prove what 
you are owed.

JACK SMITH: HUMAN RELATIONS NOT BY THE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michele Yepiz, a reader in Lemon Grove, sends my wife what she asserts is the 
actual text of an article published in a home economics guide for women in 
Ontario, Canada, in the 1950s. (She told my wife not to show it to me, but I'm 
devious.) 
</P>
<P>
 It is preposterous, yet it shows how far women have emerged from domestic 
bondage in only 45 years. Or have they? 
</P>
<P>
 It is Neanderthalian, except that Neanderthals did not have such modern 
artifacts as lipstick and washing machines. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a list of ways in which "the fascinating woman" can welcome her mate 
when he comes home from work. It assumes, of course, that the male works 
outside the home and comes home tired and in need of comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 1: Have dinner ready, because the man will be, before all else, hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 But in real life it goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Man: "What's for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wife: "I've been too busy. I'll have to go down to the store and get a 
microwave."  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 2: "Prepare yourself. Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed 
when he arrives. Put on some lipstick." 
</P>
<P>
 She: "Where will I get 15 minutes?"  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 3: "Clear away the clutter." 
</P>
<P>
 It would take two weeks to clear away the clutter in our house.  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 4: "Prepare the children." 
</P>
<P>
 How do you do that? Handcuff them?  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 5: "Minimize all noise. Eliminate noise of washer, dryer, dishwasher or 
vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
 How will he know you've been working?  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 5: "Be happy to see him. Greet him with a warm smile and act glad to see 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 He: "What's your problem?"  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 6: Make him comfortable. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or 
suggest he lie down in the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 He: "I don't want to lie down. I want a vodka tonic."  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 7: "Listen to him. Let him talk first; then he will be a more responsive 
listener later." 
</P>
<P>
 He: "I got nothing to say. It was hell today."  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 8: "Make the evening his. Never complain if he does not take you out to 
dinner. Instead, try to understand his world of strain and pressure, his need 
to be home and to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 He: "What's for dinner?"  
</P>
<P>
 She: "I'll have to go down to the store for a microwave."  
</P>
<P>
 He: "Why don't we go out to dinner?"  
</P>
<P>
 She: "I haven't a thing to wear."  
</P>
<P>
 He: "Well how about a vodka tonic?" 
</P>
<P>
 She: "We're out of vodka." 
</P>
<P>
 He: "What the hell have you been doing all day?"  
</P>
<P>
 Yepiz is a home economics graduate and she recommends, "First, do not let your 
husband or significant other read this test. Second, if you follow any of these 
suggestions, he will think you have been ovening (Canadian for cooking) with 
the cooking sherry or you have been in your supply of Prozac. Also, I suggest 
that after you read this you burn it and not your bra. Instead, buy one of 
those cleavage enhancing brassieres and make him wonder how you really spent 
your day. There is nothing wrong with a greeting of 'Are you home already?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course in our household the roles are reversed. My wife works outside and I 
am home all day, alone. She usually gets home well beyond the cocktail hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I should try to make her feel relaxed and glad to be home. 
</P>
<P>
 He: "What kept you so late. I missed you." 
</P>
<P>
 She: "I had to work late and the traffic was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 He: "Why don't you lie down for a while?" 
</P>
<P>
 She: "I've got too much to do. The papers are all over the house. I have the 
laundry to do and I have to mop the kitchen floor. I also have to go through 
the mail and pay the bills. I also have to straighten your bed and pick your 
clothes up off the floor. I also have to prepare your medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 He: "What're you going to do after that?" 
</P>
<P>
 She: "Crash, I hope." 
</P>
<P>
 He: "What about dinner? 
</P>
<P>
 She: "How about a baked potato? That's all we have." 
</P>
<P>
 He: "What about my fix" 
</P>
<P>
 She: "I forgot. We're out of vodka." 
</P>
<P>
 Things can't get any worse than that for a man who's left home alone. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a few suggestions for wives in this position. Try to make him feel that 
you're glad to see him. Ask him if he needs anything. Check the TV log to see 
if there are any football games on the tube. Ask him whether he wants Mexican 
or pasta microwave for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Make him a vodka tonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, make it a double.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; HOME SEWING RETAILER REFASHIONS CHAIN; 
RESTRUCTURING: HOUSE OF FABRICS HOPES TENTATIVE PLAN TO CLOSE SOME BRANCHES AND 
EXPAND CRAFT ITEMS WILL EFFECT A TURNAROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER PENDLETON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are trying times for House of Fabrics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-thriving Sherman Oaks-based retailer of fabrics and home sewing items 
has been in a slump since 1992, when earnings collapsed under the weight of the 
national economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to engineer a turnaround, House of Fabrics recently announced a 
tentative refinancing proposal, plans to close nearly a third of its existing 
stores, and an expanded emphasis on merchandising craft and home decorating 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the company announced it had appointed veteran corporate 
revitalization specialist David T. Allen as chief financial officer and 
executive vice president for administration. He succeeds Donald W. Boyer, who 
resigned to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was most recently with the national crisis management firm of Buccino & 
Associates Inc. Since joining Buccino in 1989, House of Fabrics said, Allen has 
managed more than 50 corporate turnaround and refinancing situations for large 
and small companies in manufacturing, retailing and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics faces skepticism in the financial community about its own 
prospects for a turnaround. "Confidence is such an important issue in remaining 
an ongoing concern. I just don't know if they're going to make it," said Bob 
Simonson, a financial analyst with Kemper Securities in Chicago and one of the 
few analysts who still follows House of Fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported an $11.6-million loss for its second quarter ended July 
31 and a 15% decline in revenue, to $110 million, from the year-ago period. 
That's on top of a $29.5-million loss on sales of $546 million for the year 
ended Jan. 31. In Nasdaq trading Friday, House of Fabrics shares closed at $2, 
down 12.5 cents. The stock traded as high as $41 a share in 1991, adjusted for 
a 2-for-1 split that year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company announced last month that it will close 200 of its 624 stores by 
Jan. 31 to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's bankers said earlier that House of Fabrics was technically in 
default on conditions of some loans, but it won a reprieve when the banks 
agreed not to declare defaults until Nov. 11. The agreement gives the firm more 
time to pursue financial restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics said last week that it had entered into an agreement with a 
private investment partnership that would raise much-needed capital. Under the 
agreement, which is subject to several conditions, Levine Leichtman Capital 
Partners would purchase $20 million in subordinated notes and receive warrants 
enabling it to buy up to 35% of House of Fabrics' common stock at $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics is also working with the Finley Group, a turnaround 
consulting firm based in Charlotte, N.C., and is writing a new business plan to 
present to its banking group. 
</P>
<P>
 President Gary L. Larkins declined to specify which stores will close. But the 
company has said it is generally targeting mall stores and some less-profitable 
"superstores," primarily in the Midwest and Northeast, where House of Fabrics 
has strong competition. It is also liquidating inventory to lower its bank 
debt, which stood at $129.9 million as of Aug. 1, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics' suppliers are apparently remaining steadfast. Bill Gardner, 
editor of the industry publication Craftrends, said he listened in on a 
conference call between Larkins and suppliers shortly after the company 
announced its plans to close stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner said the suppliers, without prompting, expressed support for the 
company. Most said they would continue shipping to the retailer, even though 
some hadn't been paid for as long as five months. "House of Fabrics has been 
honest and upfront with vendors and they appreciate it," Gardner said. "Because 
of the people involved, they're sticking with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil at House of Fabrics stems from the recession as well as shifts in 
the apparel business and social change. With more women working outside the 
home, fewer people sew their own clothes, especially with the abundance of 
low-priced, ready-to-wear clothing that has saturated the market in recent 
years. The sour economy, particularly in California, where House of Fabrics has 
most of its outlets, plus the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, put further 
pressure on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Although House of Fabrics is the weakest of the major players in the estimated 
$4-billion-a-year fabric retailing industry, key competitors Fabri-Centers of 
America of Hudson, Ohio, and Hancock Fabrics of Tupelo, Miss., have also seen 
their profits slip because of changing consumer habits. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is also dealing with a massive hangover from overexpansion in the 
1980s. Today, there are too many stores vying for the business of too few home 
sewing customers. 
</P>
<P>
 If it gets its financial house in order, House of Fabrics will look to its new 
crafts and home decorating emphasis for salvation. Last year, the company hired 
Doyle W. Parker, a former Wal-Mart Inc. craft buyer, to head its craft buying. 
It launched four prototype stores -- dubbed "Creative Centers" -- at former 
Southern California fabric superstores in Valencia, Simi Valley, Torrance and 
Temecula. The company will convert four more of its stores -- which carry a 
trimmed-down line of fabrics -- in the next 60 days, Larkins said. If all goes 
well, it hopes to have another 20 such outlets in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics has sold crafts at its outlets since the early 1980s, but 
company officials believe such merchandise can make up a greater portion of 
total sales because of the public's rising interest in crafts and home 
decorating. In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, crafts represented about 15% of 
company sales, but Larkins said he believes that share can rise to between 20% 
and 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Fabrics prototype store in Simi Valley is a 24,000-square-foot 
showroom featuring a huge selection of craft items, such as baskets, artificial 
flowers, pillows, needle craft, dolls and figurines, plus fabric for home 
sewing and decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, the location was a House of Fabrics superstore. It was 
damaged by the temblor and reopened five months later as one of the new concept 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie McAdams, manager of the Simi Valley store, said sales have been 
climbing there ever since -- up 62% in June, 50% in July and 21% in August. 
"We're getting more and more crafts customers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hobby Industry Assn. in Elmwood Park, N.J., estimates total 1993 retail 
sales for the crafts industry at $9.6 billion. For the past four years, despite 
the recession, the industry has registered healthy annual gains.

MASSIVE PHONE CALLING CARD FRAUD FOUND; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: MCI EMPLOYEE 
ALLEGEDLY SOLD MORE THAN 100,000 NUMBERS USED TO MAKE MORE THAN $50 MILLION IN 
ILLEGAL CALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what is believed to be the largest fraud of its kind, an MCI employee has 
been charged with stealing more than 100,000 telephone calling card numbers 
that were used to make more than $50 million in long-distance calls, federal 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI employee Ivy James Lay was alleged to be the main supplier of stolen card 
numbers to an international ring of thieves operating in Los Angeles and at 
least five other U.S. cities, as well as in Spain and Germany, the U.S. Secret 
Service said Friday. The Secret Service is the federal agency that investigates 
interstate telephone fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service investigation ended in Southern California Thursday night 
when agents seized numerous items from the home of a co-conspirator, which 
included six computers with pirated commercial copyrighted software and 
thousands of calling card numbers stored on computer disks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of customers of MCI, AT&T, Sprint and several local 
telephone companies were victimized by the scam, the Secret Service said. But 
those consumers -- many still unaware of the scam -- won't be billed for 
fraudulent calls on their phone card numbers, spokesmen for MCI, AT&T and 
Sprint said Friday. Customers who suspect their calling card numbers were 
illegally used should contact the customer service department of their 
long-distance carrier immediately, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service sources familiar with the case said the ring was unprecedented 
for its sophisticated use of computers and other activities coordinated on a 
global scale. According to MCI officials, the ring was more sophisticated and 
better organized than credit card and calling card scams perpetrated in the 
past by people who obtained a small number of cards by computer hacking or 
physical means, such as getting carbon copies of receipts or watching customers 
enter calling card numbers at airport terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay, a switch engineer based in Charlotte, N.C., was charged and arrested last 
week and subsequently released on bail. He faces felony charges of access 
device fraud and could serve 10 years if convicted, the Secret Service said. 
Lay was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI officials characterized the case as the largest of its kind in terms of 
known losses. The ring ran "the gamut of crimes against telephone and computer 
software companies," said Leslie Aun, an MCI spokeswoman, adding that Lay was 
fired immediately and turned over to law enforcement officials when the 
investigation in Charlotte was concluded last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest action ended a 4 1/2-month investigation by the Secret Service into 
calling card fraud. Search warrants were also served on six alleged 
co-conspirators in Los Angeles, Seattle, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Chicago, 
resulting in the seizure of large quantities of customized computer gear and 
stolen calling card numbers, the Secret Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service special agent Steven A. Sepulveda said Lay, who was known in 
the computer hacking community as "Knightshadow," allegedly devised special 
software to trap calling card numbers from a variety of local and long-distance 
carriers coming across MCI's telephone switching equipment. The card numbers 
were sold to other members of the alleged fraud ring, who in turn sold them to 
computer hackers in the United States and Europe, Sepulveda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the ring enjoyed thousands of dollars a week in profits from sales 
of the stolen card numbers, Secret Service officials said. Purchasers of the 
stolen numbers were mainly Europeans, who bought many numbers at a time, to be 
used later in calling back to the United States for free, Sepulveda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was so complex it forced normally competitive telephone 
carriers to cooperate with each other and with law enforcement officials, MCI's 
Aun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service sources said the co-conspirators will shortly face indictments 
from a federal grand jury in Charlotte, where all the cases are being 
consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Also charged in connection with his alleged involvement in the ring is Max 
Louarn, 22, of Palma de Mallorca, Spain, Sepulveda said. He was charged with 
conspiracy and arrested. He also could not be reached for comment.

LOSING GROUND; AS CALIFORNIA HEALS, DEFENSE-RELIANT SAN DIEGO IS STILL IN ACUTE 
PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the Pentagon shipped 60,000 uniformed 
personnel from here to the Middle East, most people assumed the sharp economic 
jolt this caused -- lowered retail and home sales, for example -- would end 
when the troops returned. 
</P>
<P>
 But that short-lived episode turned out to be a teaser for more fundamental 
woes to come. Even in the context of California's dismal 1990s economy, San 
Diego -- unduly dependent on the shrinking military-industrial complex -- has 
been a special case. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the region has tried to diversify its economy, exploit its economic 
ties to burgeoning Tijuana and retrain its work force, San Diego is still 
losing ground as the state overall has begun to show signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego is the exception to the rule, one of just a couple of metropolitan 
areas in California -- the other being San Jose -- still losing jobs," Salomon 
Bros. economist David Hensley said. "It's a painful period for the region to go 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time San Diego County-based sailors and Marines returned from Operation 
Desert Storm in 1991, the full force of defense budget cutbacks was under way. 
It was the beginning of a torturous belt-tightening in a regional economy that 
had been 20% reliant on defense and aerospace. More than three years later, the 
hemorrhaging seems open-ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, painful withdrawal of General Dynamics -- employer of 17,000 in San 
Diego as recently as the late 1980s -- will drag out through 1995 when its last 
1,900 local jobs will vanish as a result of July's announcement that it is 
transferring its Convair division. It will mark the end of General Dynamics' 
59-year history in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the departure of General Dynamics and steep cutbacks by Teledyne 
Ryan, Loral, Rohr and other defense and aerospace companies have caused a net 
loss of 41,000 jobs in four years, a 4% decline in San Diego's job base. A 
quarter of those jobs have been lost this year, even as the rest of the state 
is on track for a 1% gain in overall jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet defense isn't the only ongoing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Two big financial institutions -- San Diego Trust & Savings, the city's 
largest remaining locally based financial institution, and American Residential 
Mortgage -- have merged with larger companies this year at a cost of 1,000 jobs 
to date and hundreds more to come. 
</P>
<P>
 This jolt came on top of the failures of San Diego's three big savings and 
loans -- HomeFed Bank, Great American Bank and Imperial Savings -- at a cost of 
4,000 jobs since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego is pinning its economic hopes on what Mayor Susan Golding calls "the 
four Ts" -- trade, tourism, telecommunications and technology. But that has a 
familiar ring. 
</P>
<P>
 During the region's salad days in the late 1980s, many business leaders in San 
Diego seemed to take comfort in the notion that the local economy was diverse 
enough in tourism, technology and biomedicine to withstand problems in the 
defense sector. But the slow pace of the recovery here has exposed that as a 
myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism? "We've been floundering for the last four years. The major indicators 
-- visitor spending, hotel occupancy and overnight visitors -- have been about 
flat," said Lynn Mohrfeld, research manager at the San Diego Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. Like the rest of Southern California, San Diego's tourism has 
suffered from the regional recession and a sharp decline in Japanese visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Biotechnology, the epitome of a "clean" industry with its synergistic links to 
San Diego's thriving academic and research communities, was seen as an economic 
savior. But with only 8,700 employees and 128 companies, the industry is still 
too small to be of much more than symbolic importance in California's 
second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year has seen a halt to the breakneck growth of the recent past as 
uncertainty over health care reform cast a pall over biotechnology nationwide. 
According to a new Ernst & Young survey of the industry, biotechnology jobs in 
San Diego grew only 6% this year, compared with growth of 20% and more in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only trend heading in the right direction for San Diego is the boom 
in trade with Mexico, and city leaders are trying to make the most of it. 
Indeed, the San Diego Economic Development Corp., the quasi-public agency 
charged with bringing companies and jobs to the region, is marketing Tijuana 
nearly as hard as San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's efforts succeeded last April in helping persuade Samsung, the 
Korean consumer electronics giant, to build a huge industrial complex in east 
Tijuana. Sanyo of Japan is also expanding on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico 
border. Sanyo's new personal computer manufacturing facility here will mean 200 
more jobs, said Economic Development Corp. Vice President Neil Whiteley-Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita, another Japanese giant, has decided to relocate the Western 
headquarters for its consumer electronics operations to San Diego from Franklin 
Park, Ill., a move that could mean more than 100 executive-level jobs for San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other positive signs, but some suggest more about how bad things 
were than how good they're getting. For example, new housing starts in San 
Diego County are running 23% ahead of 1993 -- but that was the worst year since 
1947. Median prices of existing houses have been flat for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, though San Diego learned recently it will be home port to three 
more aircraft carriers under an expected "megaport" designation by the U.S. 
Navy, future withdrawals -- such as the 1996 closure of the Navy's recruit 
training center at a cost to the economy of $100 million -- will leave San 
Diego with fewer uniformed personnel in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say that while the community's efforts to spur growth can be 
helpful, they will ultimately be dwarfed by market forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not much that the state or municipal governments can do to promote 
economic growth. They certainly weren't responsible for the good things that 
happened here in the 1980s," said UC San Diego economist Ross Starr. "The 
business-friendly steps that states can take are excellent policies but they 
have an impact not over the course of months and quarters but years and 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
 The region's other major emphasis has been to attempt to retrain its work 
force. This year alone, some $40 million in federal job-training funds is 
pouring into the area. But there is a false promise in such programs when no 
jobs await their graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the manufacturing facilities that benefit from a big 
improvement in the state and national economies. If we did, our plants would be 
supplying stuff to companies all across the nation and California," said 
University of San Diego economist Alan Gin. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who do find work are often taking big cuts in pay, a sobering 
reminder of just how good the defense and aerospace jobs were. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense sector was just a lovely gold mine and it's gone, like a mining 
deposit that's played out," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense workers who retrain and re-enter the San Diego work force 
typically do so at a 20% drop in pay, according to officials at the San Diego 
Career Center, the city's main retraining site. 
</P>
<P>
 As jobs and salaries decline, San Diego County's population continues to grow, 
due to rising birth rate and immigration. The result: a less affluent 
population. Signs of that reduced affluence abound. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, retail sales per capita are off 20% in inflation-adjusted dollars 
since 1987, according to the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, an 
indication of San Diegans' sharply reduced spending power. 
</P>
<P>
 The region is even losing ground in the number of television sets. In an 
insult both symbolic and financially hurtful, Nielsen Media Research last month 
downgraded the San Diego media market from 24th-largest in the nation to 27th 
based on the number of households with televisions -- dropping San Diego out of 
the top 25 markets targeted by most national advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those unlikely to be buying a new television set soon are Ruben and 
Carol Cantu, both of whom lost their longtime jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is getting away from aerospace, but there is no equivalent to 
aerospace-type work, so that leaves me out in the cold," said Cantu, 51, a 
government contracts administrator who was laid off in July after eight years 
with Sundstrand Power Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantu is still looking for work as he takes computer classes at a job 
retraining center. But he has always specialized in defense contracts 
administration, a shrinking industry with limited job horizons. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Carol, was also laid off in July after 15 years as a secretary at 
General Dynamics. She at least found a new job at a local school district -- 
but at a 40% drop in pay. San Diego's Decline 
</P>
<P>
 Job losses in the face of a rising population have made San Diego County less 
affluent, leading to steep declines in per-capita spending and construction of 
new homes.

BILL GATES TOPS LIST IN FORBES RANKING OF RICHEST IN U.S.; WEALTH: MICROSOFT 
MOGUL'S NET WORTH IS $9.35 BILLION. CALIFORNIA STILL HOME TO MORE OF WEALTHIEST 
THAN ANY OTHER STATE. 
</P>

<P>
 Bill Gates' burgeoning software empire bested the stock-picking wiles of 
Warren Buffett, installing the chairman of Microsoft Corp. at the top of Forbes 
magazine's 1994 list of richest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 California also retained its status as home to more of America's wealthiest 
than any other state, with 80 of the top 400, up from 77 in the 1993 survey. 
New York remained in second place with 53, down from 57 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In its annual report on the cream of the capitalist crop, the biweekly 
business journal put Gates' net worth at $9.35 billion, enough to bump Buffett, 
with $9.2 billion, out of the No. 1 post he held last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes attributed the flip-flop to the vagaries of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffett, 64, the folksy investor from Omaha, Neb., kept his investment 
company, Berkshire Hathaway, growing this year, but not as fast as Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to his holdings in the company, Gates' net worth grew by more than $3 
billion while Buffett's rose by a comparatively paltry $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The year has been one of milestones for Gates, 38, of Bellevue, Wash., and his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Day, the king of the computer nerds married Melinda French in 
Hawaii. More important for Gates' wealth, Microsoft emerged largely unscathed 
from a federal antitrust inquiry into its alleged monopolization of the 
software business. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates is quoted in the Oct. 17 Forbes as saying its list is "silly." He 
appears to shun such marks of success. "If I'd had some set idea of a finish 
line, don't you think I would have crossed it years ago?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes also said Gates now appears to be the wealthiest commoner in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The only foreign billionaire in his league besides royalty is Yoshiaki 
Tsutsumi, a Japanese railroad and hotel tycoon whom Forbes said is worth $8.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming in third for the second year in a row was John Kluge, 80, of 
Charlottesville, Va., who built the Metromedia radio and television station 
empire, then liquidated it to invest in movies, restaurants and long-distance 
telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Kluge's restaurant and movie interests are recovering from some weak times, 
Forbes reported, and the long-distance company, LDDS, is now No. 4 behind AT&T, 
MCI and Sprint. Kluge, whose worth was listed at $5.9 billion, led the list 
from 1989-91. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market's bouts of weakness this year didn't hurt Edward Johnson III, 
64, of Boston, chief of Fidelity Investments, the top mutual fund company. His 
$5.1 billion was enough to vault him to No. 4, from No. 38 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Amway Corp. partner Richard DeVos, 68, of Ada, Mich., rounded out the top five 
with $4.5 billion, up from No. 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Money losers whose fortunes dropped off the list include onetime Hollywood 
kingpin Barry Diller. His declining shares in home shopping channel QVC Inc. 
dropped him to $130 million, from last year's $345 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As in past years, the list shows moguls who make their millions from the dirty 
smokestacks of oil, gas and manufacturing are losing ground to those in 
clean-burning companies like technology, retailing, finance and entertainment.

 Ruling Due on TMI Receivership: A ruling is expected today on whether a 
receiver will be appointed to take over operations of Teachers Management & 
Investment Corp., the Newport Beach firm that raised $1 billion from educators 
throughout California. A lawsuit filed in August by four teachers alleges that 
the company is insolvent and seeks appointment of a receiver for its remaining 
assets.The teachers also allege that the company lost $100 million of 
investors' money through fraud. More than 60,000 California teachers invested 
with TMI, many of them putting money into partnerships to buy undeveloped land. 
TMI owners Maurice Shuman and James Martin deny any wrongdoing and say the 
value of the company's assets declined because of the real estate downturn. 
Judge Francisco F. Firmat is to issue the ruling during a 1:30 p.m. session of 
Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana.

 Judge Orders Procter & Gamble to Settle Suit: Halting a trial, a judge in 
Pittsburgh told the consumer products company to try to settle its suit against 
two former researchers who left to work for competitor Johnson & Johnson. The 
suit alleges that the researchers violated an agreement not to engage in 
similar work with a competitor for three years. The judge said he was 
disappointed that the two sides had not taken him seriously when he urged a 
settlement at pretrial meetings, and he threatened to revoke the Ohio courtroom 
privileges of three New Jersey lawyers representing Johnson & Johnson if a deal 
is not reached by this morning.

 Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel Sale Completed: The $14.3-billion Los Angeles 
County Employees Retirement Assn. confirmed that it completed the purchase of 
the venerable Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena from Dai-Ichi Kangyo 
Bank Ltd. of Japan. Brentwood-based Lowe Enterprises Inc., an investment 
manager for the fund, handled the $40-million to $45-million sale for the fund, 
said Ted Leary, president of Lowe Enterprises Investment Management, Lowe's 
pension fund advising subsidiary. In August, The Times quoted sources saying 
that the pension fund had made the winning bid for the hotel, which had been 
taken over by Dai-Ichi Kangyo after the original owners defaulted on a 
$100-million loan.

 Key Mortgage Rate Rises Again: The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
said the 11th District cost of funds, the rate to which many adjustable-rate 
mortgages are tied, rose to 3.945% in August from 3.860% in July. It was the 
fifth-straight monthly increase in the rate after it steadily declined during 
the previous 3 1/2 years. The rate measures the average cost of funds to the 
thrifts and financial institutions in the bank's 11th District, which covers 
California, Arizona and Nevada.

ODD ALLIANCE INTRODUCES ARTHRITIS PAIN RELIEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual alliance between a drug company and a nonprofit health 
organization, the makers of Tylenol and the Arthritis Foundation have launched 
a line of pain relievers aimed at the 40 million people who suffer from the 
crippling disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement gives the foundation $1 million a year for research, and gives 
Johnson & Johnson a firmer foothold in the $2.5-billion analgesic 
market.Tylenol, its only product in the category, is the top seller, with a 
market share of 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit health groups traditionally have shunned such reimbursement 
arrangements because of the potential for conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a royalty agreement, Johnson & Johnson's McNeil Consumer Products Co. 
will guarantee about $1 million a year to the arthritis group from sales of the 
Arthritis Foundation Pain Relievers. The foundation will use the money to 
bolster its $13-million annual research budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arthritis Foundation last year received $5 million from pharmaceutical 
firms, but almost half of its money comes from individuals and membership fees 
of $20 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson's domination in the analgesic market is being threatened by 
Aleve, a new over-the-counter painkiller from Procter & Gamble Co., and the 
return of Bayer aspirin to Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company, as part of 
its agreement to buy the North American over-the-counter business of Sterling 
Winthrop Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 A new venture with the Arthritis Foundation could solidify the drug company's 
position, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting development in this hotbed of the (non-prescription) 
painkiller market," said Neil Sweig of Landenburg, Thalmann & Co. in New York. 
"Any way to gain market share is all fair in this type of war." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson may also benefit if consumers use the analgesic to relieve 
pains such as headaches, said analyst Hemant K. Shah of HKS & Co., in Warren, 
N.J.

$52-BILLION GLOBAL AID PLAN SCRAPPED IN CLASH; TRADE: INTERNATIONAL MONETARY 
FUND MEMBERS DISAGREE OVER SIZE OF PROPOSED FUNDING PACKAGE FOR DEVELOPING 
NATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 A clash between leading industrial and developing member states of the 
International Monetary Fund killed a $52-billion aid plan meant to help poor 
nations participate in expanding global trade. 
</P>
<P>
 IMF members, split over the size of the aid plan proposed by the IMF's 
managing director, Michel Camdessus, also failed to extend a program for 
easy-term loans to ex-Soviet bloc states. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to agree on the aid plan, debate over which occupied the full day of 
IMF and World Bank meetings here, was a severe setback for Camdessus, who faces 
reappointment in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Camdessus had refused to budge on the amount of aid for poor nations in the 
face of criticism from industrial countries, led by the United States and 
Germany, two of the fund's largest shareholders, that the amount was 
inflationary. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's misjudged the mood of the people with the money," said a senior European 
development banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Camdessus' plan had called for the creation of $52 billion in IMF credits 
called special drawing rights (SDRs), which members could convert into hard 
currencies. About $20 billion of that was reserved for poor and former Soviet 
nations, which the IMF believes will have insufficient foreign currency to 
participate in an expected expansion in world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 His twofold aim was to provide unconditional funds for developing countries 
and ex-Soviet bloc states and to bolster the role of the largely defunct SDR. 
</P>
<P>
 The G-7 instead proposed $23 billion in aid, with $10.3 billion for developing 
former Soviet countries. 
</P>
<P>
 A G-7 official said the United States, Britain and France all attempted to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 But those efforts foundered because Camdessus was wedded to reviving the role 
of the SDR and because Germany was adamant that the original G-7 offer could 
not be bettered. 
</P>
<P>
 SDRs were last issued in 1981. Since then, some 40 countries from the poorest 
parts of the world and the fomer Soviet bloc have become fund members.

JAPAN CENTRAL BANK PROPS DOLLAR AGAINST YEN; MARKETS: U.S. CURRENCY HAD 
INITIALLY FALLEN AS TRADE ACCORD WAS SEEN AS DOING TOO LITTLE TO CUT TRADE 
DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The U.S. dollar, after initially falling, rose against the yen in early Asian 
trading today after the Bank of Japan purchased the currency to prop up its 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenback had fallen on the view that the U.S.-Japan trade agreement 
reached this weekend won't do much to reduce Japan's massive trade surplus with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greenback then rebounded to as high as 99.32 yen as Japan's central 
bank intervened. In morning Tokyo trading, the dollar was last changing hands 
at 99.25 yen, up from 99.15 yen in New York late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While shares of leading Japanese export companies rallied, Tokyo stocks were 
little changed at the opening. The Nikkei 225 benchmark average finished 
morning trading up 50.21 points, or 0.26%, at 19,614.02. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell as low as 98.40 yen after Asian markets opened for trading in 
Singapore, on selling led by U.S. funds which had bought dollars last week in 
anticipation of a major breakthrough in the talks, traders in Sydney and Tokyo 
said. Activity in Sydney was light because of a public holiday there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a realization that what has been agreed on is fundamentally a 
breakthrough, but its impact on actual dollars in the (trade) deficit will be 
minimal," said Phil Jackson, a currency trade at Commonwealth Bank in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Agreement on) auto parts is some way off," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan and the United States reached a compromise on Saturday aimed at 
expanding U.S. access to Japanese markets in most of the areas discussed under 
the so-called trade framework talks which began more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for Japan to open its markets to imports in 
government-procured medical and telecommunications equipment and in the 
insurance and plate glass industries. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the two sides failed to reach agreement on autos and auto parts, 
which account for about 60% of Japan's $60-billion annual trade surplus with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders have cited Japan's persistent surplus as the primary source of the 
yen's strength against the dollar, as it leaves Japan's exporting companies 
with a massive amount of dollar revenue that must eventually be repatriated 
into yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Japan's largest exporters -- auto companies such as Toyota Motor Co. 
and consumer electronics makers such as Sony Corp. -- rallied. But those 
increases were offset by declines in shares of Japan's largest brokerages, 
which recently lowered their earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said they would continue watching the assessment delivered by currency 
markets. Changes in the yen-dollar exchange rate directly affect the overall 
Japanese economy because a stronger yen hurts the competitiveness of the 
exporters at the heart of Japan's economy.

 MCI Closes Sale of 20% Stake to British Telecom: MCI Communications Corp. said 
some of the money from the $4.3-billion sale may be put into ventures in local 
telephone service and wireless communications. MCI Chairman Bert Roberts said 
the company has a short time in which to make a decision because the federal

HOT JOBS: TELLER'S WORK GIVES BUSINESS EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Philip Le left the Navy seven years ago, he needed a part-time job to pay 
his expenses while he studied accounting at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that banks hire part-time tellers," Le said, "so I applied. It 
turned out to be a very good job for me. We work with computers, money and 
people. It provides good business experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The job requires working with money and basic mathematical calculations all 
day, and Le advises those who can't handle figures accurately and quickly not 
to become tellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cash drawer must balance out at the end of the day, so you have to pay 
attention," he said. "I'm comfortable with math, but the job involves much more 
than that. It's important to be open and friendly." OCCUPATION: Bank teller 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Processing money transactions such as deposits, 
withdrawals, credit-card payments, loan payments and cash advances at banks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Minimum requirement is a high school diploma, but most 
tellers have at least one year of college. Must be able to pass an aptitude 
test measuring mathematical, verbal and customer service skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of tellers in Orange County is expected to 
increase 6.6%, to 9,320. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $7 to $9 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Banks offer flexible work schedules, including part-time hours. Most 
provide training for those wanting to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Handling money and dealing with the public on a constant basis can be 
stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: With experience and additional training, tellers may advance to 
customer service representative, personal banking officer and assistant 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I would recommend being a bank teller to anyone looking for 
part-time work while going to college, especially if they plan to enter 
business or finance." -- Philip Le, Wells Fargo Bank

MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS HAVE QUIETLY LOST THEIR LUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the financial world has changed in the 1990s, one popular money-management 
vehicle has failed woefully to keep up with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 The item in question is the bank money market account, which holds an 
aggregate pool of some $363 billion, according to the latest data from the 
Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Money market deposit accounts, or MMDAs, were created in the early 1980s by 
lawmakers overhauling financial regulations to allow banks to compete with the 
upstart money market mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, however, as many banks and other deposit-taking 
institutions have stopped competing aggressively for money from the small 
depositor, the typical MMDA has become less and less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 As of mid-September, according to Bank Rate Monitor, the average yield on 
MMDAs stood at 2.45%, having barely budged from its level a year ago of 2.39%. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the same span, by contrast, yields on money market mutual funds climbed 
from 2.64% to 4.14%, as tallied by IBC-Donoghue's Money Fund Report in Ashland, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 If these trends go much further, money funds will be paying double what you 
can get on the typical MMDA.

HONDA CIVIC RANKED MOST FUEL-EFFICIENT OF 1995 CARS; AUTOS: GEO METRO XFI 
DROPPED OFF LISTING BY EPA. LUXURY MODELS WERE BIGGEST GAS GUZZLERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After five years of dominating the fuel economy derby, the Geo Metro is taking 
a back seat in 1995 -- to be replaced by a Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda Civic hatchback emerged as the stingiest gasoline miser on the road 
among 1995 model cars, with Honda subcompacts accounting for half of the 10 
most fuel-efficient vehicles, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a 
report to be officially released today.  
</P>
<P>
 Two Geo Metro models of subcompacts still made the top-10 list. But missing 
was the Geo Metro XFi which had been No. 1 for five straight years. Last year, 
Geo Metro cars finished first, second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for General Motors said the Geo XFi model was discontinued for the 
1995 model year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda Civic hatchback was rated at 56 miles per gallon on the highway and 
47 m.p.g. in city driving, the best among the new 1995 model cars tested. 
</P>
<P>
 As has been the case in past years, a string of luxury and high-performance 
cars made up the list of biggest gas guzzlers. The Lamborghini Diablo had the 
worst gas mileage at 9 m.p.g. in city driving and 14 m.p.g. on the highway. 
Eight of the 10 worst mileage cars were various models of the Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA estimated it costs $1,841 a year to fuel a Lamborghini, compared to 
$750 for a Ford Taurus (21 m.p.g.) and $338 for the Honda Civic hatchback. The 
estimates were based on 15,000 miles of travel and average gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA list showed 39 cars that were subject to the "gas guzzler" tax because 
of poor mileage, about the same as last year. The vast majority of cars and 
lights trucks were in the 18 m.p.g. to 29 m.p.g. category in combined city and 
highway driving. The Mazda Protege (34 m.p.g.) was the stingiest compact car 
and the Mazda 626 (29 m.p.g.) had the best performance among mid-size 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 And about 7% of the vehicles -- or 61 cars among those tested -- showed 
combined city and highway mileage of 30 m.p.g. or better. Nearly half of the 
cars and trucks tested had mileage of 20 m.p.g. or less, including 84 cars with 
mileage of less than 15 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suzuki Samurai (29 combined m.p.g.) and the Suzuki Sidekick and Geo 
Tracker convertible (both 27 m.p.g.) were the most fuel-efficient light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA provided no overall average mileage figures for 1995 models; officials 
said no such analysis had yet been done. But it is believed the overall numbers 
have not changed much from the last few years when average mileage among all 
vehicles has been about 28 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has jumped out that says there is a change here," said Tom Ball of 
the EPA's automobile fuel economy testing office in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the auto industry said the figures show again that market 
forces are not enough to get auto makers to increase fuel economy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton recently named an advisory commission to develop a plan to 
reduce automobile emissions, mainly carbon dioxide from burning gasoline, that 
are linked to global warming.

 Supreme Court Upholds Arrest Warrants on Pepsico Executives: The Philippine 
Supreme Court last week upheld arrest warrants on nine executives of a Manila 
subsidiary of Pepsico accused of refusing to pay more than 33,000 holders of 
winning bottle caps in a Pepsi promotion. The nine executives of Pepsi Cola 
Products Philippines face arrest on swindling charges after the Supreme Court 
denied their petition to reverse a lower court's order issued in May last year 
for their detention.The officials included Pepsico International Director Paul 
Roberts, the Manila unit's former president Rodolfo Salazar, board Chairman 
Luis Lorenzo and his son Luis Jr. They were indicted on several counts of 
swindling following the company's refusal to pay $1.42 billion to 33,668 
holders of Pepsi bottle tops bearing the number 3-4-9, the winning number in a 
1992 company promotion. The promotion was due to give away $36,500 to each 
winning bottle top holder.

 Rising Production Drives Industrial Output Up 3.8%: Japan's industrial output 
surged 3.8% in August from July, a result of rising production of a wide range 
of items from personal computers to clothing, the government said. August's 
rise, according to economists, provides further strong evidence that Japan's 
economy is gathering steam after its 3 1/2-year slump.

GANGSTERS TARGETING JAPANESE EXECUTIVES; VIOLENCE: CORPORATE WORLD HAS BECOME 
FEARFUL. THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SLAIN IN LAST 14 MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A wave of violence directed at business executives here is casting a spotlight 
on the murky world of relationships between gangsters and big business in Japan 
-- and stoking fear among those with gang contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, shots were fired at the home of a retired insurance executive 
who still consults for his company, and last month a Sumitomo Bank executive 
was murdered, execution style. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have speculated that the unsolved slaying of Kazufumi Hatanaka, manager 
of Sumitomo Bank's branch in the city of Nagoya, may be related to the bank's 
aggressive efforts to collect loans made during the peak of Japan's late-1980s 
economic boom. It is suspected that some borrowers may be gangster-controlled 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatanaka's murder is the third killing since the spring of last year that 
appears to be part of what Japanese media are describing as a wave of gangland 
terror against corporate targets. Hatanaka, 54, was shot through the head 
outside the door of his 10th-floor apartment in a controlled-access condominium 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judging from the method in the (Hatanaka) incident, we think it likely this 
was a planned attack by an organized crime group," said Takeshi Noda, head of 
the organized crime investigative division at the National Police Agency. 
"Because it was a quick hit and immediate escape, we don't have much in the way 
of witnesses and evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Since enactment of an anti-gang law two years ago, police have moved more 
aggressively than ever before against Japan's yakuza , who for decades were 
romanticized in film and tolerated by the public. It is much easier than in the 
past, for example, for police to arrest yakuza on harassment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations that once yielded to extortion by gangs, or sometimes even sought 
to benefit from their activities, have also been taking steps to end such 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 While companies often are simple victims of protection rackets, there also are 
cases where firms try to make use of gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, sokaiya are gangs that specialize in extorting money from firms 
by threatening to disrupt stockholders meetings. But sokaiya also are sometimes 
used by management to ensure that legitimate shareholders do not challenge 
company policies. Real estate developers sometimes turn to yakuza for help in 
evicting tenants from properties targeted for redevelopment. Tenant rights are 
so strong in Japan it is often hard to force people out by legal means. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent anti-gang efforts aim to end these practices. 
</P>
<P>
 As pressure on gangs has built, the incidence of apparent gang violence 
against corporations also has escalated sharply. Since 1992, there have been 18 
reported gun or knife attacks on corporate executives, according to the 
National Police Agency. These attacks remain unsolved. But given the low level 
of random street crime in Japan, at least most are presumed to have been 
targeted against specific victims, probably for reasons related to their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the bursting of the (late-1980s) financial bubble, the corporate world 
has been under pressure to cut its ties with organized crime," said a recent 
editorial in the Nikkei Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This in turn has sparked bad feelings, and police suspect gang members have 
been involved in some of the recent attacks against corporate officials. In 
fact, some observers hold that these attacks are part of an organized terror 
campaign against companies and society as a whole," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporations must not yield to these threats of violence. Doing so will only 
embolden those involved, and lead to the spread of such activities throughout 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 The single most frequent target of attacks has been Sumitomo. Firms of the 
Sumitomo group -- which has Sumitomo Bank at its core -- have been targeted in 
22 incidents since early last year, according to police. These have included 
fire bombings of executives' homes, the firing of shots at Sumitomo properties, 
severed telephone lines and verbal threats. 
</P>
<P>
 In an incident with the marks of a ritual assassination, Fuji Photo Film Co. 
executive Juntaro Suzuki was killed in February on the street outside his Tokyo 
home by men wielding samurai swords. Suzuki's work involved coping with sokaiya 
. 
</P>
<P>
 A vice president of the small Hanwa Bank, Tomosaburo Koyama, was murdered last 
year in what police said was the work of an experienced hit man. Koyama was in 
charge of the bank's problem loans and bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
 More incidents that appeared to involve gang attacks on business targets came 
last week. In Tokyo, shots were fired at the home of Ryuhei Takashima, 75, a 
former chairman of Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. An executive director of the 
firm had been assaulted outside his home by a man with a knife in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Since summer, ultra-rightist groups -- which often function like gangs or have 
gangland ties -- have been staging a harassment campaign around Takashima's 
house over the firm's loan policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day as the attack on Takashima's home, someone fired at an auto 
dealership and a restaurant in the southwestern city of Fukuoka. Police suspect 
the incidents may be related to September shootings in the nearby city of 
Kitakyushu that have been linked to an underworld group. 
</P>
<P>
 These incidents are creating a new climate of fear among businessmen who come 
into contact with gangsters as part of their work. "We are likely to lose our 
lives if we try to cut our ties with criminal organizations and the sokaiy a," 
said an unnamed executive quoted by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. "But if we 
continue relations with them, we are likely to be arrested, thus destroying our 
careers. Either way, we have to put our lives on the line."

Corporate Violence 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of violence directed at Japanese business people during the past year 
has unsettled the country and highlighted vague relationships between business 
and gangsters. Several incidents have occurred since last spring:

 Surging Imports Widen Trade Deficit Down Under: Australia's trade deficit was 
wider in August than it's been in more than four years, a result of surging 
imports that signal the economy is growing fast enough to spur inflation, 
analysts said. The current account deficit expanded 18% to a seasonally 
adjusted $1.56 billion, from a revised $1.32 billion in July, the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics said.

 China Expected to Borrow $15 Billion Over Next Five Years: China is expected 
to borrow some $15 billion from the World Bank in the next five years and may 
borrow a similar amount early next century to finance the most ambitious 
economic reforms in the developing world, senior World Bank officials said. The 
communist country is the bank's biggest borrower, and the development agency 
plans to lend it about $3 billion a year in the next five years. Since 1981, 
when the bank first began lending to China, it has committed $19.4 billion in 
loans, of which $9 billion has been paid out so far.

 August Unemployment Remains at 3%: Japan's unemployment rate remained stuck at 
around 3% in August, although the number of people out of work edged up to 2 
million, according to the official Management and Coordination Agency. The 
August rate was 3.01%, or a seasonally adjusted 3%, up from 2.96% in July and 
2.5% in August last year. The jobless rate for July and August is the highest 
since June, 1987, when Japan's economy suffered a slump caused by the high yen.

 World Bank Expected to Approve $100-Million Loan to Vietnam: The World Bank is 
expected to approve a $100-million loan for Vietnam next month to help the 
communist country reform its economy and buy needed imports, a senior Bank 
official said last week.The World Bank resumed lending to Vietnam last November 
after a 15-year hiatus as a thawing of relations between Hanoi and Washington 
paved the way for international assistance. Since then, the Bank has approved 
some $400 million in loans for Hanoi. The new $100-million loan, which will be 
accompanied by additional low-cost financing from the IMF, will be used for a 
variety of purposes, including banking reform.

SOME OF COUNTY'S RICH GETTING EVEN RICHER, FORBES FINDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of Orange County's richest people have gotten even richer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newly released annual Forbes 400 Richest People in America 
list, Donald Bren, the 62-year-old chairman of the Irvine Co., jumped from No. 
54 in 1993 to No. 35 this time, with a net worth of $2 billion.That's up from 
$1.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Catherine Getty Earhart, 42, of Laguna Beach has a rank of 189 with $550 
million to her name, up from $400 million last year. Her sister, Claire Eugenia 
Getty Perry, 40, listed as having moved from Laguna Beach to San Francisco, 
possesses the same amount of wealth, according to Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
 And Joan Irvine Smith, 61, of Corona del Mar, who previously was included in a 
section of Forbes magazine that listed wealthy families, is now listed as an 
individual. She is ranked 341 and her fortune weighed in at $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes reports that Katsumasa (Roy) Sakioka, 96, is still worth $350 million, 
the same as in 1993.

VIETNAM WELCOMES ITS EXPATRIATES' TRADE MISSION; COMMERCE: ENTREPRENEURS HOPE 
TO MEET WITH HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS ON THE TRIP, WHICH HAS STIRRED CONTROVERSY 
IN ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The first trade mission of Vietnamese expatriates to visit their homeland 
since the Vietnam War ended a generation ago was welcomed warmly here Sunday 
for a week of talks with high-ranking Communist officials, but their hopes of 
meeting with the country's president were dashed. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the delegates expressed disappointment, saying they still expect the 
visit to promote trade and improve relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation had hoped to meet with President Le Duc Anh and Premier Vo Van 
Kiet; instead they were told on arrival that they are tentatively scheduled to 
meet with a deputy premier today and the vice president on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham -- president of the Westminster-based Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce 
and organizer of the mission -- had said in August that the Vietnamese had 
verbally agreed on sessions with President Anh and other top government 
officials. The delegation's preliminary brochure also mentioned the likelihood 
of such top-level sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Government organizers said schedule conflicts prevented Anh from meeting the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of 24 led by Pham were given red roses at the lakeside hotel and had 
dinner with the Viet Nam-USA Society, a Hanoi friendship organization that has 
been coordinating this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first time back to where I was born (Hanoi) and I'm so sad to see 
it so poor," said Pham, crying soon after arriving at Tay Ho Hotel. "I feel so 
sorry for Vietnam. I'm more convinced than ever that all Vietnamese nationals 
should come back here to help." 
</P>
<P>
 That intention had led him to organize the trade mission, which was designed 
to introduce American businsss professionals to top decision makers in the 
Vietnamese government. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the trade mission, half of whom were born in Vietnam, say their 
purpose is strictly business, but they realized their mere presence in Hanoi 
has political overtones back in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here for business, business, business," said Philip Tuong Nguyen, vice 
president of EPG Asia, an international trading company in Anaheim Hills 
specializing in water purification systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time to forget the past," said Nguyen, who had been imprisoned by the 
Communist government for two years before escaping Vietnam by boat. "We have 
the obligation to help our country and the people. If you raise the people up 
(economically), democracy will follow suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the delegates declined to reveal their names and hometowns, fearful 
that anti-Communist demonstrators would come to their front lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 After plans for the trip were announced in August, hundreds of anti-Communist 
protesters camped outside Pham's Westminster medical office and denounced the 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators branded Pham a traitor for heading a delegation to meet with 
the enemy of the fallen Republic of Vietnam. Renewed business ties with the 
current Vietnam, they said, will help preserve a Communist government that 
violates human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers also refused to provide the list of participants on the mission. 
Pham said most of the delegates are entrepreneurs in construction, food 
processing and retail. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Christopher Murphy, a Costa Mesa finance consultant who is 
representing four Orange County companies interested in contracts to improve 
Vietnam's infrastructure. For example, one company is building homes in Poland 
while another is doing work on railways in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of work to be done in Vietnam," said Murphy, who said his 
impressions of the Southeast Asian country are based on what he has seen in 
movies and read in the media. He now wants to learn more about Vietnam policies 
regarding international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is Los Angeles resident David Hayden, managing director of a food 
processing company. Hayden and his Vietnamese wife, Phuong, said they are 
visiting Vietnam for the second time because they want to participate in this 
historical trade mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all the demonstrations will pass," said Hayden, of Borderless 
Investment Group. "It's time to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 On the ride from the airport to the hotel, the Americans saw Vietnamese 
working in rice fields; the narrow streets of Hanoi full of bicycles and lined 
with rundown buildings. Once at the hotel, the vice president of the Viet 
Nam-USA Society punctuated the friendly dinner with a message directed mostly 
at the Vietnamese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for you to come back to your country," Nguyen Huy Phan said. "You 
can feel the openness of the Vietnamese people here. I hope after your stay 
you'll be able to do something concrete for the benefit of all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The delegates are scheduled to meet members of Vietnam's Chamber of Commerce 
in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where they will be on Thursday. They will leave 
Ho Chi Minh City to return to the United States on Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the delegates were stuck in Hong Kong on Sunday awaiting entry visas 
to Vietnam. They were expected to join the group in Hanoi today.

AN INTIMATE LESSON ON AIDS; LATINAS LEARN OF RISKS, PREVENTION IN CANDID, 
BACK-YARD GATHERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the playful squeals of neighborhood children, a dozen women put aside 
their evening chores and carried kitchen chairs to the grass courtyard of their 
apartment complex to hear a neighbor talk about AIDS, intimacy and their 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, Latinas of all ages, picked up condoms displayed on a folding 
table, and some asked shyly how they are used. All of them listened intently 
while group leader Connie Rodriguez explained to them in Spanish how to examine 
their breasts for early signs of cancer. And some nodded quietly when she 
described relationships plagued by poor communication. 
</P>
<P>
 The platica, or talk, was one of four open-air sessions last week in the 
Jeffrey-Lynne area of Anaheim to educate women about HIV and other health 
issues. Sponsored by the Delhi Community Center in Santa Ana, the program also 
encourages women to speak openly with their children and husbands on such 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that to address HIV and AIDS in a vacuum without addressing the 
issues of power and sex negotiation will not work," said Irene Martinez, 
executive director of the Delhi center. "How do you bring up the issue when in 
your culture, in your community, you never talk about sex and sexuality?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, a 50-year-old homemaker who lives in the Jeffrey-Lynne 
neighborhood, organized the evening meetings. "Some husbands don't let their 
wives go out to the community centers," she said. "What I'm trying to do is go 
to their own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is one of 17 female volunteers who graduated two weeks ago from a 
Delhi Community Center program that aims to reach 1,000 Latinas across Orange 
County in the next year. The program, funded by a grant from the State Office 
of AIDS, is one of only a few to target the Latino community, local health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the word out is vital. Of the 3,388 AIDS cases reported in Orange 
County through June this year, 207 of the patients were women. Of those, 58 
were Latina, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers reflect an alarming increase over the years. In 1989, for 
example, 13% of Orange County women afflicted with AIDS were Latina. That 
compares to more than 28% of the cases reported so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely need to continue programs for the Latino population in 
general," said Ron Taylor, STD/HIV Services program manager for the Orange 
County Health Care Agency. "Men and women show the increase." 
</P>
<P>
 The Delhi program, he said, may be the only one working specifically with 
Latinas.  
</P>
<P>
 Talks cover how a person contracts the virus that causes AIDS, how to prevent 
it and how to broach the subject with a partner, including how to say no to 
unsafe sex. They also offer information about mammograms, which detect breast 
cancer, and Pap smears, which can discover cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot of things about sexual relations that I didn't know," said 
Yolanda Mendez, 28, one of the platica participants. "Before this class, I 
didn't know anything. I thought you could get AIDS by eating from the same 
spoon or from a kiss. But now I see that it's not so. Now I can go and tell my 
friends what I learned." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the hourlong sessions also touch on another sensitive issue: domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, the woman feels she has to have sex because, if she doesn't, her 
husband might hit her or become very angry," said Leticia Leon, a Delhi 
Community Center activist who coordinates the program. She spoke to the 
neighborhood group at its final session last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many men are accustomed to hit their wives in front of strangers to show that 
he's macho, that he's in control," she told them. "I don't know if any of you 
have experiences with these situations I have described, but they are very 
common." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who organized the talks equipped with little more than a borrowed 
table, a binder full of Spanish-language medical pamphlets and the condoms used 
in her demonstrations, said any piece of information passed along might benefit 
another woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez admits that she knew little about AIDS or the other subjects she now 
teaches until she attended a women's rap session held by activist Leon last 
year. What she heard that day so moved her, she said, that she joined 16 other 
women who signed up for training and made the commitment to carry the message 
into their respective neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The educadoras range in age from 22 to 55 and include women from Mexico, Peru, 
Guatemala, El Salvador and Brazil, Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was the first to launch her programs, Leon said. Other women plan to 
hold workshops soon in elementary schools in Santa Ana and Garden Grove, at a 
Santa Ana medical clinic, and in as many Latino neighborhoods as they can 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's final Jeffrey-Lynne meeting, Leon handed out certificates and 
bonus eyeliner to the women, who lingered to share tacos and sodas while they 
chatted about what they had learned. Some said their husbands hadn't been 
enthusiastic about the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Participant Mendez, for example, said her husband wanted her to sit with him 
while he ate his dinner each night. But after she agreed to prepare his food 
early and explained to him that the information might be important for the 
health of both of them, he relented. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very delicate subject," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The intimate setting of Rodriguez' sessions provide the only frank advice some 
of the women have ever received about sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The program "helps us ask for information, for counseling," said Margarita 
Mendez, 52, who is pregnant with twins and also has 13 grandchildren. "Now we 
know what to be careful of, how to guard against infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times we don't know where to go for advice," said Mendez, a native of 
Mexico. "We come from a country far away, and we are alone. We don't know where 
to turn." Without Rodriguez, she said, "we wouldn't have learned any of this."

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: FAR TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL -- 
LITERALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The radio is blaring, the window rolled down. You blink hard and try to 
concentrate. But invisible strings tug your chin and eyelids downward, and you 
drift to off sleep as your car drifts across lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're lucky, you jerk awake a second later and snap back into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 But tens of thousands of people each year aren't so lucky, and wind up in 
crashes, many of them fatal. Indeed, falling asleep at the wheel -- often just 
a metaphor for being inattentive on the job -- has in its literal sense become 
a deadly problem on our nation's highways as folks work longer hours and sleep 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that at least 50,000 accidents 
a year are caused by sleepy drivers, with 1,436 deaths in 1992. In California 
alone last year, 2,355 people were injured or killed in wrecks where sleepiness 
was a contributing factor -- and experts regard these numbers as conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a federally sponsored national campaign to warn against the 
dangers of driving while tired opens in December. In New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo 
has created a task force on the effects of fatigue on driving, which accounted 
for as many as half the fatal accidents last year on the New York State 
Thruway. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't know how big a problem this is," said Dr. Allan Pack, 
medical director of the National Sleep Foundation, which is helping to mount 
the nationwide "Drive Alert, Arrive Alive" effort. 
</P>
<P>
 What is known is that drowsy driving is fairly widespread. A recent national 
survey found that more than one-third of drivers reported having felt drowsy 
while cruising along, although the proportion of those who said they actually 
fell asleep was smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 The tendency to succumb to exhaustion behind the wheel cuts across all 
boundaries of sex, age and race. But drivers 25 and younger are the most prone 
to nodding off, because of lifestyles that embrace late-night partying, 
studying into the wee hours or working evening jobs, Pack said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also at risk are truckers who drive their hulking tractor-trailers throughout 
the night, often through long, flat stretches of desert or plain. Snoozing 
becomes almost irresistible, given the monotonous drive, blackness all around, 
lulling vibrations and the mesmeric quality of watching the broken white stripe 
in the middle of the road rush toward you and past, toward you and past. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of drivers get hypnotized," said Dick Jacoby, president of West East 
Trucking in Chatsworth, which delivers produce around the country. "A lot of 
guys, they try to fight it. But you can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoby, who says he has logged 2 million miles on the road, tells his 
employees to find a rest stop or a motel if exhaustion hits. "The rule of thumb 
is if you blink your eyes twice or yawn once, pull off and go to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 To sleep disorder specialists, the rule of thumb is that humans weren't 
designed to perform tasks like driving late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Our natural biological rhythms push us to doze at certain times of the day; 
the strongest cravings grip us between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. and in the mid- to 
late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to those powerful urges the fact that our society is demanding more of its 
work force, at all hours, and the result is a high potential for sleep 
deprivation and disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society right now is pressing people to work longer hours and take longer 
commutes. As a whole, we have a bigger sleep debt," said Dr. Frisca Yan-Go of 
the UCLA Sleep Disorders Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you have to pay some back. You cannot be chronically sleep-deprived and 
not give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: The Exxon Valdez oil spill and the catastrophe at Three Mile Island 
both occurred late at night. Fatigue also has led pilots to misread their 
instrument panels and land not only on the wrong runway, but at the wrong 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, a pickup truck packed with 20 people veered off the freeway into a 
ditch near Barstow, killing 12 and injuring eight others in one of the worst 
single-vehicle accidents in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause: a driver who had fallen sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like alcohol-related crashes. They're more severe than the average 
crash in general," said Ron Knipling of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To try to prevent such catastrophes, Knipling's agency and private researchers 
are developing devices that can be installed in cars to detect drowsiness, 
perhaps by recording how much the car is drifting off center or how often the 
driver adjusts the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Activating an alarm can warn of drowsiness, but the trick is finding a way to 
stimulate the driver into steady alertness, especially in a luxury car that 
maximizes comfort and minimizes effort -- a virtual "bed on wheels," as Pack of 
the sleep foundation puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 One idea is for drowsiness detectors to trigger the car's ventilation system 
and lower the heat inside. Another study shows that releasing an odor, like 
peppermint, may also induce wakefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts stress that these are merely short-term measures, like drinking 
coffee. Sleep cannot be deferred too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like urination in a way. You can put it off, walk around a bit to 
relieve the pressure, but if you've got to go, you've got to go," said Pack.

AIDES ABSORB THE WORLD ACCORDING TO SEN. HAYDEN; LEGISLATURE: STAFFERS TAKE 
PART IN AN INTELLECTUAL ODYSSEY OF MANDATORY READINGS, VIEWINGS AND DISCUSSIONS 
TO HELP THEIR BOSS ADVANCE HIS REFORM AGENDA. 
</P>

<P>
 The tour group was running late and the little yellow school bus was waiting. 
One of the visitors to Cal State Northridge's quake-rattled campus tapped her 
watch as if to say, we'd better cut this short. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a wrist problem?" the group leader snapped, resisting efforts to rush 
everyone along. It was for their benefit, state Sen. Tom Hayden scolded, that 
this look at campus rebuilding had been arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 While many state lawmakers see little of their Capitol staffs during the 
Legislature's recess, Hayden required his to accompany him last week on a 
two-day district tour and retreat to discuss next year's legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still trying to pull out all the lessons from the earthquake," Hayden 
said, as he guided the entourage past some of the 53 CSUN buildings damaged by 
the powerful Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour marked the latest in a series of unconventional steps that the 
activist Democrat has taken in the past few months to redefine his Senate 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 First came the required readings. Then the discussion groups. Then the 
documentary film screenings. Now everyone, from the scheduling secretary to the 
chief of staff, gets an education on the world according to Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has been to clue his aides in on what matters most to Hayden so they 
can help advance his self-proclaimed reform agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, in part, has been to remake the experience of working in the 
Capitol into an intellectual odyssey of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hayden finds a problem troubling, his staff is expected to react as 
passionately as he. If Hayden gets charged up about a cause, it ought to catch 
fire in the office too. If Hayden, himself an author and college instructor, 
finds inspiration in a book or essay, they should search for it too. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have their roots in Hayden's failed quest for the Democratic 
nomination for governor, which -- although he lost badly -- confirmed for him 
that 302,035 California voters supported his notion that the status quo needs 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in addition to mundane matters such as the care and feeding of the 
senator's electric car, staff members are expected to conduct investigations, 
ferret out scandals and organize community activists -- as well as keep up with 
the intellectual dares being tossed their way. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Hayden's staff has met the new demands with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at peace with the notion that the workplace is not a big social mixing 
bowl but a place for reform," says chief of staff Duane Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime legislative aide Kip Wiley, who has been with the senator for eight 
years and in the Capitol for 14, says: "I've worked for some of the most 
conservative and some of the most liberal members of the Legislature. It's 
always good to know not only the beliefs of the member but also their world 
views." 
</P>
<P>
 For a quick glance at the boss' global views, check out the reading assignment 
"Living in Truth" by Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel. In a chapter titled 
"Politics and Conscience," this friend of Hayden's observes that politicians 
need to stay in touch with the natural world, not so much with the artificial 
realms of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Other mandatory readings are excerpts from "The Power Elite" by sociologist C. 
Wright Mills, a book that inspired the radical Hayden in his youth, and a 
recent tome on Los Angeles' urban crisis called "City of Quartz" by Mike Davis. 
And, of course, aides are also expected to familiarize themselves with 
"Reunion," Hayden's memoir published by Random House in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But what place do esoteric ruminations and sociological truths have in a 
legislative process that, at its lowest point, is influenced more by trickery 
and deep pockets than deep thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Havel piece talks about how we have gotten away from a bond with nature," 
said Peterson. "And then you fast-forward to trying to deal with a bill to 
protect the Chinook salmon that is threatened with extinction." It all 
connects, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so for the devotees on Hayden's staff. (If anyone disagrees, they won't 
say so on the record. Hayden himself prefers to talk about issues, but not 
about the way he runs his show.) But in the corridors of the Capitol, where 
legislators are more likely to demand staffers' help with everything from pet 
care to wardrobe matching, some might regard the goings-on in Room 2048 as an 
oddity. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do other staffers view us? They don't like us at all," said Peterson, 
noting that some jealousy might result from the fact that Hayden's staff 
doesn't have to worry about fund raising for their financially independent 
boss. "I sense some hostility. We're (jerks) in a lot of people's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wiley reports, whistle-blowers show up, drawn by the senator's frequent 
railings against political corruption. "They'll say, 'Here's this bill you 
should know about. My fingerprints can't be on it, but can you help blow it 
up?' That's kind of an honored role." 
</P>
<P>
 That the senator would lay down the literary law for his staff comes as no 
surprise to those who see him return to the Capitol after lunch with another 
bag of books purchased on his frequent-customer account with a local 
bookseller. 
</P>
<P>
 A voracious reader himself, Hayden went through 200 volumes while researching 
his latest work -- a book examining how religion affects the environment by 
teaching, for example, that God created the Earth for humankind. He has yet to 
nail down a publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussion groups, everyone is expected to come prepared to talk over what 
struck them most about the reading assignment. Often there are half a dozen 
points of view for the half a dozen staffers gathered together. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, more discussions follow showings of documentaries. The staff recently 
saw a film outlining racial discrimination in South-Central Los Angeles, and 
another about the 1964 Freedom Summer in Mississippi, a critical period in the 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 This was all well and good for explaining where the senator was coming from, 
but for insight into where he's headed, 11 Sacramento and local staffers joined 
him on last week's mandatory tour of the 23rd Senate District and a few stops 
outside its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The itinerary reflected many of the issues that Hayden expects his staff to 
dog when the Legislature resumes its work in December: earthquake safety and 
rebuilding (CSUN and Sherman Oaks), gambling (Hollywood Park Casino), Santa 
Monica Mountains preservation (Soka University's Calabasas site), wetlands 
protection (Ballona wetlands), transportation (Hollywood's subway sinkhole) and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hayden is often identified as a Santa Monica senator because that's his 
home base, that coastal city constitutes only 8% of his sprawling Senate 
district. More than half of his district is in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of that fact, Hayden said he thought it smart to bus his staff through 
the Valley, and portions of the district as a whole. It is a seemingly 
common-sense mandate that few lawmakers impose. 
</P>
<P>
 Quips about the "magical mystery tour" were traded by staffers aboard the 
little yellow school bus but, on the whole, they pronounced the trip to be 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings more immediacy to the problems that people are facing," said Sandy 
Brown, the new head of Hayden's district office. "To go around with your staff 
is probably a good idea for everyone who represents constituents."

QUAKE-HIT '32 OLYMPIC SWIM FACILITY MAY BE RAZED; RECREATION: RAIDERS' AND 
CLIPPERS' DESIRE FOR A PARKING LOT ON THE SITE IS SAID TO BE ONE REASON 
OFFICIALS FAVOR MOVING THE CITY'S BIGGEST YOUTH POOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A decision is near on whether to demolish the earthquake-damaged swim stadium 
next to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the 1932 Olympic swimming 
events were held, according to officials acquainted with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's largest swim facility for youths was shut down all summer, not 
because of serious damage to the pool itself but because the stadium, which 
includes shower and dressing areas, was ruled unsafe after the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears most likely that the stadium will be torn down and a replacement 
pool and recreation facility will be constructed somewhere else in Exposition 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Relocating the facility could clear the way for building a large parking 
structure close to both the Coliseum and the Sports Arena, thus easing 
negotiations with the Raiders on a long-term playing contract. In some 
quarters, in fact, pleasing the Raiders is said to be a major reason for 
officials' desire to relocate the swim facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But many details remain to be decided. Officials cannot say definitely when a 
new swim facility will be constructed or where it will be in Exposition Park. 
Those issues will be a subject of protracted hearings and negotiations, said 
Steven L. Soboroff, president of the city's Recreation and Parks Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to allow a process to happen, and that includes input from the 
community, City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and Supervisor Yvonne Burke, to 
get the maximum bang for the buck," Soboroff said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that $7 million in funding is available from a 1992 bond issue, and 
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to come up with 
additional money from earthquake repair funds. "We have a chance for a 
$7-(million) to $12-million new facility," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, however, considerable controversy surrounds these plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amateur Athletic Foundation, the group charged with dispensing the 
Southern California youth share of the 1984 Olympic surplus, has been resisting 
demolition of the swim stadium in principle and certainly without definite 
commitment -- and a completion date -- for building a new 50-meter pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We favor retention of the present 50-meter pool," Patrick Escobar, a 
foundation vice president, said last week. "This is the only 50-meter pool in 
the inner city that works well and serves the children. And we want to know how 
long, how many summers, are the kids going to be without a pool?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-meter swimming pool -- which the foundation favors for use in athletic 
competitions -- has traditionally been the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks 
Department's biggest summer aquatics draw for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Built for the 1932 Olympics, it was renovated in the 1960s; shortly before the 
earthquake, major improvements were made in its water circulation system. (A 
separate pool was built on the USC campus for the 1984 Olympics). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar questioned why, since the pool was not seriously damaged by the 
earthquake, it would not suffice to build new dressing and shower facilities 
around it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, that he had heard that a major motive for relocating the 
swim facility is to smooth negotiations with the Los Angeles Raiders football 
franchise for a long-term Coliseum playing contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and the Los Angeles Clippers basketball franchise at the nearby 
Sports Arena both would like to see a parking structure built at the present 
site of the swim stadium and the swim facility put in a less strategic part of 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon Sloan, a member of the Coliseum Commission and chairman of a master 
plan committee for Exposition Park, has said this would be a sound plan. But he 
has cautioned that some hard negotiating may lie ahead as to where the new swim 
facility would go. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloan noted that the parks department has a long-term lease with the Museum of 
Science and Industry, a state agency, on the present site. In order to get a 
new site, the agencies would have to agree to a land swap,, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that a parks department staff member had suggested that the replacement 
site be at the northeast corner of Vermont Avenue and Martin Luther King 
Boulevard, quite close to the present stadium, Sloan said: "Over my dead body 
will the stadium be built (there). Farther north along Vermont would be a 
better place." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first months following the quake, it appeared that the damage to the 
swim stadium was not sufficient to secure FEMA funds to replace rather than 
repair it. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA, according to agency spokesman Russ Edmiston, has a rule that repair 
costs must exceed 50% of the estimated cost of replacement before an applicant 
for federal disaster repair funds can elect to replace a damaged facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "If, for instance, the replacement costs $2 million and the repair costs $2.5 
million, then we would pay the lesser of the two costs," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Soboroff said that when the parks department asked a private Orange County 
firm, Architects Pacifica, to estimate the damage, repair costs were judged to 
be only 48% of the replacement cost. 
</P>
<P>
 This seemed to mean that the damage was insufficient to ask FEMA for 
replacement funds. But, Soboroff said, a second study by Gruen Associates 
"found that the damage number was in the 70% range. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read the Gruen report," he said. "It's very thick, highly technical. It 
takes up asbestos issues that were not analyzed in the Architects Pacifica 
report. . . . So what we have done is taken the Gruen report and given it to 
Architects Pacifica, and asked for a revision of their report that we could 
submit to FEMA." 
</P>
<P>
 The president of Architects Pacifica, Jim LeNeve, said: "We have the Gruen 
draft report, which we are looking at for revisions." LeNeve said his new 
report will be submitted shortly. Soboroff expressed confidence that the new 
report will find enough damage to qualify the swim facility for replacement. 
"The thing about earthquake damage is that until you look underneath (into a 
structure's foundation), you don't know how much damage there is," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Coliseum, the swim stadium has not been designated a historic 
landmark, so presumably it could be demolished without the permission of state 
and federal historic preservation boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Soboroff said he looks forward to replacement, in part because it has been so 
costly to operate the present swim stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a new facility, he said it is possible that "we could build a community 
center there instead of just a swim stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 This would include an indoor pool -- the present pool is outdoors -- and 
perhaps a wading pool for seniors and the handicapped, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Soboroff would not commit to building the 50-meter pool preferred by 
Amateur Athletic Foundation officials, calling that only "an option." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's how the community speaks in the hearings," he said.

ORANGE BALLOT OFFERS QUIRKS, CONSERVATISM; ELECTION: THE 13 CANDIDATES INCLUDE 
A "SHAMAN" AND AN EX-POLICEMAN WITH THOUGHTS OF LEGAL AND TAXABLE PROSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters here will choose from 13 candidates who range from a "shaman" in his 
20th try for mayor to a former New York City police officer who thinks 
government is overlooking a prime revenue source in legalized prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the candidates tend to reflect the city itself: a sturdy field of 
home-grown conservatives, punctuated by the quirky and the unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign platforms are notably similar. Two of the three mayoral candidates 
and all 10 of those running for City Council push for more police, more 
business, less government and no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 City residents are sharply divided into two groups -- Old Towne 
"preservationists" and "property rights" advocates. Residents who live east of 
the Costa Mesa Freeway also present some issues, such as concern about 
spill-over crime from the county-run island of El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the mayoral candidates -- Joanne Coontz and Fred L. Barrera -- both 
hold council seats and are in a tight race. 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz, a 65-year-old former planning commissioner, has gathered a wealth of 
endorsements, including that of the police union. In 1986, she became the first 
woman elected to the council. She describes herself as tough, a risk-taker and 
someone who can unify divided residents. She said the mayor should be an 
ambassador for Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers credit her with being involved, knowing the issues and 
doing her homework. She advocates Neighborhood Watch groups, beefed-up business 
programs and the library as a city priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Her leading opponent, Barrera, 72, is a lifelong Orange resident who went to a 
segregated Latino elementary school and then went on to own a Union Oil 
dealership and co-found the Orange National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 He stresses the social problems of gangs, drugs and the disobedience of youth, 
all of which he said can be tied to hard economic times and the need for jobs 
and business growth in Orange. Barrera is in his fifth term and, as mayor pro 
tem, has some edge. He lost a battle to use the title on the ballot, but he has 
exposure as acting mayor for the often-absent Mayor Gene Beyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The third person in the mayoral race is Juan Pablo Serrano Nieblas, 59, who 
lists himself on his voter registration as a shaman and on the ballot as an 
environmentalist. A shaman is a native healer-priest. Nieblas explains that he 
is the son of Mexican immigrant and a member of the Juaneno Band of Mission 
Indians. The 59-year-old son of migrant workers who practices psychic healing 
and He is the only candidate running on an anti-business theme. Nieblas is 
known in the city as a perennial candidate and he says he has run for the 
office 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than woo business, Nieblas said he wants to cease offering enticements 
to industry. He said he has turned down money from political action committees 
and would restore the canyon lands. The former custodian would close the 
Redevelopment Agency and force developers to build low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The field vying for the two open council seats is wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Mark Murphy has a list of powerful endorsements and is the only 
council candidate to win the police union's backing. A city native, Murphy, 37, 
stresses his business sense acquired as an account manager for Hewlett-Packard 
Co. and takes credit for beating down a proposed utility tax last year. His 
record also includes pushing for the city's gift ban and working to lure the 
Mills Corp. to Orange. His platform includes public safety, business growth and 
property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Another homegrown candidate is Dan Slater, a 35-year-old real estate broker 
running on the issues of police protection and business expansion. The current 
council is too wimpy, too easily influenced by gadflies, he has told voters. He 
will give the city the decisiveness it lacks, he said. He also strongly favors 
imposing stringent design regulations to preserve the historic Old Towne. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Alvarez, 38, also works in real estate, overseeing his family trust 
and business operations. He wants to establish Neighborhood Watch programs to 
fight crime. He has the firefighters' union endorsement and wants to make 
support of the city library system a higher priority. He is president of the 
Downtown Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing them is Corinne Schreck, one of the city's most vocal property rights 
advocates. The 51-year-old property manager thinks Old Towne regulations are 
too restrictive. She would like to create ties between Orange Unified School 
District and the city, beef up the police, lure businesses and consider making 
the library privately run. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from the east side of town is Mara Brandman, a longtime activist. She 
is vice president of Orange Park Acres and the Wilderness Homeowners Assn. and 
is running on an anti-crime theme. One solution to reducing crime from El 
Modena might be to annex the area, she said, or to force the county to increase 
its anti-gang efforts. Brandman, 49, is president of the library's Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolfo Perez Jr., 22, is running on a pro-business theme and would try to fill 
some of the empty warehouses in the city. He works in banking and said he would 
try to cut the city budget in unspecified areas and increase funds for 
firefighting and police. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the newer faces is Joseph Vanderhoff, a 46-year-old retired police 
officer copfrom New York City. His platform is fighting crime and he advocates 
building more prisons. He said he brings 30 years of public service and a love 
for the city to the voters. Now a private detective, he also works as a lay 
arbitrator. He wants to legalize prostitution to both regulate it and tax it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wronski, 47, has jumped in the ring for the second time. A bicycle shop 
owner, Wronski advocates more and better bicycle trails and easing restrictions 
on bicyclists. He said he would also look for new ways to raise money, such as 
citywide bingo games. Government should be smaller, tougher on crime, and 
contract out services where possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanic David Johnson, 33, also targets crime as an issue. The former Marine 
wants to expand the industrial base and improve police training so that police 
outside of the gang unit also are trained to handle that problem. He is aiming 
his campaign largely at senior citizens and he points to his work for seniors 
at the North Orange Christian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest candidate is 20-year-old Gregory Reynolds. A Cypress College 
student, Reynolds said his youth would enable him to communicate with gangs and 
assist the city's gang-fighting efforts. He hopes to follow the political 
example of his grandfather, Max Reynolds, who was mayor of Orange for two terms 
in the 1960s. He said he would like to see the city regain some of its 
small-town friendliness.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; CHALLENGE NO HANDICAP TO THESE ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The imagination and resourcefulness of disabled American artists, some of whom 
cannot see or hold a paintbrush, is being demonstrated in a multimedia exhibit 
at the City of Brea Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inspirations: Art by the Physically and Developmentally Challenged" features 
more than 130 works by 42 artists in the fields of painting, drawing, sculpture 
and photography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to recognize these artists for their abilities, not their 
disabilities," gallery director Marie Sofi said. "They don't want to be treated 
(as) special, they just want to be in the mainstream of society." 
</P>
<P>
 Sofi said the success of a similar exhibit at the municipal gallery in 1985 
prompted her to revisit and expand on the theme of artists with disabilities. 
That first show "touched the hearts of a lot of people," she said, including a 
16-year-old girl "who had lost an arm and was having a real tough time dealing 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I teamed her up with some of the artists," Sofi said. "Not having experienced 
this myself (losing a limb), I couldn't say, 'I know what you feel.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One of the artists in the current show is Said Abdelsayed, who was paralyzed 
from the waist down when his back was broken in a 1976 traffic collision. The 
40-year-old Tustin resident switched from medical school to art school after 
the accident, and eventually earned a master's degree in drawing and painting. 
He also helped found Artability Artists, a Southern California-based group of 
artists with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is still so good," said Abdelsayed, who was married in 1982 and now has 
two children and a flourishing art career. His expressionistic paintings have 
been shown across the country in galleries, convention centers and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to sit on the couch watching TV," he said. "I want people to 
say, 'If Said can do it, I can do it.' That's the whole point." 
</P>
<P>
 "Inspirations" will continue through Oct. 21 at the gallery, 1 Civic Center 
Circle. For more information on the show and related special events, call (714)

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; GATING OF COLLEGE PARK WEST PROPOSED

<P>
 Some College Park West residents want to restrict public access to their 
neighborhood and have proposed turning their part of the city into a gated 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 They say it would create a safer environment while saving the city money by 
reducing the need for police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 College Park West can only be entered from the city of Long Beach, which 
borders the western edge of the nearly 30-year-old housing development. 
Residents say their 312-home community is isolated and suffers from poor city 
maintenance services and is often invaded by transients who camp out in the 
neighborhood park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Progressively, as Long Beach has gotten worse with crime, it's spilled over 
into College Park West," said resident Rosann Rosandich, a local real estate 
agent who grew up in the neighborhood. "We're the forgotten part of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosandich is passing out flyers to community members asking if they would 
support turning College Park West into a gated community. So far, she says, the 
phone calls have been running more than 3 to 1 in favor of the idea, which she 
would like to see on a city ballot. The City Council is expected to review the 
issue Oct. 10.  
</P>
<P>
 Restricting public access would not be hard, Rosandich said, because there is 
a single entry road to the community. But if public access is blocked, 
residents would have to pay for the cost of maintenance, trash collection and 
street repairs. Residents could keep city services by putting a guard at the 
neighborhood's entrance to monitor but not prohibit public access. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the route they need to think about going," Seal Beach Mayor George 
Brown said. "Otherwise, it could turn out to be quite a costly proposition."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; SEE 'DICK AND JANE' EXHIBIT AT LIBRARY

<P>
 Dick and Jane, the stars of a series of children's books introduced in 1930, 
will again take center stage this month at an exhibit at the Fullerton Public 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Story of Dick and Jane" exhibit will include books and memorabilia.The 
display is from Oct. 10 through Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Dick and Jane books, which by 1960 were being used in 85% of the 
nation's school systems and in Canada, the Philippines, Australia and New 
Zealand, were created by Zerna Sharp. The series introduced the "look-say" 
method of teaching children to read, in which words are constantly repeated 
throughout the books. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s, women's rights and civil rights groups contended that the 
books were sexist and racist. In response, a multiethnic edition was published 
in 1965, but the books were eventually phased out of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Dick and Jane collectors, however, eagerly seek the books, library 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The free exhibit may be viewed from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays through 
Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Fridays and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays at the 
library, 353 W. Commonwealth Ave. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FILIPINOS TO CELEBRATE A CENTURIES-OLD 
FESTIVAL

<P>
 Filipino Americans in Orange County will celebrate a centuries-old festival at 
St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Laguna Hills on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong event is the first-ever observance in the county of the "La Naval" 
festival.It is sponsored by the Federation of Filipino Rosary Groups, which has 
more than 1,000 member families. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Norman F. McFarland of the Diocese of Orange will officiate an 11 a.m. 
Mass. He will be assisted by four Catholic priests from the Philippines who are 
assigned to different parishes in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Filipinos are not known for being a politically united community," event 
coordinator Mel Gallardo said. "But what binds us together are our religious 
beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippines, the only predominantly Christian country in Asia, is about 
80% Catholic. "La Naval" is celebrated in many rural towns with boat parades 
and religious processions to mark the defeat of a Dutch naval force that tried 
to invade the country in the 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 A combined force of Spanish and Filipino soldiers turned back the Dutch, who 
briefly occupied Manila. The Philippines was a colony of Spain from the 1500s 
until 1898, when an American fleet routed a Spanish armada at Manila Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippines became a U.S. colony, was then occupied by the Japanese for 
three years during World War II and became independent in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 Filipinos are expected at Saturday's event, which will feature 
Filipino folk dances and songs by Los Angeles and Orange county cultural 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Nicholas Catholic Church is at 24252 El Toro Road in Laguna Hills. For 
more information, call (714) 837-1090. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; HIRED FIRM TO DEFEND CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city attorney's office is looking for a few good law firms with experience 
defending local campaign ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently decided to find an outside attorney to fight a 
lawsuit challenging the city's campaign reform ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed Aug. 2 in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, contends that 
the city's campaign law restricts freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson said hiring an expert in the field of campaign 
law would be in the city's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just such an important case," she said. "The people are very tired of 
these large special interest groups dumping large sums of money into Huntington 
Beach council races to get their candidates elected." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit challenges the city's $300 limit on individual campaign 
contributions to any political committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Grindle, an advocate for campaign reform who succeeded in getting the 
county to pass a campaign reform law, said she supports the city hiring an 
outside attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Grindle said the case affects other Orange County cities that have similar 
campaign reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this section (challenged by the lawsuit) is dropped out of the ordinance, 
it will create a loophole big enough to drive a Mack truck through," Grindle 
said. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; FIELDS DEDICATED TO BASEBALL LEGEND

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fields at Portola Park, where the late Jesse Flores spent years developing 
baseball programs for local youths and adults, have been named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 The area where the park's three baseball fields are located will now be known 
as the Jesse Flores Sports Complex.The designation was approved by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, a former major league pitcher and renowned baseball scout who lived in 
the city from 1923 until his death in 1991, began playing sandlot baseball when 
he was a child at what is now Portola Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who moved to La Habra from Mexico with his family when he was 8, 
became the first Mexican American pitcher in the major leagues in 1942. He 
played for the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Athletics and the Cleveland Indians 
and spent the last 30 years of his life scouting for the Minnesota Twins and 
Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends praised Flores' efforts to teach youngsters how to play baseball. He 
also organized and managed a semipro baseball team, the La Habra Tigers. He 
supplied the baseballs and bats for that team and spent Sunday mornings 
watering and preparing a field at Portola Park for afternoon games. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to honor Flores because "of what he did for the kids and 
the community," Councilman Steven C. Cheverton said. "He was a great person 
known throughout the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores' nephew, Richard Flores, said his uncle "was a very good, humble man 
who never bragged about his career and was always there for the kids and always 
wanted to help people." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and a group of residents are hoping to raise $7,000 to get two 
plaques installed by February at the park on Euclid Street.MIMI KO

<P>
 Ricoh Electronics has received the city's first business environmental award 
for the company's emphasis on recycling and on conserving water and 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli presented the award at a City Council meeting last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards program is designed to increase corporate interest in waste 
management and other conservation efforts, said Katie Pitcher, an 
administrative assistant with the city Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was created in response to a new state law that requires cities 
and counties to cut their landfill use 25% by next summer. A 50% reduction in 
landfill use must be achieved by the year 2000. If these goals are not met, 
cities and counties will face fines of up to $10,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Business environmental awards will be presented each quarter and focus 
alternately on the themes of reduce, reuse and recycle. A fourth award will be 
announced around the time of Earth Day for the best comprehensive approach to 
waste management. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsoring the program are the city of Tustin and its contracted waste hauler, 
Great Western Reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the program, call the city Public Works Department at 
(714) 573-3173. The next award will highlight reuse activities. ALAN EYERLY

<P>
 Constructing a futuristic-looking Technology Center on former pasture land 
once used for agricultural studies has a symbolic dimension that has not been 
lost on Orange Coast College President David A. Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a recent grand opening ceremony for the $9.6-million center, Grant 
noted that "the sheep and the goats, the piglets and alfalfa" are all gone now, 
reduced to memories of a "slower, more innocent era" when the 46-year-old 
college was in its formative period. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of learning about haying machines and egg farming, students are 
exploring the fields of robotics, computer-aided drafting, electronics, machine 
technology, aviation and space. They also query professors by e-mail and log 
onto the information superhighway via Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in courses have been accompanied by changes in student profiles at the 
community college. Technology Division Dean Ernest W. Maurer said that night 
classes "are our bread and butter now" because most students already have 
degrees and are seeking to enhance their job skills or prepare for new careers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Technology Center itself, Maurer said the 78,000-square-foot 
facility was constructed with high-tech materials in order to be as 
"environmentally friendly" as possible. "It's really one of the most 
energy-efficient buildings in the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is the largest technology center on any community college campus 
west of the Mississippi, Maurer said. Some of the high-tech applications being 
taught, including surface-mount technology for computer circuit boards, "aren't 
being taught anywhere else in the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer added that the center, which features a glass spine that is 3 1/2 
stories tall, looks especially dramatic when lit at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just absolutely spectacular," he said. ALAN EYERLY

<P>
 After searching South County for a suitable site, a national preschool chain 
has settled on the Laguna Heights Marketplace shopping center for a potential 
child day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has already run into some opposition, though, as a handful of nearby 
residents have complained to the city's Planning Commission about possible 
increases in noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is a narrow lot behind the PayLess drugstore on Sweet Meadows Drive, 
just off Street of the Golden Lantern. 
</P>
<P>
 "The availability of sites in Orange County is limited because most (potential 
sites) are in planned communities where they often don't leave enough room for 
playground areas," said George Rendon, who handles Southern California 
franchising for Florida-based Tutor Time preschools. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other Tutor Time preschool in Orange County is in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A preschool in the southeastern part of the city is badly needed, Rendon said 
in citing a study that showed there were several thousand children under the 
age of 5 within three miles of the proposed Laguna Niguel site. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor Time hopes to build a 7,881-square-foot day-care center with two outdoor 
playgrounds that could serve 150 children. 
</P>
<P>
 At an earlier hearing, planning commissioners said the safety of the children 
as they are being dropped off and picked up is a primary concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Preschool traffic would use the same driveways used by large trucks making 
deliveries to the PayLess and Lucky stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rendon said he does not expect safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trucks that size are no different from the yellow buses that deliver children 
to schools, so we don't see them as any greater danger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will discuss the proposal again at its Oct. 11 meeting. LYNN

CITY OFFICIAL'S ROOMMATE DIES IN APPARENT SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office on Sunday identified the victim of an 
apparent suicide as Harry Lytle, 55, who shot himself Saturday at the Eagle 
Rock home he shared with Los Angeles Police Commissioner Art Mattox. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Lytle appeared to have died from a gunshot wound to the 
head.Autopsy results, however, will not be available until today. A gun was 
recovered near Lytle's body, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattox, 38, one of five civilians who sets policy for the Los Angeles Police 
Department, called police about 11 a.m. Saturday to report that his roommate 
had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although everything indicated that the death was a suicide, Chief Willie L. 
Williams directed that the department's Robbery-Homicide Division handle the 
investigation, because the case is considered high-profile.

ROSEMEAD PAIR HELD ON PANDERING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four Thai women smuggled into the United States expecting to work at factory 
jobs instead were forced into prostitution by a Rosemead couple to earn $35,000 
to cover the fee for their passage, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tai Pham, 23, and his wife, Suphonphan Woods, 29, were arrested by Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies on suspicion of pandering after a search warrant was 
served on a four-bedroom house where the women were allegedly kept at 
gunpoint.The pair were being held without bail and could face additional 
federal and state charges, sheriff's spokeswoman Diane Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, who are between 22 and 26, had their passports confiscated by their 
captors and were held at the Rosemead home, which was "completely locked up 
with guards," Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, who were reportedly in good condition, were no longer at the house 
Sunday and neighbors seemed unaware of the activities alleged to have occurred 
there. Sheriff's officials and representatives of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service said they did not know where the women, who were in the 
country illegally, were staying. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not in custody," said sheriff's spokesman Angie McLaughlin. "They 
are being taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe five other women were brought over in the same manner 
and either paid off their captors or escaped, Hecht said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; FEDERAL SMOKING BAN CLOUDS SCHOOL BINGO

 Irvine High School bingo boosters will plead with school board members Tuesday 
night to help save twice-weekly bingo games that raise between $15,000 and 
$30,000 a year for the school's music programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents say new federal laws, which will outlaw smoking at public school 
buildings by the end of the year, will also drive away most bingo players. 
</P>
<P>
 The bingo games at Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate School raise nearly $50,000 
a year for music programs and equipment at the Irvine Unified School District's 
three high schools. But the U.S. Department of Education's Goals 2000 program 
bans smoking in public schools, libraries and buildings used for child care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to somehow come up with a solution," said school board President Mike 
Regele, "because the schools are going to lose some serious money." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials say they are looking for a low-cost space to 
relocate the games. But high school boosters fear the cost will cut too deeply 
into profits.

 Most of the nearly 200 bingo players attracted to the games on Wednesday and 
Saturday nights are smokers, bingo operators said.

 It seems like movies without popcorn, Regele said. "Smoking is virtually a 
prerequisite for bingo players," he said. "It's just part of their whole social

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; NEW CITY HALL BUILDING TURNED OVER TO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ralph B. Clark building has officially become property of the city, paving 
the way for conversion of the three-story structure to a new City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony last week, officials with the Orange County Transportation 
Authority turned over the building to city officials after signing the final 
escrow papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the building at 11222 Acacia Parkway last December for $1.2 
million. The city paid an additional $129,000 to LPA, an Irvine-based 
architectural company, to remodel the building, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Michael Fenderson said the city expects to move into the 
building by next April. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenderson said the current City Hall, at 11391 Acacia Parkway, a former 
elementary school built in 1924, needs extensive repairs. It would cost the 
city $1.7 million to repair the aging City Hall, about $500,000 more than the 
cost of buying the Ralph B. Clark building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once vacated, the old City Hall will be torn down and part of the vacant space 
will be used for parking, Fenderson said. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 The nonprofit organizations that enjoy low rents at the city's soon-to-be 
closed Multiservice Center can be accommodated at an alternative location, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The city wants to sell the building, located off Jamboree Road, that once 
housed City Hall and the Police Department to cut annual losses of $65,000 and 
to avoid paying $500,000 for needed earthquake retrofitting and 
air-conditioning repair. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been concern that not enough space would be available for the 
tenants at the city's Operations Support Facility on Sand Canyon Road, where 
the groups were to be relocated. But 10 of the 29 Multiservice Center tenants 
have made plans to move to other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week agreed to offer leased space at the new location 
for 30 cents per square foot and grant the tenants 90 days free rent to help 
defer moving costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members might offer special consideration to Irvine Temporary Housing, 
a nonprofit organization that provides housing, counseling, food and clothing 
for homeless families in the city for up to six months. The organization 
currently pays 6 cents per square foot at the Multiservice Center. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 11, the council will again discuss relocation of Multiservice Center 
tenants. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY SEEKS GREATER 'SPHERES OF INFLUENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bid to extend Newport Beach's "sphere of influence" may become part of the 
city's effort to preserve an agreement with the county that limits the number 
and type of flights leaving from John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is preparing proposals about the airport and three other 
unincorporated areas for review by the Orange County Local Agency Formation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A sphere of influence, often a precursor to annexation, is used for 
unincorporated areas that receive services from the city. The city also 
controls land uses within its sphere. LAFCO requires that cities do periodic 
reviews of their spheres of influence.  
</P>
<P>
 "If John Wayne Airport ever goes into a city, it would be appropriate to go 
into Newport Beach. It was time for us to ask for that and to plan for that 
with a sphere of influence review," said Evelyn Hart, a councilwoman and LAFCO 
board member.  
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Advance Planning Manager Patricia Temple, however, warned the 
council that the property owner -- the county -- probably would veto an 
annexation attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The other areas under consideration are: 
</P>
<P>
 * The swath of Irvine Avenue between Newport Beach and Costa Mesa, including 
the potential Bay Knolls annexation area. The area is in Costa Mesa's sphere of 
influence now, but residents have expressed interest in incorporation into 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Newport Ridge area between Newport Beach and Irvine, near the Coyote 
Canyon Landfill site.  
</P>
<P>
 * The Laguna Greenbelt area between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach. Most of 
the area is part of Crystal Cove state park. Temple has recommended against 
including this area. HOLLY J. WAGNER

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO PLANNERS OK 1ST PHASE OF SPORTS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has approved the first phase of a $3.8-million city 
sports park. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, which includes a community center, a swimming pool and fields 
for baseball, softball and soccer, will be built next to Marco Forster Middle 
School, near Camino del Avion and Del Obispo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being funded by a 1990 local bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners had only a few concerns last week when reviewing proposed zoning 
changes and other permits to allow construction of the ball fields, bleachers, 
snack bar, a roadway and parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they were worried that the planned roadway through the sports park 
might be used as a shortcut by motorists. The roadway will have a speed limit 
of 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 But city staff assured the commission that the road would be gently winding 
and not attractive as a shortcut for cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The roadway straddles a proposed site for an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The sports park, when finished, will end a long wait by residents who approved 
bonds for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the community center and swimming pool are to be considered later by 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get moving on the project," said commission member Wyatt Hart. 
"It's been four years. It's been long enough." JEFF BEAN

O.C. ENTERPRISE: GAUGING CONSUMERS' TASTES; FIRM CONDUCTS SURVEYS TO TRACK 
DINERS' CHANGING HABITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Numbers roll off Bob Sandelman's tongue faster than he can flip through his 
latest stack of statistics on what Americans think of fast-food and pizza 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 About 96% of those living in metropolitan areas go to such eateries at least 
once a month, he says. Altogether, they average 12 trips a month for breakfast, 
lunch, dinner or snacks. That means that nearly everybody, he says, is getting 
food from McDonald's or Domino's or some other chain every two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have no time for something so basic as eating," Sandelman said. "With 
dual-income households, people are going out to purchase ready-to-eat meals, 
and the need for speed and convenience is paramount." 
</P>
<P>
 Operating out of his Brea home, Sandelman has built a growing business that 
helps the chains, as well as sit-down family and casual restaurants, monitor 
and cater to the ever-changing tastes of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandelman & Associates tracks consumers' opinions of more than 120 national 
and regional fast-food chains in 49 metropolitan markets nationwide, finding 
out how aware patrons are of a chain and its products and how often they stop 
at each chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's consumer research is highly valued, clients say, because it 
targets specific metropolitan areas, polls a large sample of customers and 
costs less than other, less-focused surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Sandelman has become somewhat of a guru, opining for the 
national media on what people eat, where they go and with whom. Just 10 days 
ago, for instance, he was quoted by USA Today about the pending merger of the 
Arby's roast beef chain and Long John Silver's seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 He also studies related issues that affect the fast-food and pizza business. 
Last spring, for instance, he found through an extensive survey that 60% of the 
nation's fast-food patrons favored a no-smoking policy at fast-food 
restaurants, while only 22% opposed such a ban. The rest of the 6,230 people 
polled in 31 major U.S. markets had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a smaller poll involving casual-dining chains in the Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and Sacramento markets, even more patrons -- 73% -- favored a 
no-smoking policy in the dining area, and a surprising 45% wanted a ban on 
smoking in the bar areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Those surveys came at a time when a few fast-food chains, notably McDonald's 
and Taco Bell, said they would institute smoking bans in company-owned stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "His research gives you a pulse on what's happening locally," said Tom 
Amberger, marketing director for Wienerschnitzel Corp. in Newport Beach. "It 
gives some top-flight information quickly, and we appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Wienerschnitzel hired Sandelman to do a private survey for 
the company, which wanted to gauge the effectiveness of its new advertising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's biggest hot dog chain poked fun at itself with self-mocking ads, 
even referring to itself as "Chez Weenie." Billboards across Southern 
California showed jumbo chili dogs next to such headlines as "The culinary 
equivalent of mud wrestling" and "It's cheap. It's messy. Hey, you are what you 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandelman polled consumers both before the campaign was launched and after it 
was over. The results, Amberger said, showed that the ads made consumers more 
aware of Wienerschnitzel and that awareness translated into higher sales for 
the privately held company. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say they watch their health and they exercise," Sandelman said. "But 
when they eat out, they consider it a treat. They eat salads at home and then 
go have fatty burgers at a Wendy's or McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 With a master's degree in business administration, the 49-year-old Sandelman 
has worked at such nationally known companies as conglomerate Procter & Gamble 
and advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. But the demise of another ad agency 
left him without work in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs in senior management then were not easy to find," he said. While looking 
for work, he also took stock of his abilities and his desire to strike out on 
his own in an area that would be fun. He liked the food industry, and he 
figured he was good with details and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The food industry is so competitive," he said. "There are new ad campaigns 
every few months, new menus. It's always changing. I found that exciting." The 
constant changes also meant that fast-food chains, especially, needed a 
continuing stream of information about consumer reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The chains had lost their only inexpensive research tool when a company that 
had been selling local survey results gave up that line of work. In 1988, 
Sandelman stepped in and, with advice from Bob Wisely, then a marketing 
executive for hamburger chain Carl's Jr., launched his fast-track study of 
consumer awareness, usage and attitudes regarding fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 By focusing on a local market and selling the results to the chains or their 
franchisees in that market, Sandelman is able to offer his quarterly reports at 
a low cost. For a year's subscription, he now charges up to $12,000, the amount 
most researchers would charge for just one report that provides similar 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 For an additional fee, Sandelman adds specific questions in any survey that 
particular clients might want. He retains Verity Group in Fullerton to make the 
calls to restaurant patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also started regular consumer surveys on family-style restaurant chains 
like Sizzler and Souplantation and on casual-dining chains like Red Lobster and 
the Olive Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six years, Sandelman & Associates has grown steadily and 
profitably. The company projects revenue of $1 million for this year, Sandelman 
said. Two years ago, his wife, Bev, quit her job helping Carl's Jr. develop 
branch sites to join the company. Then JoAnn Aprati was hired to help with 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to kick the kids out," Bev Sandelman joked about the couple's two 
grown children, "so we could use their bedrooms for offices." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the company incorporated and hired Jeffrey T. Davis to open an 
office in Dallas, where he works to add more markets to the surveys and more 
restaurant chain owners and franchisees to the client list. 
</P>
<P>
 That such an operation would become successful hardly surprises Wisely, now a 
Carl's Jr. franchisee in Santa Rosa. Wisely used to work on such surveys before 
joining the Carl's chain, and he was impressed with Sandelman and his approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very bright guy," Wisely said, "and he has become very knowledgeable 
about the business." O.C. ENTERPRISE / Sandelman & Associates

Times Fast-Food Findings 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-food and pizza industry uses Sandelman & Associates to research such 
topics as who eats at its restaurants and how often. The Brea company provided 
these examples of its recent findings for metropolitan Los Angeles and Orange 
County: 
</P>
<P>
 * Most transactions: In terms of monthly transactions, the top five chains are 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, Carl's Jr., Burger King and Jack in the Box. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best overall ratings: Top five chains in terms of overall ratings by 
customers are In-N-Out Burger, El Pollo Loco, Round Table Pizza, Pizza Hut and 
Subway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Favorite foods: Hamburgers account for 26% of main meals eaten, followed by 
pizza at 22%. Chicken accounts for 17%, higher than the 14% figure nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * When people eat: Lunch is the most popular time for fast food, accounting 
for 51% of all purchases, compared to 44% nationally. Dinner: 36% in greater 
Los Angeles, 40% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frequency: The average fast-food patron nationwide goes to chains 12 times a 
month for food. In greater Los Angeles-Orange County, 34% of the patrons are 
"heavy users," making 24 trips a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Average meal cost: $3.57, with the lowest fare, $2.96, at breakfast and the 
highest, $3.79, at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat in or carry out: 27% of the meals are eaten at the restaurant; 45% are 
drive-through purchases; 23% are carry-out sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ethnicity: Latinos are more likely to patronize chicken and pizza chains and 
more likely to eat in the restaurants. They also bring along their children 
more often -- 43% compared to 24% for the general population.

 You probably shouldn't know about Monica Moore's research. 
</P>
<P>
 You think you want to know, but really you don't. If you did, you'd be too 
self-conscious to do what comes naturally. For while the rest of us fumble 
through life clutching our hearts and throats, this woman observes us and 
simply knows. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost 20 years, Moore, an experimental psychologist, has been studying 
flirting. In fact, she has spent a career turning an immensely subtle art into 
science. Which is a little like reducing Mona Lisa's smile into a neurological 
tic. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a professor at St. Louis' Webster University, and her teams of graduate 
students spent hundreds of hours in bars and student centers covertly watching 
women and men court, and painstakingly recording every smile and laugh.  
</P>
<P>
 After feeding all the data into a computer, Moore came up with a catalogue of 
52 gestures women use to signal their interest in men. Think of it as L.L. 
Bean's Love Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of those studies congressmen like to rail against when it involves 
a federal grant. But Moore, the Jane Goodall of human courtship, is quite 
serious about her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "People see flirting as so frivolous," she says. "But I'd argue that to know 
about all this is very important because it helps explain human relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Charles Darwin, Moore began with the premise that women make the initial 
choice of a mate. And from there the courtship process begins. Western cultures 
wrongly assume men control the process, she says, because they focus on the far 
more obvious second stage of courtship: The approach. But Moore contends it all 
begins when girl eyes boy -- and smiles or smoothes her skirt or licks her 
lips. And study after study showed that how attractive a woman is is less 
important than her flirting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "So she gets the first turn, then he gets a turn. Each time one signals the 
other they are reaffirming their choice. Either one can opt out at any time 
along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Moore's studies decode the obvious. The only surprise is that such 
excruciatingly erotic behavior can sound so boring. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to her description of "neck presentation": 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman tilted her head sideways to an angle of approximately 45 degrees. 
This resulted in the ear almost touching the ipsilateral shoulder, thereby 
exposing the opposite side of the neck. Occasionally the woman stroked the 
exposed neck area with her fingers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moore isn't writing for True Romance. Rather, she publishes in such 
scintillating academic journals as Semiotica and Ethology and Sociobiology. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of her study on gestures, which included observing 200 women 
over two years, is the list. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract a man, women most often smile, glance, primp, laugh, giggle, toss 
their heads, flip their hair and whisper. Sometimes they hike their skirts, pat 
a buttock, hug, request a dance, touch a knee and caress.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore's description of one of the most frequent signals -- "solitary dancing" 
-- would make anyone who has ever been in a singles bar squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 "While seated or standing, the woman moved her body in time to the music. A 
typical male response was to request a dance." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there is something risky about Moore's work and she knows it. And so 
after one of her students came back from spring break boasting that it took 12 
minutes of signaling to get a man to her side at an airport bar -- and then she 
ignored him -- Moore instituted an ethics policy for her graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want them to misuse their knowledge," Moore says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore began her research in flirting in the late 1970s when she herself was a 
graduate student in search of a dissertation topic. Her adviser suggested she 
pick something fun, and all she could think was: "Food, sex, food, sex, food, 
sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Moore heard an anthropologist lecture about biological theories of human 
female choice, which started Moore wondering how women made decisions about who 
they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore interviewed 100 women asking what it was about the men they were seeing 
that made them sexy. But interviewing techniques presented too many problems, 
so she decided she had to make objective observations of women making choices. 
In other words, she wasn't as interested in when Harry met Sally as what Sally 
was doing with her hands at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to make a list," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore doesn't have a similar list of men's gestures. All she knows is that men 
send out undirected signals of power and attractiveness by puffing up their 
chests or checking their watch or smoothing their ties. "But they don't do what 
women do," she says. "Once a woman looks around the room, she settles on one or 
two men and starts sending out the signals." 
</P>
<P>
 It's amazing how intricate her research is. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in a bar her teams of graduate students -- always one man and one woman 
because couples are rarely noticed when there are singles around -- would 
randomly select a female subject. Then one member of the team would talk into a 
small tape recorder and keep track of her every movement. The other member of 
the team would keep track of all the responses made by men. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few years Moore hopes to use her catalogue to find out more about 
women's choices and she wants to explore whether flirting drops off after 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so, but it will be fascinating to find out," says Moore, who is 
41 and married with a child. 
</P>
<P>
 She says there are only six other academics that she knows of in the world who 
have done human courtship studies. Most are sexologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I presented my work at meetings of psychologists, I was always in a 
room packed with voyeurs," she says. "I had no one to talk to until I found the 
Society for the Scientific Study of Sex."

PORTRAITS FROM AN UNSEEN HAITI; MARIE-YOLANDE SAINT-FLEUR RISKED DEATH TO 
PHOTOGRAPH LIFE IN HER HOMELAND, DRIVEN BY PASSION FOR HER WORK AND A SENSE OF 
HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before the glare of international media lights found Haiti, 
photojournalist Marie-Yolande Saint-Fleur was gathering its quotidian realities 
through her lens. 
</P>
<P>
 She put her life at risk to capture moments of the carnage playing out in city 
streets. But Saint-Fleur's greater contribution to history may be her pictures 
of everyday life, eight years' worth, that fill the gaps left by outsiders 
drawn more by flash than substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tontons Macoutes and attaches tailed her, threatened her and shot at her, but 
she kept her commitment to a simple purpose: Photograph everything. Relying on 
her knack for theatrics, she stayed at least one pace ahead of her persecutors 
while recording images of everything from voodoo rituals to presidential 
inaugurations and even, she says, "things as simple as a rock." 
</P>
<P>
 For following her passion, for risking torture or death, Saint-Fleur will 
receive the fifth annual International Women's Media Foundation Courage in 
Journalism Award on Tuesday in New York. The other recipients are Christiane 
Amanpour, a foreign correspondent for the Cable News Network, and Razia Bhatti, 
an editor for Pakistan's Newsline magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Saint-Fleur) had nothing going for her at the time that she was putting 
herself on the line, doing what she felt she had to do," says Kathy Bushkin, 
foundation co-chair and editorial manager for U.S. News & World Report. 
</P>
<P>
 While many journalists working in Haiti enjoy a measure of protection through 
ties to a large news organization or a foreign government, Saint-Fleur had 
none. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the committee had considered giving the award to another Haitian 
journalist, Edwige Balutansky. But, in a stirring letter, she asked that the 
organization pass her up in favor of Saint-Fleur. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been through very difficult times, and I felt she deserved it more 
than I did," says the former Reuters correspondent, explaining that her light 
skin and influential friends made her less vulnerable to military hounding. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Miami, Saint-Fleur, 31, speaks via a telephone conference call that 
includes a translator. A lifetime of speaking Creole gives her syllables a 
twang often found in the villages of southern France. 
</P>
<P>
 Strapped for cash, Saint-Fleur has been staying with friends since arriving as 
a refugee six months ago. She is accustomed to the itinerant lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months of beginning her first photography course in 1986, she embarked 
on a career that would force her into hiding. "I, like so many other 
journalists, could not sleep at home," she wrote in her unsuccessful 1993 
application to the United States for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother Joseph had enrolled her in a Port-au-Prince photography school, 
believing the art form would match his sister's temperament. She always had the 
ability to reach people, touch them through theater, music, art, poetry and 
dance, he explains in a telephone interview from France. "She has the sense of 
human contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, in Haiti, one takes opportunity as it comes, he says, and he knew the 
school director. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint-Fleur quickly abandoned her other interests. Within a year, her 
matter-of-fact pictures of Haitians outside the school walls drew the attention 
of an international literacy group that hired her to photograph Haiti's poor 
for its promotional and educational materials. Free-lance work for newspapers 
followed. So did the threats and warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1987, after completing school, Saint-Fleur rented a room 
outside Petionville, a town near Port-au-Prince. One day, a doctor surprised 
her with a warning: Be careful. When she asked why, he responded with a Haitian 
proverb: "If I give you water, I should not have to show you how to take a 
bath." 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti was then in the hands of Gen. Henri Namphy's military regime. Fearing 
populist reprisal, the attaches -- civilian thugs used as instruments of terror 
by the military -- tended to target public figures, including journalists, 
after dark, Saint-Fleur says. She stopped sleeping at home, finding safety in 
the homes of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 election of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide introduced a brief 
period of relative freedom and safety. Saint-Fleur and five others formed the 
Agence Haitienne d'Images, a collective dedicated to filling the void in 
Haiti's visual history and providing an archive for writers, journalists and 
scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 They would pinpoint a spot in the tiny country, roughly the size of Vermont, 
then drop in for a photo mission. Saint-Fleur focused particularly on children. 
In Haiti, where three-quarters of the more than 6 million people go hungry, 
many parents abandon their children to lives of exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the hard work is basically dropped on the children," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her photographs depict young girls scavenging water from shallow puddles or 
lugging large buckets across the countryside and a boy washing a shiny car with 
sewer water. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint-Fleur wanted "to show how the children are living, to have a record on 
file." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, her work spiraled toward the unstable vortex of Haitian politics. 
After Aristide's election, men accused of being attaches or zinglindos -- 
bandits who beat and rape women and children -- filled the prisons, she says. 
Saint-Fleur took their pictures, many of which were published in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The coup d'etat that displaced Aristide on Sept. 30, 1991, brought the release 
of those Saint-Fleur had photographed, many of them members of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 They came after her, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After a member of Agence Haitienne d'Images was found trussed in the sack in 
which he had been beaten and shot, the group disbanded. While some of 
Saint-Fleur's colleagues tried to leave the country, she stayed on, moving 
constantly for two years among hide-outs, from churches to the houses of 
friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 She drew upon her education in theater to evade her pursuers. Once, she 
dressed in robes, masquerading as a nun as she walked out of town. "I used the 
theater to transform dangerous scenes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, an attache caught her focusing a camera on him. He put a gun to 
her head. Just then, another photographer stepped in. Pointing out the size 
disparity between his large telephoto lens and Saint-Fleur's small one, he told 
the gunman that she simply was not equipped to photograph a military man. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint-Fleur played along, asking the attache : "Why would I want to take a 
photo of you?" Ego deflated, he let her go, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph had no idea whether his sister was alive until last November, when he 
heard she had fled to the Dominican Republic after the United States rejected 
her first asylum bid. Then, in March, she finally called from Florida. A human 
rights group had helped her plead her case. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint-Fleur remains cautious. The attaches might have friends in Florida, she 
says. "I don't let myself sleep in situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she refuses to live in fear because it "troubles the spirit," she says. 
"A bad situation today will change tomorrow. If you let the problem dominate 
your mind, you may as well quit." 
</P>
<P>
 And she is not about to quit. She keeps busy with English classes and a 
word-processing course until she can return to Haiti. Saint-Fleur will go back, 
she says, only "if we can win the moment we had when Aristide was president." 
</P>
<P>
 After years as an independent journalist, she is suspicious of the packaged 
news coming from her homeland, from reporters who come and go. And as someone 
who has meticulously documented Haiti's inner workings, she knows that history 
cannot always be served up by a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what happens in the street. But the great decisions, those don't 
happen where we

COMMITMENTS: RECOGNIZING MR. RIGHT -- AND HANGING ONTO HIM; RELATIONSHIPS: GOOD

 Joyce Brothers points out that a man is not a room -- he cannot be redecorated 
-- while Ruth Westheimer advises you to keep your past to yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers and Westheimer are among the mental-health experts writer Neil 
Chesanow asked about love and relationships in an article in the current issue 
of Cosmopolitan. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a sampling of what they have to say about meeting Mr. Right, getting 
married, fighting and forming an enduring partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wishful thinking is the enemy of real romance," says psychologist Judith 
Sills, adding that reality is the most romantic thing of all. "Romance means 
seeing him as he is and loving him anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Bruce Hamstra warns against being a prisoner of your past, 
saying: "Learn to recognize self-destructive patterns that set you up for 
romantic failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Brothers warns against trying to redecorate your man and advises 
asking yourself two questions: Can you live with his faults for a lifetime? And 
would you rather be with him than anyone else in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 "If the answer is no, cancel those wedding plans immediately," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great sex isn't enough -- you must share goals," says psychologist Mada 
Hapworth, who believes that it's great to be different, but without similar 
goals, "life together will be one continuous battle." 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to marriage, be able to take it or leave it," advises 
psychologist Harriet Goldhor Lerner. "Have a life plan that neither requires 
nor excludes marriage and make sure you're not just one husband or lover away 
from a welfare check." 
</P>
<P>
 In a section on fighting, therapist Westheimer has this advice: 
</P>
<P>
 "Some secrets should be kept secret. Your past life? Leave it in the past. To 
reveal everything about yourself, all your innermost thoughts, is to give your 
partner permission to use those things against you the next time you have an 
argument." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Wayne Dyer has a gentler thought, saying: "When your choice is to 
be right or to be kind, always be kind." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein, psychotherapist Bonnie Maslin says, "Say you're sorry even 
when you'd rather not. Giving love to your partner even though he's hurt or 
angered you takes maturity. Acknowledge that he might also have bruised 
feelings. Take a step toward him, put your arm around his shoulder -- even if 
that's the last thing you feel like doing. Such small gestures are what 
ultimately make a relationship work." 
</P>
<P>
 To have an enduring relationship, psychologist Nathaniel Branden says, you 
must realize romantic love is for grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love is not for children or grown-ups who, on a deep subconscious level, 
still think of themselves as children," he says. "Romantic love often dies 
because the two people involved are simply not mature enough to nurture and 
sustain it. When there's conflict, and you're having trouble communicating with 
your partner, concentrate on how much you love him. Don't disengage and let 
childish fear, anger or hurt sabotage the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 "What really scores big with men? Overlooking their mistakes," says 
psychologist John Gray, who adds: "Also, go out of your way to acknowledge 
thoughtful things he does for you -- thereby ensuring he'll do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrist Bill Hapworth advises that partners should not compete with each 
other, adding: "If you compete with the person you love -- I earn more money, 
I'm a better parent -- you're needlessly creating friction. Relationships are 
meant to provide mutual support -- competition derails love."

 They were the couple you always caught the latest movie with, or perhaps you 
helped each other on moving day. 
</P>
<P>
 Your weekends were spent at each other's back-yard barbecues, or your kids 
were on the same soccer team. You took occasional vacations together. Maybe you 
asked them to be your child's godparents. 
</P>
<P>
 You knew they had disagreements, but all couples do. Then one day they drop 
the bomb: Their marriage is breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
 As their world crumbles, your future with this couple has abruptly changed 
forever.

 You feel awkward and upset. You don't know who to believe. You try not to take 
sides. When friends divorce, their closest allies not only deal with their own 
sadness, but must avoid becoming a casualty by staying in the marital DMZ. 
</P>
<P>
 Barb Collins of Corona said she felt shocked and hurt when the couple she and 
husband Bill least expected to break up suddenly did. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed like the ideal couple," she said. "It's not as if they owe you 
anything, but when you invest yourself in a friendship you end up feeling 
somewhat betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
 The wife, who initiated the divorce, did not stay in touch with the Collinses. 
Bill Collins said he found himself siding with the husband, who felt failure 
and embarrassment over the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed like a couple that belonged together," Barb Collins said. "It was 
very hard to accept that they weren't together anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "People change tremendously and marriages can't always accommodate individual 
changes," said Marlene Schoen, a Beverly Hills psychologist specializing in 
relationship issues. "Divorce may occur because couples are unable to make 
changes in their lives to support personal growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoen thinks it's important for friends to put their own needs aside and to 
look at what the divorcing couple's needs might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Both couples will experience the divorce as a loss, said psychologist Peter 
Fisk, a family and marriage specialist practicing in the San Fernando Valley, 
and author of the book "Give and Take With Eb and Flo: Adventures in a Marital 
Relationship" (Fithian Press, 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 "As with any loss, there will be grief, depression and sadness. Assuming that 
your relationship with each person in the couple was equal, your friendship 
with them as individuals should not disintegrate. Tell yourself, 'I'm losing 
the couple, but I'm not losing the people,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoen and Fisk agree close friends can and should be honest about their 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be an uncomfortable process. Explain that you would like to 
stay friends with both of them," Schoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to say, 'How can I help? How can we remain friends on your terms for 
right now?' Ask them how you can make it easier," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends will see some psychological deterioration in the divorcing 
individuals, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to be compassionate and understanding. Let them know that what 
they say is in the strictest confidence and try not to get drawn into the 
negativism. Mix the realities with positive statements. Let them know divorce 
doesn't mean the end of life," he said. "Also be realistic about how much you 
are willing to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia and Carl of Burbank found themselves so embroiled in the tumultuous 
personal life of their friends that when those friends finally split up, Marcia 
and Carl were completely burned out and declined to get involved in the 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Define the boundaries of your friendship and let them know when they are 
putting you on the spot," Fisk said. "You'll be much more of a friend by 
bringing them out of the doldrums rather than allowing them to constantly focus 
on the negative aspects of the break-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Staying friends with both parties puts you in a delicate situation. Fisk finds 
the natural inclination for each person in the divorce is to look for allies 
among their existing friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to be viewed as the good guy," said Al Brill of Sylmar, 
married to Alice for 10 years. Both are previously divorced. "I would never 
recommend choosing sides. It's important to support them individually, while 
staying neutral on their situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you start taking sides it will only create more conflict," Schoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that it is important not to make a judgment about who was right and 
who was wrong in the relationship. Both parties are hurt and will see things 
very differently, Schoen said. Friends should accept each individual's 
perception of their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't know what goes on behind other people's closed doors," Brill 
said. "If you're in a good marriage it's either difficult or impossible to 
understand being in a bad marriage. When you're in a bad marriage you can't 
imagine what it's like to be in a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting enough advice already," said Richard Sherer of Redondo Beach, 
who is twice divorced. "If you attempt to advise them, there's a great 
opportunity to hurt your friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherer finds that being a good listener is the best gift you can give a friend 
who is divorcing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People going through a divorce ask a great deal of their friends, because 
they are so self-involved," said Mary of Calabasas, who recently divorced after 
20 years of marriage. She kept friends on the phone for long periods of time 
listening to her trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really don't want to hear about them. All you want to do is talk about 
yourself," she said. "When it's all over, whatever friends you have left should 
be treated like gold because they have been through so much." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that maintaining friendships after a divorce isn't always 
possible. Much depends on how the friendship evolved in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary lost touch with the friends she made during her marriage, but many were 
wives of her husband's business associates. She was no longer being invited to 
any of the social events that revolved around being a couple. As she adjusted 
to the single life, her circle of friends changed. She found herself regaining 
some of her old friends who had fallen away during the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many divorcing couples will let their mutual friends go, regardless of how 
persistent and supportive they seem to be. Fisk himself reacted this way when 
he divorced 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I saw our old friends I was reminded of my ex-wife and the pain 
associated with the relationship, so I let them go. I recently got in contact 
with an old friend who had tried in vain to maintain our friendship. He told me 
he couldn't understand why I had pushed him away," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Being cut off can mean a couple of things. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the divorcing person finds seeing you as hurtful or perceives you as 
attacking or unsupportive, they may choose to let the friendship go," Schoen 
said. "The person could also be saying that they need some time and space to 
move on in their life. People may need to disassociate themselves. Friends 
should put aside their own needs and agendas."

RSVP; GOURMET DINNER PARTIES FOR ART'S SAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 L os Angeles achieved new sta tus as a party town as 46 "Art of the Palate" 
dinners were given around the city Thursday and Friday to benefit the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The evenings provided a range from a casual back-yard barbecue to an intimate 
black-tie dinner in a penthouse to a lively soiree at the "Psycho" mansion at 
Universal Studios.  
</P>
<P>
 About 1,100 people took part as LACMA's 11 support councils worked together to 
raise more than $200,000; money that will allow the museum to open again on 
Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 So what were party-goers up to over the two nights? A sampling on Thursday 
included a progressive "Dinner on the Riviera" in Pacific Palisades, where 
Tally and William Mingst (he's the president of the museum's board of trustees) 
hosted cocktails for 24 people in the back yard of their ranch-style home. 
Guests, including Architectural Digest editor Paige Rense (she was also the 
event's honorary adviser) and dinner chairwoman Jann McCord and husband Bill, 
dined on smoked salmon while taking in the Mingst's extensive Inuit art 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave one of these kinds of dinners once," Rense said, "and I didn't know 
anyone who was there. But it ended up being wonderful." After cocktails it was 
a short walk across the street for an Italian-themed dinner hosted by Beverly 
and Herb Gelfand, collectors of turn-of-the-century American art. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the Playboy mansion in Holmby Hills, 20 guests were getting a 
tour of Hugh and Kimberley Hefner's zoo and aviary, plus the infamous grotto. 
(Mr. and Mrs. Hef were unable to make the event.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner was served outdoors by the pool on Jackson Pollock-esque splatter-print 
tablecloths. Even the food looked like art -- white salmon or tournedos of veal 
with colorful vegetables and a dessert of poached pears and white chocolate 
mint ice cream that looked like a Chagall. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rosenzweig, Playboy's executive vice president, and his wife Judy 
Henning were the hosts. Billed as "special guest" was artist Billy Al Bengston, 
resplendent in a leopard-print jacket. Jazz guitarist Phil Upchurch provided 
the entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday evening, apricot and soft cream roses, amid place-settings of antique 
gold and white china, decorated three circular tables, reflecting the elegance 
of Dona and Dwight Kendall's new Bel-Air home, where they hosted their "Tres 
Elegante" for 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't originally going to do the menu in French, but somehow French fries 
didn't sound as elegant as frites a la Joachim , " said Dona Kendall.  
</P>
<P>
 The party guests were greeted with glasses of Dom Perignon 1975, selected 
table seating numbers from a silver bowl and, to make sure everyone really 
mingled, the women were asked to change seats for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were Anjelica Huston and her husband Robert Graham, Alana and 
Michael Jackson, who are admirers and collectors of Graham's work, and Maggie 
and Earl Russell, who said they'd chosen this particular party so they could 
see the new house. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the home of Mumsey and Allan Nemiross, the art treasures include a 
clock once presented to Napoleon, part of his extensive collection of time 
pieces, which are on display amusingly juxtaposed with his contemporary art 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumsey Nemiross gave her guests a tour of her house where "everything is art," 
including the bed designed by Laddie John Dill. 
</P>
<P>
 Supper, a tasty buffet of grilled meats and vegetables followed by fresh fruit 
and brownies catered by Marmalade, was eaten at tables on the tennis court. The 
75 guests, most of whom had honored the Nemiross' request to wear "Gatsby" 
white, included Mumsey's art gallery partner Alexis Deutsch with Russell 
Collins, Alexis Deutsch's father Lester Deutsch with Deborah Keener, Bill and 
Eileen Zimmerman and Esther and Rick Rosenfield.

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; SPIELBERG HONORED AT A-LIST BENEFIT EVENT

 The Scene: Saturday's dinner at the Beverly Hilton where the Chaim Weizmann 
Philanthropic Leadership Award was presented to Steven Spielberg. Dinner 
co-chairman Sid Sheinberg said, "Someday Steven might be remembered as much for 
his efforts on behalf of the welfare of society as for his movies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: A stellar crowd one wit referred to as "Shindler's A-list." 
Among the 700 were Spielberg with wife Kate Capshaw and his mother, Leah Adler; 
Lew and Edie Wasserman, Mike and Judy Ovitz, Chevy Chase, Jeffrey Katzenberg, 
Gerald Breslauer, Bruce Ramer, Alan and Judy Levine, Jonathan Dolgen, Courtney 
Sale Ross and Thomas Keneally, who wrote "Shindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: More than $1 million was raised for Israel's Weizmann Institute 
of Science. "They do research for humankind," said dinner co-chairman Michael 
Forman. "Everything from solar energy to cancer to multiple sclerosis to 
increasing food production." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How So Much Money Is Raised: "Threats of bodily harm are helpful," said 
Katzenberg, also a dinner co-chairman. One studio exec said: "Half the people 
want to be here; the other half are afraid not to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Spielberg talked about being back in the limelight after last season's 
"Shindler's List" attention: "On the one hand, it feels like, enough of me 
already. This year it's 'Forrest Gump.' Let's move on to Bob Zemeckis' life. On 
the other hand, I continue to feel honored by the recognition and the amount of 
philanthropy generated by an event like this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: Very black tie. Michael Richards mentioned that in his 
pre-"Seinfeld" days, he'd rent a tux. Now major designers want him to be seen 
in their clothes so, "they send them to me for free. Now I've got four tuxedos. 
I wish they'd start doing that with planes, trains and automobiles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Jewish dietary laws were observed. The main course was veal; the high 
point was the sushi bar at the cocktail reception. Rabbi Philip Schroit, who 
oversaw the food preparation, said: "'I've done many kosher dinners. This is my 
first sushi party." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Program: Emceed by Ben Kingsley (whose accent hovered somewhere between 
"Gandhi" and "Shindler's List"), the evening included a speech by Institute 
president Haim Harari and performances by Johnny Mathis and Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Best Move: An appearance by Williams could rescue any fund-raising dinner 
from well-meaning tedium. He covered subjects from politics (Dan Quayle as 
Forrest Gump saying, "Politics is like a box of chocolates -- you just have to 
buy it") to a comment a writer once made about his rambling performances ("The 
difference between my act and life is that life eventually comes to an end").

TAKING NOTES, HIGH AND LOW; O.C. PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY'S COREY ASSESSES NEEDS 
AND GOALS AFTER 14 MONTHS ON THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 How is an arts organization like a box of crackers? 
</P>
<P>
 Brand identity, says Dean Corey, the executive director of the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society: 
</P>
<P>
 "You could have the craziest box of crackers in the world, but if it's got 
that red triangle up in the corner, that tells you something about what's 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Brand identity is something he thinks the society needs more of. He'd like 
potential ticket buyers to see the group's name on an event as a guarantee of 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey, who has spent about 14 months on the job here, considers the identity 
issue his No. 1 priority for the year ahead. Identity has been a quandary for 
the society ever since the Orange County Performing Arts Center opened in 1987 
-- a quandary that also plagued Corey's predecessor, Erich Vollmer, before he 
left for a post with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The society has been around since the '50s; of all the organizations 
associated with the Performing Arts Center, it is the oldest. It presents 
touring classical orchestras and ensembles at the center and at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre; increasingly, it has broadened the center's scope by offering 
such attractions as Ireland's Chieftains and Ballet Folklorico de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But in terms of public perception, Corey explained last week, the society is 
at a disadvantage.  
</P>
<P>
 "The center has a building, the Barclay has a building, the (Pacific Symphony 
Orchestra) is on stage, Opera Pacific is on stage. We don't have that kind of 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 The very name of the organization presents problems, Corey added: It is too 
similar to "Orange County Performing Arts Center" and too limited to represent 
the range of attractions the group actually presents. A name change was 
contemplated but deemed impractical: "If we changed our name, then no one would 
know who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corey has found that the identity problem affects not only ticket sales but 
also donations and recruitment of volunteers. The society recently redesigned 
its logo, and Corey is planning other specific strategies to "get the whole 
level of awareness raised. But it's so complex." 
</P>
<P>
 Another set of problems surfaced last month when the California Arts Council 
decided to reduce the society's annual grant from $33,005 to $20,687, citing as 
one of its reasons a lack of diversity on the society board of directors. Corey 
is appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of suspected we might get called on this," he admitted. But, he 
added, "we've been working on this for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is repulsed by the idea of courting people with no previous ties to 
the society strictly on the basis of their ethnicity ("I think that's a very 
insulting thing"). He prefers making greater outreach efforts to different 
groups in the county, building relationships in a more natural manner. He also 
noted that board makeup aside, few arts groups here have presented programs 
appealing to as wide a range of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although challenges face the group, it can count numerous strides made in the 
past year. In July, it announced that it had ended its fiscal year with a 
surplus, which enabled it to wipe out 70% of an accumulated deficit of 
$114,000. The current fiscal year is proceeding strongly, Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal, he said, is for the society to be in a strong enough position 
financially to book artistically adventuresome attractions without so much 
regard to expense. 
</P>
<P>
 He has continued Vollmer's efforts to present music that falls outside the 
Western classical tradition that had been the society's focus. Such experiments 
appeared threatened during the final year of Vollmer's tenure when Performing 
Arts Center management objected to some of the "non-classical" bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the center's own new leadership, such disputes appear to be things 
of the past. Indeed, in July OCPS and center officials hailed "a new era of 
cooperation" and announced that they would jointly present two attractions in 
the coming season, Teatro de Danza Espanola (which comes to town Thursday) and 
Fiesta Navidad, a holiday-themed mariachi festival slated for Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first got here, Corey said, his relationship with center management 
"was touch-and-go" as a result of their predecessors' conflicts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Neither Tom (Tomlinson, the new center director, whose appointment was 
announced the same day as Corey's) nor I had any baggage with it, but it was 
there, and we had to go through that baggage." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, "we have great cooperation with both the Barclay and the center. 
And we're branching out more and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thoroughly love orchestras," he added. "I've spent my entire career working 
with orchestras -- but it's great to be able to do things that are not 
orchestras. . . . It's like a treasure trove of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing ethnic diversity isn't the only way that Corey and his board, which 
he is quick to credit, are shaking things up. 
</P>
<P>
 The society is experimenting with such cutting-edge programming (all at the 
Barclay) as Anonymous 4, four women who combine medieval chants and polyphony; 
the Kronos Quartet, whose repertoire ranges from classical pieces to 
compositions by Jimi Hendrix and the new wave rock group Television; and the 
London Chamber Orchestra playing minimalist music by John Adams and Philip 
Glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Booking such attractions in Orange County has been, he allows, a little dicier 
than it would be in San Diego, where Corey was director of development of the 
San Diego Symphony before coming here. "San Diego is more of a city, and you 
have more of those distinct subcultures," he said. "The alternative press and 
those things aren't really as obvious here." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, audiences are responding so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our role, really, is to expand the envelope a little bit, not just for the 
sake of doing it . . . (but) to give audiences more opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The society's coming season will be expanded not only in terms of variety but 
in the number of concerts. The 1993-94 season was curtailed because of budget 
and scheduling problems, but Corey said he hopes that was the low point and 
that seasons will continue to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was the tail end of the recession, the tail end of our 
(difficult) relationship with the center. . . . This season really marks the 
beginning of a new era." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey, 47, is married with two children, one of whom is still in high school, 
so he continues to live in San Diego and to commute to the society offices 
here. And he continues to learn about Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's so interesting is, the towns are so different. The difference 
between Newport and Laguna, between Anaheim and Fullerton, is pretty dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 He also finds himself fascinated by the number of trendy Italian restaurants, 
particularly near his office: "I think I could have buffalo mozzarella and 
basil every day for two weeks and never eat at the same place twice."  
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a coincidence, but one fraught with irony. On one day in July of 
last year, two of Orange County's most visible arts organizations -- groups 
that increasingly had been at loggerheads -- announced changes of their top 
leadership. The Performing Arts Center had hired Tom Tomlinson (story, A1); the 
Philharmonic Society was bringing in Dean Corey, who had been director of 
development of the San Diego Symphony. Tomlinson arrived in Costa Mesa on Aug. 
1 but didn't officially take the center's reins until a year ago today. Corey 
took over his post Aug. 2. In the months since, the groups have done much to 
solve their problems with each other, and the Philharmonic Society has managed 
to brighten its economic picture considerably. Still, Corey says, there are 
tasks ahead for the group, not the least of which is to build a more prominent 
public profile.

 Some Enchanted Evening: Actress Whoopi Goldberg married film industry union 
representative Lyle Trachtenberg during a weekend ceremony at her Pacific 
Palisades home. The couple exchanged vows on Saturday afternoon before 350 
guests including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Matthew Modine and Steven Spielberg. 
Goldberg met Trachtenberg last year on the set of her movie, "Corrina, 
Corrina." She broke the news of her engagement on CNN's "Larry King Live" in 
April. Videotape shot by news helicopters hovering over Goldberg's home showed 
a bride in a white gown and a groom in a tuxedo. Goldberg was previously 
married to Dutch cinematographer David Claessen.

 Wild Ride to No. 1: Universal's "The River Wild" made a big splash at the box 
office during the weekend, its first in release, with a gross of $10.5 million 
for the No. 1 spot. The opening proved Meryl Streep to be a big box-office draw 
in her first action-adventure role. Another Universal action film, "Timecop," 
starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, dropped to second place with $5.5 million. In 
third was Gramercy Pictures' "Jason's Lyric" with $4.8 million. Paramount's 
"Forrest Gump" took fourth place with $4.2 million. Rounding out the top five 
was Hollywood Pictures' "Quiz Show" with $3.4 million. A box-office note: 
Columbia's "The Shawshank Redemption" took in a respectable $600,000 on 37 
screens for a per-screen average of $16,227.

 Where Gump Sat: The bench that Tom Hanks occupied in the movie "Forrest Gump" 
is like a box of chocolates: You hate to see it disappear. The bench in 
Savannah, Ga., was removed when filming was completed and replaced by a large 
trash bin that residents call "Forrest Dumpster." But Mayor Susan Weiner said 
some residents want to get the bench back and make it a tourist attraction -- 
complete with a life-size statue of Gump and a bronze box of chocolates. The 
city has asked Paramount to donate the bench, but the plan still has to be 
approved by Savannah's City Council.

 Massacre on Film: The massacre of eight street children in front of a Rio de 
Janeiro church last year will be the subject of an upcoming movie. Daniel 
Day-Lewis has agreed to play the part of a priest while Glenn Close and Susan 
Sarandon have both been approached to portray a sociologist who worked with the 
victims, Brazil's Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper reported. Paramount reportedly 
bought the rights to a book about the massacre written by sociologist Yvonne 
Bezerra de Mello. LEGAL FILE

 Jazzy Dispute: What's in a name? About $30 million, figures Jeffrey Miree. The 
rapper claims his nom-de-tune of Jazzy Jeff was stolen by another performer who 
has reaped musical and sitcom stardom at his expense. A federal court lawsuit 
filed by Miree in New York alleges that Jeffrey Townes -- better known as the 
platinum-selling DJ Jazzy Jeff and a regular on NBC's "The Fresh Prince of Bel 
Air" -- signed a 1987 contract with a record company that already had a deal 
with Jazzy Jeff Miree. Miree claims that Zomba Recording Corp., aware of 
Miree's career and nickname, wrongly allowed the new artist to use the stage 
name. He wants $30 million for trademark infringement and damages from Townes 
and the record company. TV & VIDEO

HEFNER 'DELIGHTED' BY PLAYBOY JAZZ FILM FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An artistic success and a commercial uncertainty. That's the best description 
of last week's Playboy Jazz Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was no denying the high quality of the material in each of the 
festival's 17 screenings at the Laemmle's Sunset-5 theaters in West Hollywood. 
But the overflow audiences that arrived for the three primary evening events 
did not show up for some of the other films. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Playboy's Hugh Hefner was far from disappointed with the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just delighted with the way it worked out," he said. "It really turned 
out to be something much larger than I originally expected it to be. And the 
reaction -- especially after the opening night performance of 'One Day in 
Harlem' -- was overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner was "touched personally" by three of the films: "Bix: Ain't None of 
Them Played Like Him Yet," "Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday," and 
"Too Much Harmony" (a 1933 theatrical featuring Bing Crosby). 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something wonderful about the fact that so many other people also 
seemed to be moved by these films," he said. "And the Crosby picture, in its 
restored version, was like seeing an entirely new film." 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner, who attended all three days of the festival, was so impressed that he 
now plans to consider the restoration of more musicals -- perhaps starting with 
"New Orleans," which also was included in the screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also "taking a hard look" at the potential for further installments. 
</P>
<P>
 The original motivation for the film festival was the celebration of Playboy's 
40th anniversary. But the Playboy Jazz Festival was initially created to 
commemorate the magazine's 25th birthday, and soon became a major annual event 
at the Hollywood Bowl. The chance for a similar continuation of the Jazz Film 
Festival -- a possibility much hoped for by many attendees -- seems bright. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner also is considering packaging comparable jazz film compilations for 
tours to universities and colleges around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Film is, by definition, a more intimate medium than jazz performance," Hefner 
said. "And there is something special about experiencing the music in such a 
direct way. I think we can do that with a college tour. Because if there was 
anything that was really moving about presenting these jazz films, it was the 
opportunity to give older people the chance to remember, and younger people the 
chance to discover." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Mark Cantor, who has one of the most extensive jazz film collections 
in the world, would like to see future festivals maintain the mainstream 
orientation of this year's "Bix to Bird" framework, while diversifying with 
other jazz items, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd also like to see more peripheral programs such as jazz dance and Western 
swing," Cantor said. "We've also talked about possibly doing some kind of 
judging process for new jazz films that have been made during the previous 
year. There are so many options." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the Playboy Jazz Film Festival opened the doorway to a 
collection of jazz images largely unknown, even to the music's most avid fans. 
And there is much more available. Cantor, who regularly has produced programs 
of short jazz film clips on his own as well as for the Playboy Jazz Festivals, 
says there is sufficient material for dozens of different shows. Later this 
month, at KLON's Jazz West Celebration, for example, he will present three 
screenings encompassing Central Avenue music and a mix of Stan Kenton, Woody 
Herman and West Coast jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news for the Playboy Jazz Film Festival's enthusiastic audiences. 
An eclectic assemblage of old and young, the crowds included fans mature enough 
to have seen Charlie Parker in person, as well as listeners who might have 
seemed more appropriate for a Pearl Jam concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's success, despite its commercial shortcomings, may have been 
best illustrated by one young man who, emerging from the opening night program 
in baggy shorts and a reversed baseball cap, announced to his girlfriend, "Wow, 
that guy Lester Young, man. He is way cool."

COUNTERPUNCH: 'BASEBALL' RAN ON INTERMINABLY, ILLUSTRATING WHY PBS FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAUL HALPERT, Saul Halpert worked in TV news for more than 40 years, 
reporting on Channels 2, 4 and 7, as well as writing and producing. He also 
moderated public affairs programs. He is now a free-lance writer, consultant 
and teacher. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Burns is undoubtedly a talented filmmaker but let's face it, his 
"Baseball" miniseries on the Public Broadcasting Service was just not that 
great. Maybe that explains why it racked up all of a 5-plus rating (a 
blockbuster, sad to say for PBS) for the first five "innings" ("For PBS at 
Least, 'Baseball' Is a Hit -- but It's No 'Civil War,' " Calendar, Sept. 26). 
</P>
<P>
 A certain conceit must be blamed for Burns' determination that the program had 
to run more than 18 hours. (It's been reported that he considered it a great 
sacrifice to consign to the cutting room floor some sequences that would have 
made the running time even longer.) This kind of programming may account for 
the unfortunate fact that PBS prime-time shows draw only an average 2 rating 
and 3% of the audience. A national non-commercial broadcast service kept alive 
by the dedication of individual "viewers like you" and perennial struggles with 
Congress for federal funding plus corporate and foundation dollars ought to do 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at a modest 18-plus hours, "Baseball" was padded with endless, repetitive 
overly long sequences that were just plain boring, as in B-O-R-R-I-N-G. How 
many times in one "inning" can you look at interminable scenes of grainy, 
scratchy black-and-white old film (and that was dramatic compared to the still 
pictures of old baseball stadiums that all looked the same after the 12th 
repeat) and wonder when the plaintive music is going to stop -- "Take Me Out to 
the Ball Game" again? -- and somebody will finally say (or better yet do ) 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth "inning" comes to mind. After a fussy opening sequence -- previews 
of coming attractions, who knows what -- the show finally seemed to get down to 
business. But wait, it wasn't "Play ball!" time yet. The band began to play 
"The Star Spangled Banner" (for the n th time), sound up full -- and played and 
played all the way to the last bar, all this over more pictures of old baseball 
parks and little figures hitting or throwing the ball or running bases. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sixth inning didn't start exactly like this, it seemed that way because 
by then my recall was jumbled by watching a dozen other sequences just like it. 
Enough already! By the sixth inning we'd all heard the National Anthem before. 
Fade the music under after a few bars and get on with the story. Or is that 
sacrilege? All in all, it seemed like we were five minutes into the hour before 
the sixth finally started -- suggesting that "Baseball" could have been cut to 
12 hours without losing much. 
</P>
<P>
 The too-cutesy "inning" format dictated choppy development of the story line, 
with themes starting in one inning and going nowhere, then picking up two 
innings later, assuming that we were all religiously marking our score cards 
and taking notes. The best parts of the "game" were the insights revealed in 
the interviews -- with historians, old ball players, social commentators, 
Jackie Robinson's widow and many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly unforgettable was Red Barber, the Mississippi-born broadcaster 
for the old Brooklyn Dodgers, describing how his Southern-bred racist views 
were impacted -- and changed! -- by closely observing Robinson become the first 
black man to play major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more pointed was the brief appearance by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who 
asked why it had taken until 1947 -- more than eight decades after the Civil 
War -- for a black baseball player to at last break that color line in the 
national pastime. Indeed, why? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question -- along with many others -- that Ken Burns should have 
answered with greater economy, skill and dramatic impact. Then it might have 
drawn a bigger audience. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a question for PBS too. When John Fuller, director of PBS research, 
said, "We're thrilled" that the 5-plus ratings for "Baseball" were more than 
twice the average for public TV programming, he unwittingly revealed a larger 
problem: PBS programs generally tend to be ponderous, if not a bit pompous, 
appealing to the elitist 3% of the audience. While commercial TV overdoes the 
fast-paced glitz (witness the seven-second sound bite in news), PBS often goes 
to the opposite extreme and meanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller also said PBS did not decide that "Baseball" should run 18 1/2 hours; 
Burns did. And that's just the point. It's presumptuous to assume that the mass 
audience is going to devote the better part of two weeks' leisure time to a 
television show. And if PBS is satisfied with reaching only the elites, that's 
unfortunate.

COUNTERPUNCH: GUTS AND GLORY: WHEN DO WOMEN GET THEIR SHARE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 I took my kids to see "The Mask" in Glendale recently and I came away feeling, 
why do men get to have all the fun? Why do they have the monopoly on guts and 
glory? It didn't just begin with the movie. The first advertisement on the 
screen was about the courageous 1993 Los Angeles Raiders, oozing all their 
pride, honor, distinction, talent and team spirit. Naturally, the short piece, 
set in a sweaty post-game locker room with team balls and team spirit, was 
performed by men, directed by men, written by men and produced by men. 
</P>
<P>
 The next piece to be shown concerned a battered women's shelter in Orange 
County where women learn life skills, how to cope with their abusive, 
drug-dealing men and basically how to avoid raising their children in a station 
wagon. The dichotomy of the two pieces, L.A. Raiders and abused women, set the 
tone for the next couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The previews followed with your basic "guns and boobs" movies or young men 
finding themselves and avenging the past. The women in all the previews were 
either lovers, mothers, prostitutes or already dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came "The Mask." Jim Carrey is hilarious and the computerized special 
effects were spectacular, but how come in the movie only the men and the dog 
get to try on "the mask?" The good guy wears it, the bad guy wears it and the 
dog wears it. The women, on the other hand, stand around either waiting to be 
rescued or back-stabbing the good guy in order to save their condos. As for the 
guy thieves, the only questions I came up with were, "Why? Who cares? How many 
times have we seen this before?" 
</P>
<P>
 My kids didn't walk away outraged at the implications of either the previews 
or the film, but how long will it be before it seeps into their subconscious 
that men play football, wear wildly outrageous masks and have fun, while women 
go to homeless shelters to be saved from their gross guys by learning smart 
business skills?  
</P>
<P>
 When one of my friends and I talk movies, he dismisses anything without a male 
protagonist with a kind of megaphoned warning, "Whoaaa! Chick flick, chick 
flick." Is he the quintessential Everyman that Hollywood producers are trying 
to appeal to? 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't men and women take turns at this guts and glory thing? Why couldn't 
"The Mask" have been a woman? 
</P>
<P>
 And what about instead of using the L.A. Raiders and a homeless women's 
shelter as advertising previews, why not use a women's basketball team or the 
LPGA tour as a symbol of guts and glory, and then advertise a men's homeless 
shelter in the next trailer? 
</P>
<P>
 Why does it have to be drilled in kids that a boy will grow up to be a 
superstar athlete but a girl will grow up to be battered if she doesn't heed 
her man? Let the men go learn to type for a while, and let the women pop open 
the champagne to celebrate their own honor, distinction and victory for once. 
</P>
<P>
 Until all kinds of stories get told by all kinds of women, men, girls and 
boys, then little girls will aspire to be hot, slinky, please-save-me "smoking 
babes," hoping to avoid homeless shelters, and little boys will grow up 
thinking they own the world as long as they have a gun and can throw a 
football. It's fantastic to see television shows like "My So-Called Life" being 
made because rarely do we see such high-quality stories with a girl 
protagonist. Films should show kids that guts and glory transcend all sexes and 
girls can be heroes too.

COUNTERPUNCH: PUT 'ER' OUT OF ITS MISERY -- QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD P. WHELAN, Dr. Gerald P. Whelan is an associate professor in the 
Department of Emergency Medicine at USC School of Medicine and 
secretary-treasurer of the American Board of Emergency Medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard Rosenberg said it best in the final line of his review . . . "Left 
untreated, 'ER,' too, may have less than a year to live" (" 'ER': Call It 
General (Electrified) Hospital," Calendar, Sept. 19.) Unfortunately, only the 
good die young! 
</P>
<P>
 As a physician, I am a constant source of annoyance for anyone trying to 
simply enjoy a medical show. I have a moral obligation to point out why it just 
isn't done that way, why the diagnosis is obviously (to me) inconsistent with 
the patient's presentation, why the whole show is absurd. But watching the 
premiere of "ER," my ire reached new heights. It was not due simply to 
technical errors. Rather, it had to do with something much more disturbing and 
even malicious -- namely, the dangerous, erroneous and demeaning depiction of 
emergency medical care that was foisted on an unsuspecting American public. 
</P>
<P>
 The "ER," allegedly Chicago's Cook County, was staffed by an assortment of 
unsupervised resident physicians. The "director" dropped in thrice, once to say 
hi, once in a tuxedo to tell the resident he was responsible for the morale of 
the unit in the midst of a profound (or profoundly contrived) crisis and, 
finally, to save the day -- at which time he revealed his true identity as a 
surgeon (in the OR, not the ER).  
</P>
<P>
 Medical students were cut loose on unsuspecting patients to perform procedures 
in which they had neither instruction nor practice. Babies trying to deliver 
had their little heads pushed back in (not a good thing!) and patients with 
significant neurological symptoms were advised to come back if they recurred to 
save the cost of a consultant. And through it all, there was neither hide nor 
hair of a single attending physician! 
</P>
<P>
 In a perverse way, I might actually thank the alleged Dr. Crichton for 
portraying what emergency medical care in this country probably would be like, 
had not some very visionary physicians 25 years ago realized that staffing ERs, 
where the sickest and most severely injured patients arrive, with unsupervised 
residents and medical students was inviting disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Emergency Medicine is a recognized medical specialty with more than 
100 residency training programs at major training hospitals across the country, 
including Cook County. Residents train for up to four years to manage the whole 
gamut of medical, surgical and pediatric patients. They work, by regulation, no 
more than 12-hour shifts with two days off per week; not, as "ER" would have 
it, "36 on and 12 off, 52 weeks a year." That was long ago recognized as being 
dangerous for everyone, especially patients. Medical students come to learn, 
but are allowed only what is appropriate to their level and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, all care is supervised 24 hours a day by a physically present, 
qualified attending physician, usually certified by the American Board of 
Emergency Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV problem, of course, is that this scenario is nowhere near as "dramatic" 
as the life-and-death crises of the poor, struggling residents in "ER," clearly 
in over their heads with no one to turn to and having to just tough it out . . 
. regardless of the effect on patients or anyone else.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger problem, though, is that the American public is being presented 
with a picture of emergency medical care that is 20 years outdated. It is a 
picture that can and should frighten people and make them avoid a visit to an 
ER at any cost! This is dangerous and a disservice to the public, and all in 
the name of not-so-high drama.  
</P>
<P>
 It is also an affront to the tens of thousands of dedicated doctors, nurses 
and other staff in ERs across the country who work night and day to provide 
emergency care that is competent, caring and real. They are too busy for the 
soapbox world of "General Hospital" . . . and they are too good for the 
ludicrous world of "ER." 
</P>
<P>
 One solution, consistent with the premiere episode's general level of the 
pseudo-dramatic at any cost, would be to have a guest appearance featuring the 
renowned Dr. Kevorkian. He could then painlessly put "ER" out of its misery. A 
year is a long time to make us all suffer needlessly.

 This latest crisis, however, has him scared. He has never before battled the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three miles from his Camarillo orange grove, trappers found two fertile 
female Medflies late last week. Inspectors are out there now, prodding and 
picking and poking as they search for more of the fruit-gobbling insects. Gerry 
wants to know what they find. Needs to know. Dreads to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tightness in my stomach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Joy, feels shaky too. Her unease began Friday afternoon, when she 
learned that Medflies had made their first known foray into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started crying as soon as I heard," she said. "When you hear the word 
'Medfly,' you know that means trouble with a capital T." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, inspectors have uncovered just two Medflies, both fertile, freshly 
mated females found drowned in a glass-bottle trap dangling from the branch of 
a squat fig tree. But experts warn that for every Medfly captured, another 
thousand usually flit nearby, burrowing into sweet ripe fruit and laying wave 
upon wave of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 And although intensive weekend trapping yielded no new Medflies, officials are 
poised to slap a quarantine on all produce grown within a 4 1/2-mile radius of 
the original find. A spokesman at the Cooperative Medfly Project, a joint state 
and federal task force in charge of battling the bug, said he expects an 
announcement within days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry's 93-acre grove -- speckled with ripe yellow lemons -- falls within the 
likely quarantine zone. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarantine would force him at his own expense to spray malathion, a potent 
pesticide, on any fruit shipped out of his orchards. He normally harvests up to 
15% of his lemons from early October to Christmas. And the price of malathion 
spraying could render that crop worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 If the lemons cost too much to treat, he'll have to let them wither on the 
trees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't work on large margins," he explained, strolling through his orchard 
as his puppy, Phantom, yapped at passing shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the worst of it -- not by far. 
</P>
<P>
 If authorities confirm a massive Medfly invasion in Ventura County, the entire 
agriculture industry could suffer for a lot longer than any quarantine might 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese have long threatened to ban the import of all California produce 
if the Medfly plague spreads beyond the Los Angeles Basin. Proof of Medfly 
migration north to Ventura County could trigger a boycott. And since nearly 
one-third of Gerry's lemons are sold to Japan through the Sunkist cooperative . 
. . he does not like to think about the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot could happen in the worst-case scenario," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his quarter-century on the farm, Gerry has endured many bad spells. 
</P>
<P>
 He's survived droughts and flooding rains, wells that run dry, trees that 
don't blossom and many, many, hungry pests. 
</P>
<P>
 But those were disasters he could see and study. He could take action. With 
the Medfly, his enemy is elusive, his battle plan uncertain. State and federal 
officials have taken over the investigation and will direct any eradication 
efforts. He must wait for them to make decisions that could sink him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a much more intense crisis because it's so out of our control," Gerry 
said. "In a frost, I can turn on my wind machines, run my water. That may not 
do anything, but at least I'm trying, and that makes me feel better. With this, 
I don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 He does know, however, that he wants the Medflies out of Ventura County. Even 
if he has to sacrifice some of his crop to intensive pesticide spraying, even 
aerial spraying, he wants the agricultural community to take decisive, 
aggressive action. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pest must not be here," he said simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, fighting the Medfly full-tilt could require aerial spraying of 
malathion bait, a sticky mixture of poison and corn syrup. In other counties, 
the mere mention of pesticide-spewing helicopters has sparked furious community 
protest and threats of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleading for cooperation and understanding, Gerry said, "I really hope this 
would not end up in court. All this antagonism really bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if neighbors and politicians permit spraying, however, the Medfly problem 
might persist. Medflies breed so quickly that spraying rarely zaps them all. 
Because they feast on 200 different crops, renegades are hard to track down. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry suspects the two Medflies found in Camarillo hitchhiked to Ventura 
County in a sack of fruit transported from the Los Angeles Basin, where a 
quarantine covers 1,500 square miles. He knows that such transgressions can 
occur again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing goes beyond all barriers and moves so fast," Gerry said. "Stopping 
them must be a community effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Deena Gerry, Will's mother, insists on optimism. "This is a wonderful way of 
life and we're not going to quit," she said. Gerry agrees readily. But 
nervously. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to being here," he said. "We like the lifestyle. We just hope 
it's not taken away from us."

CLOUDS, FOG KEEP SOME AVIATION ACTS ON GROUND; AIR SHOW: WEATHER AND MISSING 
FAVORITES COMBINE TO KEEP ATTENDANCE THE LOWEST IN RECENT YEARS. BUT FOR MANY 
BRAVING THE DRIZZLE, THE POINT MUGU EVENT PROVES A BIG HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 First came the scheduling problems that prevented Point Mugu Air Show 
officials from booking big-name aerial acts such as the Blue Angels for this 
year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after a low turnout Saturday, came the clouds and foggy weather that 
knocked some acts out of Sunday's air show and forced others to play it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination had the effect of a one-two punch on the weekend show's 
attendance, which registered the lowest in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the loss Sunday of some of the most spectacular aerial tricks, 
many of those who braved the drizzle and dreary skies said the show was well 
worth the trip to the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station south of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought today's show was great," said Mo Hasan, 28, of Oxnard. "When I 
heard they were going to fly the Harrier, I knew I had to come out," he said of 
the attack jet that thrilled onlookers with its vertical takeoffs and landings. 
"The teams (such as the Blue Angels) are OK, but nothing beats that Harrier -- 
it's so cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a big military flight demonstration at first disappointed Phil 
Whitman, 41, of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out thinking the Blue Angels were flying today," Whitman said. "But 
even without them, the other acts have been a lot of fun to watch. I'm a 
student pilot, so I can really appreciate the skills they have." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said about 86,000 people watched this year's two-day show, with 
about 45,000 turning out Sunday. The weekend drew far fewer than the 200,000 
who attended last year's program, which featured the Blue Angels and and the 
Canadian Air Force's Snowbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's low clouds and foggy weather sent Navy air show producers scrambling 
to reschedule acts -- canceling some altogether for safety reasons and 
abbreviating others. 
</P>
<P>
 A demonstration by the Air Force's F-16 Fighting Falcon, a single-seat 
supersonic fighter known for its ability to climb vertically while 
accelerating, was canceled because of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Another act, in which a parachutist with the all-female Misty Blues Parachute 
Team was scheduled to jump at high altitude with a large American flag 
unfurling behind her, was also canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 And Point Mugu's F-14 Tomcat and F/A-18 Hornet fighters had to curtail their 
high-altitude loops, figure-eights and other aerobatics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sleek and ear-piercing loud jets simulated dogfights, bombing and 
strafing runs at lower altitudes, said Cmdr. Robert E. Noziglia, a Point Mugu 
air show official. 
</P>
<P>
 "Military aircraft, because of their performance capabilities, have to have a 
lot of sky to operate safely," Noziglia said. "The civilian acts have much more 
generous rules under which they can fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Several civilian aerobatic acts helped fill the gap by dazzling spectators 
with twists, turns, dives and loops -- but even those pilots had to hold back 
on some of their best tricks due to the thick marine layer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the same restrictions as my military colleagues do," said Steve 
Stavarakis, who pilots the aerobatic stunt plane named Wild Thing. "But if I 
can't see the fans when I'm up there, I know they can't see me -- there's no 
point to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the fans interested between aerial acts was a ground-based performance 
by Smoke-N-Thunder -- a jet engine-powered dragster that won races with stunt 
planes along the base's main runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimistic event organizers had hoped the Sunday morning clouds would clear as 
they did Saturday. Instead, they shuffled acts and hoped the crowds would 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say?" Navy spokesman Alan Alpers said. "Our meteorologists are 
good but they're not perfect. I think people who came out had a good time. I 
think we still pulled a good show out of our hat."

MAN KILLED AMID FLURRY OF SUSPECTED GANG ACTIVITY; CRIME: A MAN IS FATALLY SHOT 
IN VENTURA, ANOTHER IS WOUNDED IN OXNARD. A THIRD IS A VICTIM OF CARJACKING. 
</P>

<P>
 One man was fatally shot in Ventura, another was wounded in a drive-by 
shooting in Oxnard and a third was a victim of a carjacking in what police 
described Sunday as a weekend marked by gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the incidents of violence were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jose Guadalupe Gutierrez, 37, was killed Saturday evening in Ventura's 
Cabrillo Village when a single small-caliber bullet pierced his heart. Ventura 
police officials said he was an apparent innocent victim of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark Douglas Erickson of Thousand Oaks had his pickup truck carjacked early 
Sunday morning after being confronted by about 15 suspected gang members at an 
Oxnard gas station. Police said he was yanked from his car at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruben Romero, 18, of Oxnard, was shot in the chest about 2 a.m. Sunday in 
the front yard of his home. Police said Romero told them that gang slogans were 
yelled from a passing car before several shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the three incidents came when Gutierrez was chatting with a 
friend about 9:30 p.m. Saturday outside a small, aging building on Cinco De 
Mayo Street in Cabrillo Village, where he had earlier finished leading an 
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting before heading home. 
</P>
<P>
 Area residents reported hearing several shots ring out, and police said the 
bullets were fired from railroad tracks that lie just outside the small 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they believe more than one suspect was involved, but no 
one has been identified. Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Velez said he suspects the 
shooting may have been gang-related, although it is not known for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of gang shootings in this area," Velez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was unemployed and received disability for an injury he suffered 
while working at a packing house, according to his brother-in-law Felipe 
Sepulveda. He was the father of four children: two daughters, ages 17 and 5, 
and two sons, 18 and 16, Sepulveda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting has left the children without either parent. A few years ago, 
their mother died of cancer, Sepulveda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda said gunfire is a weekly commonplace in Cabrillo Village, which was 
originally built years ago to house Latino farm laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other gangs come over here and they just start shooting. They don't care who 
it is. They just shoot into the buildings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe Gutierrez was a random victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no indication this gentleman had any hostilities dealing with 
anybody that we can focus on," said Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Anderson, who is 
leading the investigation. "He was in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 The second gunshot victim, Romero, suffered a single wound to the right side 
of his chest. He was transported to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where 
he underwent surgery and remained in serious condition late Sunday, a hospital 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacking of Erickson's pickup truck took place about 15 minutes before 
the shooting of Romero, when Erickson told officers he stopped to fill up at a 
Mobil gas station at 1st Street and Rose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling into the station, Erickson reported seeing about 15 suspected gang 
members standing on the corner. One member from the group approached him and 
flashed a handgun, Erickson told police. Still in his vehicle, Erickson 
attempted to drive away, but several from the group attacked him, yanked him 
from his vehicle and sped off. Oxnard police said no suspects were immediately 
arrested and an investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 In another carjacking Sunday morning, Oxnard police said Michael Keefe, 28, of 
Denver, was leaving Champ's Bar on Victoria Avenue when an unidentified man 
asked him for a ride home to Oxnard Shores. Keefe consented, and said the man 
then threatened to shoot him if he did not give him his car. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol later found the vehicle unoccupied near Del 
Norte Boulevard just south of the Ventura Freeway. Keefe did not suffer any 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just one busy night," Oxnard Cmdr. Jamie Skeeters said. "I hope this 
isn't any indication of an increase in these types of crimes," he said.

STREET SMART: HIGHWAY'S RUTS WILL BE FIXED WITH SKID-RESISTANT FILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months a potentially dangerous situation has developed on California 
126 just west of the Los Angeles County line. After the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
repairs were made to the roadway that included adding a new layer of asphalt. 
With the hot summer weather, the asphalt softened and is now full of deep ruts 
made by the weight of passing cars and trucks. The roadway has also become very 
slick, and I fear that as the rainy season begins, this could become a volatile 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Potter, Santa Paula 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is aware of the softening asphalt problem. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with it in the short term, Caltrans is planning to fill the ruts 
within the next several weeks, says traffic engineer Luu Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 To eliminate the slickness of the roadway, Caltrans will use a coarse fill to 
help increase friction, Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the long term, all of the asphalt will be torn out and the roadway 
widened, as part of an ongoing project to overhaul the highway from Fillmore to 
the county line. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 This letter is in response to an item in the Street Smart column on Sept. 19 
regarding Westlake Boulevard and Bridgegate Street in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant traffic engineer Jeff Knowles determined that there isn't enough 
traffic coming from Bridgegate to warrant a four-way stop or traffic signal 
where that street intersects with Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Knowles, you missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem isn't the number of cars; it's the number of people who need to 
cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 We in the Foxmoor Cove subdivision have children who need to cross Westlake to 
get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 I encourage you to interview our brave crossing guard, Virginia, who can't get 
the cars to stop so she can help our children cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, there is no crossing guard on duty to help the kids coming home 
from the junior high school in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, my walking partner and I made it halfway across the intersection 
only to watch cars zoom by; not only do cars not stop, but they also travel at 
a dangerously high rate of speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Knowles, when a pedestrian gets hit at that intersection, it will not be a 
broken arm or leg, it will be a fatality! 
</P>
<P>
 I encourage you to reconsider your decision regarding that intersection. Make 
the pedestrian crosswalk a safe place to cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise M. Landenberger, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You are not alone in admonishing Jeff Knowles and the Thousand Oaks traffic 
department for the decision not to install a traffic signal or four-way stop 
sign at the Bridgegate-Westlake intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowles says he has received several calls and letters from unhappy residents 
in the past week, as has Street Smart. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the same standards by which all intersections are judged, however, the 
city stands fast in its assertion that neither stop signs nor a signal are 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked the residents to point out anything that would make this 
intersection unusual so we could consider making an exception," Knowles says. 
"But there really isn't anything out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowles suggests that residents insistent on getting signs or a signal at the 
intersection contact Caltrans, which shares responsibility for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm puzzled by a mysterious message posted on a sign near Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 For quite a while, the Moorpark city limit sign on the west end of town (on 
eastbound California 118) has had the following statement added to the bottom 
in tiny letters: "10,000,000 low cuts checked -0- found." 
</P>
<P>
 Do you have any idea what this could possibly mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Why hasn't Caltrans painted over or removed this additional sentence? 
</P>
<P>
 David S. Weinstein, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is as stumped about the sign as you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the world of transportation engineering is rife with rituals and 
vocabulary incomprehensible to the uninitiated, there is no such practice as 
"checking low cuts," says traffic engineer Luu Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a confusing message that means nothing to us," Nguyen says. "We believe 
this was the work of a prankster." 
</P>
<P>
 The message has been removed.

SHERIFF'S OUTREACH OVERCOMES A LANGUAGE BARRIER; LAW ENFORCEMENT: UNDER THE 
YEAR-OLD ADELANTE PROGRAM, DEPUTIES RE-EDUCATE LATINO IMMIGRANTS WHO SOMETIMES 
CLING TO VALUES THAT CLASH WITH U.S. CUSTOMS. STUDENTS WELCOME THE INFORMATION.

<P>
 Two paddle fans buzz in the muggy Moorpark chapel as sheriff's Deputy Albert 
Miramontes waves a new T-shirt overhead, waiting for someone to tell him about 
the bicycle helmet law. 
</P>
<P>
 When a man explains the law correctly in Spanish, Miramontes rewards him with 
a broad smile and the shirt, the latter emblazoned with the green-lettered word 
ADELANTE, meaning, "Forward!" 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Adelante program, a year-old experiment in cross-cultural outreach 
from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department to the county's tightknit, 
Spanish-speaking communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Every six weeks or so, Miramontes, 28, and Sgt. Jerry Hernandez, 31, test 
their flawed Spanish on about 30 Latino Moorpark residents in a freewheeling 
hybrid of town gathering, quiz show and infomercial. 
</P>
<P>
 As the deputies hand out prizes and try to make friends, a few more of 
Moorpark's Spanish-speaking residents learn about the law -- and come to 
realize that these are not the corrupt or violent cops they may have known back 
in Mexico or Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a totally different mind-set" than found among many of Moorpark's 
non-Latino residents, Hernandez said later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that comes to their mind when they see a cop is he's corrupt 
and very unprofessional and very cruel and in some places sadistic," he said. 
"The government, to them, is not the good guys." 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, Deputy Luis De Anda and a coterie of volunteers hold similar 
monthly meetings to spread Adelante's message. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday, they gave out Adelante T-shirts and children's bicycle 
helmets at St. Mary Magdalen Church while quizzing their Latino audience about 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message we're trying to get out is accepted quite well," De Anda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, De Anda said, he finds himself re-educating new Americans who 
cling to values that clash with laws in the United States. Seat belts and sober 
driving, for instance, are not nearly as important in some Central American 
countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their upbringing is, 'When it's my turn to die, it's my turn to die,' " De 
Anda said. "We tell them, 'You can prevent part of this. If you're involved in 
an accident and you're holding an infant in your arms without a seat belt, . . 
. this is what's going to happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then, to drive home the point, De Anda said he shows them a graphic video of 
unbelted crash-test dummies smashing into dashboards and windshields. 
</P>
<P>
 Language is one of the hardest barriers to cross in educating Latino 
communities about American law, he said. So, from time to time, De Anda is host 
on Latino radio talk shows, fielding questions about drunk driving and traffic 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them that the American police . . . have a job to do, and the letter 
of the law has been written to be enforced, and that's what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, one of Adelante's most important goals is acclimating Latino 
residents to the notion that police are there to help, not harass, Hernandez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Adelante gathering last week, Miramontes lectured in Spanish and 
answered questions on topics ranging from drunk driving to disturbing the 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The appreciative crowd was mostly new to Adelante. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone next door is partying or washing clothes at 2 a.m., Miramontes 
urged, "Call us! You're supposed to call the police. That's disturbing the 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he joked, "But don't call me if the cockroaches are bothering you 
crawling around the ceiling." He cocked his finger and mimed blasting the 
offending bugs, adding, "I'll just come and shoot them, bam bam bam bam!" 
</P>
<P>
 While laughter filled the tiny chapel, some newcomers sat back and said 
nothing, watching quietly while their children romped in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sergio and Araceli Granados sat bolt upright and smiling in the front row 
with their three children, eagerly tossing out answers to Miramontes' queries. 
</P>
<P>
 This was their fourth meeting, Araceli Granados, 27, explained later. 
</P>
<P>
 One correct answer won them an Adelante sports bottle. Another earned their 
year-old daughter, Janet, a car seat -- a real boon since they got ticketed in 
Oxnard last month for driving without one, Araceli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen more child seats, purchased with money from the $4,000 California 
Highway Patrol grant that funds Adelante, were given out at the meeting and 
later at the Moorpark sheriff's station to needy Latino families identified by 
Catholic Charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Granados, a 32-year-old handyman, said later of the Adelante meetings, 
"They have a lot of information about traffic and the laws, much information 
that we need. This helps us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 After giving away another car seat, Miramontes swiftly shifted gears: "If your 
car gets stopped by the police, you need to produce three things. What are 
they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Someone in the back answered, "License, insurance and registration," parroting 
a lecture Miramontes gave earlier -- and winning an Adelante T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a bicycle is in your yard, it's a bicycle, but when it's in the street, 
it's a vehicle," Miramontes continued, barely breaking stride. "Which side of 
the street do you ride on?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The right!" shouted someone, winning a sports bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramontes lectured about laws forbidding passengers in open pickup truck beds 
without seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 And he warned them about piling too many people into pickup trucks with camper 
shells, recalling the 14 homicide counts filed against a pickup driver whose 14 
passengers died in a crash near Barstow this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, Miramontes finished by inviting the group to cluster around a 
table where he and Hernandez had spread Adelante stickers, pens, refrigerator 
magnets and pamphlets atop a bright Mexican blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping recent Latino immigrants assimilate into their new culture so they 
respect California laws is one of Adelante's chief goals, Miramontes said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their homelands, Latinos often don't complain to police about minor 
offenses because, if they commit a similar infraction, they hope for lenient 
treatment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them, 'Hey, you guys have got to call the police,' " he said. "And I 
say, 'Hey, if you're out there doing something bad, I'll come after you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez added, "What we talk about is telling them to learn English. And we 
encourage the kids not to lose their Spanish because it's a beautiful language 
and it's part of their heritage. And living in California, it's definitely an 
advantage. . . . But they're responsible, we think, to learn the language." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he said, some families see Adelante as a boost to their attempts to 
assimilate quickly into U. S. culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's marvelous," said Manuel Ocampo Mayor, a 25-year-old construction 
worker who was at the meeting with his wife, Maria, 25, and their two young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its name means a lot," said Maria, and she rolled the word off her tongue 
with a smile: "Adelante."

MEDFLY EXPERTS DISCUSS LIKELY BOUNDARIES OF QUARANTINE; AGRICULTURE: OFFICIAL 
SAYS SHIPMENT RESTRICTIONS PROBABLY WILL BE IN PLACE WITHIN DAYS. ZONE WOULD 
INITIALLY COVER THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FARMLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State and federal Medfly experts conferred Sunday afternoon to set the 
boundaries of a probable quarantine, which would restrict shipment of fruit 
grown within several miles of the site in Camarillo where two fertile flies 
were found last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very good possibility of an agricultural quarantine going in 
place" within days, said Douglas L. Hendrix, a spokesman for the Cooperative 
Medfly Project, a state and federal task force. "There will probably be one." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, such quarantines extend in a 4 1/2-mile radius from "ground zero" 
-- the site of the original Medfly find. Because Ventura County's first 
Mediterranean fruit flies were found near an agricultural greenbelt, the most 
likely quarantine zone in Ventura County would initially cover thousands of 
acres of farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of growers, from back-yard gardeners with a half-dozen avocado trees 
to commercial ranchers with vast strawberry fields, could be affected. They 
would need to spray crops with pesticide at their own expense before 
transporting any fruit outside the quarantine zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our nightmare," citrus grower John Grether said. "This is what we have 
been dreading for such a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cooperative Medfly Project is composed of experts from the California 
Department of Food and Agriculture and the U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
Together, they will draw the quarantine boundaries and make all decisions on 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in the Los Angeles area, the group includes entomologists, trappers and 
field workers, who travel from crisis to crisis seeking to control the 
fruit-gobbling insects. In Ventura County, they have consulted with local 
agricultural representatives, including a group of growers who have established 
their own Medfly task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine's precise scope depends on how many Medflies, with their 
voracious appetites and rapid-fire reproductive systems, stumble into 
entomologists' traps over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors found at least two suspicious larvae Sunday, and sent them to a lab 
in Sacramento. Because Medfly maggots are so small and formless -- just white, 
fingernail-sized blobs -- it's nearly impossible to identify them by sight. 
Positive identification will take a day or two, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If no more Medflies turn up near the gnarled fig tree on the well-groomed 
campus of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, the quarantine could end relatively 
quickly, Hendrix said. But if the troublesome insects have invaded Ventura 
County in force, the quarantine could drag on indefinitely. A serious 
infestation could also prompt officials to consider aerial spraying of 
malathion, a potent pesticide that zaps adult Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, officials will not speculate on the likelihood of spraying, 
or even the duration of a quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials cannot make any decisions until they know how many Medflies might 
have burrowed into sweet oranges, and how many maggots might be uncurling 
inside oily avocados. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to assess the situation," Hendrix said. "We need to see if 
there are any other flies out there, and our trapping program will be a good 
barometer." 
</P>
<P>
 That trapping program continued intensely Sunday as a team of 20 state and 
federal inspectors picked through the fruit grove that stretches across rolling 
hills outside St. John's Seminary. More than 60 workers had converged on the 
site Saturday, hanging traps and spraying a small area with a sticky mixture of 
malathion poison and corn syrup bait. 
</P>
<P>
 To the rich tones of a church choir and the huffy squawks of displaced birds, 
the inspectors trudged slowly past orange, peach, apricot and fig trees Sunday, 
hunting for the squirming specks that could devastate the county's agricultural 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 One team crouched in the dirt for hours slicing oranges into thin slivers. 
Sticky juice running down their latex gloves, they cautiously prodded each 
segment of orange to rustle up any nesting maggots. 
</P>
<P>
 Entomologists in Sacramento will examine the specimens, looking for telltale 
Medfly traits: brown-and-clear stripes on the adult and smooth white surfaces 
on the larvae. 
</P>
<P>
 While his co-workers cut oranges, project assistant Joseph Hendrickson set and 
checked traps. Yellow boards of sticky paper hung from some trees, baited with 
an arousing perfume designed to attract male Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 His morning rounds proved fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrickson started at ground zero -- the rambling fig tree with broad, 
star-shaped leaves and plump green fruits where the first Medflies were found 
late Thursday. New traps yielded nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 A few paces away, he found nothing again. Down the hill -- again, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was not surprised to draw blanks. After five years with the Medfly 
Project, Hendrickson knows his prey can be evasive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we catch one," Hendrickson said, "how many are there that we don't catch?"

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; WOMAN'S CONDITION CRITICAL AFTER CRASH 
</P>

<P>
 A Ventura woman was in critical condition Sunday after suffering severe head 
injuries when her car careened off California 33 in front of the Villanova 
Preparatory School in Ojai, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosalie Elizabeth Rivas, 27, was driving southbound on California 33 about 
9:45 p.m. Saturday when she lost control of her vehicle and slammed through the 
rail outside the private school, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car struck a tree just off the roadway, and the top portion of the vehicle 
was sheared off, causing severe head injuries to Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
 The car came to rest upside down on the front lawn of the campus, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-car accident was discovered by a passerby who alerted officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivas was transported to Ojai Valley Hospital for immediate treatment, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was stabilized at the Ojai hospital and transferred to Ventura County 
Medical Center in Ventura, where hospital officials listed her condition Sunday 
as critical. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; A REMINDER OF THEIR HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Troy Yoshimoto clapped for the Japanese dancers, and his eyes sparkled during 
the sword play exhibition. But the 4-year-old Camarillo boy waited all 
afternoon Sunday for one thing: the karate demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the (Mighty Morphin Power) Rangers do it," he said of the television 
cartoon heroes' penchant for the ancient martial art. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy, his 6-year-old brother, Shane, and their parents, Don and Gayle 
Yoshimoto, were among more than 300 people who crowded the Poinsettia Pavilion 
in Ventura on Sunday for the fourth annual event known as "Celebrating Our 
Heritage: A Festival of Japanese Cultural Arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Ventura County chapter of the Japanese American Citizens 
League, the festival included performances by Japanese dancers, traditional 
drummers and costumed swordsmen, and demonstrations of ancient Japanese arts 
and crafts like brush-painting, paper folding known as origami and cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being of Japanese heritage, I felt my sons should see the Japanese culture 
and not let it be forgotten," said Don Yoshimoto, a data processor from 
Camarillo. "I'm a third-generation American, so I wanted them to see what the 
Japanese heritage is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so Americanized," added the boys' mother, Gayle Yoshimoto. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival featured displays of Bonsai plants, origami and Japanese dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearby area, members of the league prepared miso soup and sushi, which 
was served to festival guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Stocker, a native of Germany who is studying Japanese at Oxnard College, 
said he traveled through Japan as a younger man and wanted to check out the 
cultural demonstrations at the Poinsettia Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to go back sometime, so it doesn't hurt to study the language," said 
Stocker, a Navy flight test engineer who lives in Port Hueneme. "The food's 
delicious too." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard dentist Tsujio Kato, president of the Ventura County chapter of the 
Japanese American association, said it is important for all Ventura County 
residents to know about the contributions Japanese Americans make to society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're learning about our culture as much as other people," he said. "We're 
getting to the third, fourth and fifth generations, so unless you go to a 
Japanese school, you lose contact with the culture." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MOTORCYCLIST KILLED IN CRASH IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities on Sunday identified the motorcyclist who was killed in a weekend 
head-on collision as Danny Lee Becker, 40, of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker was killed instantly Saturday along Pacific Coast Highway when he 
struck a car driven by Shannon Orick, 19, of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officials said Becker was driving north on the 
southbound lanes of the highway for unknown reasons when he hit Orick's car. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman at St. John's Regional Medical Center listed Orick's condition 
Sunday as serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Two passengers -- Elizabeth Espinoza, 19, and Xiomara Neadeau, 17, both of 
Oxnard -- were treated for injuries and released, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials said Becker was driving north in the southbound lanes of the 
highway about 7:15 p.m. when he struck the vehicle driven by Orick head-on. 
Orick's car rolled over onto the northbound lanes and crashed through a 
chain-link fence before coming to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The highway was closed for three hours Saturday night while investigators 
cleared the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County coroner's official said Becker was unemployed. He is survived 
by his parents, Vernon and Mary Becker of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was scheduled for today, Senior Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese said 
Sunday. JEFF McDONALD

FILLMORE FIRMS IN TEMPORARY QUARTERS TO PAY RENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Merchants doing business in temporary quarters erected in Fillmore after the 
Jan. 17 earthquake will be charged rent beginning in November, the Fillmore 
City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed in the weeks after the earthquake to absorb the cost of 
leasing the space while businesses rebounded from the setback. 
</P>
<P>
 The new monthly rental charges will be assessed at 30 cents per square foot of 
business space in two portable tents constructed downtown when the earthquake 
devastated a good portion of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The rental fee, which includes utilities, is still lower than the average rent 
of 40 cents to $1 per square foot paid by Central Avenue merchants before the 
quake, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the executive director of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce isn't 
complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it includes all utilities, it seems extremely fair," said Hank Carrillo. 
"I have only 200 square feet here, so I have no problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The city leased almost 10,000 square feet of modular tents to help stores 
affected by the earthquake stay in business while the downtown is rebuilt. 
Nineteen businesses and organizations are using the space on Central Avenue in 
downtown Fillmore.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BANK TO OFFER STOCK TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bank, under pressure by federal regulators to increase 
its capital levels, will offer $5 million in stock for sale to its 
shareholders, bank officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Cupp said the bank is issuing 
new stock to raise its capital levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank had been given until the end of September to boost its capital after 
a review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency earlier this year. A 
string of bad real estate loans and consistent quarterly losses prompted the 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp said he is confident regulators will accept the new plan to raise 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect any adverse impact from the OCC at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The price and terms of the stock sale have not been decided, pending approval 
by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier attempt to raise capital by selling the bank's Orange County-based 
subsidiary, Frontier Bank, was dropped when the bank's officers and the 
prospective purchaser could not agree on a price. 
</P>
<P>
 VCNB has assets of about $294 million. If the final sale of Bank of A. Levy to 
First Interstate goes through, VCNB will become Ventura County's largest 
locally owned bank. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ARTS PLAZA DONATIONS SURPASS $6.4 
MILLION

<P>
 Nine major contributions last week raised the Civic Arts Plaza's endowment 
fund past the $6.4-million mark -- and encouraged fund-raisers to predict they 
will reach their goal of raising $7 million by next month's grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said we were going to do this, and I never had any doubts," said chief 
fund-raiser Richard T. Johnson, director of the Alliance for the Arts."But 
still, I am just absolutely amazed." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles Young and his wife, Sue, contributed $50,000 to the 
endowment, which will subsidize daily operations of the two theaters, including 
performances by nonprofit community groups. The Youngs have lived in Lake 
Sherwood three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Others contributing $50,000 were Joe and Pat Paulucci, who own PTS Furniture 
in Thousand Oaks; Charter Pacific Bank of Agoura Hills; John and Sandra Moyen, 
who own the Jewellery Connection in Westlake Village; George and Judy Fritkin, 
who own BAT Electronics in Westlake Village; Ken and Di Kaplan of Westlake 
Village; Curt and Gerry Pindler of Pindler & Pindler in Moorpark; Bernard and 
Susan Wickman, managers of Reeds & Son Furniture in Thousand Oaks and Agoura 
Hills, and Jack and Terre Bergman of Agoura. STEPHANIE SIMON

CHURCH LEADERS IN O.C. GRAPPLE WITH PROP. 187; RELIGION: THEY OPPOSE THE 
MEASURE, BUT PASTORS DELIVERING MESSAGE MAY ALIENATE SOME IN CONGREGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few days shy of a Sunday Mass at St. Mary's, the pastor is seething 
with a quiet indignation more often reserved for mortal sin than a ballot 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be mincin' words on this one," vowed Father Richard C. Kennedy in the 
lilting accent of his native Ireland. "I haven't worked out what I'll say, but 
I'm going to make it clear. Proposition 187 is immoral. . . . This thing is 
completely Godless." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the weekend, Kennedy was not ready to deliver his message. He needed 
more time to reflect and consult with other priests on the perils of staking 
out a position on the initiative, which would ban most public benefits for 
illegal immigrants, including education and basic health care. 
</P>
<P>
 From pulpits across California, clergy members are suddenly wrestling with 
political strategy instead of conventional demons. The top leadership of all 
the state's major religious denominations has attacked Proposition 187, calling 
for compassion while invoking the Bible: "Welcome strangers, for by doing this, 
some people have entertained angels without knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is the foot soldiers -- the priests, ministers, rabbis, and nuns -- who 
are delicately trying to deliver the anti-187 message in a fashion that will 
persuade rather than alienate. The political reality is that members of their 
congregations feel like most of the state's voters: rightly or wrongly they 
blame immigrants for many of the state's problems and support the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Bible to prick the consciences of church members, a broad coalition 
of 60 religious organizations has launched a frantic campaign to woo them with 
homilies and house parties, candlelight vigils and forums, Sunday sermons and 
appeals for compassion from top religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals have grown even more passionate as the leaders have warily noted 
the popularity of the measure in recent polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church needs to be heard on this in public more often. We've got to 
define the issue," said the Rev. Chester Talton, the suffragan bishop of the 
six-county Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. Talton is especially concerned 
about provisions that cut health and education services to children. "Jesus 
calls on us to care for the child and as we care for the child we care for 
Jesus himself," Talton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shunning this broad coalition are fundamentalist ministers like the Rev. Lou 
Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition based in Orange County. He said 
ministers supporting the initiative do not need to organize because "it's not 
considered part of the core doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon publicly supports the crackdown on illegal immigrants, remaining 
resolutely unmoved by religious appeals to "welcome the stranger." 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal strangers are different than a passing-through stranger who needs a 
night's lodging, food and clothing," explained Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted the preacher: Biblical teachings do not address "illegal strangers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the sweet strains of the children's Angelic Choir in the background, 
Gardena pastor Jose Luis Torres nervously prepared to face the church 
leadership at a business meeting of the Pacific Presbytery last month. 
</P>
<P>
 While the children swayed in white robes to a chorus of "Somebody Bigger Than 
You and I," Torres was gathering strength from the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been privately warned by some church leaders about the potential for 
backlash within his own religious community if he forced his fellow pastors to 
take a position against the controversial immigration measure before they were 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week earlier, smaller sub-groups of the San Gabriel Valley Presbyterian 
ministers took a bold stand against the measure, but Orange County's pastors 
considered the issue too politically hot to handle and refused to allow 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, a native of Puerto Rico, insisted on forging ahead. He reminded the 
church leaders that the Bible bars Christians from oppressing "strangers in our 
midst." He warned that the ballot measure will invite discrimination against 
Latinos. Wearily, he confessed, "I am tired. I'm tired of fighting and fighting 
and fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Torres waited, watching in amazement as most of the church leaders -- 
representing 52 congregations from Malibu to San Pedro -- bolted to their feet 
from the pews to signal their opposition to the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting at the Westminster Presbyterian Church in central Los Angeles that 
September afternoon also reflected the schism facing many churches. Rev. Mark 
Nazarian, the pastor at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Redondo Beach, 
stood to oppose the measure, while his two church elders didn't budge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church should not be debating political issues," St. Andrew's elder Dick 
Olson, 61, said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazarian was mindful of the complaint; his vote that day was his first public 
expression against the measure and probably his last. He will deliver no sermon 
railing against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 By longstanding custom, Nazarian said, he tries to "stay away" from politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the Nov. 8 election approaches, major religious denominations have been 
scrambling to develop a grass-roots strategy opposing the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost weekly, various church organizations representing thousands of members 
are releasing detailed opposition statements. The groups include the 
Episcopalian General Conference, California's Catholic bishops, the 
Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and the bishops of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church of America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the Office of Justice and Peace is 
directing an anti-Proposition 187 speakers bureau, distributing voter 
registration information and offering to train clergy members as they prepare 
to campaign against Proposition 187. Cardinal Roger Mahony, who last fall spoke 
out against immigrant bashing with the call "in the stranger we encounter 
Christ," also denounced the initiative in a July conference of Latino 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County -- the birthplace of the Proposition 187 movement -- the 
diocese is leaving it up to individual churches to develop their own tactics in 
the battle for parishioners' hearts and souls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has their own niche and is trying to share information," said Msgr. 
Jaime Soto, the Hispanic Vicar for the Diocese of Orange. "So for example, the 
diocese of Oakland (developed excerpts to be used in sermons) and we're 
distributing that to our churches for suggested readings and bulletin hints." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the statewide religious organizing is being coordinated by the 
Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights, a newly formed collection of some 60 
religious organizations that met in Oceanside in July to plot strategy to 
defeat Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting aside traditional fund-raising efforts for the campaign, the group has 
focused instead on their religious networks to distribute information and 
provide speakers, according to Ed Dunn, a Franciscan brother. He and Terry 
Salkowitz, the executive director of the Northern Pacific region of the 
American Jewish Congress, are helping lead the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 From their San Francisco offices, the coalition's leaders have also been 
organizing small living room parties to encourage people to ponder the issue 
with their friends. At least one house party has grown so large that its host, 
T.J. Anthony, has moved it to a San Francisco restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony, a new board member for the American Jewish Congress, said he has 
invited a guest speaker who is a Holocaust survivor. As a young boy, the man 
and hundreds of other Jewish immigrants were aboard the ship St. Louis when it 
was turned away from the Florida shores of the United States and forced back to 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Jewish community, there is a very, very strong memory, a long, long 
memory. A lot of people remember the St. Louis and the people who were sent 
back to their deaths in Nazi Germany. You can't forget that," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interfaith coalition is planning its most public display of opposition for 
Oct. 25, with candlelight vigils in all major California cities, according to 
coalition leader Dunn. The little money that the coalition has raised has been 
targeted for advertisements that will run in religious and ethnic newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The delicacy of the immigration issue has forced many clergy members to choose 
words with the caution of diplomats. They know it is easier to take on the 
devil than a volatile issue that could divide congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of churches are still wrestling with this, especially ones feeling the 
economic crisis in terms of lost jobs and lower incomes," Dunn said. "The 
temptation for some is to say there's not enough to go around. What we try to 
do is engage people in larger reasons for problems in the state. The largest 
corporations and wealthiest families have not paid their fair taxes, and 
therefore, the immigrant didn't create this crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Churches have faced contentious debates within their denominations on 
sensitive issues such as abortion rights, birth control and gays in the clergy, 
but their role in the argument over illegal immigrants seems even less 
clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and Hawaii -- 
which represents 300 Southern California churches -- voted to oppose 
Proposition 187 in a resolution offered by the church's Hispanic Commission. 
But the vote came after a decision by a sub-group -- the presbytery 
representing Orange County and East Los Angeles churches -- to quash their own 
discussion on procedural grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The synod's vote does not require the churches to sermonize on the issue 
because, generally, most ministers do not discuss public policy issues from the 
pulpit. But it encourages them to inform their congregations of their 
opposition and to help raise funds for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we should provide education and care for some of those in our 
midst, but at the same time, we have to stem the flow (of illegal immigrants) 
so that we don't end up with no money to provide care to those who are here. 
There is a limit," said the Rev. John Huffman, whose Newport Beach church, St. 
Andrew's Presbyterian, is considered the largest and wealthiest Presbyterian 
church in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar tensions were also evident at an anti-Proposition 187 training session 
organized by the Diocese of San Bernardino for a small group of Catholic 
priests. One of the older priests vowed that he would not speak up because of 
concerns about the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's awkward silence was broken by a younger priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got irritated," said Father Miguel Urrea, the pastor of Christ the 
King Church in San Bernardino. "I just said that it's very clearly stated as a 
church that we should not be concerned if people are documented or 
undocumented. If we do, we're losing our whole perspective of why we are 
priests. This is a humanitarian issue. Are we supposed to say, 'Sorry, we can't 
take care of you because you don't have papers. Stand there and bleed to 
death.'?" Last month, a small support group of Catholic priests in Orange 
County indulged in a painful discussion about political tactics. Many preside 
over rapidly evolving congregations that are shifting away from mostly white 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The question, according to participant Msgr. Bill McLaughlin, was how best to 
preach without alienating members. McLaughlin formed a committee among his 
affluent Newport Beach congregation at Our Lady Queen of Angels to fight the 
initiative, but even the committee members were apprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
 At their information table outside the church last Sunday, parishioners Juan 
and Patty Carreras distributed a copy of the initiative and nine flyers listing 
arguments against it, but carefully insisted that they were only encouraging 
people to become informed. But that did not prevent a debate at the table after 
one of the Masses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to hesitate to say something about this in a homily," said 
McLaughlin. "I know it will alienate some people, though. This is a Republican 
stronghold. . . . When we do preach what we consider Gospel values, some of the 
community would like to see shortcuts taken. We all know what turns people 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the president of the Hispanic Commission for the Presbyterian Synod 
senses divisions within his own predominantly Latino congregation in South 
Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every single congregation, no matter what the pastor preaches, two 
(opposing) groups will arise," said Rev. Nick Aguilar, the pastor of Bethel 
Presbyterian. "It depends on how life has treated you in the U.S. If you have a 
good job and a good car and savings in the bank, it's hard for you to remember 
when you came to this country. Time and situations change our way of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 The level of church unity and the passion of sermons are often a reflection of 
the class and ethnic makeup of the congregation itself. 
</P>
<P>
 When Episcopal Bishop Talton took his soft-spoken message of opposition to All 
Saints Church in Los Angeles last month, he received only support. The 
struggling congregation in the city's Highland Park area -- 90% Latino and so 
poor that the minister moonlights as a Los Angeles public school teacher -- 
listened silently to a Spanish translation of his words. 
</P>
<P>
 A thundering endorsement for the church's position came from one of the older 
men in the parish, Luis Guillermo, an immigrant from Guatemala, who stood up 
after the bishop finished his message. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have listened," Guillermo shouted in Spanish. "All of us know how we have 
suffered here in California. I hope that all of us will vote to survive. . . . 
We are human. We are Christians. We have a heart!" 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Irenaeus Catholic Church in Cypress -- where white parishioners make up 
45% of the congregation -- no opposition has surfaced yet toward the church 
opposition to Proposition 187, and the church has sent parishioners to training 
sessions on how to register voters. 
</P>
<P>
 So aggressive is the pastor, Father Michael Heher, that he decided to make his 
pulpit a bully one -- taking his sermon to the Cypress City Council, which is 
considering a resolution supporting the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing his clerical collar, the priest stood at the council podium and, in 
the manner of television "Late Show" host David Letterman, delivered a "Top 
Ten" list of reasons why the council should not back the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was little humor in this list, a somber message appealing to the 
moral values of the council, which includes one of Heher's parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason No. 10: "You don't have to take a position." His No. 1 reason: "It's 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "Having known you as I have," Heher told the council members, "I simply can't 
imagine you being a party to this." 
</P>
<P>
 To those passionately opposed to the measure, it sometimes seems as though 
they are walking into the lion's den. 
</P>
<P>
 The ecclesiastical and political forces collided one recent Sunday evening in 
a debate sponsored by St. Mark's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, 
considered one of Orange County's more progressive congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension filled the room as the 150-member audience listened to both sides of 
the issue. It appeared that the crowd was evenly split. When one side stated a 
position, the other side groaned. 
</P>
<P>
 Just that morning, the church's pastor, the Rev. Gary Collins, had delivered a 
sermon based upon the Gospel of the day: a parable in which Jesus heard his 
disciples arguing over who among them should be greatest. Jesus placed a child 
in their midst and told them that whoever welcomes the children welcomes him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of his sermon, Collins asked one panelist, former Border Patrol agent 
Bill King, a question that went to the core of his concern: How does one 
reconcile the Bible with the initiative? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about the Bible. This is politics," Collins recalled 
King answering -- a response that bothered Collins for days. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Proposition 187 is surely a political issue," the minister said, "it is 
surely a moral issue."

HE'S PERFECTING THE ART OF GETTING ALONG; CULTURE: UNDER TOM TOMLINSON, THE 
ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING ARTS CENTER MENDS FENCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve months after taking over the top job at Orange County's largest arts 
institution, Tom Tomlinson looks no worse for wear. Movie-star tan and not a 
blond hair out of place, he gives the outward appearance of operating on cruise 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he works off stress by running 50 miles a week. And his style of 
leadership draws nothing but raves from the people who work with him. One local 
arts executive calls him "a problem-solver." Another lauds him as "a 
consensus-builder." Nobody in almost a dozen interviews has anything negative 
to say about him, not even off the record. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his wood-paneled office at the 8-year-old Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, where he presides as chief operating officer over a 3,000-seat 
hall and a budget of roughly $20 million, Tomlinson wonders aloud what a 
paragon he must be to have created such an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee," he says, evincing the open, youthful manner everyone talks about, "this 
sounds too good to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 That he is personally accessible, gregarious and self-effacing -- all terms 
used by various associates to describe him -- seems beyond question. But have 
those attributes translated into policy decisions aimed at taking the center in 
new directions? Or has Tomlinson simply chosen to reaffirm the old directions 
since officially stepping into his post a year ago? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, perhaps not surprisingly, is a little of both. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the 44-year-old Spokane, Wash., native has shown a 
willingness to recast the center's institutional image from the haughty dowager 
of the arts community to a friendlier, less lofty doyenne in cautious but 
meaningful ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * He has made signficant overtures to the center's three major resident 
companies -- the Pacific Symphony Orchestra, the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society (which brings in touring ensembles and soloists) and Opera Pacific -- 
with offers of collaborative programming. This has helped patch up wounds from 
a prickly cultural turf battle that arose before he came. 
</P>
<P>
 * He has improved the play dates for the two smaller resident companies -- the 
Pacific Chorale and the Master Chorale -- within the limited wiggle room of the 
center's heavily booked schedule. This has soothed wounded pride over past 
treatment that made them feel like hangers-on. 
</P>
<P>
 * He has backed the idea of an architectural structure in the center lobby to 
provide on-site donor recognition for all five resident companies, which they 
long had sought without success. A cost-sharing study and design meetings are 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to do," he says, "is see that bridges are built among the 
organizations and in the public mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with his previous experiences, he considers whatever corrective 
measures he has taken at the privately funded, $73-million center to be 
minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 He came here from Anchorage, Alaska, where he had run the $70-million Alaska 
Center for the Performing Arts since its opening in 1988. Before that 
three-theater complex, he ran the Rialto Square Theatre in Joliet, Ill., the 
Pantages Center for the Performing Arts in Tacoma, Wash., and the Capitol 
Theatre in Yakima, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, after a brief time at a new place, you discover there are a bunch of 
things nobody told you about," says Tomlinson, who keeps photos of those halls 
above the sofa in his office. "There were no surprises here. If I can put any 
capsule around it, there's been very little remedial work to do. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing cooperative programming with the symphony and the Philharmonic 
Society. But I'd like to think that's just the tip of the iceberg. We really 
can see a much more collaborative arts scene, some of which the center can 
facilitate and some of which it can lead." 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate example will be the joint presentation Oct. 13 of Michael 
Nyman, the British composer-pianist whose score for Jane Campion's "The Piano" 
catapulted him to fame. The center and the Pacific Symphony are sponsoring the 
concert to offer a "new music" artist not previously seen here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Tom's idea," says Louis G. Spisto, executive director of the Pacific 
Symphony. "Michael Nyman has a big following, but he's a niche market. He's the 
kind of classical crossover none of us had brought in before. I think Tom has 
added a dimension of leadership at the center that reflects his personal style. 
He's very open." 
</P>
<P>
 The most extraordinary instance of a cooperative venture could be a two-night 
engagement in May of the Metropolitan Opera orchestra led by James Levine. 
Although the deal has yet to be signed, the center, Opera Pacific and the 
Pacific Symphony are making joint plans to sponsor what could be the 
orchestra's only Southern California stop on a rare national tour that, as of 
now, will stop at just eight halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that project is an example of the center reaching out to us as it was 
brainstorming," says David DiChiera, Opera Pacific's general manager. "The 
center made contact with the Met before Tom arrived. But it was Tom who came to 
us and told us this was a possibility. He wanted to involve us." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, the jointly sponsored concerts would signal that the center 
isn't about to let the nearby Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts steal its 
thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 This season's top attractions, from Leontyne Price and England's Royal 
Philharmonic Orchestra to Tony Bennett, will be found at the publicly funded, 
$60-million Cerritos hall just north of the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major artists have by-passed the center for Cerritos during the past two 
seasons, among them violinist Isaac Stern and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, 
the St. Louis Symphony and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most striking challenge to the center's preeminence was the loss of 
the prestigious Boston Symphony Orchestra to Cerritos for next season. The blow 
seemed especially stunning to the Philharmonic Society, which made the bid to 
present the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cerritos had their offer in first, but we came in right after and slightly 
higher," says Dean Corey, the society's executive director. "We're not really 
sure why we didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got the newer hall, and because of the stuff they're slamming in 
there its reputation is high around the country. Also, they're in Los Angeles 
County, so it's considered an L.A. date -- and that counts a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Corey notes, "when an agent calls Cerritos, he can seal the deal 
right over the phone. We can't do that. We have to check dates with the center 
before we get back. But what was real good for us in that whole thing was how 
supportive the center was. They really streamlined the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, moreover, the Philharmonic Society announced that it has booked two 
stellar recitalists for next season at the center: soprano Cecilia Bartoli, the 
latest Italian opera sensation, and star violinist Itzhak Perlman. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson doesn't believe Cerritos has had much if any impact on audience 
attendance at the Orange County center, despite recent declines from earlier 
years. "The population base is just too big," he says. "But Cerritos does have 
the potential to impact perception. That's why we've been careful to show that 
we're a premiere venue." 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain that identity, he is sticking closely to the programming formula 
of his predecessor, Thomas R. Kendrick, who long ago spelled out his philosophy 
as "the four disciplines" -- musical theater, dance, opera and classical music. 
Indeed, when Tomlinson arrived, he noted that he had no intention of disturbing 
the formula. 
</P>
<P>
 It not only had proven effective in drawing large crowds, it had helped 
maintain a conservative institutional image that appealed to the elite donors 
at the heart of the center's huge fund-raising base. And no arts organization 
in the county has a greater need or ability to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
 With annual expenditures for 1995 tentatively projected at $19.2 million, the 
center dwarfs all its resident companies. This year's budget, swollen by the 
cost of presenting "The Phantom of the Opera" for a sold-out, six-week 
engagement this summer, came to $22.6 million. Last year's budget came to $19.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But except for its Broadway offerings, all the center's attractions must be 
subsidized to cover the gap between outlays and box-office revenue. This is 
especially true of the center's hugely expensive ballet series, regarded as 
Kendrick's great accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The center raised a total of $4.9 million in contributions last year. This 
year Tomlinson anticipates fund-raising needs at $5.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the "Phantom" grossed more than $7 million, of which the center kept 
roughly $700,000, Tomlinson says he has "a little breathing room" to cover 
basic inflation in oerating costs. He's already looking for another mega-hit 
musical to fill the house next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if he wants to put his own programming stamp on the center, a second, 
smaller concert hall will have to be built to free up the already congested 
schedule. The center has fewer than two dozen dark nights a year, and those 
nights are wild cards, difficult to fill because they're used as scheduling 
buffers to jockey play dates for the theatrical runs (opera, ballet and 
musicals). 
</P>
<P>
 Until a second hall is built, Tomlinson can only tinker around the edges of 
the center's programming, bringing in a show here, a concert there, which may 
or may not conform to Kendrick's preordained formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity for me to make significant program changes is limited at 
best," he concedes. "We've filled in more single dates than before, but those 
kinds of things don't really make a big impression." 
</P>
<P>
 How long will he have to wait to make his own programming mark? A long time, 
apparently. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas H. Nielsen, chairman of the center's board of directors, says the issue 
of a new concert hall "remains out there" but is not even on the horizon. "It 
would be some time after the turn of the century before we see another 
facility," he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson is unfazed. He points to a spiral-bound, color-coded pamphlet on the 
coffee table in his office. It outlines the center's outreach programs, a 
one-stop shopping guide for educators that hadn't been published before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope if I leave a mark at all, it's something like this," he says, 
"something of benefit to the community."

JAIL CLAIM FAILS TO CHANGE VIEWS ON FIRE SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ and KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials remained convinced Sunday that Jose Soto Martinez 
set the devastating Laguna Beach fire, despite his family's insistence and 
statements from a prison official that Martinez may have been in a Mexican jail 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans said his department is 
investigating the family's claim but, "We feel at this time, with the evidence 
that we have, that we have our arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will look into anything that people bring to our attention during an 
investigation and we will definitely look into the comments by Martinez's 
mother about her son being in jail in Mexico," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother, Teresa Campos, has said her son's actual name is Jaime Saille and 
that he was incarcerated under that name at the El Cerezo Jail in Mazatlan -- a 
claim that received some support from a jail official on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 El Cerezo Director Leticia Aguayo Gonzalez said in a telephone interview that 
the birth date on Saille's prison record matches Martinez's birth date. She 
said other similarities exist, including the name of Saille's mother and other 
personal information she did not detail. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said until she sees a photograph of the suspect being held in 
Orange County, she can't positively identify Martinez and Saille as being the 
same person. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguayo said that Saille was jailed from May 15, 1993, to July 8, 1994. The 
Laguna Beach fire, which damaged or destroyed 441 homes and caused $528 million 
in damage, was started Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not have anyone by the name of Jose Soto Martinez in here at that 
time," Aguayo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County law enforcement officials stood by their previous statements 
that they arrested the right man. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, 26, confessed to setting the blaze after he was caught lighting 
small fires behind an apartment complex in Fullerton last month. He is 
scheduled to be arraigned on four felony arson counts in Orange County 
Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel today. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Martinez told them he set the fire to conjure up a demon 
king named "Gotam." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very skeptical," Fullerton Police Chief Patrick McKinley said of the 
family's contention that Martinez was behind bars when the Laguna Beach fire 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what the evidence is, and the evidence is very, very convincing," 
McKinley said. "No one could have the information he has without intimate 
knowledge of that fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect's mother said in an interview in her Fullerton home Sunday that 
her son told her during a jailhouse visit on Saturday that he did not light the 
fire and would recant his confession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he did not do it. That's what gives me mental peace right now," Campos 
said. "He invented everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's family, including his stepfather, Malaquias Campos, insists he was 
born Jaime Saille in Sinaloa, Mexico, on March 29, 1968, and that the name 
Martinez is an alias of his own making. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Campos said her son is mentally unstable and confessed to a crime he 
didn't commit in order to go to jail and get away from Mafia enemies he 
contends threatened to kill him during his reported two-year stay in the 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son told her Saturday that just before he disappeared, he saw a 
man he thought was sent to kill him. Malaquias Campos said he believes his 
stepson fabricated those enemies -- as well as an account to investigators that 
he set the fire to conjure the demon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'In here I feel safe,' " Teresa Campos said. "He needs help. He has 
a persecution phobia. . . . Mentally, he's not well." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans refused to comment Sunday on the status of the investigation and would 
not say if authorities planned to travel to Mazatlan to retrieve jail records 
or how they planned to prove or disprove the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to talk about what we're doing and what we're not doing," he 
said. "We're not going to try this thing in the press." 
</P>
<P>
 No Orange County law enforcement officials visited the Mazatlan jail over the 
weekend, according to the El Cerezo jail director. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a series of interviews with Fullerton arson investigator Bill 
Wallis that Martinez implicated himself in the Laguna blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McKinley: "This will require a lot of investigation by the county to 
determine just who was in jail down there. Until that investigation is 
completed, no one will really know for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's family dismissed as coincidence claims by investigators that 
Martinez provided incriminating information on the origin of the Laguna fire, 
such as where it started and that no accelerant was used. They said he may have 
seen television news accounts of the fire while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, though, is unable to prove that the man authorities call Jose 
Martinez served time in prison under the name Jaime Saille. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer who represented their son in Mexico when he was imprisoned for 
stealing a friend's jewelry called the family Sunday and promised to send 
records proving Martinez was in prison at the time he allegedly was setting the 
Laguna Beach fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during that prison stint that her son became depressed and delusional, 
Teresa Campos said. "He called and said, 'Mama, they want to kill me here. Get 
me out! Get me out!' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Campos said her son grew up a normal child, playing with toy cars and 
making up games with his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a teen-ager in Tijuana, she said, he dropped out of school and fell in 
with a crowd of friends who used drugs. He served two years in California Youth 
Authority for a San Diego burglary and returned to his mother's home in 
Tijuana, where he worked as a house painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez joined his mother after she moved to Fullerton in 1990 to live with 
Malaquias Campos, whom she had married three years earlier. In 1993, Martinez 
decided to move to Mazatlan, a tourist Mecca where he hoped to find work using 
the English he had learned during his time in California youth facilities. But 
a friend accused him of stealing and Martinez was convicted in Mazatlan -- 
serving 14 months as Jaime Saille, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Campos said she picked up a troubled and fear-ridden son from prison. 
After a brief stay with his sister and brother-in-law in Tijuana, he moved into 
the Fullerton home, lived here legally and worked at a local factory, she said. 
He went off to work but never came home on Sept. 16, the day of his arrest in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Martinez was a transient and an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 His family reported him as a missing person to police and, hearing no word 
after two weeks, feared he might be hurt or dead, his stepfather said. "We 
thought probably he was in a car accident and forgot his name -- a thousand 
things," Malaquias Campos said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, authorities held a news conference to announce Jose Soto Martinez 
was the chief suspect in the Laguna fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a nightmare," Teresa Campos said. "This whole time we did not 
know if he was dead or alive. . . . Now we have a different, serious problem."

STREET SMART

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The new traffic signal at Ventura Boulevard and Gloria Avenue in Encino near 
the new Burger King has a very long red light. The problem is that the timing 
does not change late at night and I have to stop at Burger King at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if this is some kind of plot by Burger King to get me to stop and 
smell the burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to make this light more user-friendly? 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Kheel, Encino 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 As much as we at Street Smart love to expose scandal and corruption -- 
Whoppergate in this case? -- there is none to report here. As far as we can 
tell, the problem you report is not part of a plot by Burger King to fatten you 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 It is instead just a malfunctioning signal at Gloria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Gallagher, a traffic engineer for the city of Los Angeles, tells us that 
all of the traffic lights along Ventura Boulevard are synchronized to improve 
the flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that lights on side streets such as Gloria Avenue change only when 
a car trips sensors embedded in the pavement, which in turn tell the lights 
along Ventura Boulevard to begin changing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sensors at Gloria Avenue are broken. Until repairs can be made, the 
city has reset the lights at Gloria Avenue to change automatically every once 
in a while -- regardless of whether there are any cars waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 This temporary solution, however, created a new problem -- backups on Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, you may either need to find another way home from work or get 
used to it, because Gallagher says it may take a few months to get the signal 
and sensors fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 4,000 signalized intersections in Los Angeles, as many as 10% -- or 400 
-- are malfunctioning on any given day. With repair crews able to fix two or 
three a day, the waiting list is rather long. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Santa Clarita and I work in Glendale. Every day I drive through the 
Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange that was destroyed in the 
Northridge earthquake and subsequently rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 My understanding is that the construction firms got paid big bonuses for 
finishing that interchange ahead of schedule. So why are they constantly 
closing down various lanes and portions of that freeway interchange to do work? 
</P>
<P>
 When you drive home in the evening, a lane will be closed on the Golden State 
Freeway or a lane will be closed on the Antelope Valley Freeway. One night when 
I was driving home, the entire Antelope Valley Freeway was closed. They were 
routing people off and on the freeway, just like after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm wondering what the terms of the deal between the state and the 
construction company were. If the bonus was paid, why are they still working on 
it? 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Varenchik, Valencia 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your concerns are understandable, given the attention paid by those of us in 
the news business to the bonuses given freeway contractors. While we ballyhooed 
the openings of major interchanges, we may not have been as clear as we could 
have been on the work that remains. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Golden State-Antelope Valley, or the 5 (Golden State)-14 (Antelope 
Valley) interchange, work is being done in two phases. The first phase -- 
connecting the southbound 14 to the southbound 5, and the northbound 5 to the 
northbound 14 -- was reopened July 8, or 20 days ahead of its original 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Early completion netted the contractor, Kasler Corp. of San Bernardino, an 
extra $3.5 million on the $19.6-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is continuing on the second phase, which will connect the southbound 5 to 
the northbound 14, and the southbound 14 to the northbound 5. Work on the 
$13.2-million project should be completed by November. If San Diego-based 
F.C.I. Constructors finishes early, it will also receive a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of the bonuses are clauses in the contracts that impose a 
penalty if construction crews take too long to finish their projects. Caltrans 
officials argue that the incentives are necessary to get work done quickly and 
are a cheaper alternative to letting work drag on. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Rick Holland said closure of the Santa Monica Freeway cost 
Southern California roughly $1 million a day in lost wages and wasted time. 
Likewise, the closure of the Golden State Freeway at Gavin Canyon cost roughly 
$550,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 So while two connectors are up and running, two more remain under 
construction. Also, small adjustments remain under way on the entire 
interchange, which requires crews to shut down lanes from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Readers: 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Public Works Bureau of Street Lighting has asked 
Street Smart to pass along a message to our readers. And who are we to refuse 
an agency with such a long name? 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure the city's 220,000 street lights work properly, the bureau has 
started what it calls Operation Bright Lights. By calling (800) 303-5267, 
residents can report street lights that won't turn on -- or won't turn off, for 
that matter.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: EXPLOSION IN A PHARMACY MARKED THE START OF A HEADY HOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have not yet stormed the home of Gunther Jensen in Pacoima, even though 
he's known to concoct potentially explosive liquids there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen is not a demolitions man for an international conspiracy nor a local 
gang banger. 
</P>
<P>
 He's just a guy who knows and loves his beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old teacher of Shakespeare took up beer making at the age of 17 
after a family trip to visit relatives in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over there home brewing is popular," says Jensen. "My dad and I brought home 
a kit and mixed up a batch of beer in the back of his Fullerton pharmacy so my 
mother wouldn't find out." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of that experiment were unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used twice the amount of sugar called for in the directions, thinking I 
would increase the alcohol content," remembers Jensen. Once the grossly 
over-carbonated beer was bottled, the pressure caused about half the bottles to 
blow their stacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, he continued to make home brew while attending El Camino College 
and UC Irvine. He cooked up a batch when living with some Phi Gamma Delta 
fraternity buddies one summer in a cottage in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort did not spawn a new cottage industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen admits that what he made there was so undrinkable even frat rats 
wouldn't touch it. "It was so bad I couldn't give it away," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cooked the malted barley in a big vat on the stove and then took the pot 
and put it on ice in the bathtub," Jensen says. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a cooling method that would not win the approval of most master 
brewers. The results were a chilling experience in how beer shouldn't taste. 
</P>
<P>
 What a change 10 or 12 years has made. Jensen now has a USC master's degree in 
drama, a wife, a 7-month-old baby and a mortgage. He teaches several 
drama-related courses at El Camino College and he still makes his own beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that he now owns about $2,000 worth of gourmet beer-making 
equipment, and his brews win national awards. 
</P>
<P>
 His Fiji fraternity buddies would be amazed. 
</P>
<P>
 He has competed in national and local levels of home brewing contests 
sponsored by the American Homebrewers Assn. His most recent win was a bronze 
medal in the Belgian Lambik category in the 1994 national competition held in 
June in Colorado. It was for his unique framboise- flavored Belgium beer, which 
he describes as having a tart earthiness that he sweetens with raspberries. 
</P>
<P>
 He also won first place at the 1993 Los Angeles County Fair in the mead 
category. Jensen says mead is what the Celts, Normans and Vikings used to down 
before they went out to loot and pillage. 
</P>
<P>
 Parenthetically, Jensen suffers from a heady sense of humor that he seems 
incapable of keeping bottled up. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he told of once entering a regional contest in the pilsener 
category, pilsener being a light beer with a strong hops flavor originally 
brewed in the Lourdes of brewmeisters: Pilsen in the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 He says, somehow, instead of the pilsener he meant to send to the contest, he 
sent a novelty brew he had made that was spiked with chili peppers. He says the 
written opinions of the judges were most interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen is a member of the local home brewers' society known as the Maltose 
Falcons, which meets at the Home Wine, Beer and Cheese Shop in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 John Daume, who owns the shop and sponsors the 25-year-old group, says it is 
the oldest, largest and most active group in the country, with about 350 
members, most of whom live in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 He says many of the members, like Jensen, are serious home brewers and have 
won national and regional contests. Anyone interested in home beer-making may 
join. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Jensens, their long-term goal is to open a bed and breakfast in 
Northern California with a boutique brewery bearing the Gunther Jensen label. 
</P>
<P>
 Their short-term goal is to observe Oktoberfest with friends and sample the 
wide variety of beers Jensen is now brewing in his state-of-the-art vats and 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottles, thankfully, no longer explode. 
</P>
<P>
 The beer will be accompanied by Jensen's homemade sausages and downed to the 
singing of Danish drinking songs, including one which Jensen says is spelled 
Hanskalive.  
</P>
<P>
 Loosely translated that means either, "Long life to you and our beloved 
Denmark," or "Look out, dummy, the Great Dane is drinking your beer." It Takes 
a Lot of Green to Turn Back the Clock to Senior Year

<P>
 Hunter green is a traditional school color at Canoga Park High School, but one 
alumnus says until now, he never understood its significance. 
</P>
<P>
 It's what you spend lots of, he says, when you want your wife to accompany you 
to your 30th-year class reunion. If you can get her to go at all. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular he shall remain nameless, this in hopes of heading off a nasty 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 When he said he wished her to accompany him to the reunion, she absolutely 
lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 First, she announced she needed to lose 20 pounds by the date of the event, 
this Saturday, which seemed unlikely since the conversation was held only two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way the weight loss could have been accomplished was through a 
thorough liposuctioning. Lucky for him she was not interested in having her 
stomach vacuumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Next there was the thing about wardrobe. The old grad says his wife was 
hauling dresses from Nordstrom and then returning them so fast he was afraid 
the sales people were going to bar her entry. Getting banned from Nordstrom is 
not something a former Valley Girl, now Woman, would take with equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the problem of facial wrinkles. His wife wanted one of those 
quicky mini-face lifts that she contended was no more outrageous than the money 
he spent trying to grow hair. 
</P>
<P>
 He bargained her down to what he describes as a cut by one of those 
$500-a-minute, French-speaking, Beverly Hills scissor-slashers. She returned 
from her trip over the hill looking, she says, as if her hair had been styled 
by grazing sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot of all the trauma is that the couple decided to spend the weekend 
in Laguna Beach reunioning with each other, rather than at the Warner Center 
Marriott with the Class of '64. 
</P>
<P>
 He figures the whole exercise is going to set him back about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The interesting thing, he says, is that he doesn't even understand why his 
wife, whom he describes as 40ish and good looking, would have gotten herself 
into such a tailspin. She never went to Canoga and doesn't know a soul who did 
except him. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned today that the Shroud of Turin will be entered into evidence in 
the O.J. Simpson case. Uhh, either the defense or offense is going to say it 
proves DNA evidence is inconclusive. That's what I learned in current affairs 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader to his mother in Sherman Oaks, who is still wondering what the 
teacher might have said to put that idea into his head.

ACTING HER AGE; AT 90, IRMSIE BROWN HAS BEGUN RACKING UP ROLES IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irmsie Brown may be a neophyte actress, but she's still got a few rules about 
Hollywood conduct she simply refuses to break. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, she absolutely will not pose in the nude. She won't jump into bed 
with any smooth-talking Lothario on the set, no matter what size the paycheck. 
And as for those lingering, full-body-contact kisses? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the 90-year-old Van Nuys widow has this image of the silver 
screen back in its more-innocent infancy when she was a wide-eyed kid sitting 
in a darkened theater with a box of popcorn -- days when such matters as sex 
and nudity were, well, just left to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things just don't have to go that far, people dropping their clothes at the 
drop of a hat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do it back then and they don't have to today. People in this town 
just have to learn to keep their pants on, that's what I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown knows she has a few things to learn about The Biz. And fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, at the unheard-of age of 89, the former Wisconsin housewife and 
bookkeeper for her son-in-law's Toluca Lake talent agency plunged head-first 
into a new role that has casting directors' heads turning: She hit the big 
screen, becoming one of the oldest working character actresses in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A sprightly, gray-haired woman with slate-blue eyes and an unassuming style, 
Brown recently landed a bit part in "City Slickers II" with Billy Crystal, 
playing an elderly Central Park jogger who is nonplussed as Crystal's character 
takes his pet cow on its daily run. 
</P>
<P>
 She has portrayed an elderly party crasher -- an interloper who hits the 
buffet table on the sly, stuffing Brie into her purse -- on the CBS television 
series "Hearts Afire." 
</P>
<P>
 And she has become the resident old lady on the "Tonight Show." In one of two 
recent skits, Brown played a bespectacled, grandmother in a shawl who traded in 
her handgun for a pair of "Tonight Show" tickets. In the second, she was an 
elderly Woodstock veteran, an aged ex-hippie named Sunshine who, dressed in a 
bandanna, beads and a tie-dyed ensemble, fashioned a bong out of an old 
Metamucil bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 On the set, Brown has already developed a reputation as an able actress fit 
enough to repeatedly run up and down a hill in a jogging suit until the scene 
is right, casting directors say. And, even at age 90, she has another ability 
that eludes actresses half her age: She remembers her lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "What casting directors like about Irmsie is that she really is old -- she's 
in the same ballpark as George Burns -- so she doesn't have to act the part," 
said Candace Potter, an agent at the Tyler Kjar Agency, the family-run business 
for which Brown still keeps the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "And while Irmsie may be old, she's in great shape. She can still talk. She 
has the faculties to remember her lines. That's why the phone keeps ringing. 
She's caught on to all of this tricky Hollywood work rather quickly. I mean, 
how many people do you know who have begun new careers at age 89?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Bascom, casting director for "Hearts Afire," said Brown has a style of 
her own, recalling a recent shoot where she rejected a wardrobe room full of 
shoes, and wore her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irmsie had these orange high heels," she recalled. "Most experienced 
actresses would never have worn those shoes on the set, but she wanted them. At 
her age, you at least would have thought she would have worn flat heels." 
</P>
<P>
 Bascom said Brown's age is an asset -- even in an industry where youth is 
prized. "Irmsie's secret is that she really does not look her age. She is perky 
and spry and could play the role of a woman much younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when the call comes for someone really, really old, she's the real thing. 
I wouldn't be surprised if she was the oldest working character actress in 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Tori Pellegrino, production administrator for the "Tonight Show": 
"Irmsie may be 90, but she's still a trooper. She's fun. She's everybody's 
grandmother. It's amazing for me to see someone so together. And to be what 
she's doing at her age -- even down to the point of driving a car. It's an 
inspiration in this town where youth is so valued. To me, it proves something: 
that you can do anything you want if you try." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown takes such compliments in stride. "At age 90, you take things one day at 
a time," she said. "My mind is clear. But once in awhile, you know, you forget 
little things." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Milwaukee in 1904, Brown married Sheldon Mehlos, who preferred she 
become a mother and housekeeper rather than pursue a career. But Brown, who 
worked temporary office jobs, kept her own conservative values -- especially 
regarding women's role in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "If women go to work, I think they should respect their bosses," she said. 
"They have to remember, the workplace is not the same as leaning over the fence 
with all that gossip. You can't take back what you say. So it's good to watch 
what comes out of your mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1920s, such conventional ideas cut short a would-be entertainment 
career before it got started: Brown was hired as a dancer in a Milwaukee 
vaudeville act. Her husband accompanied her to her first practice. 
</P>
<P>
 But walking up the steps to the hall, Brown suddenly turned to her husband: 
"Oh Shelly, we've only been married two weeks! I can't do this. I can't leave 
you now for all those practices and performances. I have to try marriage before 
I can do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1970 and Brown took a bookkeeping job in 
her son-in-law's firm. Especially after Sheldon's death in 1985, after 60 years 
of marriage, Brown became a known commodity to about 400 actors and other 
professionals represented by the agency -- developing a reputation for the 
small inspirational lines she would write to clients on the note space of their 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought that was really cool the way she encouraged people, especially 
in a town where encouragement comes in small doses," actor S.A. Griffin said. 
"She writes things like 'We love you, Stevie. Keep it up' and 'His love keeps 
us alive.' It was just so unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin recently gave Brown a small obelisk to honor her acting efforts, 
calling it the Irmsie Award. She keeps it at the office, close to her side, 
right next to the urn where she keeps Sheldon's remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, friends, family and clients threw a 90th birthday party for 
Brown, who only recently joined the ranks of nonagenarians -- celebrating her 
bookkeeping and acting careers as well as a spirit that continues to win 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irmsie is just so special," Griffin said. "You couldn't meet a more amicable, 
loving person. People want to be close to her. She's genuine. I love the 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her 80s, Brown lived the life of most octogenarians: She tried to 
keep active, sadly watching many of her friends pass away. Then her life took a 
plot twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandson, Brandon Kjar, an agent at the talent agency, entered her picture 
in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Players Directory, the 
classified pages for actors looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the casting calls started. But Brown stuck to her conventional guns 
concerning what roles she would take. She shied away from playing in a pizza 
commercial when the role called for her to lie on an old couch with a man in a 
seedy motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled son-in-law Tyler Kjar: "She informed me there were some things she 
would not do. She said 'If they try and put me in bed with a man, I will get 
out right away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the "City Slicker's II" role. "We told her she had one line in the 
film," recalled Kjar. "She thought for a moment and said 'How long is it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Brown got the job for nearly dropping her pants during the casting 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made me run up and down a hill in my sweat pants," she recalled. "Well, 
I hadn't hitched them up properly and suddenly I looked down and thought 'Oh my 
Lord, my britches are falling off!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The studio loved the moment. And for Irmsie Brown, the rest is Hollywood 
history.

CSUN PLAYER KEEPS SHOOTING CHARGES SECRET FROM COACHES; CRIME: JONATHAN 
BEAUREGARD STILL PLAYED FOOTBALL DESPITE FACING TWO COUNTS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER 
IN AN ATTACK ON HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND AND A MAN IN SAN BERNARDINO IN AUGUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Cal State Northridge football player facing two counts of attempted murder 
for allegedly shooting his ex-girlfriend and her friend has concealed the 
charges from the school's coaching staff since he was arrested more than a 
month ago, police and school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan G. Beauregard, 22, was arrested Aug. 29 in his hometown of San 
Bernardino in connection with the shooting outside the Arrowhead Elks' bar, 
said San Bernardino Police Lt. Jack Griggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after he was released on bail, Beauregard reported to practice with the 
Northridge Matadors. Beauregard -- a 5-foot-11, 270-pound offensive right guard 
-- is a second-year starter for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Matador coaches said Saturday that they did not know of Beauregard's arrest. 
And a conference spokesman said it was unlikely that the school would be 
sanctioned for allowing Beauregard to continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified as Von E. Thompson, 26, of Rialto, a security 
guard at the bar, and Daniella Smith, who investigators said is Beauregard's 
ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Thompson and Smith were shot as they sat in Thompson's truck after 
the bar had closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a minute, here comes Beauregard -- he shoots the male victim twice," 
said Detective Roy Izumi, who investigated the shooting. The first bullet hit 
Thompson in the right arm and the second struck Thompson's bullet-proof vest 
"right about where his heart would be," Izumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was shot once in the hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was arrested near his mother's home shortly after the shooting. 
Smith told police that Beauregard refused to leave her alone since they had 
broken up, Izumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon at the 
San Bernardino County Sheriff's West Valley Detention Center, but was released 
in lieu of $15,000 bail within a few hours, said a source close to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were later upgraded by the San Bernardino district attorney's 
office to attempted murder, Izumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard's grandmother is Valerie Pope-Ludlam, a San Bernardino city 
councilwoman representing the 6th District. Pope-Ludlam, a member of the 
council for eight years, said she will attend her grandson's arraignment Oct. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a strong, very faithful, very religious family," she said. "We live by 
faith and that's a fact, and I believe there will be a victory in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard attended football practice later the same day, but never mentioned 
the arrest to anyone on the coaching staff, said Bob Burt, head coach of the 
Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until I know something concrete, it'll be the same as it's always been," Burt 
said before the kickoff to Saturday's game against Chico State University. "If 
we find out Monday that it's factual, we'll decide what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 When reached at his mother's San Bernardino home, Beauregard refused to 
comment on the incident, but confirmed that he did not tell the Matadors 
coaching staff of his arrest. They did not know about it until questioned by 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Vic Buccola, commissioner of the American West Conference, of which Northridge 
is a member, said the NCAA grants member schools the autonomy to handle 
disciplinary matters on a case-by-case basis. The NCAA's ethical code of 
conduct for student athletes does not address criminal cases, Buccola said, 
adding that sanctions against the school are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there's something proven," that Northridge officials had prior 
knowledge of the incident, "then there might be a hand-slapping at worst," 
Buccola said. "But that would be an NCAA matter, not a conference matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard started as a junior at Northridge after attending Long Beach State 
in 1991 and New Mexico State in 1992. He played for two seasons at Cajon High 
in San Bernardino, where he was senior class president, and was selected to 
play in the 1990 Shrine All-Star Game.

CRITTER CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Animal control officer Dennis Kroeplin starts his morning in a small cubical 
in the West Valley Animal Shelter, checking messages from callers who do not 
wish to share their lives with animals not of their choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages are about opossums, raccoons, deer, skunks and even bears.Some of 
the more frantic calls come from people who have trapped one of these animals 
inside a room or homemade trap and are wondering what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeplin's job, which he has been doing for 27 years, includes rounding up 
these critters and bringing them to the shelter or back to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Kroeplin, 53, has seen the rate of calls his department 
receives multiply as housing developments pushed outward into formerly wild 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1969, he said, his department would catch and then airlift to the 
Santa Monica Mountains about 16 wild animals per week. Now, the number 
airlifted weekly is closer to 70, and he also regularly transports animals to 
the mountains by van. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the work is hazardous. During last year's Malibu fire, he made his 
way through thick smoke and fire to rescue a dozen geese trapped by flames. He 
once broke his foot while chasing a pair of peacocks. 
</P>
<P>
 And three years ago, while pondering how to handle a bear who had climbed a 
pine tree, Kroeplin was startled by the powerful animal's sudden jump to the 
ground just a short distance from where he stood. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the bear headed in the opposite direction.

TRIBUTE HONORS LIFE, WORK OF ACTRESS MABEL KING; ENTERTAINMENT: STAR KNOWN FOR 
HER ROLES IN 'THE WIZ' AND TV'S 'WHAT'S HAPPENING' CELEBRATES WITH 300 FRIENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mabel King put on her special red dress Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 And as befits a star of stage and screen, she was glamorized with golden 
accessories -- including a beaded gold hat designed to bring to mind visions of 
Cleopatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she sat back and enjoyed the show with 300 of her friends, all of them 
celebrating King's life and spirit at a tribute that went on for hours at St. 
Anne's Melkite-Greek Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful," King said. "These are all loving people." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment, friends said, was mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got the greatest attitude you've ever seen," said Dick Sheenan, who 
produced the show, which featured vaudevillian and award-winning choreographer 
Fayard Nicholas, singer Barbara McNair and singer-songwriter David Pomeranz. 
</P>
<P>
 King, 61, is perhaps best-known for her role as the Wicked Witch of the West 
in "The Wiz," both in the Broadway version of the play and the movie. She also 
played a sitcom mom in the 1970s TV show, "What's Happening." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, she suffered a stroke. In 1991, her left leg was amputated, and last 
May she lost her right leg, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheenan said organizers hoped Sunday's show would raise $10,000 -- enough to 
buy King an electric wheelchair so she could get around with ease at the Motion 
Picture & Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, where she now lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, King said, even beyond. "I want to get back to work so bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, however, it was all play. "I'm having myself a good time," 
King said, reveling in her hat and matching gold pocketbook. "Even my blood 
pressure today was just beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 "She is absolutely beautiful," actress Joan-Carol Bensen said. "And she looks 
absolutely gorgeous."

FANS SAY GOODBY TO WESTERN STORE; NORTH HOLLYWOOD: NUDIE'S, FAMOUS FOR 
OUTFITTING WESTERN MOVIE HEROES AND COUNTRY SINGERS, IS REMEMBERED AS IT CLOSES 
ITS DOORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nudie's Rodeo Tailors Inc., famed clothier to Western movie stars and country 
singers, is now a part of history. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,600-square-foot store, which officially closed Friday after 47 years of 
dressing some of the best-known stars in Hollywood and Nashville, invited old 
and new customers to bid farewell to the legendary retailer Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't there anything left to buy?" asked Ellen Lotterman of North Hollywood 
as she peeked into the store before the party started. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we are closed today, but you can come knock on the window Monday and we 
will let you in," said Jamie Nudie, 33, granddaughter of the famous owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been going to this store since before she was born," said Lotterman, 
pointing to Jamie. "It is like a historical landmark." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm even going to miss the big Palomino," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palomino, a plastic horse that had stood out in front of the store at its 
current location since 1963, became a party decoration Sunday as patrons danced 
to country music and ate tacos and burritos Nudie's provided in the rear 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Nudie, formerly known as Nudie Cohn, died in 1984. He supplied custom-made 
costumes -- often studded with rhinestones or diamonds -- to the likes of John 
Wayne, Elvis Presley, Roy Rogers and Robert Redford. His widow, Bobbie, 81, had 
kept the business going since her husband's death. But as her health 
deteriorated, she decided to close the store and sell it rather than have 
someone take over the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Nudie said Sunday that she will inherit pictures of Nudie's famous 
customers that graced the store's walls. She said she plans to open a 
coffeehouse and display the 1,900 pictures there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure my grandfather is here in spirit," said Jamie, who wore one blue 
and one red boot in honor of her grandfather who did the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans lined up to pay their respects to Nudie's widow, Bobbie, who made her 
grand entrance to the party in her husband's white, custom-made 1975 El Dorado 
convertible. As she entered, the car's cow and horse horn mooed and whinnied 
and the crowd cheered her as "Queen of the West."

 Larry and Alice Richardson came from Castaic to pay homage to the man who made 
Western wear flashy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a lot of his clothes on display at a showcase at the Gene Autry 
Western Heritage Museum," said Larry, who met Nudie in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have bought a few things here ourselves and we just thought we'd come to 
pay our respects."

 Two people were killed Sunday in separate traffic accidents in the Antelope 
Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palmdale woman was killed and three children were hurt when she ran a stop 
sign and crashed into another vehicle about 12:30 p.m., Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose name was not released, was driving north on 55th Street East. 
Witnesses told deputies that the woman did not stop at the stop sign at Avenue 
R-8, and plowed into an eastbound vehicle driven by Charles Rauchfuss, 33, of 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2-year-old girl and 4-year-old boy in the woman's car were taken by

MOBILE HOME OWNERS OPPOSE PROPOSAL; PLANNING: THEY CALL SANTA CLARITA OFFICIALS 
UNSYMPATHETIC. THE NEW LAW WOULD PREVENT UNITS OLDER THAN 10 YEARS FROM BEING 
PLACED ON RESIDENTIAL LOTS. 
</P>

 To Jim Robinson, owning a mobile home in this land of suburban plenty is a 
little like being Rodney Dangerfield: It's hard to get respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, president of the Santa Clarita Area Mobile Home Owners Council, 
contends that residents and officials in the 7-year-old city are more 
interested in housing the affluent than those just getting by. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he says, residents of the city's 16 mobile home parks face 
oppressive attitudes and regulations. To wit: City officials last week began 
drafting a new law that would prevent mobile homes older than 10 years from 
being placed on residential lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're saying is the city of Santa Clarita has outgrown mobile homes 
and we sure wish you guys would die on the vine," Robinson said. "That's the 
attitude we're facing." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law was inspired by the complaints of residents in a 30-year-old 
neighborhood upset that a woman got city permission to put her 15-year-old 
mobile home on a vacant lot in their midst. Much of the neighbors' anger was 
directed at city officials, who said state and local laws left them no choice 
but to approve the woman's permits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the proposed law, neighbors asked city officials to help 
negotiate a deal in which the mobile home owner would sell her property to 
neighborhood residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say they are sympathetic to the concerns of mobile home owners 
and have done much for them since the city incorporated in 1987. But, they add, 
the line has to be drawn somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Property values are one of the things that will be affected when you put 
(this) mobile home in a residential area," Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson said the city has nothing against mobile homes, or even against 
placing them on some residential lots. He said the character of the 
neighborhood and the rules of local homeowner associations must be considered, 
as they would be for any permanent house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Others may be perfectly all right and others may actually improve it," he 
said of the effect of mobile homes on a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tell that to H.P. Alexander, 83, a traditional homeowner visiting a 
friend at the Greenbrier Mobilhome Park. Although he likes his friend, he would 
not want his friend's mobile home next door to his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, a mobile home is a mobile home," Alexander said. "If I told my 
wife we were moving into one, she'd leave me." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said their opinion would depend on the quality of the home and how well 
it was maintained. Many said with exterior additions such as wood paneling or 
stucco, larger mobile homes can be nearly indistinguishable from traditional 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that would bother me as a neighbor is if they didn't mow the lawn," 
said Martin Lackpour, 35, a homeowner with a view of the Canyon Breeze Village 
mobile home park at the bottom of the hill behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are plenty of people in the neighborhood who "look down on the 
people below us because it ruins the scenery," Lackpour added. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile home parks -- like regular neighborhoods -- vary from elite to 
run-down, said Jason Edwards, 52, a contractor who owns six units at the 
Greenbrier park. Expensive parks can have units bigger than many people's 
conventional homes. And they are surrounded by pools and other recreational 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, poor-quality parks house the stereotypical "trailer trash" 
envisioned by many homeowners, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the stigma comes from is people who drive along the side of the road 
and see a run-down trailer with no skirting, dogs are running all over the 
place and a car is upside down beside it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson lives at the Canyon Breeze park with his wife, Patricia, in a 
17-year-old double-wide mobile home that includes an outdoor Jacuzzi with 
fountains among their landscaping. But the couple said the park, and several 
others in the city, could be closed by their owners to make room for more 
expensive permanent housing in the next few years, leaving many with no place 
to put their mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing laws don't protect mobile home dwellers enough from unexpected 
closure, and there is nothing to prevent park owners from increasing space rent 
fees to new tenants, Robinson said. As a result, more mobile home owners could 
end up trying to move into residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are running out of options," he said. "People are trying to find other 
places to live, better places to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar comments made by him at last week's City Council meeting drew the fury 
of at least one council member. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has worked for seven years to give mobile home owners what they 
want, and now what we get from you is a veiled threat that you're all going to 
go out and find a vacant lot to put a mobile home on," Councilwoman Jan Heidt 
told him. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has implemented a rent stabilization ordinance so park owners cannot 
raise rent for existing tenants more than 6% a year, said Rich Henderson, a 
city planner. An ordinance to control rent for new tenants is under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, state law requires mobile home park owners to give at least six months 
notice to tenants before closing and to provide them with the fair cost of 
relocating, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, city officials said extensive help was provided to mobile home 
owners after the Northridge earthquake damaged roughly three-quarters of mobile 
homes within city limits. For example, one Federal Emergency Management Agency 
employee sent to the city was assigned to work exclusively with mobile home 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the earthquake, we had to address the mobile homes coming off 
their foundations," said city planner Kevin Michel. "We got 1,400 of the homes 
approved to get braces throughout the parks. When we have our next earthquake, 
all of our parks will be in a lot better shape to weather the situation."
