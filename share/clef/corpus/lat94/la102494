SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: WORKING PEOPLE; 
ORDER IN THE O.J. COURTROOM:; 'NO INCIDENTS, NOBODY HURT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Three months ago, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. George Smith was named 
supervisor of the 62-person Court Services Division unit that provides bailiffs 
and security for the 36 Superior Court rooms in the downtown Criminal Courts 
building. Smith is a 21-year veteran. One of his first assignments was 
protecting the judge in the 1975 trial of Bill and Emily Harris for the Patty 
Hearst kidnaping. He now finds himself responsible for the orderly running of 
the O.J. Simpson courtroom, including possible sequestration of the jury. He 
talked with JAMES BLAIR about preparing for a complicated, high-profile trial. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You better start planning ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 With the coverage that this case has been getting we've been asked to look at 
what's needed (for) a sequestered jury of 20 to 24 people (including a panel of 
alternates). You've got to think about how they are going to react with one 
another, locked up for an extended period of time, especially if you're talking 
about doing it over a holiday period. 
</P>
<P>
 Logistically, if the jury is sequestered, you want someplace that's 
comfortable and roomy but keeps them gathered in the same group. The optimum is 
to keep them as closely confined as possible and yet give them some space. 
However, you don't want them breaking up into isolated groups, splintering into 
little factions. They have to be kept together because, essentially, they're 
working. You want to make them feel comfortable because they're going to feel 
like they're under a microscope already. It's a tricky thing to do. We don't 
want to intimidate them in any way. All of the deputies we're going to use for 
this have good people skills -- a lot of patience. 
</P>
<P>
 We've surveyed several different hotels that would fit our criteria -- 
distance from the court, number of rooms, how big the jury's going to be. A 
hotel may be available at one time but not at another and then we need a 
secondary. All these things have to be considered. Once we're sure the hotel 
meets our security needs, we'll make a recommendation to the judge and see how 
it fits into the per diem of $90 a day per room and $30-$40 for meals the 
county allows. 
</P>
<P>
 We're planning for any special needs they may have -- if one misses their 
children or has business papers they have to sign or somebody dies in the 
family; or if one gets sick and they have their own special doctor. We have 
provisions to help move them, supervised, so they can continue as best they 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 From past experience, there have been times when juries have been taken to 
amusement parks, movies, shopping. All these activities would have to be 
strictly monitored. You would have to assign a good number of deputies and 
ensure they weren't getting any information other than what the activity called 
for. You can't allow them to come in contact with newspapers, TV or radio. 
</P>
<P>
 I know there are other influences, but when they look at us it's important for 
us to really separate ourselves from either the prosecution or the defense. You 
don't want to make it look like everytime you talk to a prosecutor you're all 
happy and friendly and when you talk to a defense attorney you've got this 
hardened look about you. You do your job professionally in there. You don't 
want these jurors ever getting the idea you're implanting some thought in their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 My main (security) concern is not so much O.J. doing something as somebody 
doing something to O.J. or these very popular attorneys. Usually you have a 
threat (of) the individual on trial doing something whereas in this case you 
(may) have something on the outside coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the situation with the prosecution. I've seen members of the 
public in the courtroom take offense, become incensed, if Bill Hodgman or 
Marcia Clark starts making a point in argument. A disruption? A threat? Who 
knows; but we have to be ready for it. I have a deputy in the back of the 
courtroom and during opening arguments I'll probably put a few more in. That 
place is going to be packed. You're going to have families of the victims and 
defendant. And the statements made at that part of the trial could be a little 
more volatile. The deputies have to keep order in that courtroom -- make sure 
the proceeding goes undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything I do and the decisions I make are based on the information those 
deputies give. That's what makes this work. If something's bothering them, if 
they feel unsafe, there's no hesitation to request additional manpower. They're 
going to get the backup they need.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day I just hope we have been able to carry this whole 
process through -- to provide security that will give Mr. Simpson, the 
prosecution and Judge Ito a trial with no incidents, nobody hurt, no breach of 
security that jeopardizes the outcome of this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds boring, but that's the way I want to see it come out.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PROPOSITION 187; IS 
BLACK-LATINO FRICTION A VOTING-BOOTH ISSUE?; YES: THE INITIATIVE IS HORRIBLE 
LEGISLATION, BUT IT'S STILL A FOCAL POINT FOR LEGITIMATE AFRICAN AMERICAN 
RESENTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ROSS, Kevin Ross is a deputy district attorney in Inglewood and 
political action chairman for the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP. He also 
co-hosts a radio talk show on KACE radio, 103.9 FM, which serves the African 
American community. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Proposition 187 being used as a campaign ploy? Absolutely! Should it be 
defeated? Absolutely! Will large numbers of African Americans vote for it, 
helping ensure its passage? Absolutely! 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because the opponents of the ballot measure, including the 70,000 
protesters who marched a week ago down streets named after Mexicans prominent 
in Los Angeles history, have ignored long-running tensions between the black 
and Latino communities. There is fighting in the high schools and prisons, a 
tenuous gang truce in Venice, a power struggle in Compton. Each of these 
problems has strained relations between two groups scrambling for the crumbs. 
Many black people don't care that Proposition 187 is being financed by racist 
organizations and that minorities are being pitted against one another. If the 
initiative creates a McCarthyite police state, the attitude is, "So be it". 
</P>
<P>
 Latino community leaders cannot have it both ways. They cannot expect the 
African American community to embrace their struggle while they disrespect 
ours. When studies came out about the lack of Latinos on television and in the 
news, many of the people interviewed focused more on the number of blacks on 
the air rather than the bigger problem of who holds the real positions of 
power. When accusations were made of Latino underrepresentation in U.S. Postal 
Service hiring, blacks were the focus of the attention, not the federal 
government. Attempts to rename Martin Luther King Hospital also was another 
example where Latinos have pitted themselves against African Americans. Now 
comes Proposition 187 and blacks are being told that they must join with their 
minority brothers to fight racism? For many, that's a big pill to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 While it must be conceded that Ronald Reagan's voodoo economics is the true 
suspect responsible for tearing the social safety net apart, as Mexican author 
Carlos Fuentes correctly pointed out, this is a labor problem. Forty percent of 
African-American youth are unemployed. When the assertion is made that illegal 
immigrants do the jobs others wouldn't do in the first place, the black 
community is offended. The fact is, when you look at large metropolitan cities 
around the country, it is black women who are doing the cleaning, or working 
for minuscule factory wages. It is the black man who is slinging the food, 
shining the shoes and selling the peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say Proposition 187 is not against illegals, it's against children. For 
African Americans, their children are the driving force behind their support of 
the proposition. Joe Hicks, Executive Director of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference of Los Angeles, recently discussed the initiative at an 
NAACP meeting. In articulating his reasons for joining other prominent African 
American leaders who are against 187, he spoke on how this immigration hysteria 
is really premised on bigotry, racism and scape-goating. But is it in fact 
hysteria, or like the march, a social movement to bring resolution to a deeper 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino community wants to have their cake and eat it, too, and black 
people aren't having it. Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina cannot 
accuse fellow Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke of being racist for trying to 
resolve the problem of day laborers, then ask Burke's constituents to join 
hands with her and sing "Kumbaya" against Proposition 187. The $15 billion in 
federal aid this state receives due to the presence of illegal immigrants is 
still taxpayer money. And for those who insist on comparing African Americans 
with illegal immigrants, that only serves to further alienate potential allies. 
</P>
<P>
 I will be voting no on Proposition 187 because it truly is not the solution to 
the problems associated with immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless opponents of the measure offer other African Americans more than 
what they've come up with, unless they deal with the issues tearing us apart, I 
will be in the minority, my place of origin.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC; 
PERSONAL IDENTITY VERSUS AMERICAN UNITY: AN IMMIGRATION FLASH-POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The immigrant experience in the United States has, in recent years, been 
likened more to a salad bowl than to the old melting pot. Maintaining one's 
national identity, so the theory goes, has replaced the generations-old ideal 
of assimilating into the American experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the melting pot was always as much myth as reality. Certain 
immigrant groups were prohibited from full participation in national life until 
federal immigration reforms were passed by Congress in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a number of factors have conspired to make the salad metaphor more apt, 
not the least of which is new communications technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1965, technology has made migration a different game," says David Yoo, 
a history professor at Claremont McKenna College. "In the 19th Century, making 
a break with your homeland was usually pretty permanent. Today, global 
migration doesn't necessarily represent cutting ties." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble in Armenia? The Armenian community bands together. Fidel Castro 
tightens the screws? The Cuban community demands action. Problems in Central 
America? Unrest in the Middle East? All sides become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only fitting, therefore, that the Haitian community in the United States 
has been riveted by the recent events in Haiti. In today's Community Comment, 
Haitian activist Gerry Gaspard exhorts his small local Haitian community to 
help fellow countrymen rebuild their nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many immigrants before him, however, Gaspard does not advocate wholesale 
return of Haitians to their homes. The help can come in many forms; it does not 
require abandoning a new American lifestyle. It also is indicative of the 
general patterns of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first generation of immigrants inevitably tends to identify more with 
their home country," says Ruth Gim-Chung, a psychologist at Pomona College in 
Claremont. "It is also inevitable that each successive generation will identify 
with America." 
</P>
<P>
 The retention of language, customs and allegiances, however, raises difficult 
questions. Is it better for the entire community for immigrant groups to 
maintain their identity, or should immigrant groups be encouraged to 
assimilate? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we will be a melting pot or a salad bowl is a critical question on 
how well we will pull together and how people think about themselves in these 
isolated groups," says Elizabeth Rolph, a senior political scientist at the 
RAND Corp. in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is assimilation a hotter issue than in California. And there are many, 
even among immigrants, who believe unity is at least as necessary as ethnic 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Margarita Nieto, coordinator of the humanities program at Cal State 
Northridge and a first-generation Mexican American: "I've seen too many people 
becoming nothing more than defenders of their ethnic past. It leads to a great 
deal of unnecessary splintering among groups, and we're only on this planet for 
so long."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: ON CELEBRATING 
HALLOWEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to say a few things in regard to Elaine E. Minamide's article on 
the evils of Halloween ("Bedeviled by Halloween," Oct. 17.) 
</P>
<P>
 When I was married, I participated in a ceremony that in not-so-ancient times 
represented a transfer of "property" from one man -- the father -- to another 
-- the husband. If I had allowed old associations and meanings to ruin it for 
me, I could never have gotten married. 
</P>
<P>
 I think Minamide should not keep her kids from what can be, and mostly is, a 
harmless and even beneficial confrontation of our fears of things imaginary 
(vampires etc.) and things real (death). She could even use this time to talk 
with her children about how death is not to be feared and discuss with them, if 
this is her belief, how "Grandma would never be a ghost because she would be in 
heaven," or whatever she wanted to say. You can take things from an old 
tradition -- even pagan ones -- and make them over into a new celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not acknowledge where humanity has been on its travels rather than recoil 
in fear from everything that reminds you of a pre-Christian past? 
</P>
<P>
 MELANIE MACQUEEN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I feel sorry for Elaine Minamide's daughter, not so much for missing out on 
the innocent fun of Halloween, as for having a parent who presents such a rigid 
(and historically inaccurate) picture of what it means to be a Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Minamide rejects Halloween because of its links to "pagan" (i.e., 
pre-Christian) rites. Apparently, she must also not celebrate Easter with 
images of bunnies, eggs or little chicks, symbols of fertility cults 
celebrating the rebirth of the Earth in spring, or have a Christmas tree at 
Christmas. The use of trees in Christmas festivities first became widely 
popular in 19th Century England but had its roots in Germanic tribes that 
worshiped trees and nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Christians obviously realized that their religion was part of a 
tradition that included many influences, not all of which originated with 
Christ. Many pagan holidays, symbols and practices were incorporated into 
Christianity, sending a message of inclusion, tolerance and respect for the 
differences of others. How sad that this is the part of the message that 
Minamide has missed.

 Proposition 187 is an attack on all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 It would attack our civil rights, it would attack our health, it would attack 
our pocketbooks. Unfortunately, it would not attack illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very disturbing to hear people say that this initiative should be used 
as a way to get even with some other group, particularly members of the Latino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 contains a Pandora's box of ills that will not be limited to 
any single group or community that may be targets of bigotry and revenge. It is 
morally bankrupt, socially corrupt and fiscally unsound. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans, of all Californians, should be wary of Proposition 187 and 
not jump on the bandwagon of an overly simplistic proposal based on bigotry and 
misrepresented as a solution to the serious illegal immigration crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would force the development of a police-state mentality. The 
authors set out to enforce its provisions by requiring American citizens to 
turn anyone whom they found to be "suspect" in to the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not define "suspect" or the criteria that should be used in 
determining who fits that description, but one does not need a crystal ball to 
see how distinctions would be made. "Suspects" are sure to be determined by the 
color of their skin, the way they talk or the sound of their last name. The 
power to determine who is suspect is put in the hands of any person at a school 
or health facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Education Secretary Richard Riley has stated that $450 million in federal 
funds will be withdrawn from the Los Angeles public school system if 
Proposition 187 is approved by voters. This will hurt all students attending 
public schools including African Americans, Asians, Latinos and whites, 
particularly the poor, who are most vulnerable. The school district would lose 
Chapter I funding, which enhances education for poverty-stricken black and 
Latino students attending South Central Los Angeles schools. The state's total 
loss of federal education and health funds would come to $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would deny immunization and other basic health care services 
to illegal immigrants. This would pose a serious health danger to all of us. 
Dangerous diseases have already reached epidemic proportions. This would 
worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 There are credible news reports that link white supremacists and Proposition 
187. The author of the initiative wrote it while he was a paid lobbyist for an 
anti-immigration group bankrolled by the Pioneer Fund. The Pioneer Fund has 
spent millions of dollars over the decades supporting "research" designed to 
prove the genetic superiority of the white race over blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest hoax being perpetrated on California voters, who are justifiably 
upset over the serious problem of illegal immigration, is that Proposition 187 
would solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would do nothing to solve our illegal immigration problem. It 
would do nothing to enforce laws already on the books or add one border guard 
between Mexico and California. And it would not send anyone out of California. 
My African American brothers and sisters should recognize that the current 
"close the border hysteria" will be used against Haitians, black Africans and 
others of our color. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue that we need to send a message, but Proposition 187 is not a 
telegram. It is a real law with real repercussions. Do not take my word for it. 
It is all in your voters pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
 If you read your pamphlet, you will also find that Proposition 187 would throw 
300,000 school-children out of our classrooms and onto our streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, it does not send them anywhere. It just throws them out of schools. 
Many will then learn the lessons of the streets -- gangbanging, violence and 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is wrong no matter how you look at it. But add in the City of 
Los Angeles, struggling to bring together the most diverse population in the 
world, and you have a disaster in the making.

HURT HUMPHRIES WATCHES BRONCOS STEP ON CHARGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Denver Broncos knocked off the NFL's only remaining unbeaten team, handing 
the San Diego Chargers their first loss in seven games, 20-15, Sunday before a 
sellout crowd of 61,626 at Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made more mistakes today than we did all six games," said Charger 
quarterback Stan Humphries, who watched his team's final five plays from the 
sideline after suffering a freak ankle injury on the last drive. "It's not nice 
to lose, but maybe a little pressure is off us now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, who overcame a 17-point deficit to defeat the Broncos, 37-34, in 
their season opener, had a chance to pull it out, driving to the Broncos' 
31-yard line with 1:48 remaining. However, Humphries suffered a severely 
sprained left ankle when accidentally stepped on by one of his blockers, and 
reserve quarterback Gale Gilbert, who hadn't thrown a pass in a regular season 
game since Dec. 30, 1990, threw four consecutive incomplete passes. Not that 
Humphries had enjoyed a stellar effort. He threw three interceptions, one more 
than he had thrown in the first six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he's OK, but I felt a little better when Humphries went out," said 
Bronco wide receiver Shannon Sharpe, who caught six passes for 121 yards, 
including a 43-yard touchdown. "They were bringing a guy in who had been 
sitting on the sideline the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 After connecting with running back Ronnie Harmon on a 14-yard pass play to the 
Bronco 31, Gilbert didn't complete another pass. After misfiring on a pass to 
wide receiver Mark Seay on first down, Gilbert tried to hit wide receiver Shawn 
Jefferson in the end zone, but Bronco cornerback Ben Smith knocked the ball 
away. Denver ran out the clock after Gilbert misfired on two consecutive 
sideline passes to wide receiver Tony Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Shawn was interfered with," Gilbert said. "Everybody was running go 
routes on that one. And then on third and fourth I had Tony (Martin) on the 
sideline and I didn't hit either one of them. I just missed him. . . . Shoot, I 
was warmed up. I was ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, the AFC's top-rated quarterback, had his worst game of the season, 
completing only 17 of 33 passes for 142 yards as the Chargers failed to score a 
touchdown despite starting two drives inside the Denver 21 after Bronco 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do anything we didn't expect," Humphries said. "We expected most 
of what they did. They played well today and we didn't play well. We didn't 
have the best football game we've played this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been making the mistakes and that's why we've been winning, but 
today we made the mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries was hurt when Bronco defensive end Simon Fletcher pushed Charger 
tackle Stan Brock into Humphries' left leg while trying to get to Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries said he doesn't think the injury will keep him out of Sunday's game 
against the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's just a sprained ankle," he said. "I guess you could call it a 
severely sprained ankle. I'm putting a little pressure on it, but for a while 
it was real numb. Now that I've taken the tape off, it's a little sore." 
</P>
<P>
 Off to their worst start in 30 years, the Broncos, who had lost three of their 
first six games by three points, including last Monday night's 31-28 loss to 
the Kansas City Chiefs, finally pulled out a close game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in a lot of these (close games) every weekend and today we finally 
got over the hump," said Bronco quarterback John Elway, who completed 22 of 31 
passes for 241 yards with one touchdown. "We've got nine games left and I'm 
certainly not going to hang everything on just one game, but it's nice to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Denver Coach Wade Phillips: "Today we felt we were going to find out 
whether we had a good football team that's had some bad things happen, or a bad 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we answered that."

THE RAIDERS GO FROM SNARLING TO SMILING, 30-17; PRO FOOTBALL: A WEEK OF 
CONTROVERSY IS FORGOTTEN AS HOSTETLER AND SHELL ENJOY VICTORY OVER FALCONS.

 Jeff Hostetler knew the blitz was coming. Quarterbacks can sense that sort of 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the first wave of on-rushing media attacked receiver Tim Brown after 
Sunday's game and asked him about the Raider play-calling, Hostetler took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let it go," he yelled over his shoulder as he disappeared through the locker 
room door. "Let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler made it halfway down the Coliseum tunnel before he realized he had 
left his wallet behind. 
</P>
<P>
 So back he came, agreeing to sit down and talk about a subject that obviously 
remains sore, even in the afterglow of Sunday's 30-17 victory over the Atlanta 
Falcons at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rough week," he explained, cracking a smile in public for the first 
time in seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 That it was. But for the first time in weeks, there was plenty for him to 
smile about Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders won decisively, before a sparse crowd of 42,192. Hostetler, Coach 
Art Shell and offensive coordinator Tom Walsh were apparently back in 
agreement, the Raider offense running smoothly and effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams was back in the starting lineup for the first time since his 
days as a Kansas City Chief, gaining a game-high 107 yards, the first 
100-yard-plus rushing performance by a Raider in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider offensive line, despite the presence of two new faces, was back to 
being a cohesive unit, opening holes for Williams in the face of an eight-man 
Atlanta front, and closing those holes when Hostetler needed protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense was back to peak efficiency after letting down in overtime 
last week in Miami. The Raiders picked off two passes, both by cornerback 
Lionel Washington, who got additional playing time because of Atlanta's use of 
three and, occasionally, four wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory kept the Raiders in the hunt for a possible playoff spot and 
relieved the tension of a week of controversy over the play-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 That controversy had erupted on the sideline in Miami a week ago in a shouting 
match between Hostetler and Shell after Hostetler had changed two plays in the 
huddle. The two had talked during the week, but questions lingered about 
Hostetler's relationship with Walsh and Hostetler's freedom to improvise on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 So does Hostetler retain the power to change plays when necessary?. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a feel for the game out there," he said. "It was something we were 
able to work out during the week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders worked out a game plan that seemed perfect for the defense they 
faced. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step was starting Williams over Ty Montgomery, a move that seemed 
about seven weeks overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has promised big things since he signed with the Raiders in the 
off-season. This might not have been the best opportunity to deliver on that 
promise, considering that both offensive tackles were making their first starts 
of the season, Robert Jenkins on the left side for injured Gerald Perry and 
Greg Skrepenak on the right for slumping Bruce Wilkerson. 
</P>
<P>
 But it all worked, Williams' quickness and durability enabling him to carry 27 
times and open up the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can carry about 10 more times," he told Shell toward the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't necessary because Hostetler was able to deliver on the promise he 
had shown a year ago when he proved adept at picking defenses apart with a 
versatile passing game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, who has struggled some this year even when he was pleased with the 
play-calling, was back to finding the open man, including Brown, his favorite 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler completed 21 of 30 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns, of 20 
and 31 yards to Brown, who wound up catching a season-high eight passes for 130 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler also took advantage of his backs, completing an additional eight 
passes to Williams and three more to fullback Tom Rathman. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was a far cry from the way Sunday's game began for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons' Norm Johnson opened the scoring with a 23-yard field goal on the 
opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 After the kickoff, the Raiders had the ball on their 45-yard line. Hostetler 
faded back to pass, but never saw safety Roger Harper blitzing from the left 
side. Harper hit Hostetler, the ball popped out and Falcon lineman Chuck Smith 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the Raider controversy going to start all over again? 
</P>
<P>
 It sure seemed so when Atlanta drove to the Raider one-yard line and Craig 
Heyward powered his way into the end zone from there, giving Atlanta a 10-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Williams scored on a one-yard run. Then, when a diving Albert Lewis got 
a piece of Harold Alexander's punt, causing it to flutter for only 17 yards, 
Hostetler and Brown were able to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jeff Jaeger kicked a 46-yard field goal in the third quarter, the Raider 
lead stood at 24-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta quarterback Jeff George then threw a three-yard touchdown pass to 
Terance Mathis to close the gap to seven points at the start of the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jaeger's 31-yard field goal made it 27-17, Lewis knocked George out of 
the game for one play with a sack that resulted in a hip injury for the Atlanta 
quarterback. Enter Bobby Hebert, whose one and only pass was intercepted by 
Washington, setting up Jaeger's 24-yard field goal to close out the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 In dropping the Falcons to 4-4, the Raiders outgained them 313 yards to 255 
and kept the ball for 32:32, enabling their defense to finally enjoy a breather 
after weeks of carrying the team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a smooth ending to a rough week. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems and obstacles certainly remain, but for one day at least, the smile 
was back on Hostetler's face. 
</P>
<P>
 And the offense was back in the Raider game plan.

NEW JACK OF CLUBS GETS UPPER HAND IN SENIOR CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ralphs Senior Classic? Now it's the tournament that Jack won. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Jack Kiefer, a 54-year-old from New Jersey who never played the 
PGA Tour and never won a tournament on the PGA Senior Tour -- at least until 
Sunday at Rancho Park. 
</P>
<P>
 All Kiefer did was shoot a 63 to complete his second consecutive bogey-free 
round and hold off a record-tying performance by defending champion Dale 
Douglass to win his first pro title by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it was a fine day for the one-time club pro and former driving 
range owner. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was his best, mainly because when it was over he picked up the 
winner's check of $112,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time," said Kiefer, who said he was overcome with emotion 
afterward. "I'm holding it together pretty good right now." 
</P>
<P>
 He really held it together with a club in his hand. Kiefer's 197 total was 
16-under par, but only one stroke better than Douglass, who tied the senior 
tour record and set a course record with a 61. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglass, who began the day six shots behind leader Jim Dent, shot 29 on the 
final nine holes and needed only 12 putts. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dent faded, failing to take part in the normal birdie barrage, Douglass 
moved quickly into contention. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally caught Kiefer with a birdie on the par-three 17th when he rolled in 
a 15-foot putt. Kiefer, standing on the 14th tee, knew he had to do something 
if he was going to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of birdies out there," Kiefer said. "Thank goodness I had 
enough of them to hold up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiefer went out and birdied No. 14 when he hit an eight-iron to within 12 feet 
of the hole and made the putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglass was still one shot back, but only for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglass closed with a flourish. He knocked his drive on 18 into the right 
rough with trees in front, but he was able to hook his second shot onto the 
green and knock in a 12-footer to again tie Kiefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiefer won with his birdie on the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 His second shot, a nine-iron, stopped two feet short of the hole. When Kiefer 
rolled in the putt, he had a one-shot lead, which was good news. Douglass was 
off the course, which was even better news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very happy he ran out of holes," Kiefer said. "He really came out of 
nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is where Dent wound up. After playing the four par-five holes Saturday 
in five-under, Dent played them in two-under on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent finished with a 71 and in a seven-way tie for fourth at 202 with Tony 
Jacklin and others. Jim Colbert's final-round 66 put him in third place at 201. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again Rancho Park proved to be a golfer's best friend. There were 38 more 
rounds shot in the 60s, for a three-day total of 108. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 858 birdies and 26 eagles in three rounds and the average score was 
69.7, the lowest for any tournament on a par-71 course on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiefer took advantage of the setup, although he began the day with a case of 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more nervous than I've ever been on the senior tour," he said. "I was 
three shots back, but I felt like if I could get a good start, I would have a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 He followed his strategy perfectly. Kiefer birdied five of the first six holes 
to catch Dent and made birdie putts of 30, 20 and 25 feet. When his 15-foot 
birdie putt dropped in the hole at No. 9, Kiefer took the lead and never 
trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He birdied two holes after I tied him, so he did real good," Douglass said. 
"I'm glad to see him win." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiefer won several state titles in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but he made 
only one try at qualifying for the regular PGA Tour. He failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't good enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't feel that way about playing the senior tour. He quit as a club 
pro and earned his senior tour exemption in 1990 when he finished second to 
Simon Hobday at the senior qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 His best finish until Sunday was a second in 1992 at the Bruno's Memorial 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiefer's day still was not complete. He had to finish while Douglass waited in 
the hospitality tent to see if Kiefer would falter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiefer played 18 safely and two-putted from 25 feet for par, the second one a 
2 1/2-foot comebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little longer than I wanted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly like the wait for his first victory.

SAINTS' LONGEST MARCHES MADE BY KICK RETURNER; PRO FOOTBALL: RUNBACKS OF 92 AND 
98 YARDS BY HUGHES HELP NEW ORLEANS HOLD OFF RAMS, 37-34. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Kharee Bailey, who was born in the early hours Sunday, will have his birthday 
noted in the NFL record book compliments of his father, Robert, whose teammates 
are more likely to remember Tyrone Hughes' exploits for the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, the NFC's Pro Bowl specialist as a rookie last season, broke two NFL 
records after returning kickoffs 92 and 98 yards for touchdowns to offset 
Bailey's 103-yard punt return and lift the Saints to a 37-34 victory over the 
Rams before 47,908 in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, with 304 yards on seven runbacks, broke Wally Triplett's 1950 mark of 
294 yards in kickoff returns for Detroit, which also came against the Rams. His 
347 yards in combined punt and kickoff return yardage bested the previous mark 
of 294 yards by Triplett and Ram returner Woodley Lewis (1953). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams and Saints combined for 688 yards in punt and kickoff returns in a 
circus-like game that also featured Toby Wright's 98-yard fumble return for a 
Ram score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four plays for more than 90 yards, well, I don't know if I've ever been in a 
game like this," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "And I've been in a lot of games." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett, making his first start against his former team, began a punishing 
day for the Rams (3-5) with two first-quarter scoring drives, which included 
eight of eight passing and a 30-yard touchdown throw to tight end Wesley Walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vengeance is a . . . " Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Everett: "I wanted to score in the first quarter. That was very important 
for us. There was a lot riding on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, who completed 17 of 26 passes for 206 yards, held the ball high above 
his head at game's end while taking congratulations from Ram center Tom 
Newberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everett didn't beat us," Ram safety Anthony Newman said. "He wasn't back 
there doing a Randall Cunningham, running around and throwing bombs. They 
scored 14 points off kickoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 After Everett helped the Saints to the lead, the Rams went on to lose starting 
quarterback Chris Miller, cornerback Darryl Henley, linebacker Shane Conlan, 
wide receiver Todd Kinchen and offensive line coach Jim Erkenbeck because of 
injuries and, in Kinchen's case, ejection for fighting. Miller, who suffered a 
concussion, was kept overnight in a local hospital for observation, team 
doctors said, and Erkenbeck, who was accidentally knocked down on the sideline 
by Saint safety J.J. McCleskey, returned with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who was knocked to the turf by linebacker Ernest Dixon after throwing 
a pass to running back Howard Griffith near the end of the first quarter, 
played until halftime, completing five of his next eight passes with two 
interceptions and a 19-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller couldn't remember the plays during halftime discussions, and after 
being replaced by Chris Chandler to start the third quarter, he began to have 
problems with his vision and was also unable to handle the noise in the 
Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 While Miller and Erkenbeck were transported to the hospital, the Rams played 
on and tried to overcome Hughes' heroics and a 37-20 fourth-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Bailey's seven-yard touchdown run with 8:38 to play brought the Rams to 
within 10 points of the Saints, and then after using all three timeouts to make 
a defensive stand, the Rams forced the Saints to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Barnhardt's kick landed in the end zone, and the ball appeared on its 
way past the end line for a touchback. But as the Saints and most of the Rams 
began walking off the field, the ball suddenly bounced back, away from the end 
line. While the Saints' defense and the Rams' offense began to make its way 
onto the field, Bailey picked up the rolling football and began running. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something special teams coach Wayne Sevier talks about almost every 
day," Bailey said. "He always says if the ball is not touched, then you can 
run. I saw everybody running off the field, so I figured I can't lose anything 
by picking it up. I knew I had to get to the 20, and after that I never looked 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's a good thing I stayed for the game. When I got the call from my 
wife that she was ready to have our son last night, I talked to Coach Knox 
about flying home, but the airport was closed. I didn't really get much sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's alert return, which broke the NFL mark of 98 yards held by a number 
of players, would have certainly left the Saints with many a sleepless night 
had it brought the Rams back to win. The Saints, stunned by the bizarre play, 
argued incorrectly that the ball had bounced beyond the end line and out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys swore a whistle had blown," said Saint Coach Jim Mora, who 
criticized the officials for several calls. 
</P>
<P>
 After closing to within a field goal of the Saints with 4:08 to play, the Rams 
didn't get the ball back until only 22 seconds remained. They took possession 
at their 40 and needed more than 20 yards to get Tony Zendejas, the NFL's 
all-time field-goal percentage leader from beyond 50 yards, in position. But on 
first down, Chandler was sacked for a five-yard loss, and on second down with 
19 seconds to play, Chandler's pass for Flipper Anderson was tipped by 
cornerback Selwyn Jones and intercepted by teammate Jimmy Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, that was a wild, wild sucker," said Mora, whose record against 
the Rams is 13-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints took a 14-0 lead, remained ahead, 17-7, after the first of three 
Morten Andersen field goals and were poised to put the game away inside the 
Rams' one-yard line midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On second and goal, running back Lorenzo Neal attempted to bull his way over 
the right side. While Neal headed to the ground, safety Marquez Pope caught him 
from behind and knocked the ball loose. Television replays failed to show if 
Neal was down when he fumbled, but Ram safety Tony Wright didn't care; he 
picked up the ball, avoided Everett's tackle attempt at the 12-yard line and 
went 98 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "After talking to the line judge, we decided that the ballcarrier was lying on 
top of players, that forward progress had not stopped," referee Johnny Grier 
said. "The ball came loose. That is a live ball at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams celebrated and Hughes prepared to enter the record books. "On Hughes' 
first kickoff return, I was out of position," Ram cornerback Todd Lyght said. 
"The first one was my fault." 
</P>
<P>
 The second, which came after the Rams had closed to within 10 points of the 
Saints, looked a lot like the first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we had some coverage problems on our kickoff team," Knox said.

 Amy Alcott is stuck on 29 victories, one shy of the number needed to qualify 
for the LPGA Hall of Fame. She got a rude reminder during a tournament in 
Nashville, Tenn.  
</P>
<P>
 "I opened the door in my hotel and I was trying to get my newspaper," Alcott 
recalled in Golf Digest. "I didn't have any clothes on and I figured it was 
safe because it was 5:45 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm standing there naked and there is this guy standing there going, 'I hope 
you win your 30th soon.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the guy and said, 'Thanks. How did you know it was me?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Oh, I'd recognize you anywhere.' "

 Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for most pass receptions in a season?

 "This is a team that once tried a college of coaches, that resisted the 
electric light bulb (night games) until it was sure it was not just a fad, that 
treats failure like an annuity."

<P>
 Sideshow: Eccentric Dennis Rodman of the San Antonio Spurs regards himself as 
a showman. "I keep things on edge. People come to see me so they can see 
something different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it. These days Rodman has fuschia-colored hair and body 
piercings, including one in his navel and one in his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Thud!Ronnie Lott, the veteran New Jork Jet defensive back, describes in a book 
"Total Impact" his approach to the game: 
</P>
<P>
 "Grab a football, throw it in the air, and before you can catch it, have your 
best friend belt you with a baseball bat. No shoulder pads. No helmet. Just 
you, your best friend and the biggest Louisville Slugger you can find. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what it feels like to be hit by me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bear hunting: USC's 61-0 blowout of California on Saturday wasn't the largest 
margin of victory over the Golden Bears in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Jones' Thundering Herd team routed Cal, 74-0, at the Coliseum in 1930.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

 How wacky was the Saints' 37-34 victory over the Rams on Sunday in New 
Orleans?. . . Jim Everett wasn't mentioned until the 15th paragraph of the 
Associated Press' game story. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Everett's spot of revenge was lost in the commotion over kickoff returns for 
touchdowns of 92 and 98 yards by teammate Tyrone Hughes, a 98-yard run with a 
fumble by the Rams' Toby Wright, and something really bizarre, a 103-yard punt 
return by the Rams' Robert Bailey. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The day after USC's Cole Ford put nine consecutive kickoffs into the 
California end zone and had none returned, Hughes was able to take advantage of 
the new NFL rules that work against the kicker. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 NFL Films will have a treasure in the clip that shows Bailey coming out of the 
end zone and running the length of the field untouched while the Saints, who 
thought the punt had been whistled dead for a touchback, strolled to their 
bench. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Everett, who had a pretty nice day staying on his feet and throwing 
the ball, will get a little more attention when the Saints play the Raiders 
Nov. 20 at the Coliseum and the Rams Dec. 4 at Anaheim Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In recording their first Coliseum victory of the season, the Raiders were 
unusually efficient against Atlanta. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They didn't commit a turnover after their first scrimmage play and were 
penalized only 31 yards, compared to 70 for the Falcons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 About all the coach, Art Shell, and the quarterback, Jeff Hostetler, appeared 
to exchange on the sidelines were handshakes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The play calling was the Raiders' best this season and their new starter at 
tailback, Hundred-Yard Harvey Williams, had his workload increased. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If you are a believer in the law of averages, the Denver Broncos' narrow 
victory over the San Diego Chargers didn't come as a surprise. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Robinson tried to downplay USC's victory over Washington on opening day. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a good team right now," the coach said Sept. 3. "I think we will be 
in November." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans appear to be a trifle ahead of schedule, having devoured 
California, 61-0, on the third Saturday of October at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Their next game is in November -- on the 5th at Pullman against Washington 
State after taking a week off. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most remarkable statistic of a young team that is becoming more efficient 
every week is that it hasn't committed a turnover in the last 15 quarters. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Now for the quarterback situation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If it's a controversy, it's the kind that most coaches would like to have. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson probably will start against Washington State -- remember, his 
injured ankle will have an extra week to heal -- but Robinson won't hesitate to 
summon Brad Otton again if necessary. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Otton, the sophomore transfer from Weber State, has shown uncommon poise and a 
strong, accurate throwing arm the past three games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference race that appeared to be narrowing down to Arizona 
and Washington State now includes USC and Oregon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans and Ducks must be encouraged by the way UCLA's Wayne Cook was able 
to pass against the Desert Swarm defense in Tucson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Bruins would have been competitive down to the wire if their 
secondary hadn't broken down on some key third-down situations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Getting his kicks was UCLA punter Darren Schager, who averaged 48 yards on 
seven punts and kept pinning the Wildcats deep in their territory. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 Game of the Week: Arizona at Oregon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, which lost to Minnesota, has gone from one of the most surprising 
teams in the nation to one of the most disappointing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect Scott Bentley, the Florida State kicker who appeared on the cover 
of Sports Illustrated before he ever played in a college game, to make any 
magazine cover again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam has moved to the head of the class of 
Heisman Trophy candidates, at least for the moment. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but Ohio State Coach John Cooper, who poured it on against Purdue, 
never seems to get the opportunity against Michigan.

GOLF ROUNDUP; EAGLE ON 16 HELPS LIETZKE WIN LAS VEGAS INVITATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran Bruce Lietzke, 43, scored a one-stroke victory Sunday in the 
$1.5-million Las Vegas Invitational and earned a place in next week's 
season-ending $3-million Tour Championship in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Lietzke shot a closing seven-under-par 65 on the TPC at Summerlin, for a 332 
total, 27 under in the five-day, 90-hole event. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th victory of his 20-year career was secured on a 232-yard two-iron shot 
on the 560-yard, par-five 16th. It landed about four feet from the cup, set up 
the go-ahead eagle and was worth $270,000, more than doubling Lietzke's 
earnings for the year to $483,926. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gamez, a 26-year-old Las Vegas resident, came up short as his 
five-birdie finish led to a final-round 64, and a 333 total. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Watts, the 1987 U.S. collegiate champion, shook off a bogey at the first 
hole and a double-bogey at the 11th and won the $1.2-million Bridgestone Open 
by three strokes at Chiba, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts shot a par 72 in the final round for a 72-hole total of 14-under 274, 
scoring his fourth victory of the season in Japan. He earned $216,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Calcavecchia, the 1989 British Open champion, fired the day's best score, 
a six-under 66, and finished second at 277. Australian Roger Mackay shot a 68 
for 278 and was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Price, the 1994 British Open and U.S. PGA champion, finished in a 
fourth-place tie at 279 after a closing 70 over the 7,110-yard Sodegaura 
Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The United States dominated Sunday's singles play to avenge the stunning 
defeat of 1992 and reclaim the Solheim Cup with a 13-7 victory over Europe in 
the women's match play team competition at White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. The 
U.S. team won eight of 10 singles matches at The Greenbrier to break what had 
been a 5-5 deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory means that the crystal trophy, which Mickey Walker's European team 
won in a 1992 upset victory at the Dalmahoy Golf and Country Club, will remain 
in the United States until the two sides meet again in Wales in 1996.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; EARNHARDT MAKES IT A LUCKY 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was only one important ingredient missing Sunday after Dale Earnhardt 
wrapped up his record-tying seventh Winston Cup championship with a victory in 
the AC Delco 500 at Rockingham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dedicate this year to Neil Bonnett," said Earnhardt, lamenting the death of 
Bonnett in a crash at Daytona in February and the serious injuries suffered by 
Ernie Irvan in a crash in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my best friend and it's been a tough year, with Ernie's deal and all, 
and it's tough going through some of these things without him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Earnhardt quickly got his emotions in check and began to enjoy an 
accomplishment that most racing people didn't think possible -- tying Richard 
Petty's season-championship mark, which he set in 1979 with his seventh title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been just kind of putting it out of my mind that I could tie Richard 
Petty's championship record," Earnhardt said. "I knew what it would mean, but I 
can't take nothing away from Richard Petty. He's still the king. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done it all. He pioneered this thing and got us to where we are today." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt got some help in clinching the championship when Rusty Wallace, his 
closest pursuer, was ambushed by a mid-race engine failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the checkered flag waved for Earnhardt's 63rd career victory, the 
biggest cheer from the record crowd at North Carolina Motor Speedway came on 
lap 302 when Wallace slowed and drove to the garage area, virtually handing 
Earnhardt the title that tied Petty's NASCAR record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably dropped a valve," Wallace said. "He ran a great race this year 
and he deserves to win the championship with reliability like that. We can't 
win the championship with me wrecking the cars and the motors blowing up like 
that. But that's racing and we'll go after them again next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, whose previous championships came in 1980, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1991 
and 1993, entered Sunday's race an almost-insurmountable 321 points ahead of 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt led 104 of the 492 laps, including the final 77, but had to hold off 
Rick Mast, who was trying to earn his first Winston Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kalitta clinched his first Winston top fuel championship at the ninth 
annual Chief Auto Parts Nationals in Ennis, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kalitta lost in the semifinals and Don Prudhomme won the event, 
Kalitta collected enough points to eliminate Prudhomme from the title picture 
heading into this weekend's Winston Select Finals at Pomona, the season finale 
in the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series.

WATTERS HAS BIG DAY, BUT IT'S BAD ONE FOR DILFER; NFC: RUNNING BACK LEADS THE 
49ERS TO 41-16 VICTORY; THE BUCCANEER ROOKIE QUARTERBACK IS LIMITED TO SEVEN 
COMPLETIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ricky Watters broke out of a slump by running for 108 yards and two touchdowns 
and San Francisco's defense frustrated Trent Dilfer in his first start as the 
49ers routed Tampa Bay, 41-16, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said we should beat Tampa Bay. We beat them," Watters said. "They said 
we should win big. We won big. We took care of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young completed 20 of 26 passes for 255 yards and one touchdown in a 
quietly efficient outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Watters' running mate, rookie fullback William Floyd, ignited San Francisco's 
17-point third quarter with a one-yard scoring run as the 49ers (6-2) pulled 
away for their ninth consecutive victory over Tampa Bay (2-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer, the Buccaneers' top draft pick out of Fresno State, completed seven of 
23 for 45 yards and was intercepted once, but had receivers drop several of his 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had high hopes," Dilfer said. "I thought we'd execute well on offense. I 
thought we'd play a lot better game than we did and I thought I would play a 
lot better game than I did." 
</P>
<P>
 The outing nevertheless was an improvement over his last effort, when he came 
on for Craig Erickson and threw three interceptions during a two-minute span 
Oct. 9 against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The roles were reversed Sunday as Erickson came on to play the final 13 
minutes. He led the Buccaneers to a pair of scores, completing two-point 
conversions after each of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Watters, who struggled behind San Francisco's injury-ravaged offensive line 
earlier this season, produced the eighth 100-yard rushing game of his career, 
but the first this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had four receptions for 64 yards and averaged 7.7 yards on his 14 
carries after entering the game with a per-carry average of 3.2. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are coming back," Watters said, noting guard Jesse Sapolu and tackle 
Steve Wallace are both back from injuries. Tackle Harris Barton and guard Ralph 
Tamm are nearly ready to return. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustrated Buccaneers were called for several penalties for 
unsportsmanlike conduct, and tight end Tyji Armstrong and 49er linebacker Gary 
Plummer were ejected after a third-quarter fight.

EXPECTATIONS AND COWBOYS BEAT CARDINALS; NFC: DALLAS HAS TO DO WITHOUT 
QUARTERBACK TROY AIKMAN IN RALLYING AGAINST ARIZONA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan let the football world see him sweat Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Large beads dripped from his nose to his chin to his shirt as he stood in the 
searing heat of Sun Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This was it. Midway through his first season as coach of the Arizona 
Cardinals, this was his chance to show a league full of skeptics that they are 
the fools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys were falling through the ropes, and his Cardinals were 
standing above them with a half-crazed smile. There were 14 minutes left, his 
team led by a touchdown, the Cowboys' All-Pro quarterback was wearing jeans and 
a sport shirt, and there should have been nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
 And then it happened: a nine-minute stretch that gave the Cowboys a 28-21 
victory and defined the league's most controversial regime in four words. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddyball is all talk.  
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelmed by the courage of backup quarterback Rodney Peete and the 
acrobatics of receivers Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper, Ryan's vaunted defense 
yielded 159 yards and two scores during those nine minutes to drop his team to 
2-5 and probably out of the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The raucous crowd of 71,023, which began the game by screaming at the Cowboys 
and pelting them with ice, was left motionless and mute. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-hitting Cardinals, who had knocked two Cowboys out of the game and 
bloodied several others, held their heads and limped away. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fighter suddenly looked like an old man. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan jogged from the field without shaking the hand of winning coach Barry 
Switzer. That much was not new; he is the league's only coach who refuses this 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 When he spoke a few minutes later, he was red-faced, raspy and humble. 
</P>
<P>
 That much was new. 
</P>
<P>
 "At halftime (with the score 14-14), I told my guys that playing these guys 
close wasn't good enough," Ryan said. "I told them that these were the 
defending champions and that only by beating them can we prove we belong in 
their league." 
</P>
<P>
 He shook his head. "I guess this proves we don't belong with the big boys." 
</P>
<P>
 At least not with Irvin, 6 feet 2, and Harper, 6 feet 3. 
</P>
<P>
 After batting a pass from Peete out of the air and catching it at the back of 
the end zone to pull the Cowboys into a halftime tie, Irvin and Peete tied the 
game again with 13:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Peete, who took over in the first period after Aikman suffered a concussion, 
found Irvin at the Cardinal 45-yard line, where Irvin caught the ball and 
smartly cut inside cornerback James Williams before running untouched into the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was Harper's turn. The Cowboy defense held the Cardinals to four 
plays, then took over and drove 79 yards in nine plays thanks to 47 yards worth 
of catches by Harper against Williams, including a lunging 38-yard reception. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Cardinal six-yard line, Emmitt Smith bounced behind reserve guard and 
injured tackle Ron Stone and injured tackle Mark Tuinei before running into the 
corner of the end zone with the eventual winning score with 5:13 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was asked if he remembered when Ryan -- before his Cardinals were 
outscored, 66-24, in two games against the Cowboys this season -- said nobody 
could run on his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I didn't run, did I?" he asked after gaining 98 rushing yards in two 
games with Arizona. "But, I mean, so what? We all should know the bottom line 
is not whether you run or catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Unspoken was that Ryan does not know. Because the bottom line is precisely 
where Ryan has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pros are consistent," Ryan admitted. "Amateurs are hot and cold." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little doubt in which category he would place his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of this season the Cardinals have been beaten by the NFC's second-worst 
offense, whose troubles have proven that Ryan knows little about that side of 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 But for once Sunday, the offense survived, outgained only 312-305 by the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got beat by our defense today. We got beat by using a three-deep zone 
today, and that is almost impossible," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this, we needed this," Cardinal linebacker Eric Hill said while 
rubbing a bloodied, bandaged nose. "This game could have given us such an edge. 
This hurts so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the most physical games in the league this season, it hurt both 
teams. In Aikman's case, the pain came from a shot to the head by flying 
linebacker Wilber Marshall on the Cowboys' first possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least it proves that Williams, at 5 feet 10, doesn't belong with the big 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hit by Marshall, Aikman stood, rattled his helmet with his hand, 
then two plays later threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Harper against Williams 
for the game's first score. 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing thing wasn't the pass, but that Aikman was only vaguely certain of 
where he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Team doctors knew Aikman could not play when they asked him the day, date and 
year . . . . and his only answer was "Sunday." He is expected to return for 
next week's game against the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 At this rate, look for Buddyball sometime next year.

HEATH WHO? FREROTTE LEADS REDSKINS, 41-27; INTERCONFERENCE: ROOKIE QUARTERBACK, 
WITH HELP FROM ELLARD AND OTHER VETERANS, DELIVERS VICTORY OVER COLTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His veteran teammates made Gus Frerotte's first NFL start look easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Frerotte, the 197th player taken in this year's draft and starting in place of 
injured first-round pick Heath Shuler, passed for 226 yards and two touchdowns 
Sunday as the Washington Redskins defeated the Indianapolis Colts, 41-27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't real nervous. I was a little shaky at first," said Frerotte, who 
fumbled a snap on the first possession. "Anybody's going to be nervous in their 
first NFL start. After that fumble, though, things seemed to settle down and I 
played well after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to give credit to everybody around me," the rookie from Tulsa 
added. "They played great games. The line did a great job and the receivers 
were catching the ball. You can't ask for more than that. I just put it where I 
was supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ellard, the NFC leader in reception yardage, caught six of Frerotte's 
passes for 108 yards and set up the first of two touchdown runs by Ricky 
Ervins. Then pass interceptions off the Colts' Jim Harbaugh by Martin Bayless 
and Andre Collins -- and one off backup Don Majkowski by Lamont Hollinquest -- 
led to three more scores as the Redskins (2-6) ended a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they would come more (on blitzes)," Frerotte said. "But we were 
ready for anything, I think. We were prepared to take the blitz on, and they 
didn't bring it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Redskins ended a six-game slide with a 30-24 victory over the 
Colts at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard, the former Ram signed as a free agent this year, is eighth in 
reception yardage with 10,539. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have to tell him anything," the 12-year veteran said. "We were 
talking about certain routes, but everything was going well. It wasn't like we 
had to talk about it, just execute." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of Ellard's receptions were for at least 19 yards. Frerotte also 
connected with Tydus Winans on a 51-yard pass play that set up Chip Lohmiller's 
first field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offensive line did a great job getting Gus enough time to sit back, take 
his reads and throw the ball," Ellard said. "He was a little nervous (after the 
fumble), but you couldn't notice it really in the huddle, because he's a quiet, 
laid-back kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Colt Coach Ted Marchibroda was understandably annoyed at the Colts' inability 
to stop Frerotte. "Washington played a smart football game. I don't feel a 
rookie quarterback should score that many points against us. And I think we 
gave him some of those points," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our initial thought was to put some pressure on the kid, put it on him early. 
But we were unable to do so. They did a good job picking the blitz up, and he 
wasn't rushed, he stood in the pocket well and made the throws he had to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Frerotte was 17 of 32 with no sacks and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis (3-5) helped Washington with two pass interference penalties in 
the end zone, both setting up touchdowns.

 The Detroit Lions, criticized for their inability to make big plays, came 
through splendidly on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, who had gone three consecutive games without forcing a turnover, 
intercepted three passes and Chris Spielman returned a fumble 25 yards for his 
first career touchdown in a 21-16 victory over the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions also got a key play from the special teams, which had come under 
heavy criticism in the last two losses, as Mel Gray returned a kickoff 102 
yards for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing is we made a bunch of big plays by a lot of people," Spielman 
said. "We talked about how we haven't been making any (turnovers), and bam! " 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Sanders gained 167 of the Lions' 183 rushing yards, with 84 coming on 
one play to set up Detroit's only offensive touchdown. The run was the second 
longest of Sanders' career, a yard short of his 85-yard run against Tampa Bay 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears (4-3), who had won three in a row, did hold the Lions to eight first 
downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defensively, it might have been the best we've played all year," Coach Dave 
Wannstedt said. "But our youth and immaturity was the biggest thing that showed 
up today." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that, Chicago had a chance to win in the final minute. But Erik 
Kramer's pass to Nate Lewis on fourth and five from the Detroit 20 was broken 
up by Robert Massey with 41 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The big plays by the Lions were decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, who early in the game became the NFL's career kickoff return leader, 
returned the kickoff for a score just as Chicago had closed to 14-10. Then, 
when the Bears were moving again, Milton Mack intercepted at the Detroit eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, returning for the Bears after missing three games with a separated 
shoulder, completed 29 of 48 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns. But he 
was intercepted three times, including twice inside the Detroit 10.

HAPPY EVERETT DECLINES TO GLOAT DESPITE THE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a postgame interview New Orleans quarterback Jim Everett could have had 
Sunday. With dozens of cameras circling him and microphones stuck in his face, 
Everett had the opportunity to blister his former team after leading the Saints 
to a 37-34 victory over the Rams at the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have criticized the Rams for trading him to the Saints for a lousy 
seventh-round draft pick last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have taunted a Ram defense that had mocked him a week ago but barely 
put any pressure on him Sunday. And he could have unloaded on Ram Coach Chuck 
Knox, whom he skillfully avoided in the post-game handshakes at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Everett stuck with his politically correct theme, and was bland and 
downright boring. After all, the Rams and Saints meet again Dec. 4 in Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were in the cellar and we want out," said Everett, whose Saints 
(3-5) are tied with the Rams for last in the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this is a step toward the playoffs. I just thank God that it happens to 
be against the Rams. It makes it extra special for me, considering I had played 
there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was haunted at times Sunday by his shaky past and controversial 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 He was greeted by a banner that read, "Who dat, Chrissy Everett?" an obvious 
poke at his apparent attack on ESPN2 talk-show host Jim Rome, who mocked him by 
calling him "Chris" in an interview last spring. By the end of the game, the 
banner was gone and Everett ran off the field with the game ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy to get this win," he said. "It was a big win for me and it was a 
big game for us. A lot was made of the Jim Everett situation but this was a 
huge game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that really was Everett pumping his fist in the air after Derek Brown's 
three-yard touchdown run capped the Saints' opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that really was him going to a wide open Wesley Walls over the middle for 
a 30-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, that was Everett completing his first eight passes for 111 yards 
before completing 17 of 26 overall for 206 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Rams could "get to those happy feet," as safety Anthony Newman put 
it last week, Everett was dancing all over the sideline in celebration. In his 
mind, justice had been served to a team that had turned its back on him after 
nearly eight full seasons as the starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some electricity before the game," Everett said. "I might be the 
generator. It was pretty awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' pass rush, which had terrorized Joe Montana and Dave Brown, barely 
made Everett shuffle in the pocket. End Robert Young dropped him for a 10-yard 
loss in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knew Jim wanted to go out there and have a big game against the 
Rams," said Willie Roaf, a Saint offensive tackle. "Hell, he has done a great 
job all year. All we have to do is keep protecting him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Saint Coach Jim Mora: "Everett did a good job and made some key throws. 
And we did a good job of protecting him. We've been doing that every week, and 
it's one of the real positives about this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett called the victory one of the biggest of his career. It also was one 
of the strangest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints' Tyrone Hughes set an NFL record with 304 yards in kickoff returns, 
including returns of 92 and 98 yards for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram rookie Toby Wright grabbed a Lorenzo Neal fumble and returned it 98 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' Robert Bailey outsmarted the Saints' punt coverage, sneaking the 
ball out of the end zone and returning it a league-record 103 yards for a 
touchdown in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final seconds ticked off the clock, Everett tucked the game ball under 
his arm and was met by a small group of former teammates at midfield. Defensive 
end Fred Stokes hugged him. Linebacker Roman Phifer slapped him on the arm. 
Center Tom Newberry shook his hand and wished him luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying this because I mean it, I feel for the guys on that team," Everett 
said. "I know they're still trying to turn things around over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Everett approach Knox? 
</P>
<P>
 "Haven't talked to him at all," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that intentional? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I said all week that I have nothing to say," Everett said.

IT'S MORE RUN THAN SHOOT FOR FALCONS; STRATEGY: AT LEAST TO START WITH, AS 
ATLANTA RELIES ON THE RUSHES OF HEYWARD WITH RISON ON THE SIDELINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For their first two drives of the game Sunday, the Atlanta Falcons' modified 
run-and-shoot offense gave the Raiders fits. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of using their familiar four-wide receiver lineup, Atlanta caught the 
Raider defense by surprise by inserting tight end Mitch Lyons as they amassed 
104 yards in their first 17 plays -- with 265-pound Craig Heyward accounting 
for most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely wanted to get our running game started, and that is what we 
did," Atlanta quarterback Jeff George said. "It worked well for the first 
couple of series." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta Coach June Jones looked like a genius with this new attack as the 
Falcons drove around and over the Raiders even without Pro Bowl wide receiver 
Andre Rison, who did not start because he missed the team's bus and was late to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with 2:50 remaining in the first quarter, the Falcons led, 10-0, and had 
the Raider defense guessing while they were able to protect second-year pro 
Lincoln Kennedy, who was making his first start at left tackle in place of 
17-year veteran Mike Kenn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our game plan was great," said Terance Mathis, who entered the game as the 
NFC's leading receiver with 51 catches. "Although we're known for our passing, 
we jumped ahead 10-zip just by running the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 That was until the Raiders made some adjustments of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Raiders got back into the game behind the running of Harvey 
Williams, who scored on a one-yard run to cut Atlanta's lead to 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Raiders got physical and stopped the Falcons on their next three 
possessions of the first half, thanks to the run-stopping efforts of Nolan 
Harrison, Jerry Ball and Chester McGlockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Falcons could blink, their 10-point lead had become a 14-10 
deficit, and their run-and-shoot offense had turned into a crawl-and-fall 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that we can't throw, throw, throw on every down or we'd get killed," 
said George, who completed five of only 10 attempts in the first half for only 
61 yards. "We just got away from what we did well at the start of the game and 
they made some big plays defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 With their season in jeopardy, thanks to a 2-4 start, the Raiders bounced back 
to stop the Falcons' run-conscious offense. After gaining 62 yards in the first 
half, Heyward gained only nine in the final two quarters, which forced Atlanta 
to look to the air more in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they got ahead they were able to just blitz and come after us," said 
George, who completed 11 of 19 passes in the second half. "We practice against 
the blitz all the time, but when they know you are going to throw the ball, 
it's tough to stop them from just teeing off on you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders made things difficult for the Falcons when they took the second 
half kickoff and drove 62 yards and scored on a 31-yard touchdown pass from 
Jeff Hostetler to Tim Brown to put Atlanta down by 11 points before the Falcons 
took a third-quarter snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta tried to regroup, but the Raider defense had an answer as they held 
the Falcons to only four third-quarter plays before punting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had too many mental breakdowns and started to slow down," Kennedy 
said. "Mistakes hurt and took us out of a couple of drives when we needed to 
move the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders took a 24-10 lead before the Falcons finally got their offense to 
move again at the start of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison, who entered the game with 49 catches and six touchdowns, was not a big 
factor after sitting out the first quarter, but he did catch a 29-yard pass to 
help set up a four-yard touchdown pass from George to Mathis to cut the 
Raiders' lead to 24-17 with 14 minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, however, the Raiders took over as they controlled the clock and 
scored on two Jeff Jaeger field goals, while shutting down the Falcons with 
four sacks and two late interceptions by Lionel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played like we thought we had to do in order to win," Jones said. "We were 
more conservative than normal, but we still had a chance. We just didn't make 
the plays and the Raiders are a team that (can) turn (their offense) on at any 
time, and that's what they did."

LOSS MAY HAVE CAUSED NEW YORK BROWN-OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Brown threw in Rod Woodson's direction once too often, and it might have 
resulted in more than a 10-6 victory by the Pittsburgh Steelers over the New 
York Giants on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have cost Brown his starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson's 25-yard interception return early in the fourth quarter set up a 
game-winning six-yard touchdown run by Byron (Bam) Morris with 8:17 to play, 
and the Steelers handed the Giants (3-4) their fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, despite two costly early fumbles, showed the Steelers can win without 
injured Barry Foster. Morris, Pittsburgh's third-round draft choice from Texas 
Tech, rushed for 146 yards in 29 carries and was very effective in helping 
Pittsburgh, the league's top rushing team, run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers' defense also came up big, limiting New York to one first down 
and 56 yards total yards in the second half. Overall, the Giants were held to 
53 yards rushing, were one of 14 on third-down conversions and turned the ball 
over three times, all by Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 He had two passes intercepted and was charged with a questionable fumble at 
the Pittsburgh one. He was also sacked five times in what was one of the 
worst-played games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown last week was told by Coach Dan Reeves to produce or face the prospect 
of sitting on the bench behind backup Kent Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always felt that anything that you say after a game like this is not 
very smart," Reeves said. "I will wait. We will evaluate everything. Dave Brown 
and everybody on our football team will be evaluated. If we are going to do 
something, it will be after looking at the films." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was 13 of 25 for 206 yards.

BENGALS DROPPED TO 0-7; NEXT UP, THE COWBOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals would like to think this is as bad as it gets. Then 
they take a look at their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wonder when you hit rock bottom. The Dallas Cowboys are coming into 
Cincinnati next week," Coach Dave Shula said Sunday after the Bengals let a 
promising first half disintegrate into yet another loss, a 37-13 beating by the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland (6-1), off to its best start since 1963, trailed, 13-10, after 
Cincinnati played two of its best quarters of the season. But the second half 
showcased the Bengals (0-7) at their bumbling worst, a continuation of the 
Keystone Kops routine that has plagued their special teams all year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns turned the game around with a 17-point third quarter that featured 
consecutive touchdowns on Cincinnati punts. Eric Metcalf returned Lee Johnson's 
punt 73 yards for a touchdown less than two minutes after Travis Hill recovered 
a blocked punt in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals lost for the 15th consecutive time on the road and remained the 
NFL's only winless team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns have quietly built their best start in more than 30 years -- 
quietly, because they haven't yet beaten a team above .500 at the time they 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterbacks on both sides took a beating. Cleveland's Vinny Testaverde left 
complaining of headaches and blurred vision early in the third quarter, and the 
Bengals lost David Klingler to a sprained knee and Don Hollas to a shoulder 
injury. Testaverde's injury was diagnosed as a mild concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rypien, signed by the Browns last spring to back him up, completed only 
eight of 18 passes for 103 yards.

ALLEN'S 36-YARD BURST SILENCES SEATTLE, 38-23; AFC: THE 117TH TOUCHDOWN OF 
RUNNING BACK'S CAREER HELPS SEAL CHIEF VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 His coach says he's like a fine wine and his linemen say he's a delight to 
block for. 
</P>
<P>
 His 34-year-old legs, churning like a teen-ager on a long touchdown run in 
Kansas City's 38-23 victory over Seattle, say Marcus Allen's career is far from 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still run a little bit, guys," a grinning Allen told reporters bunched 
six-deep around his stall. "I just saw an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the third quarter, with the Chiefs protecting a 13-7 lead, Allen burst 
through a hole on the left side of the line, cut sharply right and sped 36 
yards for his 117th career touchdown. He passed John Riggins for fourth on the 
career list with his longest scoring run since going 61 yards against Denver in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an old dive play from our days as a power-running offense," said guard 
Dave Szott, who helped open the hole. "It's supposed to get five yards max. But 
Marcus made the perfect cut. Guys like him and Joe (Montana) are fun to block 
for because you know they can make something happen on any play." 
</P>
<P>
 Touchdown No. 117 put the Chiefs on top, 19-7. Then, as if to prove once more 
how wrong people were three years ago to declare him washed up, Allen took 
Montana's handoff and ran for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was still thinking about that dropped pass I had earlier before the half," 
Allen said. "It was a great big hole and I just hit it. There wasn't much else 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Marty Schottenheimer said, "I think that Marcus is like a fine wine. He 
keeps getting better each week." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana threw two touchdown passes as the Chiefs won their seventh consecutive 
game against the Seahawks and made the Seahawks 0-6 in post-bye games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (5-2) had only six days to get ready after playing on Monday night, 
while the Seahawks (3-4) had two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana completed 21 of 31 passes for 270 yards and two touchdowns. He 
completed a nine-yard touchdown pass to Kimble Anders in the second quarter and 
tossed a 21-yarder to Lake Dawson in the fourth for the rookie's first NFL 
touchdown. Dawson had five catches for 93 yards.

 Jeff Lukas' return to racing was spoiled by unbeaten Evansville Slew, who 
recovered from a bad start and won the Remington Futurity on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time Lukas saddled a horse for a race since Dec. 15, when a 
frightened Tabasco Cat trampled him at Santa Anita, nearly killing the trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Lukas sent out Southern Tempo, who finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas returned to training on a part-time basis June 27 after extensive 
rehabilitation and only recently increased his work schedule to five days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes time," Lukas said on the eve of the race. "It took longer than I 
thought it would. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's what it requires. Things slowly have gone in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Evansville Slew has won all five of his starts and is considered one of the 
leading contenders for the $1-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs 
on Nov. 5.

AGASSI AGAIN TOO MUCH FOR STICH IN REMATCH OF U.S. OPEN FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Open champion Andre Agassi defeated Germany's Michael Stich on Sunday, 
7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, in a rematch of last month's final to win the CA 
indoor tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-hour 48-minute match was watched by an enthusiastic crowd of 8,000 
cheering wildly for the third-seeded Agassi, who was playing in his first 
tournament since the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first set, the second-seeded Stich broke Agassi to take a 3-1 lead, but 
Agassi broke back on his third break point in the seventh game to get back to 
3-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi held serve for 5-5, then attacked in the 11th game, but Stich battled 
through six deuces to lead, 6-5. But Agassi got even and won the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second set, Agassi broke Stich to lead, 2-0. But he then lost three 
games in a row, allowing the German to break back in the fifth game and even 
the score in the sixth at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started out serving so well, and I think I was lucky to get back into the 
first set," Agassi said. "In the middle of the second, I got a little tired, a 
little loss of concentration."

BOOK REVIEW; FICTION; BLUE-COLLAR ANGER FACES A DISAPPEARING AMERICAN DREAM; 
CAMARO CITY STORIES BY ALAN STERNBERG , HARCOURT BRACE $19.95, 219 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A principal enchantment of literature is its ability to dash preconceived 
notions into a million pieces, to make the implausible seem inevitable and the 
contradictory consistent. Hamlet is both sage and fool; Ahab is madman and 
hero. Writers write to make sense of the apparently nonsensical, and readers 
read, often, to share the writers' discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Sternberg isn't Shakespeare or Melville, and few stories in "Camaro City" 
are exceptional taken alone, but read together they throw into hard relief the 
internal conflicts of modern industrial culture in the United States. Just 
about every character in these stories is a blue-collar worker barely making a 
living, and in most of the stories the climax -- if they deserve that term, for 
Sternberg isn't given to dramatics -- occurs when these laborers begin to 
grasp, however vaguely, that they will never achieve the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Hober," the eponymous protagonist toils six days a week at a muffler shop 
he co-owns and in the winter often drives a city snowplow all night, but his 
hard work seems to create neither a better world for himself nor greater 
opportunities for his son. Hober is not merely a cog in an immense industrial 
machine; he's a diminutive, worn-out, easily replaced cog quite aware of his 
low status, and unable, furthermore, to find an acceptable outlet for the 
brimming anger that self-knowledge generates. 
</P>
<P>
 Anger is everywhere in "Camaro City." Central Connecticut, in which these 
stories take place, is an industrial region well past its prime. The mills and 
foundries and factories have closed, and the companies that remain -- mostly 
smaller operations, such as rock quarries and construction firms -- are 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Moose," a landfill inspector -- recently laid off from Pratt & Whitney -- 
is shot by a trash hauler caught dumping out-of-town garbage; in "Bilt-Rite," a 
laid-off construction worker complains about having to clean out flooded 
basements for a living, only to be told by his friend and new partner: "I've 
been in wet cellars my whole life, and you do it one day and you turn into a 
goddam baby." 
</P>
<P>
 All this anger flows naturally into the characters' domestic lives; in 
"Airport Beach," a truant officer is heckled by students who would rather have 
no job than his job. And in many stories, couples argue over nothing, the 
husbands acutely defensive about their failure to live up to their promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Carver made blue-collar workers and ne'er-do-wells staples of literary 
fiction. He didn't apologize for them, nor, usually, explain them. Sternberg, 
on the other hand, wants readers to understand the bitterness and confusion 
found in his characters, and does so by describing the stress under which they 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not enough that the main character in "Camaro City," Brunet, has been 
passed over for promotion at the family-owned quarry because he's not a blood 
relation. He also has to cope with the fire that burned down his home, a fellow 
employee who ran a cement-loader out of gas and doesn't know how to jackhammer 
the resulting mess, and the theft of his 1986 Berlinetta (just 22,000 miles on 
the odometer). 
</P>
<P>
 Brunet is annoyed at the policeman's lecture about Camaros -- they're stolen 
in town all the time, apparently -- but he completely loses his composure when 
Janice, his wife, agrees that he'd be stupid to think about buying another one. 
She's right to point out that Brunet, like many other locals, practices 
"self-defeating behavior," doing things as natives always have regardless of 
changed circumstances; but she's wrong not to see how difficult it is for 
Brunet to suspend his sense of natural right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camaro City" is an atypical story in this collection in that Brunet shows, 
fleetingly, a rough side. The fire in Brunet's home had been inadvertently 
exacerbated by a neighbor who broke into the house to rescue any remaining 
occupants, and had thus fueled the fire with outside oxygen. After learning 
this, Brunet yells at his neighbor, whose name is Morjassian, and we know that 
some of Brunet's anger lies in the fact that the immigrants now living in this 
part of town are more often from the Middle East and Puerto Rico than from 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunet isn't exactly prejudiced against nonwhites, but he can't quite make 
peace with the notion that they may be able to attain the American dream when 
he can't. It's a contradiction that Brunet has trouble living with -- hadn't he 
played by the rules? Hadn't he worked hard, done everything that was asked? -- 
and easy to see how his real-life counterparts might find their essential 
broad-mindedness deformed to the point where it felt important to blame 
somebody -- immigrants, liberals, feminists, legislators, pointy-headed 
intellectuals, whomever -- for the change in fortune.  
</P>
<P>
 Though not a political book, "Camaro City" is full of political implications, 
among them the notion that one can be liberal and conservative, tolerant and 
traditional, at the same time.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: ON LOCATION; 'IS 
THIS THE END OF BRITAIN'S ROYAL FAMILY?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Princess Diana's supposed lover has bared all about intimate moments while 
Diana was still with Charles. Prince Charles has bared all for a book that says 
he had a terribly unhappy childhood and was forced to marry Diana. The 
continuing scandals have commentators predicting the end of the British 
monarchy, but love of the royals runs deep among Britons, even (or maybe 
especially) the 1 million or so who live far from home in Southern California. 
JAMES BLAIR went to the Kings Head Bar in Santa Monica to check the pulse of 
local Britons.

 I understand that Prince Charles said he was forced to marry Diana even though 
he didn't love her. Well, the Royal Family's been doing that for hundreds of 
years. Originally, the children used to marry princesses or princes from 
Germany or France just to keep the peace among nations. So it's nothing new. 
The fact is that now, through the media, it comes out. But I think the Royal 
Family is the best thing for England. I can't understand why anybody would like 
to say that they should be disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely, there's a future for the Royal Family. They do a good job. Even if 
Charles doesn't become the king, one of his sons will. MONICA MORRIS 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist, from London, 26 years in Southern California 
</P>
<P>
 I was never a royalist and always wondered what the Royal Family was for. I 
was told that they played a very, very important function. Having a strong 
Royal Family at the helm was thought to be invaluable in holding the society, 
the state, together. I really marvel at the way that illusions have been so 
easily created and firmly believed in. The illusion of this incredible love 
affair -- films were made about Charles and his Diana, this lovely fairy story 
-- was created presumably quite deliberately and just as easily destroyed. The 
Royal Family's been under fire for quite a long time, what with Princess 
Margaret and her carryings-on, the whole crowd in fact. The poor Queen is in 
terrible disarray. MELANIE ETTIENE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's all become quite tarnished. They were supposed to stay married. They 
weren't supposed to cheat. Well, they weren't supposed to get caught. I 
wouldn't be upset now if the monarchy were to vanish. Not now, no. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's always been quite a draw for tourism and it's something that 
Americans have always been very big on. I always talk with people from our 
King's Head gift shop next door. They always come in and ask us about what's 
going on. It's definitely a big tourist draw so I think that would really hurt 
if that were to happen; but I don't think that is what will happen. I think 
they'll probably try to straighten out Prince Edward, clean him up. I think 
he'll probably become king. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think Queen Elizabeth will abdicate. If Charles and Diana had stayed 
together I think, yes, she probably would have. I think she'll stay on to the 
bitter end, or at least until she feels secure that there is somebody to take 
over. GLEN BISHOP 
</P>
<P>
 Plastering contractor, from Chelmsford, Essex, 10 years in Southern California 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I feel that the Royal Family is only human like the rest of us. 
They're going to go through everything that normal people go through. People 
tend to forget that the soul of the English people is our Royal Family. They 
bring so much good and investment into the country that I honestly feel they'll 
be along for a lot longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The media blow things all up and everybody will be talking. When it comes down 
to it, everything will be the same as it was before because so many people love 
the Royal Family in England. You can't blame the economy on the Royal Family. 
That's something to do with the government and the fact that we've got a world 
economy now, not just a British economy.

'BLACK-WHITE DIVIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found "Black-White Divide Appears to Be Widening" (Oct. 11) inflammatory and 
incorrect in claiming that whites are specifically targeting blacks in their 
decreasing support of "equal opportunity" programs. Rather, I sense a feeling 
that entitlements of any kind are wrong for everyone, and that they have gone 
too far, creating even more inequality and anger in the workplace and in 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 I teach college at night. One of my students, a black female (and a government 
employee) was working on her BA degree, with her tuition paid by her employer 
(the taxpayers). During one of our conversations, she declared that her 
ancestors were promised "40 acres and a mule" to make up for their suffering as 
slaves. She wanted to know when she would be getting her "40 acres and a mule," 
never mind the money spent on her education, as well as the special programs 
that helped her get the job that she had. I, like many whites, want to know, 
when is enough enough?

 * It's not surprising that middle-class whites think their share of the

 * Re Mickey Kaus' Oct. 14 commentary, "Blaming Genes to Excuse Social 
Inaction": 
</P>
<P>
 What's better, Kaus' liberal, compassionate point of view concerning blacks 
and their IQ deficit or Charles Murray's argument that blacks are 
intellectually inferior? Neither. They, as most Western elitists, will never 
understand the virtual meaninglessness of IQ. Born of poor, uneducated parents, 
I was valedictorian from an all-black high school in Georgia 27 years ago, just 
in time to ride the first wave of token entries into elite white universities. 
</P>
<P>
 With only a paltry 1,200 on my Scholastic Aptitude Test, I got into MIT, where 
the average was 1,470. One of five blacks in a freshman class of 1,000, I'm 
sure I had the lowest score in my class. Everybody knew I was a token entry, 
including my white, liberal adviser. You'd better believe I felt out-of-place 
and inferior, especially when I nearly flunked out my first semester. But I 
knew that every system had a key, and that anyone who worked hard was destined 
to find it. One fellow in my otherwise-white fraternity flunked out in two 
semesters. His SAT score: a perfect 1,600! A few of my other white brothers 
never earned a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 My fate? After only 4 1/2 years, I graduated with bachelor's and master's 
degrees in chemical engineering with a 4.5 grade point average (out of a 
possible 5.0) in my major. Not only that, but I am broadly educated, successful 
in the real world and can hold my own with intellectuals from any background. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all of this, I am still no smarter than I was back then. I just very 
consciously mastered the rules of a different game. It doesn't bother me that 
blacks are perceived to be intellectually slower. Even if it's true, it doesn't 
mean anything. We're just different. Regardless, those of us who have a mind to 
achieve, will.

HEALTH INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on medical insurance rollbacks ("California Firms Enjoy Rollbacks 
in Medical Costs," Oct. 17) fails to put these rollbacks in context. Health 
insurers, faced with the prospect of elimination by Prop. 186, are acting out 
of self-preservation.Yet, as the article makes clear, they are not reducing 
their obscene profits: They are limiting physician choice and forcing 
physicians to reduce their staffs. Quality of care suffers as profits grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the real story here is that, both nationally and in California, health 
insurers reduced the spiraling costs of health care only when faced with 
federal regulation and Prop. 186. But a short-term decrease in the rate of 
inflation does not translate into health care reform. Rate rollbacks do not 
provide coverage to 6 million uninsured Californians, they do not provide 
long-term care, nor will they lead to increased spending on preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
 When the chairman of Blue Cross of California makes more money than an entire 
hospital, it is clear that something is very wrong with the system. When rates 
are reduced at the expense of choice of provider and quality of care, it is 
clear that the system must be reformed. Prop. 186, feared by greedy health 
insurers, is that reform.

 I strongly agree with Pinkerton's idea that we need a government work program

He correctly points to Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps as a 
fine example of a government jobs program that worked.(Incidentally, the CCC 
did not offer a job for anyone who wanted it. Only unmarried, unemployed young 
men were eligible for the work force.) 
</P>
<P>
 If the government can find tens of billions of dollars to build and maintain 
new prisons, surely it can find the money to finance an adequate jobs program 
for young men and women rotting in idleness, frustration and bitterness in our 
inner cities. Many have chosen crime and gang activity as a way of life, 
feeling they have nothing to lose if sent to prison. The choice of a decent job 
could be an effective crime prevention measure. 
</P>
<P>
 I would vote for Colin Powell or any other well-qualified presidential 
candidate who would make jobs for the disadvantaged the centerpiece of their 
campaign.

DON'T BE DISTRACTED BY ALIEN COWS; BIODIVERSITY: THE U.S. HAS EVERYTHING TO 
GAIN IN RATIFYING THE GLOBAL TREATY FOR PRESERVING SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD KENNEDY, Donald Kennedy is professor of environmental science and 
president emeritus of Stanford University.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Senate will soon have a vital test before it -- if, that is, it can 
muster the time and determination to deal with the most critical matters that 
face it in the upcoming lame-duck session. This test lacks the media drama of 
health reform or crime, but passing it or failing it will nevertheless have 
sweeping global significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming vote on whether to ratify the International Convention on 
Biological Diversity, a treaty that emerged from the Rio environment summit two 
years ago, will establish for the rest of the world whether the United States 
really cares about the conservation of species and ecosystems. We originally 
declined to sign; now we have done so, and the Senate must supply the required 
ratification vote. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no time to lose. The first conference of parties to the treaty is 
scheduled for November, and if we fail to ratify, we will not be at the table. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the convention actually accomplish? Its most significant sections 
commit signatory nations to monitor organisms and their habitats and to develop 
protection plans for those in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 A prospect that appeared potentially troublesome in the early going was the 
likely development, under the treaty, of a rigid and confining biological 
safety protocol -- a regulatory regime for controlling the transfer of plants 
and animals and field-testing new varieties. There is indeed a worry here.  
</P>
<P>
 Biosafety regulations that differentiate by the use of a particular technique 
rather than by outcome (that is, treat similar genetic modifications 
differently depending on whether they are wrought by recombinant DNA methods or 
by "classical" methods) have been widely criticized on scientific and 
competitiveness grounds following their adoption in the European Union and in 
Japan. The treaty panel discussing the form and implementation of the safety 
protocol has already headed down the wrong track: A preliminary report suggests 
a protocol drawn along the European lines. That would be a mistake. But no 
signatory is obliged to accept a defective biosafety protocol, and the United 
States will have a better chance of moving the parties toward the kind of 
science-based regulation it favors if it is present as a party and not just an 
observer. 
</P>
<P>
 In reaching its decision, the Senate will have to navigate in a blizzard of 
misinformation. For example, one article of the convention is an admirable 
provision requiring each party, as far as possible, to prevent the introduction 
and control the spread of alien species that threaten ecosystems. It is plainly 
aimed at the kind of introductions -- goats and pigs on Pacific islands, 
rabbits in Australia and the like -- that have been a very important cause of 
the extinction of native species. Yet in a Washington Times editorial it was 
asserted that the provision referred to domesticated animals -- alien cows! -- 
and would mean "eliminating the U.S. livestock industry." Nothing, of course, 
could be further from the truth: "Alien species" does not apply to domesticated 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Foreign Relations Committed, in formulating its unanimous 
recommendation for ratification last June, heard a lot of testimony. Much of it 
dwelt, understandably, on the potential economic gains to be realized from 
biological diversity. For many of us, though, the central concern is about a 
collection of values, both humanistic and scientific, now being lost in this 
greatest extinction episode in the planet's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The tens of millions of undiscovered, undescribed species -- in addition to 
the much smaller number we already know about -- represent an irreplaceable 
resource; each is the unique end-point of a long evolutionary process that will 
never be duplicated. One may be the keystone of a complex ecosystem that plays 
some role in climate stabilization. Another may contain gene sequences that may 
yield new understanding about the control of behavior. Still another may, 
because of its beauty or its grandeur, have a special hold on the human 
imagination -- as eagles have for some of us, or otters for others. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to ratify this treaty would send a signal to the world that we do not 
care about these values, and that we are not prepared to join with the vast 
majority of nations in preserving them. That would be even more damaging than 
the lost opportunity itself.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; TITANS RALLY TO BEAT UCI IN OVERTIME

 Cal State Fullerton scored two goals in the final six minutes of overtime for 
a 4-3 victory over host UC Irvine on Sunday in Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 After UC Irvine's Adel Afkarian put the Anteaters (11-5, 4-3) up, 3-2, four 
minutes into the first overtime period, the Titans (9-6-1, 4-3) responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Eddie Soto scored his third goal of the game, on an assist from Ricky 
Rodriguez nine minutes into the second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning goal came two minutes later when senior Brad Wilson beat goalie 
Matt Goldman amid a pack of Irvine defenders in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tremendous victory for these guys the way they came back," Cal State 
Fullerton Coach Al Mistri said. "It wasn't really artistic. We didn't really 
get on track." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, who trailed twice in the game, fell behind, 1-0, when senior P.J. 
Polowski beat goalie Mike Kornock 19 minutes into the opening half. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto pulled the Titans even with his first goal on a penalty kick three 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto's second goal, assisted by Matt Bradbury, put the Titans ahead at the 57 
minute mark, but Irvine tied the score ten minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Polowski scored his second goal of the game on a penalty kick, tying him with 
Kevin Smith for the UC Irvine career point record at 70. He has scored 18 goals 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto's three goals give him 11 this season, one short of his career high. 
Kornock recorded eight saves and Goldman had five for the Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonconference women's soccer: 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine 2, UC Santa Barbara 2 (OT) -- UC Irvine's Tracie Ann Manz scored 
with about eight minutes left in regulation to tie it, 2-2. It was the 
team-high eighth goal from Manz, a freshman from Estancia High. Jenni Tanaka 
had the assist on the tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Ruggiero scored UC Irvine's other goal.

 Daewoo Plants Ready to Go in North Korea: Daewoo, a leading South Korean 
conglomerate, said its joint venture textile factories in North Korea have been 
completed and will be ready to begin operations soon, pending government 
approval. The three factories to manufacture apparal and bags in North Korea's 
western port city of Nampo would be the first joint venture project between 
rivals South and North Korea. The planned start-up assumes the South will 
proceed with plans to liberalize trade relations following a breakthrough in 
talks between the United States and North Korea on Pyongyang's suspected 
nuclear weapons development program.

 NAME BRANDS: Cal State Northridge doesn't play what most consider to be a 
big-time brand of college basketball. But several of its opponents do. . . . 
Northridge's schedule this season includes games against seven teams that last 
season qualified for the NCAA tournament of 64 -- UCLA, Alabama-Birmingham, 
Cincinnati, Xavier, Pepperdine, Cal and Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 WOODEN'S WORDS: Has John Wooden, UCLA's legendary former basketball coach, 
switched allegiances? No way. The Hall of Fame mentor merely will be the guest 
speaker at a fund-raiser for the Cal State Northridge team Nov. 6 as a favor to 
his friend, Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy. . . . CSUN and UCLA square off Nov. 
26 in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 KING ARTHUR: Arthur Lee, above, senior guard from North Hollywood High and 
arguably the region's top high school player, already has accepted a 
scholarship offer from Stanford after averaging 17.7 points, 4.5 assists and 
3.3 steals last season. . . . Another who made his college choice before his 
senior season is Crescenta Valley High forward Brock Jacobsen, headed for the 
University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA STAYS: Local playgrounds aren't a hotbed of pro talent. Only three NBA 
players have ties here. . . . Lucious Harris, in his second season with the 
Dallas Mavericks, attended Cleveland High. Isiah (J.R.) Rider of the Minnesota 
Timberwolves went to Antelope Valley College. Mitchell Butler, second-year 
guard with the Washington Bullets, attended Oakwood School. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUBLE TROUBLE: Harvard-Westlake High didn't have much of a basketball program 
until Jason and Jarron Collins ducked in. . . . The twins, among the best 
players for their age in the nation, transformed the Wolverines into playoff 
contenders. Jason, 6-foot-8, averaged 16.3 points, 9.6 rebounds and 3.3 blocks 
per game. Jarron, 6-foot-7, averaged 10.3 points and eight rebounds as 
Harvard-Westlake went from a 5-20 season to 24-3. As sophomores, they have 
three more seasons of high school eligibility. Mike Hiserman

 PAST TREASURES: Ventura County is fortunate to have dozens of sites that have 
been declared historic landmarks or points of interest by the county's Cultural 
Heritage Board . . . Among them: five barns, 12 churches, three cemeteries, 37 
private homes and a pagoda in Oxnard . . . Designation is based on guidelines 
issued by the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 MUSIC MATTERS: Oh sure, she's wowed them on Broadway and shared the screen 
with some of Hollywood's leading men -- but how did Bernadette Peters go over 
in Thousand Oaks? (Calendar, Page 3). . . Peters performed for the city's 
glitterati at the splashy gala opening of the Civic Arts Plaza (Photos, B2). 
But on Sunday, just plain folks got to tour their new City Hall and enjoy a 
community showcase featuring local performers (B1). As for Peters, the verdict 
-- at least from some in the audience -- was that she lived up to the city's 
high expectations for the plaza's inaugural concert. 
</P>
<P>
 POINT MAN: For school districts, getting money out of Sacramento is no mean 
feat . . . But Moorpark schools chief Tom Duffy has managed to get $55 million 
in state funding to pay for seven of the nine schools in the fast-growing 
district (B5). . . Rising enrollments are a boost for districts seeking money 
for new campuses. But understanding how red tape works is also a valued asset. 
Said Alicia Cruz of the Poway school district, where there's also been a big 
influx of students in recent years: "(Duffy) knows the right people, and he's 
willing to help other districts."

 STAR TALK: Paul Weissman is in great demand on the lecture circuit, but 
Ventura College has managed to snag the research scientist at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . . . Weissman, who worked on the Galileo 
Project, is set tonight to lead an up-close-and-personal discussion of the 
"Great Comet Crash of 1994," when numerous fragments from the comet 
Shoemaker-Levy 9 showered the planet Jupiter. Historic Places

LAKER UPDATE; CEBALLOS IS BETTER THAN ADVERTISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of course the Lakers thought Cedric Ceballos would be good. They wouldn't have 
sent a first-round pick to the Phoenix Suns, a division rival, if they didn't 
believe that. 
</P>
<P>
 But this good? No, probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a little bit better than even what we thought," Coach Del Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos has averaged 18.2 points and 6.2 rebounds in only 24.2 minutes while 
shooting 62.3% in six exhibition games, four of them Laker victories. That kind 
of production was expected because he is so good underneath, with the ball and 
going after offensive rebounds, but the surprise has been his work from the 
perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "His shooting is better than advertised," Harris said. "People saw him as a 
good runner and a good athlete who had a scoring knack, but he also has some of 
these other things that were not included on his bubble gum card." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ceballos: "You always want to be relied upon. I watched a lot of that 
kind of thing in Phoenix. I remember (Tom) Chambers, (Xavier) McDaniel, Kevin 
Johnson, (Charles) Barkley. It's a different feeling for me to be that guy, but 
I'm going to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson won't disappear altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got too much money at stake to be less visible," the Lakers' new 
minority owner and vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does plan to have a lower profile at games. Johnson, who bought about 
5% interest from Jerry Buss during the summer, said he plans to find new seats 
this season, somewhere other than on the baseline a few feet from the Laker 
bench. That was home in 1993-94, at least before he went on the Laker bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the team to get its own identity," said Johnson, who during the final 
days of his coaching tenure questioned the young Lakers for trying to distance 
themselves from his era. "I don't want Del or anybody to think I'm looking over 
their shoulders or anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good for them to do their own thing. I don't want them to feel 
like I'm there for any other reason than to cheer for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known when James Worthy will rejoin the team following the death of 
his mother, Gladys. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy missed Saturday's game against the Nuggets, before which a moment of 
silence was held, to return to his native North Carolina and is not expected to 
be with the Lakers when they fly to Vancouver today for a game Tuesday against 
the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing in Canada, the Lakers conclude their exhibitions Thursday 
against the Utah Jazz at Ogden, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the dozen or so scouts at the Forum for the exhibition doubleheaders over 
the weekend, one had unparalleled access to the Lakers. Harris even put the guy 
up at his home in Pacific Palisades and drove him to games. Of course, it was 
his son, Larry Harris, a scout/video coordinator with the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Del, making sure not to give away too much to the second opponent of the 
regular season: "I dropped him off at the Sports Arena." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers should be better than last season, and also younger. With Kurt 
Rambis (retirement), James Edwards (free agent) and mid-season acquisition 
Danny Schayes (free agent) gone from 1993-94, that leaves Worthy, Sam Bowie and 
Sedale Threatt as the only players on the 15-man training camp roster older 
than 26.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Second-ranked Colorado and No. 3 Nebraska stayed on course for a Big Eight 
showdown Saturday in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffaloes closed within four points of No. 1 Penn State in The Associated 
Press college football poll after defeating Kansas State, 35-21, Saturday. The 
Nittany Lions, who led Colorado by 13 points last week, were idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State (6-0) received 19 first-place votes and 1,486 points, while 
Colorado (7-0) got 16 firsts and 1,482 points from a nationwide media panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska (8-0) received 24 first-place votes and 1,461 points after defeating 
Missouri, 42-7. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, after a 61-0 victory over California, re-entered the poll at No. 25. The 
Trojans (5-2) are 23rd in the coaches' poll. Hockey  
</P>
<P>
 The NHL is expected to cancel some games and cut the 84-game schedule by as 
many as 10 games. The number of games will be reduced depending on the length 
of the lockout, which erased 132 games in its first 23 days. Commissioner Gary 
Bettman and Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., spoke 
several times Friday to discuss schedule changes and the elimination of 
neutral-site games, but did not set up formal talks. They have not negotiated 
since Oct. 11 but are expected to meet this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Their tension resurfaced when Goodenow denounced the NHL for sending a package 
of documents to 10 player agents Friday claiming they had not been fully 
informed about the negotiations. Goodenow called the action "disruptive." 
Tennis

 Charlotte Hornet forward Larry Johnson, who was expected to be sidelined up to 
eight weeks, doesn't have a stress fracture in his left foot after all and 
might be ready for the team's season-opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Former major leaguer Dan Gladden scored on Tatsunori Hara's hit as the Yomiuri 
Giants defeated the Seibu Lions, 1-0, tying the best-of-seven Japan Series at 
one game apiece. 
</P>

JEFF WHITE WANTS TO REVITALIZE THE STATE CHAPTER OF OPERATION RESCUE. BUT THE 
ISSUE OF VIOLENCE MIGHT IMPEDE HIS EFFORTS.; OPERATION REBOUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is late into a crystal-clear fall night high above the Southern California 
urban landscape, and Jeff White and Joe Foreman are wolfing down steaks at a 
local restaurant, trading war stories from the front lines of the Christian 
fundamentalist battle against abortion -- and plotting a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 White, the 37-year-old leader of Operation Rescue of California, has retreated 
from his former base in Orange County to this resort town near Lake Arrowhead 
to regroup his battered organization, now one of the last active statewide 
chapters left in Operation Rescue. And he has just enlisted Foreman, who was 
ousted from the national leadership of the anti-abortion group four years ago 
as a result of his radical views and his repeated personality clashes with 
founder Randall Terry, to help him re-energize a grass-roots movement 
politically devastated by the effect of anti-abortion violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a major protest campaign in the summer of 1993 that targeted clinics in 
the San Jose area, White, a born-again former BMW parts distributor from Santa 
Clara and the father of seven children, has been unable to generate much 
attention for his organization, and financial contributions have been halved 
over the past year. Like other anti-abortion leaders, he manages to make ends 
meet for his group and for his family through cash and in-kind donations from a 
hard-core group of loyal supporters in the fundamentalist community; he and his 
family are now living in a townhouse here, and he keeps his group's offices in 
a second one nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, it is clear that Operation Rescue of California is now just a 
shadow of the powerful statewide force that was able to blockade dozens of 
clinics and put thousands of protesters onto Southern California streets in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 To return to his glory days, White, with Foreman's help, is organizing a team 
of 10 full-time fundamentalist, anti-abortion "missionaries" at his office to 
rebuild a statewide activist network. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an awful lot you can do when people think you've been beaten," says 
Foreman confidently. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as they try to resurrect their struggling cause, White and Foreman find 
themselves embroiled in increasingly bitter battles with rival leaders across 
the country over how to keep Operation Rescue afloat at a time when a wave of 
violence has led to declining membership and plunging financial donations for 
anti-abortion groups from their traditional base among Christian 
fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 And that fight shows the degree to which the violence against abortion doctors 
by a handful of extremists -- two doctors have been killed within the last two 
years, and a third has been wounded -- has come to dominate the entire national 
debate over abortion, especially inside the anti-abortion movement itself.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, White's decision to bring Foreman to California has been enough to 
create a serious rift between White and Flip Benham, the national director of 
Operation Rescue, largely because of questions about Foreman's track record on 
the issue of violence. White and Foreman have not been linked to any acts of 
violence, but Benham believes that leaders of the movement have to make it 
clear to the world that they do not even tacitly endorse it.  
</P>
<P>
 That is especially true since Operation Rescue continues to target doctors by 
name for protest and personal harassment, and its leaders identify doctors by 
name during rallies and charge that they are baby killers. If Operation Rescue 
officially took the next step and openly supported the murder of the doctors 
that its leaders identify, the group would almost certainly bring the wrath of 
the federal government down upon its head.  
</P>
<P>
 Benham, a Dallas fundamentalist minister, has been outspoken in denouncing the 
attacks on abortion physicians; he argues such public statements are the only 
way to protect Operation Rescue from the pressure of federal conspiracy 
investigations and political ostracism. So he angrily charges that White and 
Foreman endanger Operation Rescue's credibility because they have refused to 
join him in openly opposing the violence. In fact, the ambivalence with which 
leaders like White and Foreman have greeted the violence has already sparked a 
firestorm of protest from many abortion-rights advocates, who chide that some 
anti-abortion leaders are guilty of encouraging acts of violence by "praising 
with faint damns."  
</P>
<P>
 What's more troubling for Foreman is that he is finding it hard to live down 
his past. He initially allowed his name to be attached -- and then had it 
quickly removed -- from a petition passed around earlier this year by extremist 
Paul Hill endorsing the "justifiable homicide" of doctors who perform 
abortions. Later, Hill was arrested for the August killings of Dr. John Britton 
and his escort in Pensacola, Fla.; those who signed his petition have come 
under growing scrutiny from law-enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the killings, Foreman also hosted a summit meeting of anti-abortion 
leaders in Chicago to debate whether violence was justified; the meeting was 
dominated by supporters of violence, including Hill. Foreman's credibility on 
nonviolence has also been eroded by his past leadership of a Milwaukee group 
called the Missionaries to the Pre-Born, which he co-founded with the Rev. Matt 
Trewhella, reportedly a target of a federal investigation of a possible 
conspiracy in a campaign of violence against abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 So by bringing Foreman to California, White has left rival leaders guessing 
about his future policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff White is no longer a spokesman for Operation Rescue," says Benham 
flatly. "There are too many unanswered questions. . . . I absolutely have a big 
problem with the fact that he is dealing with someone like Foreman. And if 
Foreman is not able to toe the line on the issue, then he cannot speak for 
Operation Rescue either." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the attacks from Benham, White and Foreman still refuse to 
publicly denounce all anti-abortion violence -- clouding their hopes to bring 
their California operation back to life in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 White and Foreman argue that they are being misunderstood both by their rivals 
in the movement and by the media. "Martin Luther King Jr. preached the same 
creed of nonviolence from day one until he was shot, but the way he was 
portrayed in the press changed dramatically; at first he was viewed very 
negatively, and only later did the press recognize what he was about," observes 
Foreman.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the long run, it will be seen that there is a distinction between 
Operation Rescue and those who advocate and commit violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, talking to White and Foreman about their rather tortured and complex 
views on violence makes it clear why Benham is confused about where they stand. 
 
</P>
<P>
 White and Foreman insist that they personally oppose the use of violence, and 
that neither of them would tolerate anyone in their organization who committed 
violent acts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know absolutely, positively that violence is not the answer, and I think 
for someone to insinuate something different after all these years that we have 
been in the movement is out of line," notes White. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at the same time, they refuse to speak out against all acts of 
anti-abortion violence, and complain that Benham's hard-line stance against 
dealing with any leading advocates of "justifiable homicide" only polarizes the 
anti-abortion movement, and divides longtime allies who worked together for 
years before violence against doctors became an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "By pushing (Benham's) line, you keep people from coming together," says 
Foreman. He adds that he has trouble condemning advocates of violence because 
he is not convinced that all acts of anti-abortion violence "are intrinsically 
a sin." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people all over the map on this issue in the anti-abortion 
movement, and many of them agonize over whether they would endorse violence in 
different hypothetical situations, and I don't want to get into that debate."  
</P>
<P>
 White says he believes that by not speaking out against violence, he can keep 
more people inside what he insists is a nonviolent movement, thus ensuring that 
anti-abortion activists don't get so frustrated that they turn to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the answer is not in shooting abortionists, but in laying down 
your life (through nonviolence) for the children," White says. "That is the 
history of the true church. I did not sell my business and my home to lead a 
secret life.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I do not engage in debate over the justifications of violence. I'm a 
leader, not a debater. I make it clear that if anyone wants to be in an 
Operation Rescue of California event, they will follow the path of nonviolence. 
But if a person will commit their life to nonviolence, not just when they are 
at an Operation Rescue event but all the time, then I don't care where they are 
on the spectrum of thinking about violence as an issue. I don't care what they 
think , as long as they commit in action to nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tactically, what's the best way to reduce violence?" White asks. "Is it to 
polarize those who are on the fence, to shut them out and push them to 
violence, or to keep them busy with nonviolence?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the attacks on White and Foreman over their views on violence come 
at the same time they have been attempting to organize a "peace summit" with 
abortion-rights advocates in Southern California to talk about the issue of 
violence. White says he's amused that Benham also has chastised him for sitting 
down with the enemy, even while he criticizes White for his refusal to speak 
out more clearly about violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet abortion-rights advocates, meanwhile, have dismissed White's attempts to 
organize meetings with them about violence, arguing that he is simply trying to 
generate publicity for his shrinking organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing to talk to Jeff White about; there is no common ground," says 
Leslie Sebastian, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in spite of his troubles stemming from the violence issue, White remains 
confident that he and his group will ultimately be back in good graces with 
other anti-abortion leaders like Benham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that Flip and I will be able to work together again, maybe 
before the year is out, maybe even sooner," says White. "Hey, I've been thrown 
out of Operation Rescue and thrown back in more times than anybody else, but it 
doesn't matter. I don't hold grudges. If you are pro-life, then I am your 
friend."

JACK SMITH: NOT ANY CLOSER TO GETTING THE ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My recent inquiry into the question of why we are here has brought a large 
number of responses. Many, as might be expected, are remonstrations against 
what is perceived as my disbelief. Many others quote the myth of Genesis as the 
answer, and urge me to read the Bible. Others have sent me pamphlets quoting 
Eastern mystics in whose philosophies the answer presumably lies. 
</P>
<P>
 Easier to handle than most of the arguments against my philosophy are the ones 
against my grammar. I had written, "I keep wondering why, if God is infallible, 
did we turn out so bad?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oops!" writes Dr. Harry A. Goodman (and others). "I believe the correct word 
is 'badly,' not 'bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The usage panel in Harper's Dictionary of Contemporary Usage voted 74% to 24% 
against the use of "badly" as in "I feel badly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Feeling badly," commented Isaac Asimov, "is the mark of a dirty old man." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chrichton said, "I say, 'I feel bad.' You don't say, 'I feel goodly, do 
you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Burton Rouche said, " 'Feel badly' is a dainty-ism used by people who think 
'bad' is too blunt and crude." 
</P>
<P>
 Several readers question my quoting Albert Einstein as saying "God does not 
play dice with the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shouldn't that be 'universe,' not 'world?' " asks one. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me Einstein might have said "universe," since the universe was his 
plaything. However, I looked it up in Bartlett's, which quoted the old wizard 
as saying "world." 
</P>
<P>
 Several readers note that Einstein was a lifelong atheist, and wouldn't have 
used the word God anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 In that connection, I have an interesting correspondence between Einstein and 
Guy H. Raner Jr., a wartime ensign. 
</P>
<P>
 Raner wrote Einstein, recalling a letter Einstein had sent him in 1945. "At 
that time I was aboard the U.S. Navy carrier Bougainville and had written you 
regarding some statements made by a merchant marine officer to the effect that 
a Jesuit priest had brought you around to a belief in God . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "You replied, 'I have never talked to a Jesuit priest in my life and I am 
astonished by the audacity to tell such lies about me. From the viewpoint of a 
Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been, an atheist. It is always 
misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with things outside the 
human sphere -- childish analogies. We have to admire in humility the beautiful 
harmony of the structure of this world -- as far as we can grasp it. And that 
is all.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Einstein spent his life trying to grasp it, and never quite did. He was still 
grappling with his unified field theory when he ceased to be. So Einstein, like 
me, never quite grasped the universal truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jynny Retzinger takes issue with my belief that the human species has turned 
out bad. "I disagree," she writes. "You are too influenced by the news media 
that look for sensationalism! I don't believe it. There are still eight million 
good ones (out of nine million in L.A. County)." 
</P>
<P>
 She's probably right. How many of the hundred million women in America would 
cut off their husbands' penises, even when provoked? That good people outnumber 
bad people there is no doubt. But why do we have bad people at all? Would the 
world be dull without them? 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Wood of Balboa Island recalls a verse that he says was a favorite of the 
late Richard Feynman, the brilliant Caltech physicist. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why I wonder why, I wonder why I wonder.  
</P>
<P>
 I was a great admirer of Feynman. There is a story that he used to take a 
break from the classroom and go to a topless bar. I could identify with that, 
if not with his cosmic theories. 
</P>
<P>
 I had always wanted to meet Feynman. One night, at a costume party in the home 
of Caltech scientist Al Hibbs, I had the chance. My wife pointed to a man 
sitting in a window seat. He wore a long white robe and had a long white beard 
-- false, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife said, "That's Richard Feynman. I think he's Moses." 
</P>
<P>
 I went over to the window seat and confronted the man. "Are you Moses?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said, "I'm God." 
</P>
<P>
 I went over to Hibbs and told him that Feynman had said he was God. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," said Hibbs. "We've known that all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he was. 
</P>
<P>
 So here I am. No closer to knowing why we are here. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why I wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell White of Ventura says, "Oh, come on, Jack. Dear Gertrude Stein gave us 
the answer. 'There is no answer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He encloses a "Hagar the Horrible" cartoon in which Hagar says, "A man must 
wrestle with many questions. Who am I? Why am I here? What's it all about? Why 
me? Do we have any beer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's what Feynman was seeking at the topless bar. A beer.

THELMA HOWARD'S LEGACY OF HOPE; AS A DISNEY HOUSEKEEPER, SHE FOUND HER HAPPIEST 
PLACE ON EARTH. HER BEQUEST WILL HELP CHILDREN FIND THEIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He reminded us not to lose grasp of our dreams, reducing the process of hope 
and faith to its most simple terms -- that we need only to wish upon a star. 
When Thelma Howard entered the home of Walt Disney in 1951, she brought her 
dreams with her, but it was a star she lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 30 years, Howard worked as live-in housekeeper/cook for Disney, 
his wife, Lillian, and their two children. It was a long way from her childhood 
home near Southwick, Idaho -- a long way from the tragedy and misfortune that 
seemed to batter her down each time she managed to climb to her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dreams were not lavish. Nothing about her was. She did not ask for fortune 
or fame, only for her wounds to heal, for laughter to replace a lifetime of 
tears. When she died, the world learned this month, she left a surprise to help 
children's dreams come true. 
</P>
<P>
 The same year Howard joined Disney's household, his studio released the 
animated version of a Lewis Carroll story. But Alice was not the only one who 
suddenly found herself in Wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an exciting time. In 1954 Disney's weekly television show began, and in 
1955 Disneyland opened. Within the Holmby Hills home, says Diane Disney Miller, 
one of two Disney daughters, it was the dawn of "golden years." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon there would be the joy and laughter of grandchildren, who flocked not 
only to their grandparents, but to the woman who cleaned their house. 
</P>
<P>
 Thelma Howard was a handsome, quick-witted woman who loved football and the 
color pink. She smoked cigarettes, played a cunning game of gin rummy and baked 
a lovely boysenberry pie. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a confidante and friend to the Disney children and grandchildren. It 
was not a talent or way that she had with youngsters, says Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney referred to her as "the real-life Mary Poppins," although her 
nickname around the house was Fou-Fou, the closest one of the Disney 
grandchildren could come to pronouncing Thelma . 
</P>
<P>
 She was a perfectionist in her work, making sure the Disneys were well cared 
for down to the tiniest details, such as making sure the refrigerator was 
stocked with wieners. 
</P>
<P>
 When Disney came home from work, he would walk into the kitchen through the 
back door and oftentimes stop at the refrigerator to grab a couple of wieners 
-- one for him and one for Lady, the family's French poodle; and the two of 
them would munch them down cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was treated with fondness, and shared in the family's ups and downs. 
Each holiday season, Disney would reward her and other employees with a gift of 
Disney stock. Of course it wasn't worth much then, and many employees would 
have preferred cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Howard retired to a modest two-bedroom bungalow in West L.A. Her 
health began failing. Her heart, her lungs -- it seemed her entire body was 
simply wearing out. 
</P>
<P>
 She died last June 10, days before her 80th birthday, and was buried in a pink 
casket at Forest Lawn in the Hollywood Hills overlooking the Disney Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday was the first meeting of the Thelma Pearl Howard Foundation Board 
of Directors, charged with carrying out her final wish. 
</P>
<P>
 In her will, half of her estate was left to her son, Michael, now in his 
mid-50s and living in a Long Beach home for the developmentally disabled. The 
other half was to benefit disadvantaged and homeless children. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, it totaled more than $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother died giving birth when Thelma was 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 One day that same year, Thelma and her sister, Louise, 8, were cooking dinner 
on a wood-burning stove. Louise opened the oven door to stoke the fire, and 
flames shot out, engulfing her dress. Thelma ran frantically to get their 
father, but Louise burned to death outside the farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was poor, and while in high school, Thelma was ashamed to be seen 
riding horseback to school, so her brother, Jay Mill, would walk with her; and 
when they were a couple miles from town, she would dismount and walk the rest 
of the way while Jay returned home with their gray mare named Blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after graduating from high school, she left Idaho to attend a business 
college in Spokane. She hoped to become a legal secretary, but ran out of money 
and had to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 She stayed briefly with relatives in Northern California and in 1931 moved to 
Los Angeles, where she did office work and cleaned homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before working for the Disneys, she was married briefly and had a son, 
Michael, whose rebellious childhood led him to the McKinley School for Boys, a 
boarding school in Van Nuys. He and a friend lied about their ages and joined 
the Navy when they were 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Harris, whose name then was Alva Lee Phillips, was a friend and an 
accomplice of Michael's, who often would spend weekends at the Disney home. He 
says he and Michael raised their share of hell together, but never at the 
Disney residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thelma was very strict and very dedicated to the Disneys," he says. "She laid 
down the rules and made sure we followed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's niece, Cheryl Wallace, says her aunt regretted not being closer to 
her son when he was young. Later, she would buy him expensive cars and a house. 
In her final years she fretted more about his welfare than her own, Wallace 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard lived a frugal life, perhaps because of her upbringing, says Wallace, 
46, who is head teller at the Potlach Federal Credit Union in Lewiston, Idaho, 
which happens to be the town where the Disneys were married in 1925. Mrs. 
Disney grew up nearby in Lapwai. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father (Howard's brother) is the same way," says Wallace. "He's 76 years 
old and could retire comfortably, but he insists on working full time at the 
mill." 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, Wallace says, she visited her aunt at the Disney home. She 
would stay in Howard's quarters, but when the Disneys were gone, they would 
spread themselves out, pretending it was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would sit at their big dining room table, and I remember she would act 
silly, like a schoolgirl. She would sit at one end, and I would sit at the 
other end, and we would shout like, "Could you pleeeeeeze pass the peas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace says she discovered that her aunt had been hospitalized in 1991, when 
her father received notice that someone had applied to be administrator of her 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 She flew to Los Angeles and found her aunt in a Santa Monica nursing home. "I 
was aghast," she says. "She was always meticulous about her appearance, and 
there she was, she hadn't been bathed, her hair hadn't been brushed, she was in 
a ward with another woman and two men." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace discovered that a man claiming to be married to her aunt had told the 
nursing home she had no family and was attempting to gain control of her 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said she had had a relationship with the man but denied being married 
to him. Attorneys could never verify the marriage. When the man and his son 
were left only $1,000 each in her will, they contested; a $24,000 settlement 
was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Diane Disney Miller noticed she hadn't received the usual 
Christmas card from Howard. She, too, discovered her in the nursing home, where 
she kept a framed, autographed photograph of Walt and Lillian Disney in her 
room until it disappeared. She was given another and kept it hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was moved to another home where she had a private room. Miller sent 
fresh flowers every Monday and visited her often. When she died last year, 
Howard was living in a retirement home with beautiful gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 It was discovered that she had never sold any of her Disney stock, which 
through numerous splits had grown to 192,755 shares. Between 1980 and 1993, the 
stock has increased in value tenfold and was valued at $8.39 million. Her 
property and savings pushed the total over $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Howard weren't surprised that she wanted children to benefit 
from the fund, which is being administered by a board of volunteers in 
conjunction with the California Community Foundation, a nonprofit group that 
administers individual funds and grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long before she died, she was sitting with Evelyn Murphy, a social worker 
for the legal conservator handling her affairs. Murphy telephoned her daughter, 
and Howard overheard her mention that she could hear her granddaughter singing 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I listen?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy handed her the phone, and Howard listened silently to the tiny voice. 
Tears formed in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says she can still picture Howard dashing about the kitchen preparing 
Thanksgiving dinner. Grandchildren would be sprawled out all around her drawing 
pictures, helping and laughing.

 In the news: Comic Argus Hamilton, on the request that the Simpson trial be 
postponed for a year and that the defendant be released on bail until then: 
"O.J. is certainly no flight risk. Robert Shapiro has made sure he hasn't got 
enough money left for a plane ticket."

 Hamilton, on Hollywood Boulevard sinking nine inches from subway tunneling: 
"Oh, come on. As far as Hollywood has sunk in the last 50 years, what's another 
nine inches?"

 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on Halloween: "It's the time when strange sorcerers 
contact the spiritual world. That can only mean one thing: Arianna Huffington 
is stumping for her husband again."

 Comedy writer Mark Miller, on the Pope's new book: "Each chapter opens with a 
question from an journalist, such as: Does God really exist? Why does God 
tolerate suffering? With so many talented actors out of work, why is Pauly 
Shore a star?" The Pope's book is historically faithful, says comedy writer Bob 
Mills: "It sells for 30 drachmas."

 Jay Leno, on a report that men who run have better sex lives: "For a lot of 
men, running a race is a lot like sex. . . . They're always jumping the gun, 
they treat every event like it's a 100-yard dash, and they think the goal is to 
finish first."

 Miller, on the President saying "he's not smart enough" to help his daughter 
with her math homework anymore: "Chelsea replied that if that's his attitude, 
he can just forget about any more of her help on foreign policy."

 Reader Fatima Bayati was talking with her cousin Nathan, 7, when he told her 
of the demise of his pet goldfish and guppies. She asked if they were to be 
buried or flushed down the toilet. The boy, taken aback, said he'd already 
buried them. Feeling insensitive about her flushing suggestion, Bayati 
reassured him that his pets were probably already in the beautiful waters of 
fish heaven.

 Nathan thought for a few minutes, then said: "Yeah, that's a lot better than 
going to toilet heaven."

FIRST PERSON: DAD TAKES A GAMBLE ON LOVE'S WINNING HAND: SIX OF A KIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CROMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have long thought that my dad looked at marriage as a game not unlike poker: 
Don't like what's in the cards you've drawn? Fold 'em quick and wait for the 
next hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years I've watched in a state of semi-detachment as Dad refined this 
philosophy, going to the altar again and again after his 13-year marriage to my 
mother went down in the 1970s like the Hindenburg. 
</P>
<P>
 I say semi-detachment because my mother, who raised me, sheltered me somewhat 
from my father's nuptial adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Dad was Dad, and it was kind of hard to avoid the obvious as new 
faces and names appeared during my visits with him. None of the Post-Mom wives 
lasted very long, much to my mother's pleasure. I can't be exactly sure, but I 
figure each of them had a shelf life of about 2.5 years before disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 After a divorce, he would settle into a "cool-down" pattern of several years 
before starting the cycle all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother and I set up an early-detection system whenever Dad was single. If 
we were getting a lot of phone calls from the old man and invitations to spend 
quality time together, we knew the coast was clear. We'd pick up a blip on the 
radar screen when the calls suddenly dropped off and Dad became progressively 
more busy: another wife on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps I shouldn't have been too surprised when my dad called a couple of 
weeks ago, following a dry spell of several wifeless years, and broke the news 
that he was going to Sin City to tie the knot. Yep, in the long and dark shadow 
of five previous wives, old Pops was going to waltz into Las Vegas and step up 
to the altar for Round Six. 
</P>
<P>
 And I was invited. 
</P>
<P>
 Honestly, I never really considered not going. Despite the animosity that has 
simmered and flared between my parents and the sheer indifference my brother 
has managed to display after moving 300 miles away, I have become accustomed to 
what I consider my dad's shortcomings and love him just the same. 
</P>
<P>
 As I said, Dad is Dad. What's a guy to do? I sort of figured Mom wasn't going 
to take it too well, so I tried to take a lighthearted approach when I called 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Mom. Listen. Hear that noise?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What? What noise?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen. Far off in the distance. Sounds like wedding bells in Albuquerque." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhhhhh nooooooooo. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 She kind of got a kick out of it, actually -- until I told her that I was 
going to attend. Her end of the line slowly grew colder than an Ice Age as I 
tried to explain (for the millionth time) that I wanted to let Dad's decision 
to bail on "us" be water under a very emotional bridge. You know, the old 
time-heals-all-wounds thing. She wasn't biting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine," she replied. "But when he's standing at the altar be sure and ask him, 
since now that he has a dual income, if you and your brother can expect to see 
that $16,000 in child support he never paid!" 
</P>
<P>
 Right, Mom. Unfortunately, I lost my cool and screamed that it wasn't good 
enough for just her to hate him, that she had to poison everybody else's 
relationship with the old man as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later I was checking into the Econolodge on the north end of Las 
Vegas Boulevard, the only guy out of probably 50 blood relatives and friends 
from my dad's side of the family who bothered to make the journey. I had no 
regrets. I was committed. I knew what had to be done. I ambled down to the 
Mirage and started chain-smoking between a long string of Harvey Wallbangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The following morning, nursing a vodka and Marlboro Light hangover, I took my 
seat inside the "west wedding chapel" on the second floor of the Treasure 
Island Hotel. I sat on one side, a dozen or so other guests sat on the other. 
The ceremony was mercifully swift, punctuated by the piped-in music of a 
droning carnival organ. 
</P>
<P>
 To my surprise, and though my mother would have wished otherwise, the bride 
was radiant and my dad looked like a million bucks. But the minister was 
apparently confused and she waxed eloquent about how the rings exchanged were 
like eternity -- with no beginning or end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen," she announced, "I present to you, for the first time, 
Jim and Judy Cromer." 
</P>
<P>
 I suppressed a sudden urge to loudly clear my throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Later on, at the reception, I toasted the happy couple: "A great captain once 
said, 'We're not here for a long time, just a good time. So here's to the good 
times.' " It earned a hardy "Hear! Hear!" and a broad smile from my father. Ah, 
acceptance at last. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way home I let my eyes unfocus on the black asphalt of Interstate 15. 
It was over. Pops had survived 57 years of life to play a mean game of Pick 
Six. I didn't feel sad or happy or angry or anything, really. Although as a 
single guy rapidly approaching 30 who has so far avoided the big "I Do," I 
began to wonder where all my fears about the institution were coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that it's over, I know my mom will be calling sooner or later to pepper me 
with the inevitable questions about the wedding and how my dad looked and, 
especially, what she looked like. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not mad at Mom anymore. I'll tell her what she wants to hear. And I wish 
my dad the best. Again.

COMMITMENTS: NAKED TRUTHS; NOTHING MAKES A PERSON MORE VULNERABLE THAN SEXUAL 
CONTACT. BUT THAT'S PRECISELY WHEN HONEST COMMUNICATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
IN A RELATIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The problem isn't getting naked. It's getting candid. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to sex, nothing is more revealing -- and scarier -- than an 
honest conversation with your partner about sexual desires and dislikes, 
feelings and fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ponder one revelation in the most recent and, many claim, most reliable 
national sex study: More than 22% of the women claimed they've been forced into 
a sexual act, yet fewer than 3% of the men admitted to sexually coercing a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 This gap in perception "tells me that there is limited communication about sex 
between partners," says sociologist Edward Laumann, one of four social 
scientists who conducted the University of Chicago study of 3,432 randomly 
selected 18-to-59-year-olds. "It's clear each gender has different ideas about 
sexual matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is hard to believe in a society that has turned the unmentionable into 
the inescapable. We may not talk with our partners about sex, but we can't stop 
talking about it everywhere and with everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Westwood sandwich shop, two 40ish men debate the pros and cons of giving 
a vibrator as an anniversary present. In a La Jolla hotel lobby, a pair of 
60ish couples compare their favorite sexual positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the so-called sexual revolution, "Couples in sexual relationships work 
too hard to avoid talking about sex on an intimate level," says Judith 
Wallerstein, who has researched relationship issues for 25 years as founder of 
the Center for the Family in Transition, in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing makes a person more vulnerable than flesh-on-flesh contact. Emotions 
are raw. Physiological responses -- or the lack of them -- can be embarrassing, 
even maddening. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious and cultural attitudes about sex often instill shame in the 
individual and confusion in the couple, says psychologist Tibor Jukelevics, who 
specializes in relationship counseling and directs the Center for Family in 
Torrance. "It's hard enough for a lot of people to think about sex without 
feeling bad. Talking about it seems impossible and very scary." 
</P>
<P>
 And, so, one reasons, "Why risk humiliation by telling my partner what my body 
likes?" says psychotherapist Bonnie Maslin, author of "The Angry Marriage: 
Overcoming the Rage, Reclaiming the Love" (Hyperion, 1994). "It's much easier 
to talk about sex when it concerns other people -- like John and Lorena 
Bobbitt." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1994 study in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that adults are becoming 
more accepting of sexually explicit content in the mass media. In fact, experts 
say this increasing "overexposure," which thrives in entertainment hubs like 
Southern California, makes it more difficult for couples to talk about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is left to the imagination," explains Pepper Schwartz, a sociologist 
at the University of Washington and former president of the national Society 
for the Scientific Study of Sex. "This causes some to lose touch" with their 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when couples compare their sex lives to fictitious ones portrayed 
by entertainers, says Schwartz, author of "Peer Marriages: How Love Between 
Equals Really Works" (Free Press, 1994). Then, "they worry about being normal." 
</P>
<P>
 They shouldn't, suggests the University of Chicago report. It found that most 
adults are conservative in their sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes me feel a little more normal," says Don, a 26-year-old auto 
mechanic who lives in the San Gabriel Valley. "You hear about other people 
having continuous, passionate, unbelievable sex. Then you feel inadequate when 
you just have really good sex once a month, if even that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't say anything because it would be like admitting you're lousy in 
bed," says Don, who has been married for nine months. "Also, you don't want to 
hurt the other person's feelings. It's easier to brag to my friends about sex 
and keep quiet with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Don's silence has spread to other parts of his marriage. "We're drifting. We 
don't have much sex anymore. We can't talk about anything anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He probably bristled at any talk beyond the superficial, experts theorize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simple communication problems affect sexual relationships," says William H. 
Masters, director of the Masters and Johnson Institute in St. Louis and author 
of numerous books and studies on sex. 
</P>
<P>
 They can also crush relationships. A few years ago, a survey by the American 
Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers cited lack of communication, including sexual, 
as a leading cause of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Fithian, co-director of the Center for Marital and Sexual Studies in 
Long Beach, recalls helping a woman who had an embarrassing problem that ruined 
her relationships: All her former husbands and lovers became impotent. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, in her mid-40s, expressed her self-anger at her partners by mocking 
their sex techniques. The men communicated their insecurities physiologically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things didn't improve until the woman talked about her anger," Fithian says. 
"She had to take responsibility for her sexual problems. Sex is hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Too many people falsely believe good sex happens naturally, Fithian explains. 
"They feel like something is wrong if they need to talk about it. But that's 
not always true. Who doesn't want more pleasure? Talking about sex can mean 
telling a partner what touches bring on orgasms." 
</P>
<P>
 Experience taught Maureen Ward that lesson. For years, she endured boring sex 
with introverted men who ignored her. But 12 years in psychotherapy taught her 
that low self-esteem encouraged her to select sexual partners who unconsciously 
confirmed her feelings of worthlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have a husband I trust," says Ward, who received sex counseling from 
Fithian's center. "We have no problems talking about sex. And we have great 
sex."

TIPS TO BRIDGE THE COMMUNICATION GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's some advice from experts about how to have a candid, sincere discussion 
with your partner about sex: 
</P>
<P>
 * Resist knee-jerk responses to your partner's comments. Listen before you 
respond. Be kind, gentle and patient. "People get defensive because this is 
such a sensitive subject," says Tibor Jukelevics, a Torrance psychologist. For 
example, they might wrongly assume a partner who fumbles when talking about sex 
is being critical. "It's just difficult for them to talk. Getting upset, rather 
than trying to understand, can turn a harmless comment into a hurtful 
argument." 
</P>
<P>
 * Save sexual criticisms, says sociologist Pepper Schwartz. Nothing stings a 
relationship or squashes an ego more than a sexual insult, even if it's not 
intended to be one. This is particularly true if the comment relates to 
performance, or penis or breast size. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss techniques after sex. "It's a private and safe time to say, 'I 
really liked it when you touched me like this, or kissed me like that," says 
Marilyn Fithian, co-director of the Center for Marital and Sexual Studies in 
Long Beach. Such praise encourages a partner to repeat the feel-good 
techniques. It also makes them more confident about pleasing a partner's sexual 
requests. "Say it in a way that flatters them, such as, 'I would love it if you 
touched me here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Broach emotional feelings about sex at a time when both partners are 
relaxed, Fithian says, when intimacy and mutual respect are at their peak. 
"There's likely to be more understanding and self-revelation." 
</P>
<P>
 * View portrayals of sex in the mass media with skepticism. Don't compare 
yourself to someone who is not real. Psychotherapist Bonnie Maslin understands 
why people like to compare. Sex still worries most of us, she writes in "The 
Angry Marriage: Overcoming the Rage, Reclaiming the Love" (Hyperion, 1994). "Am 
I normal? Do we do it enough? Why do I feel this way? Why do I think this way?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Be wary, for example, when hearing about a friend's wild night of lusty, 
no-strings-attached sex. "People often exaggerate to make themselves sound 
good," Maslin adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Understand that an occasional diminishing interest in sex is normal. "Sexual 
encounters eventually lose the glow of romantic excitement they had when 
couples first met," Maslin writes. "Burning love doesn't continue to burn 
indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
 * Concentrate on resolving self-esteem and relationship problems. "Sex is not 
separate from other parts of your life," says Judith Wallerstein, founder of 
the Center for the Family in Transition, in Northern California. "A low 
self-image or communication problems show up in the bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 * Realize that extra sensitivity is needed if a partner has ever been sexually 
abused. The recent University of Chicago study found that adults who were 
sexually touched as children have higher rates of sexual dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Acknowledge communication barriers relating to gender, religious and ethnic 
differences. For instance, a finding from a 1992 study in the Journal of Sex 
Research discussed how men and women incorrectly perceived each other's sexual 
desires. "This is because men and women are brought up differently," says 
Jukelevics, the Torrance psychologist. "Women tend to value intimacy while men 
express themselves through physical activity. The differences can create sexual 
misunderstandings." 
</P>
<P>
 * Pinpoint words that might be a source of embarrassment, Jukelevics suggests. 
"Sometimes it's best for couples to come up with their own names of genitalia 
or sexual acts. This makes them more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn about sex from books and videos. Stores are full of them. "I found 
that to be an easy way to bring up the subject, especially if we were both 
studying the same thing," says Maureen Ward, a Malibu resident who no longer 
has an unsatisfying sex life. "It's easier to say something like, 'Honey, I 
read this book about hanging from a chandelier, and I think I know a way we can 
really enhance our sex life.' " KRISTINA SAUERWEIN

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; 'PICASSO' PARTY AN ARTISTIC SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Saturday's West Coast premiere of "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" at 
the Westwood Playhouse. There was a packed after-party in the courtyard. 
Performed by the Chicago-based Steppenwolf Theatre Company, this is Steve 
Martin's one-act comedy regarding a hypothetical meeting between Pablo Picasso 
and Albert Einstein in 1904 in a Parisian cafe. "They were two young men with 
big ideas and it was just prior to these ideas being fully expressed," said 
Martin. "I thought about those moments when people are young and filled with 
enthusiasm and magic. That's what the play's about." 
</P>
<P>
 Audience Review: The crowd seemed to embrace the play. They gave it a standing 
ovation. Martin Mull said, "Steve Martin is to playwriting what he is to 
everything else he tries." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Martin, director Randall Arney, plus as large a Hollywood 
turnout as any play in Los Angeles has ever gotten. Among the 500 guests were 
Carol Burnett, Martin Short, John Goodman, Ron Howard, Helen Hunt, Bea Arthur, 
Gary Sinise, Linda Gray, Eric Idle, Dana Delany and Jay Leno, who said: "The 
thing I liked about the play is, not knowing much about art or science, it made 
me feel smart. And I got all the jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Stood Out: An amply bosomed, gray-bearded transvestite wearing hoop 
earrings, black nylons, a tight white dress and orange pumps quietly waited 
outside the theater all evening. "I think he saw 'Ed Wood' one time too many," 
said one guest. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: From Along Came Mary came scallop brochettes, salad nicoise, grilled 
sausages and ratatouille. One veteran playgoer said the difference between 
theater and film premiere crowds is, "Here they just eat. They don't make 
deals. Of course, here there aren't any deals to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Martin on theater versus film: "In a play you can deal with a topic 
like this. In a movie, you really can't. They cost too much and they're for a 
mass audience. With this, I have to fill 500 seats a night and I can be as 
esoteric as I want."

RSVP; PAYING TRIBUTE TO PEACE AND HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never mind that her grandparents on her father's side were Italians. Dolores 
Hope was all colleen for the night. The American Ireland Fund paid tribute to 
Bob Hope's wife Thursday night at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel and you 
could have sworn her brogue was more County Clare than Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 At its 10th annual fund-raising dinner in Los Angeles, the nonpolitical 
organization -- whose motto is "peace, culture, charity" -- decided Hope was 
Irish enough for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Irish grandmother, Nora Kelly, was the delight of my life," she told a 
crowd that included Frank and Katherine Price, Buzz Aldrin, Buddy Rogers, 
Gretchen and Michael Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Hope confided, "I'm not too comfortable without Bob standing beside 
me, I must say." 
</P>
<P>
 But the spirited, silver-haired honoree so gracefully managed to barely let 
her husband get a syllable in edgewise when she invited him onstage, you would 
have thought it was perfectly normal for her to be up there and for Bob to be 
the admiring spouse beaming from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Utterly relaxed at the microphone, as well, Hope -- a professional singer 
before she started to raise her family -- didn't miss the opportunity to plug 
her first album, "Now and Then," which guests received in their gift bags along 
with Hennessy cognac. 
</P>
<P>
 It so happened that Mark and Jack Hennessy and Jack's wife Shirlee -- Toluca 
Lake neighbors of the Hopes and distant descendants of the Irishman who 
established the cognac company -- co-chaired the dinner, at which the St. 
Ambrose Ceili Dancers did Irish jigs and reels and Constance Towers Gavin 
brought down the house, as she does every year, with her renditions of the 
American and Irish national anthems, the latter sung in Gaelic. This year, Ann 
Blyth also sang several Irish melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 While restaurateur Jimmy Murphy was insisting that "nobody knows how to party 
as much as the Irish" and invited seemingly half the crowd back to Jimmy's for 
"a little poteen" afterward, there was other cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire in Northern Ireland certainly had a role in lending the evening 
a more upbeat mood than usual. Indeed, the fund takes partial credit for 
influencing the peace process through social programs it supports in Northern 
Ireland, particularly its 21 integrated schools for Protestant and Catholic 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston-based fund holds similar dinners in 13 other cities annually, 
raising a total of $2.1 million this year.

 LAGUNA HEAT II: Maybe crime doesn't pay, but fighting it certainly costs. The 
city of Laguna Beach received a record bill of $33,275 from the district 
attorney's office -- for prosecuting cases stemming from its Police 
Department's stepped up patrols this past summer. . . . Especially effective 
was its new all-terrain vehicle for beach patrols. Points out city Police Chief 
Neil J. Purcell Jr.: There wasn't a single gang-related incident during the 
summer, a sharp contrast to 1993. The increased patrols, he says, "definitely 
paid off."

<P>
 ROOM WITH NO VIEW: The market for self-storage garages has been down since the 
1980s, but those in the business here say there are signs of renewed interest. 
Financial institutions see them as a great way to store records. Legal firms 
and medical centers are using them to store inactive files. And owners say 
they're practical: One man in Irvine had a chair and rug in his, and went there 
daily to read. . . . The downside: One Laguna Hills tenant was caught recently 
growing 400 marijuana plants in his.

 KNICKER FAN: Payne Stewart has two claims to fame in golf: Besides being a 
former U.S. Open winner, he's the the only prominent player who wears knickers 
every round on tour. Now Stewart wants to be known for something else -- golf 
course architecture. . . . Stewart will be in Fullerton today for business 
talks on his first design effort, the new par-70 Coyote Hills course just off 
Bastanchury Road. Part of the Unocal development, it will open in late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 HER DEAL: One phase of golf men have long dominated: the corporate outing. 
That's where executives take a day off to play for a charity. But the field is 
changing. This morning more than 100 executives -- all women -- will tee off at 
Seacliff Country Club in Huntington Beach for the Inaugural Women's Golf 
Classic -- a breast cancer fund-raiser. . . . Says a spokeswoman: "Golf is 
becoming a mainstay for women executives looking to close a deal with clients."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerome B. Wiesner, a science adviser to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon 
B. Johnson and past president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has 
died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiesner died at his home late Friday after an unspecified illness that lasted 
several months, MIT spokesman Ken Campbell said. Wiesner suffered a stroke 
several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was president of MIT from 1971 to 1980 and a member of the President's 
Science Advisory Committee from 1961 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a humanitarian. The issues that were most important to him were peace, 
disarmament, education," said his son, Zachary. "I think he enjoyed working for 
the government, but he loved MIT." 
</P>
<P>
 After his retirement from MIT, Wiesner was a founding member of the 
International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, a group 
of U.S. and Soviet scientists and educators that raised money for research on 
global problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Detroit, Wiesner joined the MIT radiation laboratory in 1942 after 
directing the University of Michigan's broadcasting service and working as 
chief engineer for the acoustical record lab of the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1945 to 1946, then 
returned to MIT as a professor of electrical engineering, eventually rising to 
department head in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Laya W. Wiesner, and four children.

WILLIAM A. LEONARD; TV NEWS INNOVATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William A. Leonard, a CBS News veteran who influenced network media stars from 
Edward R. Murrow to Dan Rather and helped develop such shows as "60 Minutes," 
died Sunday of a stroke. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard died at Laurel Regional Hospital, according to Tom Goodman, a 
spokesman for CBS. Leonard lived in nearby Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He was responsible for the selection of Rather to succeed Walter Cronkite as 
anchor of the "CBS Evening News." Earlier, he had been a key figure in the 
creation of "60 Minutes," as well as of techniques for rapidly predicting the 
outcome of political races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Leonard was the only on-air network journalist ever to be president of 
CBS News, and his bravura, warm and iconoclastic style reflected his years as a 
major broadcaster and made him a brilliant, unique executive," said Howard 
Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group. "He presided over all of the 
great documentaries of the 1960s and 1970s and was the godfather of '60 
Minutes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York City, Leonard spent his childhood in Orange, N.J., and 
Westport, Conn. He earned a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College and went 
to work as a reporter for the Bridgeport (Conn.) Post-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard joined CBS in 1945, after serving in the Navy during World War II. He 
was hired at the network's flagship radio station, WABC (later WCBS) in New 
York City, to anchor a program that became "This Is New York" on the radio and 
later "Eye on New York" on television. The series, which ran for 15 years with 
Leonard as host, was one of the forerunners of today's electronic magazine 
format. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard's penetrating interview style led him to be chosen by CBS News to be a 
floor reporter at the 1952, 1956 and 1960 political conventions. In 1959, he 
became a full-time CBS News correspondent in the group that would inaugurate 
the CBS Reports documentary series. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard went on to become head of the newly formed CBS News Election Unit in 
1961-65, where he was in charge of editorial policies, production plans and 
on-air broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to supervise political coverage at CBS News until 1972. By 1965, 
he had become vice president and later, senior vice president of CBS News 
programming. During this period, a number of new documentary forms were 
developed at CBS, most notably "60 Minutes" but also "Magazine," "30 Minutes" 
and "Sunday Morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard succeeded the retiring Richard S. Salant as president of CBS News in 
1979 and retired in June, 1982. Among his many news and broadcasting citations 
were a George Foster Peabody award for his career contribution to radio and 
television, several Emmys and the Albert Lasker Award for Medical Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, the former Norma Kaphan Wallace, and six sons.

<P>
 What could have been the worst day of a man's life turned out to be one of his 
luckiest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Yackera learned Sept. 13 that he didn't have cancer. Hours later, he won 
$9 million in Pennsylvania's Wild Card Lotto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through a lot that week," Yackera said of extensive tests before his 
doctor declared him cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Yackera, 34, picked up a check Friday for $305,000, the first installment of 
the jackpot. "I'm a very lucky man and I thank God for everything that's 
happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His immediate plans include a trip to Disney World and early retirement from 
his job as a school district business manager.

PROP. 184: WHY EVEN POLLY KLAAS' FATHER SAYS IT'S A BIG MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surely there's no one in California who isn't sick to death of violent crime 
and fed up with repeat offenders. Indeed, roiling frustration with 
out-of-control crime bubbled over last winter when the "three strikes and 
you're out" law passed the Legislature on greased skids. 
</P>
<P>
 The law doubles prison terms for criminals convicted of a second felony if 
they have previously been convicted of a serious or violent felony. Criminals 
who commit a third felony -- any one of the more than 500 listed in California 
law -- face prison sentences of up to 25 years or life. 
</P>
<P>
 We strongly support longer prison terms targeted on repeat violent offenders, 
but we opposed AB 971, the legislation that established the "three-strikes" 
law. As the first wave of "three-strikes" defendants moves through the courts, 
our worries are being borne out. These early results of AB 971 are why we also 
oppose Proposition 184, on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing law indisputably does some good by locking up the state's most 
violent repeat offenders, but because it casts such a broad net, scooping up 
nonviolent as well as violent criminals, it is also doing great economic harm 
to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 184 simply repeats what was already approved in AB 971, thus it 
would do nothing to improve the law. It would not put one additional criminal 
behind bars nor would it incarcerate anyone for a day more. However, 184 would 
surely multiply the harm that AB 971 has already caused this once-prosperous 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Marc Klaas opposed AB 971 and opposes Proposition 184. His 
daughter, Polly, was kidnaped from her bedroom last year and killed, allegedly 
by a man with a history of violent crime. It was her murder that pushed through 
AB 971, a measure that had been floating around Sacramento for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas lobbied in vain for a competing "three-strikes" bill that would have 
targeted repeat violent felons, such as the man charged with murdering his 
daughter. Now he wants to defeat 184 because he thinks it would cost too much 
and would make a bad law worse. He's right. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Proposition 184 is unnecessary. The initiative clearly adds nothing new in 
the way of punishment. And legal experts say it is so poorly drafted that it 
may unintentionally dilute provisions in the existing law. The initiative's 
"three-strikes" provisions may not apply to those with juvenile records or with 
felony convictions in other states.  
</P>
<P>
 2. Proposition 184 would make future refinements impossible. The major 
difference between the existing law and 184 is that it would take a two-thirds 
vote of both houses to amend 184. The Legislature can amend the existing law 
with a simple majority. Proposition 184 would make it all but impossible for 
state legislators to fine-tune the "three-strikes" law. That fine-tuning is 
already manifestly necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Proposition 184 would lock California into a wrongheaded approach to crime 
control. No one condones petty theft, passing bad checks or possession of small 
quantities of illegal drugs. Those who commit such crimes should be punished. 
But the bulldozer approach of the current "three-strikes" law and 184 sweeps 
"third-strikers" convicted of these crimes into prison for the same terms as 
murderers and rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has already been forced to file 
9,000 "three-strikes" cases. The defendants include a Los Angeles man accused 
of stealing a slice of pizza. A Pomona man could be given 25 years in prison if 
convicted of stealing three steaks to feed his family. And a San Diego man who 
stole a can of beer could face a similar sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Proposition 184 would force California to maintain an expanding prison 
system that is already well beyond the state's ability to manage properly. 
California prison population is at 126,000 and is expected to hit 232,000 by 
the turn of the century. Prison officials project that the state will need 25 
more prisons, above the present 28, at a cost of about $200 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-part series last week Times staff writers Dan Morain, Maria L. La 
Ganga and John Hurst brought into sharp relief the enormous costs and potential 
for abuse in the state's ongoing prison construction program. That construction 
program has generated a maze-like bureaucracy with minimal legislative 
oversight. Prison construction and operation costs are sky-high and soaring 
even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, California allocated less than 3% of its general-fund budget to 
prisons; this year it will spend more than 7.5%. The annual prison payroll 
exceeds $2 billion. California spends more on prisoners' physical and mental 
health care -- $372 million -- than 36 states spend on their entire prison 
budgets. Despite paying more in wages than almost any other state, the 
California Department of Corrections has trouble finding competent guards 
because the job is as dangerous as it is dull and many facilities are in 
sparsely populated parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The probable effect of the coming bulge of "three-strikes" offenders is 
extremely worrisome. Full implementation of this law, if it occurs, would 
necessarily compete for already stressed resources that now go into critical 
state services. California already has a tough sentencing law on the books. 
Proposition 184 does nothing except lock us into sloppy, quick-fix "solutions" 
that don't get at violent crime and may reduce our choices in education, health 
care and other crucial areas.

 Question: What is the limit a company can increase its employees' contribution 
to a health plan? Recently, my company raised the contribution from 25% to 50% 
of the total costs; in addition it instituted a pay cut. What rights do we 
have? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is really no limit on the amount a company can increase its 
employees' contribution to its health plan. In the absence of a collective 
bargaining agreement, maintenance of an employee health plan is completely 
voluntary on the part of an employer. 
</P>
<P>
 An employer does not have to provide coverage at all, and if it does it can 
set whatever level of shared premiums it wants for employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the health plan's summary plan description or the company's employee 
handbook expressly states that premiums will not increase at all, or not go up 
during some set period, your company would have the right to increase your 
premium.

 Question: I am a small-business owner with one part-time, hourly employee. Am 
I required to provide her with a specified of days of sick leave time at full 
compensation? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.E., Orange 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No. There is no law that requires that employers provide employees 
with paid sick leave. Sick leave is purely a matter of contract between an 
employer and its employees. Therefore, unless you have promised in writing or 
orally to provide sick leave benefits to your employee, no law forces you to do 
so.

</P>
<P>
 Question: What rights, if any, do CPAs and accountants have regarding working 
hours? They often have to work 16 or more hours a day to meet deadlines, which 
results in stress headaches and stomach problems. And because they're on 
salary, they do not receive any overtime compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of many people who live with and care about an accountant, I would very 
much appreciate a professional explanation of why accountants must work such 
long, exhausting hours. I would like to know what their rights are, and if it 
is possible for the rules or law in this field to be challenged or changed? 
</P>
<P>
 -- F.O. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Accountants, along with doctors, attorneys and other professionals, 
voluntarily take on the amount of work that they feel they can handle 
comfortably. As professionals, such people are generally exempt from the wage 
and hour laws that establish rights to overtime compensation for most 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional's hours will vary greatly, depending on the individual's drive 
and stamina, depending on the amount of work available. As such a professional, 
I recognize that the extra hours and added stress are offset by the rewards of 
more challenging and enjoyable work, and pride in being a member of a learned 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 If the particular professional that you care about has been overwhelmed by the 
demands of his or her particular situation, perhaps a switch to another firm 
should be considered. Your accountant might also be helped by counseling or 
other professional medical assistance.

 Question: I work in the payroll department of a company that operates several 
day care centers and would like to know if Gov. Pete Wilson's executive order 
W-75-94 is still in effect? That was the change in overtime regulations made 
after the Northridge earthquake to allow employers in the state to calculate 
overtime on a flexible, weekly basis -- meaning an employee would have to work 
more than 40 hours in a week before being eligible for overtime pay, rather 
than just working more than eight hours in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A.A., Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Wilson has since signed Executive Order W-109-94, which lifted the 
daily earthquake overtime exception for the remaining two counties, Los Angeles 
and Ventura. After Oct. 15, 1994, all hours worked beyond eight hours in a day 
reverted to the daily overtime pay structure as before the earthquake. An 
exception to the rule will continue for employers that have implemented an 
alternative workweek program voted on by their employees. After the extensive 
damage to our freeway system caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, five 
counties were allowed to ignore daily overtime requirements. On May 15, 1994, 
the overtime waiver for Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties was 
rescinded and effective Oct. 15, 1994, Los Angeles and Ventura counties are 
also rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension of daily overtime requirements for work over eight hours in one 
day was a great advantage to California businesses. There currently are 46 
states that do not have such daily overtime requirements. If California were 
one of them, it would allow businesses to enhance their economic 
competitiveness and flexibility.

 Documents just filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by 
tabloid behemoth Enquirer/Star Group shows that the single copy circulation of 
its flagship National Enquirer had fallen at an annual rate of 6.3% since 1989, 
dropping from 3.8 million then to 2.7 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's Star publication has dropped at a 5.7% annual rate, to 2.37 
million from 3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company blamed the recent economic slowdown and an overall decline in 
circulation of such publications. It also blamed the increased competition for 
celebrity news, presumably from such tabloid television shows as "Hard Copy" 
and "Inside Edition." 
</P>
<P>
 The company warned that if single copy sales continue to fall, and it is 
unable to increase the price of its publications or advertising revenue, the 
result may be a drop in profits and "a diminished ability" to pay its debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the company's bizarre Weekly World News has been falling in sales, 
dropping at a 10% rate annually since 1989 to 526,166. 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet on whether the publication's issue last week helped any. The 
headline: "Nostradamus Predicted O.J. Verdict; Prophet Knew the Stunning Answer 
500 Years Ago." Floor Space

 The Alhambra Globetrotters?

<P>
 The world-famous Harlem Globetrotters basketball team has made a fast break to 
the San Gabriel Valley city by leasing 6,585 square feet of space there for the 
organization's offices.

<P>
 Don't get the idea that the team moved all the way from Harlem -- previous 
headquarters were in Hollywood. Can You Hum 'Surfin' U.S.A.'?

 Jurors in the Simpson murder case aren't the only ones in a celebrity trial 
who have had to fill out a questionnaire about attitudes and familiarity with 
various facts and issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in a current federal trial involving a dispute over royalties and 
credit between cousins Mike Love and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys have been 
queried about their familiarity with such songs as "California Girls" and "Good 
Vibrations."

 Prospective jurors were also asked such non-musical questions as "Do you read 
the fine print on contracts?" Briefly. . .

 An ad in the Hollywood trades advertises the availability of a "lifestyle 
coach." . . . Not that it matters with the season on ice, but Team Marketing 
Report reports that the average cost of a National Hockey League game is $33.66 
this season. . . . Stop the legal insanity? Infomercial Marketing Report says 
that Susan Powter, the white-haired fitness guru seen on late-night 
infomercials, and her partners are suing each other in Texas in a battle over

THEATER REVIEWS; ROMANCE GOES WITH COMEDIC FLOE IN SCR'S 'GREEN ICEBERGS'; 
CAPTIVATING WORK BY NEWPORT BEACH'S CECILIA FANNON REVOLVES AROUND THE FOIBLES 
OF TWO O.C. COUPLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When underwater plankton become abundant on the lower depths of an iceberg, 
the iceberg can become so lopsided that, on rare occasion, it tips over, 
revealing the previously unseen greenery of the plankton. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so we're told in "Green Icebergs" at South Coast Repertory. Just as the 
iceberg finally reveals its true colors, so do the people in Cecilia Fannon's 
captivating romantic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of her characters are equally "green." While the upheaval in these 
people's lives resuscitates two of them, two others turn their lives over and 
over, without much of anything to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The action of Fannon's play occurs far from actual icebergs, in a seductive 
Tuscan town where two Orange County couples in their mid-30s, each married for 
nine years, are vacationing. The human icebergs begin to upend when Justus 
(Jeff Allin) mistakes Veronica (Nike Doukas) for his own wife, Beth (Annie 
LaRussa), while approaching her from the rear in a cafe as he reads a book. 
</P>
<P>
 The misidentification is quickly cleared up. But ambivalent feelings about 
their marriages soon surface in the conversation between Justus and Veronica, 
kindled by the story in the book Justus is reading. It's about Fra Filippo 
Lippi, the Renaissance priest and painter who defied convention by seducing and 
marrying a nun. Soon the two Americans are defying convention themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The new coupling becomes painfully obvious when the four tourists -- including 
Beth's husband, Claude (Robert Curtis-Brown) -- share a dinner table that 
night. It becomes even plainer the following morning. Drastic measures are 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, more than a year has passed, and the four reunite at the 
same hotel and restaurant, but under very different circumstances. Only at this 
point is it revealed how truly green each character is. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Fannon plays her most predictable narrative card in the first act, she 
has saved enough surprises for the second to keep interest high. Among them, 
Fannon successfully rebuts Beth's earlier complaint that Justus and Veronica 
seem to be in a movie while Claude and Beth are in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Fannon pulls off the difficult task of keeping her entire quartet 
alive and involving while nevertheless making it clear whose side she's on. She 
makes a moral statement, about the superior value of long-term compatibility 
over short-term passion, yet she never sounds moralistic or preachy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Her viewpoint isn't necessarily restricted to marital matters either. She also 
displays a fine-tuned sensitivity to the general importance of keeping private 
affairs private, of considering other people's feelings even when they're no 
longer part of your life. When some of her characters attempt to cash in on 
their personal stories, we get a whiff of the similar concern felt in Alan 
Ayckbourn's masterful "Man of the Moment," at this same theater a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This play isn't as funny as Ayckbourn's, but it does have more than its share 
of witty one-liners, especially for a Southern California audience that knows, 
for example, what Souplantation is like. Only a few of the jokes stretch too 
far for a laugh, most notably one near the top of the script, when we hear an 
absurd story of why Claude stopped playing tennis, which we're apparently 
supposed to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon demonstrates a good ear for writing different kinds of engaging talk 
for her different kinds of characters. Justus, for example, knows how to use 
big words, while Claude knows how to use brusque ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon takes her biggest risk with an omniscient moderator -- a waiter (Hal 
Landon Jr.) who anticipates every order, has a handy homily for every occasion, 
even counsels one of the characters in a scene away from the cafe. He's an 
abstracted memory more than a real person, and he could become insufferable, 
except that Fannon recognizes this and deftly takes advantage of it in her 
second act. 
</P>
<P>
 This play won South Coast's final California Playwrights Competition (Fannon 
is from Newport Beach). Unlike some of the previous winners of that contest, it 
has been given a Mainstage production -- and, as one expects from SCR, a classy 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Director David Emmes directs a pitch-perfect cast. Doukas' throaty allure and 
Allin's loping charm heat up the first act, while LaRussa and Curtis-Brown 
carefully transform their characters' worst qualities into strengths in the 
second. Lighting designer Tom Ruzika got to play with romantic Italian light on 
Robert Brill's sun-washed set, while Ann Bruice's costumes help delineate the 
transformations of Beth and Justus, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, this is the second SCR play in a row (A.R. Gurney's "Later 
Life" just closed Sunday) about Americans who are (or were) inspired to tryst 
while in Italy. The Italian restaurants around South Coast Plaza should be 
doing a booming business.

LOCAL BANDS MAKE FINE DECLARATION AT INDEPENDENT'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Independent's Day '94 festival Saturday at Irvine Meadows had to be one of 
the most imprudent rock concerts ever staged in Orange County. But in the end, 
anyone with a patriotic regard for the local grass-roots rock scene had to 
conclude that, all in all, it was a glorious Twenty-Second. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistakes, there were a few, and not too few to mention. But by doing things 
their way, the show's two young promoters gave the Orange County punk and 
alternative rock scene a much needed shot of specialness at a critical time. 
Yes, the Offspring's success finally gave Orange County rock a strong national 
profile this year, but back on the home front, with Bogart's gone and not 
replaced as a central, professional-caliber venue, grass-roots bands have 
struggled to find a decent, high-profile stage on which to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters Tony Cardullo and Jaime Munoz provided six such stages, temporary 
ones built on the concourse and walkway outside the main amphitheater at Irvine 
Meadows. They invited 75 unsigned or emerging independent-label bands to come 
play on them -- none of them having a draw of more than a few hundred fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The promoters, whose company is called Taurus Enterprises, appear to have lost 
money on their bullish faith in the grass-roots concert market: They estimated 
near the end of the 12-hour festival that they had sold about 2,800 tickets, 
when they needed to pass 3,500 to break even (an additional 1,000 people, 
including all the musicians and their guests, got in free). But just pulling 
off an event of this scope was an achievement.  
</P>
<P>
 Against all odds, the sound and lighting were excellent, bands playing 
simultaneously in close proximity on stages placed back-to-back didn't impinge 
on one another, the fans (most of them in their teens and early 20s) were, with 
a few scant and quickly dealt-with exceptions, a happy and considerate lot, and 
the show ran on time (even if it did run on and on and on). 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, for much of the marathon there was that refreshing sense of 
newness and unpredictability that can make a festival special. A lot of people 
had turned out to see a bunch of less-than-famous bands -- a cross-section that 
by no means represented the artistic or commercial cream of O.C. alternative 
rock. That in itself was special, and the bands came through. The 57 that I 
sampled for at least one song all played with effort that suggested they viewed 
Independent's Day as more than just another gig. 
</P>
<P>
 The day also had its lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rock festivals, like work days, are best when they don't go beyond eight 
hours. The rock segment of the show hit a palpable peak near the eight-hour 
mark, with back-to-back sets by Bitch Funky Sex Machine and One Hit Wonder. 
Bitch Funky laid into its heavy, Black Sabbath-meets-the-Chili Peppers set with 
impressive force and fury. As for One Hit Wonder, I may grow tired of writing 
glowing reviews about this splendidly aggressive and winningly catchy punk-pop 
band, but I doubt I'll grow tired of hearing it play. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, it just got too late and too cold for most of the crowd, which 
thinned out drastically after 9:30. Spirited sets by the Crowd and the reliable 
Burnin' Groove were highlights of the home stretch. Otherwise, hard-core punk 
and wrathful grunge, two styles over-represented on the bill, dominated the 
night hours of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 That made the KUCI-sponsored ska stage a welcome respite. Such bright, sharp 
bands as Larry (humorously dressed in matching Los Angeles Lakers basketball 
uniforms), Reel Big Fish, the Skeletones and See Spot kept the fans hopping 
happily. 
</P>
<P>
 See Spot's easy-rolling blend of ska with traditional New Orleans jazz and 
Dixieland proved an especially helpful remedy for nerves frazzled by the rage 
and doom set. Also on the Jamaican-inspired list was Common Sense, which, when 
I could pry myself away from One Hit Wonder's simultaneous set, offered 
trenchant, tightly played reggae. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're an emerging Orange County band and your sound doesn't have much to 
do with punk or ska, you face an uphill fight for recognition. Two of the day's 
best sets came from the roots-rocking Mystery Train and from Psychic Rain, 
which played a sharp and emotive brand of rock that had a bit of Elvis 
Costello, Graham Parker and Neil Young in it. Neither attracted much of a 
crowd, as the masses pursued more punkish fare on other stages. About 100 fans 
watched as Psychic Rain's Greg Stoddard sang his heart out on the walkway 
stage, but hundreds more filed by without even slowing for a look as they made 
their way to the main concourse. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least if people walked by they can get a little taste of it, and that's 
what it's all about," Stoddard said cheerfully after his band finished. 
</P>
<P>
 * If Liz Phair feels like an exile on the male-dominated Chicago scene she 
dubbed Guyville, she should check out O.C., where the female rock musician is a 
woefully rare bird. The vast lineup offered just one all-female band, Milk N 
Honey. Otherwise, the O.C. women's club was, as far as I could tell, limited to 
one singer in the ska band called Larry, and a grunge bassist or two. A couple 
of Los Angeles bands were fronted by women singers: Human Waste Project (led by 
a charismatic, blond Courtney Love-type yeller) and the rap-metal act, Manhole. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent's Day wasn't gender-biased, but merely reflected a general lack of 
women playing rock in O.C. Only Gwen Stefani, the singer of No Doubt, and Kim 
Shattuck and Melanie Vammen of the Muffs come to mind as well-established 
female rockers on the local modern-rock scene. Country, folk, pop and blues -- 
different story. But where are the rockin' lasses? 
</P>
<P>
 * The day's youngest bands bore the brunt of the festival's only major 
mess-up. Because of a miscommunication, Munoz said, the stage set aside for 
high school bands was left without a sound system for several hours. Hence, 
bands could be seen lounging forlornly on the stage when they should have been 
bashing it out. Eventually, all the high-schoolers got to play, with the last 
two, Needless and Elvis Disciples, staying five hours past their scheduled 
starting times to get a chance to perform. Two fledgling bands I saw, Outlook 
and Dennis, already had a decent idea of how to shape a song and write a 
melodic hook. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were various strategies for sampling the numerous options laid out on 
helpful program leaflets that gave a grounds map and accurate schedule of 
performances. Jennifer Johnson, 18, knew she wanted to see Outlook, which 
included friends of hers from Santa Margarita High School, and Common Sense. 
Other than that, she said, "I'll just pick the (bands with) the best names." 
</P>
<P>
 A large, friendly, gap-toothed skinhead named Colonel said he was there to see 
the hard-and-fast bands (HFL, the Grabbers and China White were favorite 
options for the hard-core punk set; the more melodic Gameface was another 
favorite of the punkers, and showed in a strong set that it has moved at least 
part of the way out from the shadow of Big Drill Car, its better-established 
sound-alike). 
</P>
<P>
 As for the non-punk stretches, Colonel said stoically, "I'll deal with it." 
Hours later, he passed judgment on the proceedings with a grin and a thumbs up. 
With punk available in most time slots, he didn't have to deal with much else. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Curto, director of operations at Irvine Meadows, gave the Independent's 
Day promoters high marks for what he viewed as a trial run to see how they 
would function.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a very good job. I'd cut it down a bit next time." 
</P>
<P>
 That part makes lots of sense and is easily done. What remains to be seen is 
whether Irvine Meadows and its regular promoter, Avalon Attractions, will do 
what they can to improve the chances for a successful sequel by sharing costs 
and assisting with promotional resources for an Independent's Day '95.  
</P>
<P>
 Just as it's good ecology for lumber companies to plant seedlings in the 
forests they harvest, it's good business, and simply a point of honor, for 
promoters who rake in big profits from the Orange County market to nurture the 
musical grass-roots as well.

MIXING IT UP WITH THE GENIUSES; STEVE MARTIN'S IDEAS AT PLAY IN 'PICASSO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Picasso at the Lapin Agile," which opened Saturday night at the Westwood 
Playhouse, Steve Martin approaches playwriting with the energy and the reinless 
irony -- perhaps the first purely exhilarating irony ever concocted -- that he 
used in the mid-1970s to transform stand-up comedy from a cabaret act into a 
post-modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Martin seems to be seeking that youthful sensation of limitless 
possibility that he must have experienced when he was breaking form, the 
euphoria of feeling one's own burgeoning gifts stretch out to reach a place 
that neither the artist nor the unknowing, waiting world has yet conceived. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin pinpoints the year, 1904, when the 23-year-old Picasso was overflowing 
with ideas that produced dozens of startling pencil drawings, the year in which 
his blue period gave way to rose, and, in Martin's imagination, the year in 
which he experienced his first vision of "Les Demoiselles D'Avignon," the 
painting that would help usher in the revolution known as Cubism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the warm bohemian at atmosphere of a Parisian bar called the Lapin Agile, 
Picasso (Tim Hopper) realizes his power. "If I think it, I can draw it," he 
says. He euphorically describes his connection to all the great artists who 
came before and, simultaneously, to all of the great artists who will come 
after. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, it's like a relay?" asks Gaston (Nathan Davis), a beret-wearing 
Frenchman, exhibiting the playwright's gift for pleasing absurdities. In fact, 
it is Martin's love of play that is "Picasso's" main character, not the artist 
or the evening's other well-known barfly, Albert Einstein (Rick Snyder). 
Einstein's theories on a continuum of time and space complement Picasso's 
rhapsodic epiphanies about art, but these ideas are merely window dressing on 
Martin's own concerns about employing comedy to turn the expected absolutely 
upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 As a new playwright, Martin's brain works at full throttle as he attacks the 
boundaries and traditions of theater. When Einstein enters, the bartender 
Freddy (Tracy Letts) flies into the audience and grabs a program, outraged that 
the physicist has entered out of the order listed therein. Soon after that 
Freddy steps forward to explain that he is leaving to take care of a neighbor's 
unpaid bar tab and that he may be gone for a longer time than that transaction 
would normally take. "But," he patiently explains to the audience, 
"traditionally, that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's grapple with the art of playwriting is a worthy battle to behold. He 
has not, however, won it hands down. His characters chatter riotously (Freddy 
and his lover Germaine argue whether her Romanticism is post- or neo-), but 
they are only conceits. Hopper's studly Picasso comes on as not only the 
greatest artist but the biggest ego the world has ever produced. He soon blends 
into the background, though, as each character comes forward to state his 
particular idea. For one brief moment, when Picasso attempts to mollify a 
wounded lover, there threatens to be some actual interaction. But that soon 
passes and the parade of ideas and jokes come on. 
</P>
<P>
 When Einstein looks at one of Picasso's pencil drawings, he sinks in his chair 
and exclaims, with full understanding of Picasso's genius, "I never thought the 
20th Century would be handed to me so casually." Yet when he meets Picasso, 
Einstein seems dubious of the artist's gifts, as if the playwright could not 
resist putting that line into Einstein's mouth but could not follow through on 
what it meant. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters do have brilliant set pieces. Sagot (Alan Wilder), the 
unscrupulous art dealer, has a great bit about why people will not buy 
paintings of Jesus. In another, Freddy and Germaine (the wonderful Rondi Reed) 
take turns predicting the future. "There will be a brief craze for lawn 
flamingos," she says, and, going two for two, "Music by four lads from 
Liverpool!" Freddy isn't quite as gifted. "Led by Germany, this will be known 
as the century of peace!" 
</P>
<P>
 But the most wonderful of all the set pieces is a brief visit by a huckster 
named Schmendiman. Exhibiting a spasmodic joy over his discovery of a "very 
brittle and inflexible" building material called Schmendimite, Schmendiman 
(Troy Eric West) is a stand-in for Martin's early stand-up persona, which the 
comedian once described as "a character with total confidence and nothing to 
back it up." Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company re-creates its production 
here, with arch and fluid direction by artistic director Randall Arney. As 
Einstein, Snyder delivers a stock old codger, complete with Ed Wynn laugh, but 
the cast is inventive and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The third genius (it's definitely not Schmendiman) does arrive, and he shows 
Picasso a vision of "Les Demoiselles D'Avignon." The painting lights up the 
stage, and we are meant to feel its enormous impact on the century and see it 
as the climactic extension of all of the discussions about genius and art and 
time that have gone on throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a problematic painting to feel ecstatic about. Martin has not fully 
explained what the breakthrough means to Picasso -- after all, a visitor from 
the future has come and handed Picasso the vision. Also, it's a weirdly angry 
and, one can't help noticing, misogynistic image. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it is the joyful huckster Schmendiman who makes the most impact. 
One senses that Martin could not resist putting himself, if only briefly, in 
there, mixing it up with his two favorite geniuses. That's a true act of 
daring, and one that makes "Picasso" truly worth seeing.

FALL FILMS SLUMP DESPITE 'PULP'; BOX OFFICE: THE GRITTY FILM HOLDS STRONG WITH 
$8.1 MILLION IN ITS SECOND WEEKEND, WHILE 'LOVE AFFAIR' LIMPS ALONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The honeymoon has ended abruptly for "Love Affair," the amorous pairing of 
Warren Beatty and off-screen wife Annette Bening. Despite a potent marketing 
campaign and more than one Saturday night sneak preview, audience ardor was 
missing from the film's opening weekend. Its estimated ticket sales were a limp 
$5.7 million on 1,585 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 That made for a third-place finish. But it was another lackluster fall weekend 
at the box office despite a wide variety of films playing. "I don't understand 
it," said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations, a company that tracks movie 
attendance. "There's a good selection of movies out there, but people just 
aren't going." 
</P>
<P>
 Business for the season is down almost 10% from last year. The only muscle at 
the box office was "Pulp Fiction," which held strong with an estimated $8.1 
million in its second weekend, obviously getting good word of mouth to back up 
some powerhouse reviews. Exit surveys continue "through the roof," according to 
David Dinerstein, senior vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes "Pulp" the undisputed No. 1 film. With more than $21 million in 10 
days, it joins a select group of fall films that can be classified as even 
marginal hits. They include "The Specialist," starring Sylvester Stallone and 
Sharon Stone, in second place, which dropped down to $6.1 million in its third 
weekend, but has about $35 million so far. Locked in a battle for fifth place, 
Meryl Streep's "The River Wild" took in another $4.2 million over the past 
weekend and has taken in about $32 million. However, both films were costly. So 
they're not totally out of the woods yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pulp" on the other hand came in at less than $10 million. (Other strong fall 
performers have been "TimeCop" which has topped $40 million, making it Jean 
Claude Van Damme's biggest grosser to date, and the late summer release 
"Natural Born Killers," which has grossed about $47 million so far). 
</P>
<P>
 Woody Allen's "Bullets Over Broadway" got a great send-off from reviewers and 
in New York and Los Angeles engagements managed more than $72,000 in its first 
weekend. Of course, those two burgs have traditionally been Allen strongholds. 
The real test will come as the period comedy expands to more than 200 theaters 
by Nov. 4. The Sundance Festival favorite, "Clerks," finally came to town, 
again New York and Los Angeles. The black-and-white convenience store comedy, 
which originally cost $27,000, did a little better than that over the weekend 
and took in $35,000 in its first five days of release. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of "Love Affair" along with the disappointing debut of "Puppet 
Masters," which managed only $4.1 million, and the disastrous first weekend of 
the period mystery/comedy "Radioland Murders," which barely cracked $800,000 on 
844 screens, are but three more titles on the ever-expanding fall casualty 
list: "Wes Craven's New Nightmare," despite terrific reviews, followed the 
traditional pattern of horror films by losing almost half its opening weekend 
audience with $3.6 million on 1,870 screens and $11.6 million to date. The 
other disappointing romantic comedy in theaters is "Only You" starring Robert 
Downey Jr., which dipped to about $2.75 million with less than $15 million to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notable box-office disappointments for the season have been "Quiz Show," 
"Ed Wood," "Terminal Velocity" and "Exit to Eden." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's still out on "Little Giants." Despite a so-so opening, second 
weekend business showed little erosion -- there being little for kids in the 
fall mix. The $4.2-million weekend total brings "Giants" to almost $10 million 
in 10 days. Ditto "The Shawshank Redemption," which didn't exactly set theater 
ticket booths on fire when it jumped to more than 900 screens last weekend. It 
declined only marginally to $2.15 million and has also grossed about $10 
million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 But no film has demonstrated the sustaining power of "Forrest Gump," which is 
still in the top 10 after 16 weeks in release, adding another $2.7 million over 
the weekend. The $300-million mark is still comfortably in its sights. Popular 
is as popular does.

PROKOFIEV'S FIERY, SURREAL 'ANGEL' RISES IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stage, a dark eerie box, is haunted, quite literally, by a silent horde of 
virtually naked white demons who freeze, scramble, crawl, stalk, contort, 
tumble, stretch, climb the dank walls and gently mock the feeble mortals in 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeble mortals include a strong-voiced maiden experiencing the terminal 
throes of sexual hysteria, a masochistic knight who wants to possess her, a 
generous representation of mystics and religious fanatics, one sadistic 
alchemist, a devil in disguise who amuses himself by devouring a tavern lad, 
and, oh yes, a chorus of nuns who strip off their habits in a climactic 
outburst of orgiastic frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera is such a delicate art. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you couldn't tell, the bill at the War Memorial Opera House on Friday 
was not "La Boheme." It was Sergei Prokofiev's "The Fiery Angel," a.k.a. 
"Ognenniy angel," a strange and startling, daring and ultimately poignant 
evocation of 16th-Century Germany as filtered through the sensibilities of 
modernist Russia, ca. 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles saw a fascinating, boldly primitive facsimile of the forbidding 
opus at the Music Center in 1987, staged by Andrei Serban and designed by 
Robert Israel. San Francisco chose a safer, arguably more authentic version, 
borrowing a universally applauded and much traveled production from the 
Maryinsky Theater, a.k.a. Kirov, in St. Petersburg, a.k.a. Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
 This "Fiery Angel," staged by the progressive British director David Freeman 
amid sparse surrealist decors by David Roger, was mounted at the Maryinsky in 
1991. It was subsequently sent to Covent Garden in London and, as part of a 
historic Kirov tour, to the Metropolitan Opera in New York. It has been 
recorded for a doubtlessly grateful posterity on videotape as well as compact 
discs. 
</P>
<P>
 One can argue about the sustaining qualities of Prokofiev's massive score -- 
sometimes cataclysmic in its brute force, sometimes dazzling in its sardonic 
wit, occasionally compelling in its muted lyricism and, one fears, frequently 
muddled in its expressive convolutions. But it would be difficult to argue 
about the impact of Freeman's sensitive theatrical vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic inspirations are wild, to be sure, and the interpretive gestures 
are drastic. However, they never distort, much less contradict, the basic 
musical impulse. In contemporary opera production, that is a very big, very 
crucial but.  
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted that the basic musical impulses were not given optimal 
weight or focus on this occasion. "The Fiery Angel" has been a favored 
showpiece for Valery Gergiev from the start, and, according to all reports, the 
mighty Russian maestro brings virtually manic brio to this forbidding 
challenge. Unfortunately, Gergiev had to attend to some urgent directorial 
business in St. Petersburg on Friday, and he yielded his place on the San 
Francisco podium to a valiant Kirov associate, Alexander Polianichko. 
</P>
<P>
 The associate, making a difficult debut in operatic America, held everything 
together with informed competence, even though he could do little to ignite 
hand-me-down sparks. The dynamic discourse was cautious. The energy level, 
especially at the outset, was low. The emotional violence was muted. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, sight tended to overpower sound. And those 
omnipresent demons -- superbly enacted by a team of acrobatic mimes from St. 
Petersburg -- tended to draw undue attention from the poor protagonists who had 
to act primarily with their voices. The balances in modern musical theater are 
precarious. 
</P>
<P>
 The central role of Renata is relentlessly demanding. The vocal line is 
extraordinarily long and loud, high and tough. Despite some technical problems, 
Marilyn Zschau made a tour de force of the demented heroine in the Los Angeles 
production seven years ago. Galina Gorchakova, miscast last year as Puccini's 
Butterfly at the Music Center, triumphed in San Francisco as a very different 
Renata. 
</P>
<P>
 Hysteria is not her forte. With Freeman's obvious support, she stressed an 
overriding degree of misplaced innocence throughout, focusing numb distraction 
rather than raging passion. The essential understatement created sympathy in 
this context, and the soprano sang the impossible music with abiding purity, 
unflinching stamina and point. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Leiferkus complemented her as an almost heroic, attractively compulsive 
Ruprecht. Konstantin Pluzhnikov introduced a compellingly sly and crusty 
Mephistopheles, and, replacing an indisposed colleague, doubled ably as the 
blustery Agrippa von Nettesheim. Larissa Diadkova upheld the sacred Russian 
tradition of the gallon-jug contralto nobly as the Sorceress and Mother 
Superior. Bulat Minzhilkiev boomed nicely as the mean Inquisitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The American contingent held its own honorably in secondary assignments. Scott 
Wilde served as an exceptionally sonorous Peasant, Larry Henderson as an 
unusually sympathetic Heinrich and Donna Petersen as an uncommonly endearing 
Landlady. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, for once, a stimulating night at the opera. 
</P>

ABRACADABRA: DISNEY, ROBIN WILLIAMS QUIT FEUD; MOVIES: STUDIO PRESIDENT JOE 
ROTH APOLOGIZES TO THE ACTOR, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT DID BREACH AN AGREEMENT 
WITH HIM. BOTH SIDES SAY THEY WILL NOW DISCUSS FILM PROJECTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Genie is back in the bottle. The yearlong feud between actor Robin 
Williams and the Walt Disney Co. is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who last autumn accused Disney of lying to him and breaching an 
agreement not to use his voice to merchandise products inspired by the hit 
animated film "Aladdin," has received an apology from newly installed studio 
chief Joe Roth. Both sides say they will now discuss movie projects, although 
no official deal yet exists. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks as stunning as they were contrite -- especially coming from a 
studio chief -- Roth admitted that Disney had exploited Williams without his 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin complained that we took advantage of his performance as the Genie in 
the film, exploiting him to promote some other businesses inside the company," 
Roth told The Times. "We had a specific understanding with Robin that we 
wouldn't do that. (Nevertheless) we did that. We apologize for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Roth said, "Disney may have been responsible" for the media's 
portraying the dispute as a ploy by the actor to get more money for his role as 
the wisecracking Genie in the 1992 film. At the time, sources close to the 
dispute had characterized Williams' comments as "sour grapes" because he 
received scale pay of $75,000 for a film that grossed more than $200 million 
domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question in my mind that we need to apologize (to Williams) . . . 
for not defusing the issue in the media that (his motive) appeared to be about 
money," Roth said. "I've known Robin for years and know that none of these 
issues are ever about money. They are simply about principle." 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting the olive branch, Williams called Roth's apology "a decent thing" 
and added: "It's like a country re-establishing diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling because I've done good things there," the actor-comedian 
said. Those include "Good Morning, Vietnam" in 1987 and "Dead Poets Society" in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't trying to shake anybody down," Williams said in a telephone 
interview. He said hawking merchandise "is one thing I don't do," noting that 
he has felt that way since his days on television, joking that it probably 
began when he first saw "Mork and Mindy" dolls "dismembered in trash cans." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute with Disney came to a boil last November, when Williams went on 
"The Today Show" to publicize his film "Mrs. Doubtfire," which had been 
greenlighted by Roth when he was head of 20th Century Fox studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling on an imaginary nose a la Pinocchio, Williams did little to disguise 
his anger at Disney, telling an interviewer: "You realize when you work for 
Disney why the mouse has only four fingers -- because he can't pick up a 
check." He made a similar comment in New York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney later sent him a Picasso painting as a way of thanking him for his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has said all along that he played the Genie as simply as "a favor." 
He noted that what started out as one day's work "ended up to be weeks. It was 
27 hours' worth of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love animation, and Disney is the Rolls-Royce of animation," he said. "But 
I told them, 'Don't use my voice to sell merchandise,' and they agreed to 
that." When Disney went ahead and used his voice in their marketing, Williams 
said, he felt "it was like a violation of a trust." 
</P>
<P>
 The apology is remarkable for the Disney studios, which have been rocked by a 
change of leadership in recent weeks. Jeffrey Katzenberg, who gambled and lost 
in his attempt to become the No. 2 man in Disney's corporate adminstration, was 
replaced by Roth in September. Katzenberg has since gone off to create his own 
studio with director Steven Spielberg and record mogul David Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said one of his first tasks after assuming command was to put out peace 
feelers to Williams, through his agent, business manager and attorney. "As soon 
as I got the job, I called up people in his camp . . . and said 'I'd like to 
get back into the Robin Williams business.' I kind of left Fox a little early 
for 'Mrs. Doubtfire.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Roth stressed that his overture to Williams was in no way meant as a 
signal that he was heaping blame on Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a Jeffrey or a non-Jeffrey issue whatsoever," Roth said. "This is 
something that happened inside a very large organization through its 
merchandising and all of its tentacles that went out with what they thought was 
the best way to sell a picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also declined to heap blame on Katzenberg, saying the problem was 
caused by Disney's monster marketing machine. "I wouldn't want to take a whack 
at Jeffrey," he said. "It's a company thing. Something went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it seemed clear by Roth's willingness to make amends that the studio chief 
is sending a signal to the creative community that Disney will be a 
talent-friendly place under his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One earmark of the Katzenberg years was the way the studio would consistently 
create box-office stars but then see the actors work for other studios because 
Disney simply refused to cave in to agents' contract demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said that although there exists no official deal between Disney and 
Williams, "there is an understanding." He said one of the scripts he will show 
Williams is called "Jack." It's a story about a 40-year-old who is in fact a 
10-year-old who has a disease that makes him age four years for every year of 
his life. It will be produced by Ricardo Mestres, former head of Hollywood 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio chief also said he will entertain any ideas Williams has for film 
projects, including animated movies. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Williams, he's just glad to be on speaking terms again with Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just when people are getting burned right and left (in Hollywood), look, an 
act of kindness!"

MUSIC REVIEWS; VIENNA CHOIR BOYS WILL BE BOYS -- PURE AND SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the best things about the Vienna Choir Boys is thatthey they never 
pretend to be anything but children. They may be vocally blessed, trained and 
disciplined, but there is no Hollywood hype, no hint at worldliness beyond 
their 10 to 14 years, no saccharin stabs at calculated cuteness. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only purity of vocal production and of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 These qualities distinguished their performance Saturday night at Segerstrom 
Hall. Presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society, the concert combined 
the natural innocence of 24 sheltered youngsters with the results of a nearly 
500-year-old tradition of excellent instruction. Under the leadership of Georg 
Stangelberger, the outcome may not have moved the emotions, but it could not 
help but inspire admiration for unfailingly true tone production, clarity and 
precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Stangelberger took his chorus -- one of the four touring groups, a combined 
total of 100 sopranos and altos, that make up the Vienna boys -- through styles 
that spanned four musical periods and three languages. In Purcell's three 
pieces from "Come ye sons of art," written in the last quarter of the 17th 
Century, as in the conductor's own 1994 set -- an "Ave Maria" and "Ocenas" (Our 
Father) -- dedicated to those who died in the Bosnian conflagration -- the 
ensemble maintained careful balance, excelling in fluid legato, but tackling 
Stangelberger's insistent, broken phrases and punctuating glissandi with 
aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Schubert -- himself once a member of this esteemed organization -- and 
Mozart received their due (the latter in a hodgepodge of German-sung and 
English-spoken translations of scenes arranged from his unfinished opera buffa 
"L'Oca de Cairo"), Stangelberger did not dwell only on the historical legacy of 
the choir. Besides his own compositions, the conductor/pianist also programmed 
other less-than familiar contemporary works -- Austrian Heinz Kratochwil's 
jazzy "Jubilate Deo" and Canadian R. Murray Schafer's Western-sounding, a 
capella "Gamelan." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, his jaunty, sailor-bloused singers exhibited ever consistent 
polish.

MUSIC REVIEWS; INNOVATION IS BYWORD FOR CHAMBER SERIES OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As composer Stephen Lucky Mosko pointed out before Saturday's concert, 
promoters' unwillingness to hazard the financial risk of programming and 
publishers' reluctance to print contemporary output has left audiences woefully 
unprepared to hear music of their own era. 
</P>
<P>
 He was obviously not talking about the Southwest Chamber Music Society's 
concert that evening at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, in which 
chamber members continued their long-established quest to broaden listeners' 
musical vocabularies and to enlarge restricted concert repertory from all 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, for the opening of the fifth Chamber Music Series in 
Founders Hall, Artistic Director Jeff von der Schmidt seemed to have chosen 
pieces infused with a spirituality particular to each of the chosen composers 
-- Mosko, Messiaen and the intensely devout Austrian Catholic, Bruckner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the selections was the premiere of Mosko's "Psychotropics." But when 
prodded to describe his artistic intent, Mosko refused to intrude upon a 
musical experience that might differ for everyone. Instead, he offered an 
otherworldly concept of a sound environment that one walks through, each 
reacting in different ways. He also noted intentional pairings based on 
relationships among the players for which it was written -- violist Jan Karlin 
and her husband, hornist Schmidt as well as between Stuart Horn on oboe and 
English horn, and his longtime friend, the composer's wife, Dorothy Stone on 
flute, bass flute and piccolo. 
</P>
<P>
 The work offered constantly changing sonic colors and effects, exploiting both 
traditional and unusual sounds on the quintet's eight possible instruments, 
including Vicki Ray's piano. Mosko emphasized the darker side of his palette, 
over a wash of ever-shifting meters that required him to conduct the quartet 
and that also left an uncomfortable impression of a technical exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Two compositions by the French mystic Messiaen received authoritative 
readings, with Stone attentively shaping the angular and ominous blackbird of 
"Le Merle Noir" and Ray excelling in deliberate soliloquy against a monolithic 
string quartet -- formed by violinists Peter Marsh and Susan Jensen, Karlin and 
cellist Roger Lebow -- for the late "Piece."  
</P>
<P>
 Bruckner's Quintet in F, long absent from standard fare, found eloquent 
champions here. Adding violist Richard Elegino to the above quartet, the 
ensemble brought insistent passion and compelling depth to its reading, 
particularly in the lush, mournful cantilena of the Andante.

 Bush's Turn: Former President George Bush opened "Saturday Night Live" with a 
few shots at Dana Carvey's impersonations of him during his years in the White 
House. "Do I have any hard feelings about that? Yes I do, and I'll have my 
revenge when the time is right," Bush joked. "Not now. Wouldn't be prudent at 
this juncture. But revenge will be mine." Bush, on tape from his home in 
Houston, declined to use the standard introductory line, "Live from New York, 
it's Saturday Night." He explained he was on tape and wasn't in New York, and, 
anyway, the usual line was "just not something I do." Carvey, who left the show 
in April, was a guest host Saturday.

abuse. . . . These children are American's home-grown refugees. I'm glad I 
could help," the sitcom star said.

 Costners Divorcing: Actor Kevin Costner and his wife, Cindy, are divorcing 
after 16 years of marriage. The college sweethearts have three children. 
Costner, 39, has won seven Academy Awards, including best director for "Dances 
With Wolves," and is currently filming the highly budgeted "Waterworld," a 
futuristic " 'Road Warrior' on the water" adventure. No reason was given for 
the split. "We did not come to this decision easily and on behalf of our entire 
family we ask to be allowed the dignity of sorting through this most painful 
part of our lives in private," the couple said in a statement.

 Suite Parting: Playwright Neil Simon has sent his disregards to Broadway with 
the announcement that his newest comedy, "London Suite," will not be staged on 
the Great White Way when it opens in New York next year. "It's just not 
economically viable for us to go to Broadway anymore," Simon, 67, told the New 
York Times. Since "Come Blow Your Horn" in 1961, Simon has had 23 plays 
performed on Broadway but the playwright said his next Gotham opening will be

 Tribute to Houdini: It's no illusion -- workers are repairing Harry Houdini's 
vandalized grave site at Machpelah Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens, N.Y., thanks 
to the magic of a $10,000 donation from David Copperfield. "I was shocked by 
the senselessness of the incident," Copperfield said by phone from Den Haag, 
Holland, where he's on tour. "What a terrible act of violence, to disturb the 
final resting place of such a great American legend." Workers hope to have most 
of the repairs done by Halloween -- the 68th anniversary of Houdini's death.

PERFORMING ARTS; SOLID SET FROM PETERS OPENS ARTS VENUE

 "This was the dream that wouldn't die," announced Thousand Oaks council member 
Judy Lazar at the grand opening performance Friday night at the city's new 
Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dream, which has persisted for nearly a decade, did not come to life 
without a few glitches and some heroic efforts from everyone involved. Signs of 
the last-minute crunch to bring things together were obvious around the fringes 
of the celebration -- from the portable generators supplying lighting for the 
parking lots to a hasty application of duct tape to hold down the red carpet at 
the entryway. 
</P>
<P>
 Glitches aside, by 8 on opening night the important elements were all in 
place. The brand new Civic Auditorium was spick-and-span, the Conejo Symphony 
and the combined choirs of the Conejo Valley were massed on stage, raring to 
go, and headline artist and Broadway star Bernadette Peters was waiting in the 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a season schedule that features such mainstream names as Ray Charles, 
Paul Anka, Kenny Rogers and Liza Minnelli, Peters probably was an 
understandable choice for the event. Still, with the number of performers who 
live in the area, one wonders why a local artist wasn't the headliner. (How 
interesting it might have been, for example, had someone been able to persuade 
Newbury Park resident Artie Shaw to pick up his clarinet one more time.) 
</P>
<P>
 But no apologies were needed for Peters' performance. As always, she was 
adorable. Alternately seductive and sweet, comical and serene, she commanded 
the stage with the deceptive ease of a theatrical veteran. Her voice is one of 
the unique sounds in popular music, capable of moving easily from Betty 
Boop-like coyness to hard-belting Vegas-style climaxes. Less obvious, but 
equally significant, she sings everything with pinpoint musical accuracy and an 
actor's respect for the story-telling relevance of the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters worked her way through a far-ranging collection of material, from 
Stephen Sondheim ("Broadway Baby," "No One Is Alone" and the "Dick Tracy" 
ballad, "Sooner or Later") to Andrew Lloyd Webber ("Like an Unexpected Song"), 
the blues, pop standards and a characteristically whimsical rendering of "Glow, 
Little Glow Worm." Halfway through her set, a too-heavy dose of unfamiliar 
numbers slowed down the musical flow. But Peters quickly picked things up with 
a lovely medley of Harold Arlen songs, finally closing her show with a quietly 
touching reading of "I'll Be Seeing You." 
</P>
<P>
 The gala performance began with Shostakovich's Festival Overture -- a 
suitable, if not particularly inspiring selection for the start of the 
inauguration. Any number of other, more familiar works would have done the job 
as well and with greater audience recognition. The finale to Beethoven's 
Symphony No. 9 followed, and it was a far more appropriate composition, and one 
that tested the skills of conductor Elmer Ramsey and the orchestra and chorus, 
as well as the acoustics of the new hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, neither fared as well as they should have. Ramsey generated 
very little emotional intensity from his players, and there were times when 
much of his attention seemed focused simply on keeping them in sync. This is an 
orchestra with a large group of quality musicians, especially in its violin and 
woodwind sections, but it still is a good distance away from discovering an 
ensemble sound and substance of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The acoustics, in a 1,500-seat hall that is alleged to have no seats farther 
than 118 feet from the stage, were also lacking, sounding dampened and subdued, 
sometimes to the point of audio blandness. The climaxes in the Beethoven Ninth, 
for instance, which should explode off the stage, were compressed and limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' amplified music reached out somewhat better, although the orchestral 
accompaniment again appeared to recede into the background. At the very least, 
the venue has more work to do in tuning the room's acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
 One further aesthetic problem is the absence of a grand entry -- the sort of 
large gathering area that creates excitement and anticipation as an audience 
enters the hall.  
</P>
<P>
 These caveats aside, the Civic Arts Plaza is a welcome addition to the growing 
Southland list of first-rate performance arenas. The dream has become a 
reality.

POP; MUSIC, POLITICS MIX IT UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pop music and politics too rarely mix in any meaningful way these days. But a 
daylong festival geared to opposition of Prop. 187 (the so-called "Save Our 
State" initiative) at the Olympic Auditorium on Saturday -- headlined by the 
rappers of Cypress Hill -- usually managed to focus on its pro-immigrant and 
pro-Latino messages. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest exception was the headlining set by Cypress Hill. In spite of 
compelling beats and effects, the rappers had a hard time communicating a 
message against the measure, which would deny education, non-emergency health 
care and other social services to undocumented immigrants. Legalization of 
marijuana remains the bigger issue for this Los Angeles trio. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the other talent gathered on two outdoor stages in the Olympic 
parking lot, angry messages leveled against Prop. 187 and Gov. Pete Wilson 
mixed with rhetoric about issues facing indigenous American peoples. Rap-rock 
band Rage Against the Machine brought out Native American activist Russell 
Means before launching into a typically frantic reading of its underground hit 
"Freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, radical political rap group Aztlan Underground implored in Spanish, 
"My blood is red / I am human," before sitting down to beat traditional drums. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall the crowd was mainly made up of fans in their late teens and 
early 20s. But earlier in the day, veteran activists and families with baby 
carriages helped crowd the open lot, listening to the more than 20 musical acts 
of rap and rock and milling around booths selling posters of Cesar Chavez, 
books and jewelry and promoting the United Farm Workers union, the American 
Indian Movement and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Culture Clash -- the Latino comedy troupe that hosted the event -- and UFW 
vice president Dolores Huerta gave speeches urging people to cast ballots in 
the November election. And Huerta's son, who calls himself Kool-Aid, was 
responsible for one of the day's high points with an impassioned a capella rap 
against the present anti-immigrant environment. STEVE APPLEFORD

COUNTERPUNCH: 'WOOD' TARNISHES A GOOD MAN -- LUGOSI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MITCHELL, Lisa Mitchell is a free-lance writer specializing in 
film-related subjects. She has written previously for The Times and her 
articles on Lugosi have appeared in such magazines as Famous Monsters, New West 
and Cult Movies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The photograph accompanying David Kronke's article "A Bela and His Chihuahuas" 
(Calendar, Oct. 2) was a vivid reminder that, for all the lively entertainment 
of Tim Burton's "Ed Wood," the movie does Bela Lugosi a terrible disservice and 
highlights the shallowness of the research done on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually the photo of actor Martin Landau, portraying Lugosi with a Chihuahua 
in each hand, is one of the less significant distortions in the film. But it 
jumped out at me because the real Lugosi was a man who only had large dogs such 
as Dobermans and German shepherds. 
</P>
<P>
 As one who saw Lugosi in his latter years and has often written about him, I 
was moved to telephone Bela Lugosi Jr. to get his reaction. The late actor's 
son, who has not seen the film but had been told about it by friends, said the 
Chihuahua photo was indeed indicative of what he heard about the film's more 
damaging inventions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand taking some dramatic license for certain story points. I can 
look the other way when the Lugosi character is shown improbably done up in 
white tie and tails to sit in front of a TV set watching himself in one of his 
old movies ("White Zombie") with those little dogs. It's harder to ignore the 
gross words my father, a warm but dignified man, would never say -- such as 
certain references to Vampira's anatomy or his scatological remarks regarding 
Boris Karloff. The so-called animosity between my father and Karloff existed in 
the publicity mills, anyway -- not in real life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Lugosi Jr. got to a more significant point: "I cannot ignore the film's 
misconstruction of my father's drug rehabilitation. The truth, in this case, is 
actually more dramatic than fiction, but it doesn't star Ed Wood. My dad, who 
had a medically induced addiction to morphine, turned himself in -- with no Mr. 
Wood accompanying him, contrary to what the film shows -- to Metropolitan State 
Hospital in Norwalk. The film suggests Wood takes him home after a doctor 
discovers that he has no money." A scene in which Wood tells Lugosi that he's 
fine and can go home while Lugosi protests that he doesn't feel fine gives the 
impression that Lugosi left professional care before he was completely cured. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father's willingness to swallow the pride of a once-famous film star and 
expose himself to the indignities and often horrific conditions of a facility 
for indigents -- and stick it out until he was, indeed, clean -- is testament 
to his courage. When he was released he was optimistic because he had completed 
something that took enormous character. I don't want him to be robbed of that 
accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 My own father, Jimmy Mitchell, knew Lugosi during the years covered in the 
film and, while it is true that Lugosi was greatly depressed about his career, 
he was not the lonely, pathetic, isolated man of "Ed Wood" in which Edward D. 
Wood Jr. seemed to be his only human contact. "My dad was living with my mother 
and me during the making of the first two of the Ed Wood movies," Lugosi Jr. 
said. "And after my parents divorced, I visited him regularly. My father was a 
well-read, forward-thinking man who had friends -- many within the Hungarian 
community -- and a new wife with whom he was living at the time of his death." 
</P>
<P>
 Lugosi desperately wanted and needed the dignity of work. And, yes, it was 
Wood who, albeit for his own exploitative purposes, gave Lugosi the chance to 
wake up in the morning knowing he had a job that day with someone who admired 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am saddened that a new generation of moviegoers will be exposed to an 
inaccurate picture of my father that shows him in a false and denigrating 
light," said Lugosi Jr., an attorney in Los Angeles. He is also "puzzled that 
no one among the people responsible for shaping the Lugosi role ever came to me 
for help with research. In addition to my firsthand recollections of my father 
and Ed Wood, I have an extensive information bank of material -- such as Ed 
Wood's original, handwritten account of his relationship with my father and the 
making of the films, as well as tapes of Wood's comments in his own voice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And if they used Robert Cremer's 1976 biography, "Lugosi: The Man Behind the 
Cape," which Lugosi Jr. believes accurately covers the Ed Wood period, he feels 
there is scant evidence of it. "It is interesting that in the hundreds of 
interviews Cremer conducted with people who knew and worked with my dad, there 
was no reporting of his using the type of language put in his mouth in 'Ed 
Wood,' " Lugosi Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad left a wonderful legacy as an actor, father and friend. He deserves 
better than to have the most difficult part of his life resurrected only to be 
distorted."

COUNTERPUNCH: BIG AMEN FOR RHYTHMIC, RIVETING AND SEXY 'JASON'S LYRIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMAA FANAKA, Jamaa Fanaka is founder of the Directors Guild of America's 
African American Steering Committee. He is an independent 
writer-producer-director whose films include the Penitentiary trilogy. He lives 
in Inglewood. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I read Peter Rainer's tepid review of Doug McHenry's "Jason's Lyric" 
("Ambitious 'Jason's Lyric' Falls Short of Redemption," Calendar, Sept. 28).  
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the high regard in which I hold Rainer's cinematic opinions, I 
went alone to a Hollywood theater to check things out for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 All I can say is that Rainer must have seen a completely different print of 
"Jason's Lyric" than the one I viewed with a packed and enthusiastic weekend 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Rainer, I found the film to be fascinating, funny, rhythmic, riveting, 
tragic and very, very sexy. Indeed, in my informed opinion, the supremely 
talented Jada Pinkett as Lyric emerges as the quintessential female sex symbol 
of the 21st Century. (Pinkett's arrival may be six years early, but, with her 
assets, who's counting?) The lady's got sex appeal to burn and the males in the 
theater gladly inhaled the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 But no male chauvinistic pig is director McHenry. His excellent camera angles 
provide the very talented Allen Payne, who plays Jason, with a highly sexed 
ambience in which to perform. And perform Payne does, drawing impassioned 
shouts of "Amen!" from women in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's Lyric" is not a perfect film. But I can count the number of "perfect" 
films on one hand and never use my thumb. "Jason's Lyric" does, however, have a 
number of perfect parts. Jason and Lyric's set piece lovemaking scene in the 
woods ranks right up there with the bathtub scene between Ron O'Neal and Sheila 
Frazier in Gordon Parks Jr.'s "SuperFly" as one of the sexiest scenes ever 
committed to celluloid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainer opines that the romantic sex scenes in "Jason's Lyric" were "inserted 
to boost the film's commercial temperature." I think not. But, let's face it, 
any Hollywood filmmaker who does not consider box-office potential when making 
a film is at best a fool and almost certainly a failure. Is anyone naive enough 
to think that the makers of "Jurassic Park," for example, didn't have 
bottom-line considerations in mind when they chose the violent and carnivorous 
Tyrannosaurus rex as their monster-villain, instead of a more docile and 
herbivorous variety of dinosaur? Money talks. But in Hollywood, it screams!  
</P>
<P>
 We African Americans especially crave love stories like that of Jason and 
Lyric who are both pure of heart and completely committed to one another. And 
have sexual appetites! Indeed, what is romantic love without sexual spices? 
Blacks have too often been cinematically castrated ever since Edison invented 
the Kinetoscope. "Jason's Lyric" helps provide us with a sort of cinematic 
"sexual healing." 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the year AS 1994 (After Spike) and it falls to us African American 
filmmakers to help define our own unique existences. In "Jason's Lyric," 
director McHenry and writer Bobby Smith Jr. have taken us one step closer to 
the intellectual realization of our cultural Promised Land. Jason and Lyric 
represent the romantic ideal to which we all aspire. When they win, we all win! 
And, make no mistake about it, vicarious winning, sexual or otherwise, is one 
of the more exquisite rewards of good cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's Lyric" should also be credited with a couple of superb acting talent 
discoveries in Naughty by Nature's Treach and his screen girlfriend, Lisa 
Carson, who both turn in excellent performances. And comic Eddie Griffin 
upstages anyone within range. All three deserve shots at leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The buzz is that Jackson/McHenry, the producers of "Jason's Lyric," have made 
Hollywood history by becoming the first African Americans with the power to 
greenlight mainstream films. Let the African American film community say, 
"Amen!"

<P>
 Canada's original riot grrrls Fifth Column played raw pop-punk Saturday at 
Jabberjaw minus the bratty insolence that drives many of the feminist genre's 
newer pigtail-wearing bands.  
</P>
<P>
 The indie trio instead played with a subtle and earnest confidence.Though 
bumpier and rawer live than on album, the amateur-sounding set worked in the 
tiny club, and it was clear that great songs bubbled just underneath the 
buzzing ampage and shoddy sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Caroline Azar, dressed in a tattered gingham dress and striped tights, sang in 
alternately stealthy and dramatic, vibrating tones. In more intense moments, 
passionate growls pierced her cool exterior and hit the attentive audience full 
force. She echoed the inane lines every women has heard ("C'mon smile, it can't 
be all that bad") with a sarcastic and dangerous edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which included two supplemental members, squeezed onto the tiny 
stage, frequently blocking one another from the audience's view, but still 
managed to jump successfully between punk rampages, garage-y pop tunes and 
dark, disturbing slow numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 Though rough and choppy, Fifth Column got its message across without copping 
faux attitude and did it inside of strong songs -- proving itself a rare and 
effective force. LORRAINE ALI

 You can tell a lot about a band from its encores, and it was rarely so true as

ended the evening with two impressive, complex jazz numbers, Thelonious Monk's 
"Well You Needn't" and Miles Davis' "Freedom Jazz Dance." Second-billed trio 
Consolidated ended its set by handing the microphone over to audience members 
who spouted off about vegetarianism and intolerance.

<P>
 In both cases these encores were distillations of the groups' own main sets. 
While hip-hop-jazz fusion projects are becoming increasingly common, the 
Dallas-based Jesus (real name: Mark Griffin) gives his an intriguing twist by 
drawing on such earlier fusions as Davis' pioneering "Bitches Brew." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin's own droll, stream-of-consciousness beat prose replaced Davis' 
trumpet, floating atop undulating vamps built on Dave Palmer's electric piano 
and Chris McGuire's sax excursions. With Griffin's contemporary lyrical twists 
and DJ Zero's dexterous turntable artistry bringing things up to date, it was 
an odd, hypnotic time warp of elements, quite unlike anything else on the pop 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 No such subtleties to Consolidated's rap-rock: The Bay Area group devotes 
itself to anti-meat, anti-war, anti-macho, whatever-it-is-they're-against-it 
messages. But their arguments and music were forceful enough Saturday to carry 
the diatribes, and you gotta admire their conviction. Like the boy in Gunter 
Grass' "The Tin Drum" -- a clip from the movie was part of a video shown on 
stage -- Consolidated seems intent on hammering away until it all stops. STEVE

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MEXICAN POP STAR'S SHOW IS POWER-DRIVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Was this really a bad night for Juan Gabriel? It depends of how you look at 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a mild but constant hoarseness, the 44-year-old Mexican superstar 
singer-songwriter-producer took care of business with heart and charisma 
Friday, in the first of three shows at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Presenting "Gracias por Esperar," his first studio album in seven years after 
legal battles with his record label, Juan Gabriel struggled for the first three 
songs until he just concentrated on feeling and fun instead of technique. He 
then delivered a stunning three-hour concert that had it all -- a nine-piece 
choir with the power and presence of a gospel troupe, a 20-piece orchestra, 
three cameras floating on booms, two giant screens and medleys of romantic, 
cumbia , bolero and mariachi tunes mixed with selected classics and new songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its length, the well-produced show was a greatly entertaining 
presentation that confirmed that Juan Gabriel, if not a great singer, is a 
versatile, gifted melody-maker with a special ability to add twists and turns 
to a seemingly simple pop song. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during his hilariously showstopping mariachi set -- where he made 
fun of the Mexican macho myth and sang of heroes wearing tennis shoes instead 
of boots -- he had the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan playing while the 
orchestra's electric bass, guitar and drums gradually came in with a sustained 
pop groove that, imperceptibly, transformed a full-fledged mariachi sound into 
a pleasant pop fusion. In someone else's hands, that might have ended in an 
insufferable concoction. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the fever pitch decreased when Juan Gabriel introduced singer 
Lorenzo Antonio, an average performer whose energy was not enough to justify a 
pointless four-song set, and another guest singer, Stephanie (a former backup 
singer for Julio Iglesias), whose two-song set seemed out of context despite 
her vocal capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Gabriel, more commercial-minded than other serious Latin hit writers, is 
nevertheless talented enough to sell tens of millions of records without cheap 
pandering. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new recording contract, this was a test for the "second coming" of Juan 
Gabriel, despite the fact that he has remained popular without releasing new 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 His show Friday raised questions about his voice, but left no doubt as to the 
power of the rest of his arsenal, which seemed intact and more than enough to 
keep the fans on their feet for most of the night.

MUSIC REVIEWS; KIPNIS FOCUSES ON 20TH-CENTURY GEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harpsichordist Igor Kipnis made music of the 20th Century the unlikely focus 
of his Friday night recital, part of the Los Angeles Bach Festival at First 
Congregational Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the newer works were all short and obscure, this was no mere tokenism 
on Kipnis' part.The products of some detective work by the 64-year-old 
musician, they became the center of his program, enlivened by his spoken 
introductions and keen performances, and sandwiched in between music of Handel, 
Bach and Scarlatti. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1921 "Suite de Clavecin" by the Dutch composer Alexander Nicolas Voormolen 
proved a well-wrought piece of Impressionism, elegant, nostalgic and anchored 
by the brilliant blur of its Toccatina finale. The 14-year-old 
Castelnuovo-Tedesco's English Suite -- written in 1909 -- starts with a 
quotation from Arne, wanders through a chromatic fantasy and ends with a 
devilish gigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Schnittke's 1990 "Drei Fragmente" are just that: the spare twangings of 
a broken music box; a section from the middle of a lost allegro; the 
inconsequential musings of an unfinished Lento -- eerie and evocative. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipnis began with the Suite No. 4 in D minor by Handel, continued with four 
preludes and fugues from Book I of "The Well-Tempered Clavier" and closed with 
seven Scarlatti sonatas, all played knowingly and intently, with an astute ear 
for the cut and scope of their rhetoric. TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; PIANIST ASSISTS L.A. MOZART ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning her third season as music director of the Los Angeles Mozart 
Orchestra, Lucinda Carver led a bracing, largely pleasing Mozart/Beethoven 
program in Wilshire-Ebell Theatre, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In this, the conductor was aided by veteran American pianist Seymour Lipkin, 
returning to this city after a long absence, in Beethoven's G-major Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 Important pianists have become a signature of LAMO programming, and Lipkin's 
splendid performance honored that tradition. If he did not plumb all the depths 
of this masterpiece, he seriously indicated their existence in a long-breathed 
reading. And he sailed past all the technical shoals that bedevil even the most 
experienced Beethovenians in this supreme pianistic challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old musician had helpful partners in his performance; Carver and 
her 38-member band showed stylishness and confidence throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 On their own, in Mozart's "Lucio Silla" Overture and Beethoven's Fourth 
Symphony, the orchestra proved again inconsistent, an ensemble apparently 
without a "peggable" musical identity, one that, though often note-clean to a 
fault, still manages to produce sounds without tonal allure or emotional 
resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it the room in which they play? Are their lacks traceable to the podium? Or 
is this orchestra simply the victim of its own, short annual playing-schedule? 
If we knew, we would tell. DANIEL CARIAGA

MUSIC REVIEWS; GLENDALE SYMPHONY OPENS 71ST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale Symphony makes more sense in Glendale. Long a fixture at the Los 
Angeles Music Center, downtown, the orchestra there seemed like a suburban 
cousin putting on city airs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at the beginning of its 71st season, the orchestra has moved back home, 
right into Glendale's city center and the refurbished Alex Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra, under music director Lalo Schifrin, sounded better rehearsed 
than it often has with this conductor. The Alex Theatre, too, with the addition 
of a sound-shell onstage, surpassed its recent reputation. Heard from the front 
balcony, the orchestra had an appealing brightness and clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Schifrin took a back seat on this occasion, with three 
soloists on the bill. But he did get off a spirited, tidy, well-judged account 
of Stravinsky's "Pulcinella" Suite to start things off. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the locally trained, 12-year-old pianist Jun Asai gave an assured 
performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, flying through the 
passage-work with ease, pointedly forceful when she needed to be, leaning into 
and shading phrases musically. In encore, she ripped through Liszt's "Forest 
Murmurs" and the finale of Prokofiev's Second Sonata. The kid has chops. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, harpist Marcia Dickstein and flutist Sheridon Stokes partnered in 
Mozart's concerto for those instruments, offering technically solid playing, 
Dickstein the sensitive, engaging poet to Stokes' blunt journeyman. In both 
concertos, Schifrin and ensemble proved alert and robust.TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; BARTOK IS REBORN IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good musical news befell Long Beach on Saturday night. The Long Beach 
Symphony, under conductor JoAnn Falletta's strong hands, tends to deliver on 
high expectations these days, and the latest showing at the Terrace Theater was 
no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Between familiar doses of Ravel and Brahms was the program's intriguing 
centerpiece, the U.S. premiere of a revised version of Bartok's Viola Concerto. 
Soloist-revisionist Paul Neubauer's intent was to restore the score, left 
unfinished upon the composer's death in 1945, to a more authentic state. 
</P>
<P>
 In performance, Neubauer niftily mined the riches of Bartok's work, perched 
alluringly between romantic expressivity and cool mid-century objectivity. 
Apart from the potent -- and often poignant -- solo part, the orchestra's role 
did still seem sketchy, less unified or propulsive than it might have been had 
the composer finished his task. But it remains a glowing piece, especially as a 
bold vehicle for an unjustly neglected instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from the lean to the lush, the second half belonged to Brahms' 
generally feel-good Second Symphony, on which Falletta flexed a broad 
expressive hand. Big, swelling sonorities were drawn, without sacrifice of 
clarity, as the orchestra writhed its way to the almost boisterous finale, by 
Brahmsian standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Falletta's treatment of Ravel's "La Valse" accented inherent dreaminess, 
melted edges instead of satirical urbanity. The orchestra effectively captured 
the work's elusive elfin spirit, with its delicious brand of waltz-driven 
madness.JOSEF WOODARD

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; 'GUMP' A LOOK AT DECENCY, NOT CYNICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was appalled by William Relling Jr.'s cynical comments about "Forrest Gump" 
("It's Time to Dump the 'Gump,' " Oct. 17). To me, the central message of the 
movie is that no matter your IQ, you can still be a decent, caring, loving and 
committed person.These are noble qualities we find so sorely lacking in today's 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is based on my perception of the movie that I do not find myself 
superior, intellectually or otherwise, to Forrest Gump. If anything, I feel 
inferior because I know that, as most people, I have not been able to attain 
the exceptional level of decency that this character personifies. 
</P>
<P>
 Relling and those who share his view of "Forrest Gump" are not wrong in their 
assessment. What consummate cynic, of whom there are far too many in 
"Hollywood," would think they are wrong?

 Gump's success in various fields does not result merely from fate, although 
that is a part of it, just as in real life. There is also hard work involved, 
and natural talent and practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason this movie has struck a chord in audiences is that it shows us a 
human being who succeeds at the greatest task we all face: retaining humanity. 
Life throws a lot of things at us, obstacles and opportunities alike. Would 
that we all could handle them as well as Forrest Gump.

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; FEMALE ROLE MODELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I share many of the frustrations expressed by Kerry Madden-Lunsford ("Guts and 
Glory: When Do Women Get Their Share?," Oct. 3). However I take exception to 
her argument that "films should show our kids that . . . girls can be heroes 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Implicit in this tautology is the notion that it is the responsibility of 
Hollywood filmmakers to be the moral educators of our children. It is not, nor 
should it be, incumbent upon the entertainment industry to provide for our 
children more positive female role models; rather, it is our absolute, 
non-delegable duty as parents to show our kids that women are not the passive 
and dependent objects of desire that popular culture so frequently portrays 
them to be. 
</P>
<P>
 If we truly want to expose our children to more positive female images, then 
perhaps the next time they want to see a movie we will invite them instead to 
the local library. Once there, we can expunge the image of the "hot, slinky, 
please-save-me 'smoking babes' " and introduce our kids to the works of Jane 
Austen and Virginia Woolf, or Simone de Beauvoir and Betty Friedan. Certainly 
these were not women who were passive and disempowered; indeed, their words 
quite literally changed the world. What a powerful lesson to teach our 
children, both sons and daughters alike! 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps we might offer to take them to one of Los Angeles' many 
extraordinary museums. We could stroll with them through centuries of artistic 
creation at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, for instance.  
</P>
<P>
 If the kids want a little more action, then we could always take them to a 
women's sporting event. UCLA, USC and Pepperdine all have great women's 
intercollegiate athletic programs, and all have phenomenal women athletes.

TV REVIEW; 'MOTHER' RE-CREATES GOLDEN AGE TV DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new version of Paddy Chayefsky's 1954 teleplay "The Mother" reintroduces not 
only a pioneer of quality television writing but re-creates the very tone and 
style of intimate Golden Age TV drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Starring Anne Bancroft as a newly widowed, 66-year-old mother struggling to 
find dignity and self-worth in a chilly world and Joan Cusack as her meddlesome 
daughter, the production is a compelling example of vintage Chayefsky 
dramatizing ordinary people in unadorned terms. 
</P>
<P>
 A BBC production, shot in New York's Astoria Studios for public TV's "Great 
Performances," the story's revival accompanies a surge of interest in 
Chayefsky, including his "Collected Works" (published this month) and the first 
Chayefsky biography, Shaun Considine's "Mad as Hell" (published last August). 
</P>
<P>
 The teleplay's remake, still set in 1954 Gotham, is an ensemble achievement, 
featuring an understated performance from Adrian Pasdar as Bancroft's 
son-in-law and a crusty turn by Stephen Lang as her bedeviled seamstress boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Curtis' direction delicately mirrors a frightened, aging woman's burning 
will to be independent. A shattering, four-minute scene with Bancroft on the 
phone talking to her daughters is a riveting, heroic moment. And when Bancroft, 
fighting the slippage of time, cries out to to her family, "Is this what it all 
comes to -- an old woman parceling out the old furniture in her house?," it's 
classic Chayefsky. 
</P>
<P>
 It's refreshing to look again at one of his simple, realistic teleplays (in 
the grain of "Marty" and "The Bachelor Party") and be reminded of television's 
other world.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; BURNETT TAKES A STROLL DOWN MEMORY LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Didn't she used to be Carol Burnett? 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's "Men, Movies & Carol" is for determined Burnett fans who will like 
anything she does. Watching this hour special, whiffing its strong essence of 
nostalgia, makes you feel as if you're on some kind of archeological dig, 
unearthing bones from the Mesozoic age. 
</P>
<P>
 The antiquity is not Burnett or her guests: Scott Bakula, Barry Bostwick, 
Michael Jeter and Tony Bennett, the latter not only much admired by the older 
crowd but also enjoying an amazing renaissance among the young. Rather, it's 
the style of sketch comedy that echoes earlier times, a smattering of 
low-burlesque movie spoofs -- from "Double Indemnity" to "The Graduate" -- that 
could have been plucked directly from Burnett's series that ran on CBS from 
1967 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that they're not funny. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, no one was better than Burnett and her main sidekicks, Harvey 
Korman, Tim Conway and Vicki Lawrence, at performing amusingly written, 
pleasingly over-the-top takeoffs that turned movies inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett can still give her voice that trademark wobble and be as goofy as 
anyone in an oversized wig. At its very best, however, her latest satire is 
mediocre, with most of it failing to make any impression at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercifully, Bennett is there only to sing, doing a medley with Burnett that 
provides a welcome break from the rest of the hour, the best of which is a 
quasi-straight production number emulating the MGM musicals celebrated in 
"That's Entertainment (1, 2 and 3)." Bakula, Bostwick and Jeter as Maurice 
Chevaliers? Better to rent the movies.

 MS. INTEGRITY: It was June 23, 1993, and Deborah Norville was a correspondent 
on CBS' "Street Stories" when she used an appearance on NBC's "Tonight Show" to 
aim a blistering attack on tabloid magazine shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the networks, we have standards that we try to adhere to," Norville said 
during that conversation with host Jay Leno, which was printed last week in the 
New York Daily News. "And I think 98% of what you get is the truth on our 
shows. You can't say that about the tabloids." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, with OJitus sweeping the media these days, you can't say it about 
network magazine programs either. In any case, Norville related to Leno her 
awful experience interviewing a 10-year-old stalking victim and her family in 
Montana right after they had spoken to a tabloid show (which the Daily News 
identified as the syndicated "Inside Edition"). 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I came in, this kid was so battered that she had taken all the 
animals, all of her dolls and had her mother lock them in the basement because 
they reminded her of this horrible tabloid reporter," said Norville, adding 
that the child's waitress mother was paid $1,500 by the tabloid to make her 
daughter available to its reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what these shows ought to be about," said Norville, resolutely. 
"That's just not what I, as a journalist, am going to do, and I don't think 
that's what we as reporters ought to be doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference 16 months make. Last Thursday, the syndicated "Inside 
Edition" announced a successor to departing anchor Bill O'Reilly. A familiar 
name? Yes.

 DEADLY DAYTIME: Jane Whitney's low-brow, low-rated talk show is gone, replaced 
by "The Other Side," whose topics, NBC says, are "incredibly relevant to 
today's daytime audience." On last Monday's premiere, a man conversed with the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that "The Other Side" is a talk show that's on the level, its host is 
Will Miller. Not just any old host, Miller is a psychotherapist, ordained 
minister and stand-up comic. He sounds like his own sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 His opening act, a fast-talking medium named James Van Praagh, shared the 
stage with the parents of David, who had died when he was 20. The parents 
poured out facts about their son that they said Van Praagh could not have 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh listened as David communicated with him. "He's got your son with 
him," Van Praagh said to the father of another deceased person, Josh, who died 
at age 8. Josh's father proposed a test. If Van Praagh was legit, he'd be able 
to learn from Josh the private nickname the father had given his son. 
</P>
<P>
 The medium accepted the challenge. It was a stream-of-consciousness chat. 
"Joshie, what did Dad call you? It's hard to get stuff like this, but I'll try. 
C'mon. C'mon. Doctor! 'Daddy called me doctor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh also shared his belief that whatever ails us in life gets repaired 
in the afterlife. "Even if you don't have a leg," he promised, "you will get 
that back." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day found "The Other Side" welcoming healers, one of them Gene 
Egidio, who said he didn't learn of his "gift" until age 50, when a woman he 
didn't know knocked on his door and said, "I have herpes." Instead of slamming 
the door, he healed her. He ticked off his other feats, including healing the 
hand of a man who had nearly severed his thumb in an accident with a knife. 
Egidio said that when he clasped the thumb and the rest of the hand, they 
fused, leaving only a red ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Egidio also said that he died of appendicitis when he was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Other Side" is tailor-made for ridicule. Yet compared to Jane Whitney's 
circus, this is the Smithsonian. Miller turns out be a competent interviewer 
and a pretty fair devil's advocate. And most of his subjects, the ones claiming 
to have been touched by bizarre happenings, appear credible. These are not 
toothless hillbillies in bolo ties, but mostly articulate, solid-citizen types. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Friday's show, during which a woman insisted she was visited two weeks 
ago by her long-dead stepfather. All right, you rolled your eyes. Yet on the 
same show was a couple who came across as persuasively sane and earnest while 
claiming that the spirit of their daughter -- who died of breast cancer when 
she was 32 -- was playing mischievous tricks around the house. As evidence, 
they cited the track lighting that clicked on independently and wouldn't go 
off, and the TV remote that inexplicably disappeared, then reappeared on the 
couch "right under our noses." 
</P>
<P>
 Are they hallucinating? Is everyone here hallucinating? Who's to know? If Van 
Praagh can really schmooze with the dead, however, why doesn't he get in touch 
with murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman and ask them 
who did it? 
</P>

RESTAURANTS; MAKING SOME NOISE AT MELROSE'S CREEQUE ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even when it's not packed five people deep at the bar, Creeque Alley is loud. 
The awning says bar and grill, but the menu says "bar & ball": Even on a 
quieter weeknight, multiple video monitors are apt to be broadcasting two or 
more ballgames, each with the volume cranked. Other times, there are muted 
prerecorded basketball games or Bill Cosby shows with Kool and the Gang, 
Prince, Marvin Gaye or Stevie Wonder blasting from speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Creeque Alley is also dark, although there's just enough light to see the 
place is pretty great looking: If you didn't know you were on Melrose Avenue, 
just a few paces west from its sister establishment, Georgia, you might think 
you'd found a primo back-alley haunt under huge shade trees not far from the 
town creek. The ceiling is all beams and lath, like a shade arbor or walls 
waiting for plaster. Windows and the bar are snugly shuttered. What light there 
is comes through slim gashes in clever sheet-iron wall sconces. There are also 
candles in quaintly hewn tin-can lanterns: If you hold them right, you can read 
your menu line-by-line with a beam of light rivaling the intensity of a 
near-dead flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the light of day, the menu, a single stiff laminated sheet, shows a 
dreadlocked, grinning figure playing football, hockey, soccer, basketball, 
records and the electric guitar. There is a handful each of appetizers, 
entrees, sandwiches and eight specialty drinks such as Jamaicanmecrazy (two 
kinds of rum, two kinds of liqueur, fresh juices, crushed ice), and the $15 Be 
Scatter and Vanish (light and dark rums, vodka, gin, tequila, triple sec and 
fruit juice served with flaming "151 rum" over ice).  
</P>
<P>
 With or without alcohol, the media bombardment and darkness challenge one not 
to be scattered and vanish. The food is what keeps us in our booth: Each dish 
seems better than the last. Fried calamari might not be the crunchiest, but 
it's well-seasoned, chewy, addictive. Beer-battered shrimp are crisper and even 
more flavorful, although the fruit-spiked tartar sauce tastes oddly like 
strawberry ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaican patties, plump, golden turnovers, come with one of two fillings: a 
hot, sweet, powerfully smoky bean, or a curried, rich, volatile beef. Both are 
so good, you'll keep eating them and trying to staunch the chile heat with 
anything on the table -- although if you reach for the heady house-made ginger 
beer, you're truly fighting fire with fire. Don't turn to that scoop of 
cucumber relish, either -- it's hotter than the patties! 
</P>
<P>
 Crab cake salad, with two of the teeniest crab cakes ever, is the least 
interesting item we try. Dumplings in a rich, peppery chicken dumpling soup, 
however, are dreamy: torpedo-shaped paragons of pleasurable gumminess, they 
taste like the thickest possible egg noodle. And the only reason not to order 
jerk chicken wings is that you might want the entree-portion instead. On the 
other hand, these wings, which are marinated in jerk spices and served 
unsauced, are subtly, increasingly hot, with a compelling scorch and stickiness 
-- in other words, the perfect drinking food.  
</P>
<P>
 Jerk spices also add punch to the house-ground "back alley" burger, which 
comes with excellent thin, crispy french fries. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two good stewed chicken entrees, both cooked until the meat melts 
right off the bone: the Port-A-Prince, a light-handed, not very exciting curry, 
and the richer, sweeter brown-stewed chicken Negril. These and all entrees come 
with rice, dull fried plantains and buttery chayote squash. Don't miss the 
smothered pork chops: Who remembered that long-cooked meat, rice and gravy 
could be so wonderful? 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to these rich, gravied dishes, there's a mammoth slab of 
grilled-rare ahi tuna with a refreshing red pepper and onion sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 As for dessert, Creeque Alley has but one -- allegedly. Our waitress assured 
us the warm chocolate cake is moist, rich, divine, but the kitchen is 
invariably out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is friendly, but often lax. With good night vision, you'll spy a tiny 
note on the menu that says a 15% gratuity is automatically added to the bill, 
but this is confusing: Some waiters do add the tip, some don't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Creeque Alley, 7302 Melrose Ave., Hollywood, (213) 937-1416. Open seven 
nights for dinner, Sunday for brunch. Full bar. Visa, MasterCard and American 
Express accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $28 - $48.

POP BEAT; EXPLOSION GIVES BLUES A TUMULTUOUS TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion played a show in Minnesota recently, the 
trio was confronted by an irate audience member. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ranting. 'You're not a blues band. I've been playing blues for 20 
years, and you're definitely not a blues band!' " recalls Jon Spencer, the 
trio's 29-year-old leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The incensed club-goer was sort of right. The Blues Explosion doesn't hail 
from the Mississippi Delta or the smoky dives of Chicago. It emerged from New 
York's East Village, where noise bands and art schools are far more prevalent 
than hound dogs and rotting porches.  
</P>
<P>
 And the Blues Explosion doesn't play down-and-out blues in the tradition of 
Robert Johnson or Muddy Waters. Instead, singer-guitarist Spencer, guitarist 
Judah Bauer and drummer Russell Simins (no bassist required) play a raw and 
tumultuous twist on the style. 
</P>
<P>
 It's such a musical mutation that Spencer doesn't even call it blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name of the band is ridiculous," says the New Hampshire native and former 
Brown University student. "We're not trying to pass ourselves off as a blues 
outfit. What the blues means to me is honest and direct music. It's also very 
simple. In that sense, then we're a blues band. But I would just say we're 
indie rock. That's where we came out of. That's our audience: punk rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Blues elements, from intermittent howls to sleepy grooves, do rear their heads 
in the flailing mix, but it's blended with '70s funk and sleazy, discordant 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
 It might aggravate blues purists, but the band, whose third album, "Orange," 
was released this month on Matador Records, has received plenty of positive 
reaction: intellectualized by critics, worshiped by trust-fund bohemians, just 
plain respected by underground rock fans nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of that audience may have crossed over from Spencer's previous 
affiliations with abrasive noise bands. He founded Washington's ear-bending 
Pussy Galore, which avoided melody like the plague, and New York's Boss Hogg, 
which turned Rolling Stones tunes into smoking piles of sonic rubble.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's some stuff that runs through both Pussy Galore and Blues 
Explosion," says Spencer, who brings his band to the Palace on Wednesday. "But 
with Pussy Galore, it was more about attitude. The Blues Explosion is more of a 
natural band, the songs just sort of come out of us playing."  
</P>
<P>
 The Blues Explosion started in 1991, four years after Spencer moved to New 
York from D.C. "I wanted to be in a more exciting place. I was into what was 
going on in New York and the East Village, what came after 'no wave' like the 
Swans, Sonic Youth, Lydia Lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer combined those influences with his more recent fascination with old 
bluesmen such as Hound Dog Taylor and came up with the Blues Explosion's sound. 
This rootsy tilt from the master of musical pileups initially alienated noise 
audiences, who were used to pure dissonance and clamor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year we played around New York, it was really out there and 
strange," recalls Spencer. "The audience just didn't know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 People eventually caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer is entirely aware of the band's hip value and the questions that it 
generates -- mainly, can a Village boho really sing the blues?  
</P>
<P>
 "People say it can't be blues if it's not played by a depressed black person 
-- and I mean depressed in the sense of economically," says Spencer. "I think 
music is music, it can happen anywhere."

ART REVIEWS; FINLEY'S LOW-TECH, HIGH-TOUCH 'CONTROL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Finley's wall-mounted sculptures consist of an eccentric inventory of 
plastic containers packed inside each other like those hollow Russian dolls 
that open -- again and again and again -- to reveal an identical, slightly 
smaller doll nestled inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than suggesting infinite regression (and mirroring the Kafka-esque 
experience of living in a bureaucratic state), Finley's art celebrates 
unpredictability. Titled "Cruise Control," his quirky exhibition at the newly 
opened Acme Gallery offers a hands-on demonstration of spontaneity's place in 
an increasingly regimented world. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Finley's works have the presence of gerrymandered computer 
technology. About the size of desk-top hard-drives and monitors, each of his 
piecemeal units seems to have been rigged to perform a specific, if unknown, 
function. All five cubical structures present elaborate variations on the 
molded, synthetic skins that ordinarily protect the chips, circuits and 
software enclosed within. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike computers, however, whose programs are engaged only through keyboards 
and screens, Finley's user-friendly sculptures invite viewers to disassemble 
their loosely conjoined components. Once you begin unpacking, unwrapping and 
unfolding, a seemingly infinite array of interactive possibilities opens up. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the removable face of "Wet and Reckless" is a plastic car caddie 
whose compartments for drinks, coins, pencils and cassettes have been filled 
with cut-up place mats and bits of synthetic rubber that are themselves 
removable and rearrangeable. Before you lift off this part of Finley's 
interlocking sculpture, you must set aside a yellow plastic dish that was 
designed to hold a single cob of corn but is currently filled with kitty litter 
and whittled stubs of pencils. 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath is a Ziploc sandwich bag containing ties for garbage bags and 
fragmented images snipped from magazines. Under that is a plastic storage bin 
stuffed with scraps of perforated plastic, foam and rubber that dangle from the 
wall like synthetic intestines. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pieces, like "World's Greatest" and "Closer Than They Appear," are 
chock-full of hidden surprises, including life-size plastic squirrels, tiny 
giraffes, ducks, inflatable owls, six-pack rings and photographs of kids in a 
tree-house. No object's position is permanently fixed, and your memory is 
tested when you try to return the pieces to their original configuration. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley's compact sculptures deliciously confuse the 3-D space of tactility 
with the untouchable space of computer technology. More importantly, they 
conflate both of these realms with the invisible space of the human 
imagination. Finley's loaded, low-tech instruments take place at the 
intersection between cyber space and old-fashioned American ingenuity, where 
adaptation, flexibility and trying things out for yourself count above 
everything else.

 Old Mold: Soap scum and Wonder Bread are the main ingredients of Yolande 
McKay's predominantly monochromatic sculptures. Titled "Family Crust," her 
amusing exhibition at Ovsey Gallery pits symbols of aristocratic identity 
against slices of bland, mass-produced bread. The artist's earnest works also 
play architectural ornamentation against congealed wads of bathtub residue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than bringing art down to earth to infuse it with vitality, McKay's 
resin-coated pieces of moldy, rotten bread contend that attempts to make 
beautiful objects are based in the misguided desire to deny organic life's 
messy underside. Her fiberglass-reinforced swirls of soap scum, formed into 
frothy patterns of wainscoting and wall-molding, imply that high art is little 
more than a manipulative attempt to wash away real life's lowly dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay's conceptual decorations are meant to undercut the ideal of aesthetic 
purity first put forth in the 19th-Century and promulgated by a small band of 
formalists in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the debate over the viability of art-for-art's-sake has not 
been articulated in terms of purity for more than two decades. Even though 
McKay's attack on this outdated position is accurate, the staleness of the 
argument dulls the critical edge of her sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 They try to resuscitate an anachronistic viewpoint only to make fun of its 
limits. Today, that is more manipulative than trying to make an object of 
beauty.

 Sweetly Sinister: Adam Ross' new oil, alkyd and acrylic paintings on wood, 
iron and porcelain put a palette of delicate pastels to such perverse use that 
these ordinarily saccharine-sweet colors look sinister. At Sue Spaid Fine Art, 
14 small abstractions pack the same sort of punch possessed by cotton candy 
laced with strychnine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross still builds his images by pouring dozens of layers of noxious, 
industrial-strength paint over variously shaped panels and then violently 
sanding their surfaces down, like a mad archeologist more enthralled with the 
incessant whirl of his power tool than anything he might discover in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Intensifying the destructive side of his creative project, the artist also 
employs a router to carve spiraling incisions into his most recent paintings. 
Their surfaces no longer have the glassy, super-smooth feel of TV screens but 
are sometimes punctured by holes, interrupted by indentations and marred by 
tiny gullies. These textures give Ross' fluid images the presence of contour 
maps that seem to have been transmitted from outer space by some 
high-resolution, heat-sensitive device. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the matte finishes and pastel tones of Ross' poisonously beautiful 
paintings downplay their high-tech, sci-fi edge, and catapult them into a 
strange realm of their own, where metaphors mix promiscuously and unanticipated 
hybrids take shape.

 Feminine Forms: Sally Elesby's shamelessly decorative sculptures at Food House 
look like a group of floozies ready to go out on the town in search of fun -- 
or trouble, if it happens to come their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Made from sheer swathes of lavish fabrics stretched taut and suggestively 
bundled over wire ribs protruding from the wall, the L.A.-based artist's 
abstract sculptures initially appear to address currently fashionable ideas 
about social mores and feminine identity. Adorned with fake flowers, feathers, 
jewels, sequins, beads, lace, ribbons and glitter, her insistently frilly works 
do indeed seem to take an active stance in the charged debate over the body, 
sexuality and artifice. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Elesby's second solo show, titled "Incidental Form," forgoes this 
sort of direct political posturing, instead exploring such formalist issues as 
the relationship between surface and volume, excess and necessity, presence and 
absence, as well as positive and negative space. 
</P>
<P>
 Her superficially feminine pieces are most effective when they almost vanish, 
appearing to be less substantial than their shadows. Elesby's art brings 
obliqueness and indirection back into the picture, suggesting that discretion 
is sometimes more persuasive than a straightforward assault, and that a whisper 
sometimes speaks more powerfully than a shout.

KIDNAPERS INVADE SAUDI HOME, KILL 3 HOSTAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saudi police stormed a villa belonging to a prominent businessman Saturday 
where three Filipinos demanding $10 million had taken several hostages and 
killed three people, including a 2-month-old baby, an official Saudi statement 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, issued by the chief of police in Riyadh, said the Filipinos had 
attacked the house and taken the businessman's wife, two sons, a maid and a 
driver hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 They killed one of the sons, who was 2 months old, the maid and the driver, 
the statement said, adding that the infant died "from stabs by one of the 
kidnapers." 
</P>
<P>
 One kidnaper was killed, according to the statement, and the other two were 
injured, one seriously, when an anti-terrorist police force stormed the house. 
The kidnapers had demanded weapons, ammunition and $10 million.

 "Red Hill" is the not-so-creative name for the rust-colored ridge of mercury 
ore near Browning Avenue and La Colina Drive in the north Tustin area. 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient landmark is also known as "Cerrito de las Ranas," or "Hill of the 
Frogs" -- a Spanish-language reference to the thousands of small green 
amphibians that once lived in a swampy area extending from the hill down to 
Newport Bay.The sound of croaking frogs could be heard for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Red Hill was mined for its quicksilver. 
Today, it is surrounded by fashionable homes in an unincorporated area of

GEORGE RAMOS: GANGBANGERS WHO WANT TO START OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I always root for gang kids who want to go straight. It's a struggle for many 
of them but some persevere in tough circumstances, even when the ex-cholo is 
reminded every day that he'll never amount to anything. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I'm rooting for Clemente Arrizon Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrizon, 24, is a former gang member from Buena Park who is graduating in 
December with a bachelor's degree in urban recreation from Cal State 
Northridge. He knows all about gang life: He's been stabbed twice, shot four 
times, been arrested three times and done more than his share of "stuff" on the 
streets. His upper torso is fully tattooed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's worked hard to change his life. He does anti-gang work in Pacoima and 
has given lectures on the subject. One appearance so impressed authorities in 
Canada that he spent 3 1/2 weeks in Toronto at the invitation of city officials 
to work with gangs there. His work made him a minor celebrity up north, 
prompting Air Canada to allow Clem -- as he's known at school and on the 
streets -- to sit in first class on his way home as a sign of appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home in Buena Park, the cops think he's still a punk. They don't see the 
change in him. When stopped by officers, the normally gregarious Clem tries to 
stay calm and ignore their skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to walk the line," he says. "If I don't, I fail." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I got to thinking about Clem after reading the piece last Monday by Times 
reporter Paul Lieberman, who told the tragic story of 17-year-old Abel Silva of 
Hollywood. A former gangbanger, Silva was trying to turn his life around and 
wanted to be a police Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 The cops at the Hollywood station thought they had won the battle for Silva, 
but they'll never know for sure now. The boy was stabbed to death in Malibu, 
another innocent victim of L.A. violence. The fact that he was a former gang 
member apparently played no part in his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, those who knew the boy were left to wonder: Had they made a 
mistake? Was he turning his life around? Was he back to old habits? 
</P>
<P>
 The pain over his death was evident in the story. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other battles to wage, so I eagerly agreed to go to Northridge 
to meet Clem at the invitation of Prof. Jack Foley, who thinks his prize 
student has seen the light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clem is a great kid," Foley says. "He's an example of what can happen when 
someone takes an interest in somebody's life. . . . Without strong influences, 
these kids get into trouble, but they're good kids. There are a million kids 
like Clem out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley isn't the only one who has taken an interest in Clem. Ed Munoz, an 
attorney in Orange County, remembers the first time Clem showed up in his 
office several years ago when he was facing charges stemming from a carjacking. 
Munoz told him to leave until he changed his appearance and attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like the prototype gang member," remembers Munoz, who grew up in 
Boyle Heights. "Fu Manchu mustache, Raiders regalia. . . . We started talking 
about his trouble and I told him, 'Look, don't BS me. I know the routine. Look 
at your attitude, your posture. It's a chip on your shoulder. You can't win 
with that attitude.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clem responded to Munoz's tough-love lecture. While he is proud of his little 
barrio, he knew the old neighborhood had no future for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm marked for life," he admits over a Coke. "I've been to 28 funerals 
of my friends in the gangs since I was 13. My whole world before was just four 
blocks (in Buena Park). That's why I'm working for a college degree. I want to 
be something. I want to prove that people can change." 
</P>
<P>
 On campus, Clem covers up his gang tattoos. "Even in the summer, I cover up," 
he says. "That's why I love winter." 
</P>
<P>
 But he still gets into trouble. Recently, police found an ice pick in his 
truck, a violation of his probation from previous trouble. Although the judge 
threw out the case, Clem still has to explain himself to disbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case, I didn't do anything wrong and I'm not planning on doing 
anything wrong," he says. "Look, I'm no angel and I know how people look at me. 
But if you get to meet me, I know you'd like me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clem won me over with his earnestness and ability to laugh at himself. I was 
rooting for him as he told an anecdote about being stopped recently near his 
parents' home by the cops. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, they were on his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me, 'What are you going to do with your education? You're going to 
jail anyway,' " he remembers. Then came his zinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'I'm going to join the ACLU and mess with you guys.' "

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MULTICULTURAL 
MANNERS; RECOGNIZING DEATH AS A PART OF LIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The hospital oncology department holds meetings for doctors to ease the 
emotional toll of treating dying children. 
</P>
<P>
 At one session, Dr. Kent relates his concern about the family of Estela 
Ramirez, an 8-year-old patient who has recently died. 
</P>
<P>
 He has visited the Ramirez home and discovers an altar with incense, candles, 
yellow flowers, fruit, plates of food and Estela's photo. 
</P>
<P>
 He notices more disturbing articles: candied skulls with eyes of rhinestones 
and sequins, small round breads decorated with skulls and crossbones, tiny toy 
coffins with pop-up cadavers and skeleton puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kent finds these objects morbid. Since Estela died more than three weeks 
ago, he believes the Ramirez family is behaving inappropriately, that they are 
obsessed with death. 
</P>
<P>
 He advises, "You must get on with your life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramirez family believes that is what they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kent should have checked the calendar. He arrived at the Ramirez house on 
Nov. 2, All Soul's Day. For Mexicans living across the border and here, it is 
also Dia de Los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than discovering a macabre memorial for Estela, the doctor had stumbled 
into an annual event where families offer flowers and favorite foods to the 
recently deceased. This Aztec-based holiday, with ties to Halloween, recognizes 
-- even celebrates -- the reality that death is a part of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Before making assumptions, check the cultural traditions of the people 
with whom you are involved.

INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although your endorsement of state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) for 
insurance commissioner properly recognizes the integrity of both candidates as 
"more interested in getting things done than in ideological posturing," your 
reasoning for the endorsement based primarily on campaign contributions is 
misleading (editorial, Oct. 12). It is my understanding that the majority of 
Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush's (R-Cupertino) "industry" funds come from 
persons and groups who may earn their living from the industry, but are not 
directly employed by the companies, not unlike the law firms who represent the 
insurance industry and contribute to Torres' campaign. You also failed to 
recognize that Torres receives the endorsement of most trial lawyers in the 
state, who earn enormous incomes from the industry because of liberal tort and 
workers' compensation laws. These incomes are ultimately borne by the insurance 
consumer in the form of higher premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 As a supporter and adviser to Quackenbush, I can assure you that his 
understanding of the insurance business is not only thorough, but also 
refreshing in its approach. His business experience prior to public service 
will bring administrative skills that will improve operational efficiency 
within the department as well as encourage insurance company operational 
efficiency through administrative review and the rate-approval process. His 
concepts of auto, homeowners and workers' compensation insurance reform are 
fair to all business entities dependent on insurance, but most importantly, 
strongly favorable to the insurance consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 I would suggest that voters demand meaningful and precise answers from the 
candidates on insurance issues affecting their daily lives. In this area, I 
believe Quackenbush has the upper hand.  
</P>
<P>
 THOMAS W. MATUSH 
</P>
<P>
 Covina 
</P>
<P>
 * Your endorsement of Torres should be reconsidered. Torres' election will 
only lead to a greater deterioration of the insurance marketplace for 
consumers. Torres is greatly misinformed of the insurance climate. He stated in 
an interview to the Professional Insurance Agents that the insurance market 
seems to be quite strong. Has not Torres heard of the Farmers moratorium, and 
the State Farm restriction for homeowners? Twentieth Century and Republic are 
leaving. Safeco is deciding whether to leave. Ohio Casualty, and Crum & Forster 
have left. Many other companies have left due to the regulatory conditions. 
Torres has done good work, but his "Homeowners' Bill of Rights" is regulatory 
strangulation, and his bill for mandatory fertility coverage would be 
regulatory bankruptcy if passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' election as insurance commissioner will only exacerbate an already 
depressed insurance marketplace. We in the insurance industry call it a hard 
market. Ask anyone trying to get insurance on an older home.

SOWING THE GROUND FOR A BETTER CALIFORNIA; IN THE LAST SEGMENT OF THEIR DEBATE 
IN THE TIMES, THE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES TELL WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED BY 
LISTENING TO CALIFORNIANS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN BROWN, Kathleen Brown is the State Treasurer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During my campaign for governor, I've traveled up and down this state and 
learned important lesson about Californians and their families. Day after day, 
I've seen the tenacity of people raised on the special promise of California -- 
that tomorrow will be better than today, that our children's future will be 
brighter than our own. With hard work and responsibility, Californians have 
always believed they could achieve security for their families and prosperity 
for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But that special promise -- the California promise -- has been betrayed by 
Pete Wilson's rudderless leadership. And Californians are crying out for 
change. They want new jobs, better schools and an end to the fiscal mess in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I sat down more than a year ago to write an economic plan to turn 
this state around. I'm sending out millions of copies of this plan to every 
corner of California. More than 50 economists, including two Nobel laureates, 
have endorsed my written plan to rebuild California. So have hundreds of 
leading educators, business leaders and more than 39,000 rank-and-file police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, as I traveled through Merced County, I met a pipe fitter who 
embodied many of the lessons I have learned since I began this campaign to 
rebuild California. Like many Californians, John Hollis' parents migrated to 
California from the Dust Bowl. They settled in the Central Valley and raised a 
family. John's father was a trucker and was able to transform the difficulties 
of their past into a prosperous and happy life in California. They left a world 
of economic uncertainty and found opportunity and security in California. 
</P>
<P>
 John told me that by the time he was 17, he was able to leave his parents' 
home and support himself. He learned the pipe-fitting trade and has worked hard 
his whole life to support his own family. This year, John will pay off his 
mortgage and completely own his own home -- realizing the California promise of 
independence and security that brought his parents here a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as John has fulfilled the dream of a lifetime, his three sons are 
finding it harder and harder to begin their journey to independence. All of 
them have had to move back home with their parents because they can't make 
enough to support their own households. John's eldest son, for example, can't 
make enough to support his wife and children even though he has been in the 
trade for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 When John's parents came here decades ago, they understood the implicit 
promise that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you could get a good 
job with a decent wage and your kids could get a good, affordable education. 
And perhaps most important, when your children were grown, they were assured a 
better life than yours. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, this California promise has been shattered. More than 
550,000 Californians have lost their jobs, 64,000 businesses have failed and 
our schools have gone from the top of the national rankings to the bottom. For 
the first time ever, our children may not be able to enjoy the same lifestyle 
they knew growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 This truth was brought home to me recently when I visited a school to talk 
about my proposals to put computers in every classroom. The children's eyes lit 
up with hope. But they made it clear that it's not just computers they need -- 
it's basic supplies like pencils and textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, California's middle-class families have had a governor who 
doesn't seem to care about the declining economy or crumbling schools -- a 
governor who spends millions of dollars on 30-second television commercials, 
yet hasn't even taken the time to spell out his plans for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hollis is one of millions of Californians who are frustrated and fearful 
for their families' futures. He sees the problem more clearly than Pete Wilson 
ever could. He sees it in his own home and among his friends. He explained that 
if you lose your job, you lose more than an income. You lose your dignity, your 
independence and your hope that things will ever get better. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I have written a plan to cut $5 billion from wasteful government 
spending and use the money to help create 1 million private-sector jobs you can 
raise a family on and put our schools and colleges first again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has no plan for California's future; he only has a plan for his own 
reelection. He lacks the courage to clean up the financial mess in Sacramento 
so that we can put more cops on the streets, keep libraries open longer and 
make our schools safe again. 
</P>
<P>
 John and his sons deserve better. California deserves better. We cannot afford 
four more years of drift and decline.

SOWING THE GROUND FOR A BETTER CALIFORNIA; IN THE LAST SEGMENT OF THEIR DEBATE 
IN THE TIMES, THE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES TELL WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED BY 
LISTENING TO CALIFORNIANS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE WILSON, Pete Wilson is governor of California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The people of California constantly renew for me an unstinting faith in the 
future of our state. Californians have weathered tougher times than anyone 
should have to endure, but they've continued to fight for the changes that will 
restore health, hope and confidence in the state's future. 
</P>
<P>
 That better future must begin with opportunity -- the opportunity for our 
children to learn more and earn more than we have. That's why creating jobs and 
investing in schools have long been top priorities for me. California's economy 
is coming back, but to promote job creation, we need to get government out of 
the way by slashing red tape and unleashing the power of California's 
job-creators. It was that type of reform after the Northridge earthquake that 
allowed us to rebuild the world's busiest freeway in record time. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as we must free job-creators from needless bureaucratic rules and 
regulations, so too must we free our schools. Our teachers deserve a chance to 
be innovative, to make our schools better. But they can't do that when they're 
weighed down by 11 pounds of the California Education Code. And it's time to 
give parents a greater voice in how their children's schools are run. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians are justifiably fed up with those who break the law and ignore 
the rules that govern a civilized society. Californians want people held 
accountable for their actions again -- whether it's a career criminal, a 
deadbeat dad who ignores his obligation to his children or someone who violates 
immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians aren't simply waiting for government to solve these problems. 
They've started doing it themselves. I recently met with a group of neighbors 
in Chatsworth, for example, who -- fed up with graffiti, drug trafficking and 
violence on their block -- formed a Neighborhood Watch. As a result, they've 
seen crime drop 23% in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 These community activists and cops on the beat tell me that they need tougher 
laws to put dangerous criminals behind bars for good. After years of gridlock, 
the Legislature finally responded to pressure from crime victims, police, 
sheriffs, prosecutors and other citizens concerned about violence on our 
streets. We won the most significant criminal-justice reform in the history of 
California. It started with our "three strikes, you're out" law, which a RAND 
Corp. study predicted would cut adult violent crime statewide by nearly 30%. 
But our reforms also include a "one strike" law for rapists, child molesters 
and arsonists; a law to try dangerous juvenile thugs as adults, and a measure 
ending the absurd law that lets dangerous criminals cut their time in prison by 
as much as half for doing little more than folding shirts in the prison 
laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians also want government to start encouraging the same values that we 
all share as individuals. Hard work and personal responsibility are 
time-honored values, but until recently, government programs like the welfare 
system actually punished these virtues. That's why I fought for welfare 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 A former welfare mother working in Riverside told me that she was glad our 
welfare reforms had helped get her back into the work force, because it let her 
set a positive example of honest work and personal responsibility for her kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as individuals should be held responsible, so too should government. But 
the federal government is shirking its responsibility to enforce U.S. 
immigration laws. And its failure to enforce these laws is eroding the quality 
of life for every legal resident in our state. 
</P>
<P>
 When I visited White Memorial Hospital in East Los Angeles, the doctors and 
nurses told me that illegal immigration was undermining their ability to 
deliver adequate health care. It's simply not fair that legal residents, 
including recent legal immigrants, should suffer because Washington forces us 
to reward people who violate our immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing I've learned is that Californians strongly disagree with 
Kathleen Brown's observation that "illegal immigration is wrongly seen as a 
cause" of problems in California. Californians understand the problems that 
illegal immigration is causing in our schools, in our prisons and in our 
hospitals, and they want something done about it -- now. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important, I've learned that no matter how great the challenge, 
Californians aren't quitters. I've seen them bounce back from earthquakes and 
wildfires, from mudslides and floods. I believe in what I said after the 
Northridge earthquake even more strongly today: They can shake us, but they 
can't break us. We are bringing the change needed to make California healthy 
again. And with the courage and determination of the people of California at 
work, our best days are yet to come.

MIKE PENNER: RUNBACKS, THEN SAINTS, STEAL THE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saints over Rams by a field goal, just the way Jim Mora and Chuck Knox always 
play them. 
</P>
<P>
 You know how it is whenever these two legendary sticks in the mud are planted 
on opposite sides of the same football field. Four scoring plays of 90 yards or 
more. A 92-yard kickoff return. A 98-yard kickoff return. A 103- yard punt 
return. A quarterback and an offensive line coach carted off to the hospital 
with concussions. Seventy-one points, almost 700 yards in kick and punt 
returns, three league records set by someone named Tyrone Hughes and Jim 
Everett leaving the Superdome with a Pearl Drops grin plastered on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Been there, done that. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, who walked into this building Sunday morning expecting, 13-10, 10-7, 
something like that, staggered into the visitors' interview room after Saints 
37, Rams 34, looking as if he'd just seen a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a Galloping Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Hughes has been loaned the nickname by now, hasn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I've been in one of these, and I've been in a lot of 'em," 
Knox gasped as he wobbled behind the mike, in serious need of something or 
someone to lean on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never been in a game where we've had two kickoff returns for 
touchdowns against us. That is a first." 
</P>
<P>
 For Knox, for Knox's numbed players and for Hughes, the man who ran both of 
them back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, normally a second-year Saints' cornerback by way of Nebraska, spent 
this day masquerading as Red Grange. Field the ball, run this way, go 92 yards. 
Catch the ball, veer the other way, dash 98 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And those were only the second- and third-most interesting returns of the day. 
The Rams' Robert Bailey, another mild-mannered cornerback in real life, set a 
record that might never be broken -- logically, it should never again be 
attempted -- when he picked up a stray punted football going around in his end 
zone and carried it into the other end zone, a total trip covering 103 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A 103-yard punt return? 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints couldn't believe it, wouldn't believe it. Eleven of them were 
walking off the field, assuming Tommy Barnhardt's fourth-quarter punt had 
nicked the back line of the Rams' end zone and done its job. Touchback. 
Commercial break. Make way for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnhardt had just reached the New Orleans sideline and unsnapped his chin 
strap when, out of the corner of his right eye, he caught the flash of a white 
jersey darting behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 What in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 Barnhardt jerked his head around, turning in the double-take of the season. 
There was Bailey, running with the ball and running solo, with no player from 
either side within two counties of his heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Running, amid stunned silence, to a touchdown that pulled the Rams to within 
three points with 4:08 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was walking off," Bailey said, "but I never heard a whistle. I see 
the ball bouncing around in the end zone and say, 'Hey, I got nothing to lose.' 
I can either be the hero or the goat, if I fumble it or something." 
</P>
<P>
 So Bailey scooped up the ball and headed down field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys are looking at me like I'm crazy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bailey began looking for striped shirts. But "nobody's moving. Nobody's 
blowing a whistle. The ref isn't acting like the play is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because it wasn't. Live ball, dazed Saints, amazed Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Who'd have ever thought it -- Ram football as performance art? 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think I'd seen it all," Ram special teams coach Wayne Sevier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I have seen it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's Barnum act was headed straight for the highlights shows, but taken in 
the context of these demented 60 minutes off Bourbon Street, it seemed like 
nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 How often does Everett go an entire quarter without throwing an incomplete 
pass, hitting his first eight for 111 yards and a touchdown? 
</P>
<P>
 How often does Miller get knocked out of a game? OK, it happens every week -- 
but how often does a Ram assistant coach wind up in the same X-ray room with 
him? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Erkenbeck, who coaches offensive linemen for Knox, got blindsided in the 
fourth quarter by a roll block of sorts and wound up riding shotgun with Miller 
to Baptist Hospital, where both were treated for concussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Erkenbeck was low-bridged on a punt return by Saints' safety J.J. McCleskey, 
who was shoved out of bounds by Ram Steve Israel and sent tumbling into the 
back of Erkenbeck's knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took a heck of a hit," Knox observed, and, yes, the veteran coach had to 
admit that was another career first, having to update the medical status of a 
line coach during the postgame injury report. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the craziness, however, it was still the same old Ram result. Loss to 
New Orleans, loss within the division, loss on the road, loss that drops them 
to 3-5 at midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram safety Anthony Newman could barely stand it, especially when the questions 
about a victorious quarterback named Everett began piling up around his locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everett didn't do anything special," Newman snapped. "He had a couple nice 
drives at the start of the game and that's it. Two drives, that's all. How many 
yards did he have? 200?" 
</P>
<P>
 To be exact, 206. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other things beat us, he didn't beat us," Newman said. "We gave them 14 
points on special teams. Fourteen points are hard to come by. We got one 
(touchdown) back on the punt return by Bailey, but they had the extra seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were beaten by a kickoff return." 
</P>
<P>
 There ought to be a law, Sevier said. Or at least a new rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad there's no 10-point punt return," Sevier mused. "If you return a punt 
over 100 yards, it ought to be worth 10 points, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL promises to consider it, the next time it happens.

MIKE DOWNEY: THEIR RUSHING ATTACK IS INVISIBLE NO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harvey Williams, hands on hips, is standing smack dab on the 50-yard line, 
feeling fine. His football team has finally won a home game -- first time all 
season -- and a Raider (him) has finally rushed for 100 yards -- first time all 
season -- which explains why guys are hanging across the Coliseum railing, 
calling, "HAR-vey! HAR-vey!" 
</P>
<P>
 Quick as a bunny, Harvey ran and ran and ran. This was his first start in the 
backfield since becoming a Raider and he hippity-hopped 27 times for 107 yards 
and a touchdown, leaving footprints all over the Atlanta Falcons. For someone 
who gained two yards in the first quarter, Williams has just run wild. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, an opportunity for Harvey to show what he could do. "I don't know 
about the people around the country," he says to a TV camera immediately after 
the game, basking in the afterglow, "but I know what I can do, and the Raiders 
know what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, he runs off, waving to his new fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing. Passing. Passing. That's all anybody ever praised about the Raider 
offense. More and more it irritated Williams, who said, "I take it real 
personal. Every time you flip the TV on, they're saying the L.A. Raiders don't 
have a running game, the L.A. Raiders don't have a running game. You get sick 
of that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sunday's game began, the Raiders didn't have a running game. No one from 
the organization had rushed for 100 yards in nearly two years, since Eric 
Dickerson did so Nov. 29, 1992, at San Diego. Even worse, no one on the current 
Raider roster other than Williams had 100 yards total all season, and it took 
Harvey until the seventh game to even crack the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Shell doesn't equate starting with succeeding. A few days ago, asked again 
if the rapidly improving Williams would finally get to start, Shell's reply to 
a reporter was, "This is important to you, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no. Yet even at the end of a full quarter Sunday, there seemed to be 
something lacking in the Raider backfield -- namely motion. First carry, 
Williams was stopped for no gain. Second carry, Williams was stopped for no 
gain. Last play of the quarter, Williams slashed for two yards. Total Raider 
rushing yardage for the quarter: two. 
</P>
<P>
 Then things picked up. Williams began the second period by catching a short 
pass from Jeff Hostetler, one of eight -- yes, eight -- he caught Sunday. 
(Williams now ranks second on the Raiders in pass receptions, behind only Tim 
Brown.) 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he skirted right end for a one-yard touchdown, outrunning the 
Falcons to the pylon, Williams was feeling more useful. He had waited so long 
for some real work. He had wanted to justify the Raiders' faith, for rescuing 
him from a situation that Williams considered a personal hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I said before, I should have been here on Draft Day," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how he hated those wasted seasons with the Chiefs. How he resented the 
Kansas City coach, Marty Schottenheimer, for putting his whole career on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those times, me saying, 'Marty, give me the ball. Give me the ball.' And 
him saying, 'Oh, just wait your turn.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's ever given me anything. That's why I am so happy to be standing here 
with the silver and black on. I was promised in Kansas City that I would get a 
true opportunity. But I wasn't promised anything here. I was lied to in Kansas 
City. If they were straight with me, I'd have handled it. I'm a man. Al Davis 
didn't promise me anything but a chance. Art Shell, same thing. I owe them and 
I want to repay them." 
</P>
<P>
 He did so by leading the Raiders in rushing at New England, at Miami and again 
against Atlanta. On third and two Sunday, instead of passing, the Raiders gave 
the ball to Williams, who went over left tackle for three yards and a first 
down. An actual rushing first down. And on the next play, Hostetler threw to 
Tim Brown for a 20-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Run and pass. What a concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody on the line got excited," Williams said. "They started saying, 
'We're going to get you a hundred. We're going to get you a hundred.' (Right 
guard) Kevin Gogan was really pumped up. He was more excited than I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Gogan blocked last year for Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, it has to be 50-50 if you're going to go to a Super Bowl, half running 
and half passing," Williams said. "The Dallas Cowboys showed that. That's what 
we've got to do if we're going to get this ship turned around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders came pretty close to half and half Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-one rushes. Thirty passes. 
</P>
<P>
 When he ran off the field after his 27th and final carry, Williams ran right 
into his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell asked, "You tired?" 
</P>
<P>
 Williams answered, "No. I can carry it 10 more times." 
</P>
<P>
 Laughing about that afterward, Williams was thankful that he could finally 
pull his weight and volunteered to carry more, more, more. But after further 
review, he also said, "If I don't get the ball none of the time and we win, I'm 
happy." Which was better than getting the ball none of the time and being in 
Kansas City.

COLONIAL AFFAIR INJURED, OUT OF THE CLASSIC; BREEDERS' CUP: RECENT WINNER OF 
JOCKEY CLUB GOLD CUP SUFFERS A BROKEN LEG. FRANKEL MIGHT ENTER RUN SOFTLY IN 
RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Colonial Affair, who would have been one of the favorites for the $3-million 
Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5, has been retired because of 
a stall injury suffered at the Louisville track on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial Affair, who scored a two-length victory over Devil His Due in the 
Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park this month, apparently was agitated by the 
arrival of other horses at his barn. The 4-year-old colt kicked the back wall 
of his stall and suffered a broken sesamoid bone in his right rear leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's never been better in his life," said Scotty Schulhofer, who trained 
Colonial Affair. "I felt like he could go out and get the job done. He loved 
the track, and he had been galloping like a champion." 
</P>
<P>
 In his two starts before the Jockey Club Gold Cup, Colonial Affair was third, 
behind Holy Bull and Devil His Due, in the Woodward at Belmont and he won the 
Whitney Handicap by a nose over Devil His Due at Saratoga. Last year, Colonial 
Affair won the Belmont Stakes as his jockey, Julie Krone, became the first 
woman to ride the winner of a Triple Crown race. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial Affair, who broke awkwardly and finished last in last year's 
Breeders' Cup Classic, won seven of 20 starts and earned $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With Colonial Affair on the sidelines, the probable favorite in the Classic is 
Devil His Due, even though he has won only three of 10 starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the lack of a standout, trainer Bobby Frankel will be on the phone 
today to Grant Pritchard-Gordon, the racing manager for Juddmonte Farms, trying 
to persuade him that Run Softly belongs in the Classic. Run Softly, a 
3-year-old son of Deputy Minister who never has run on dirt, won Sunday's 
Volante Handicap, a 1 1/8-mile grass race, at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Arcangues made his dirt debut at Santa Anita and won the Classic 
at 133-1. Frankel's horses -- Bertrando, Marquetry and Missionary Ridge -- 
finished second, fourth and 11th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Classic (this year) is not that strong of a race," Frankel said. "It's a 
Group III race and Run Softly is a Group III horse, so he ought to be in there. 
He's bred for the dirt, he's got a dirt foot (not big and flat) and the 
distance shouldn't bother him." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel's other Classic prospect, Tinners Way, will undergo surgery Wednesday 
for a knee injury and won't race again until next year. Tinners Way won the 
Pacific Classic at Del Mar in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chances are 100% that he'll come out of the surgery all right," Frankel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Frankel's barn led the country with $8.8 million in purses last year 
and the trainer won an Eclipse Award, his bad luck in the Breeders' Cup 
continued. He is winless despite 22 starters in the 10-year series. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel said Sunday that he will saddle Raintrap for the first time when 
Juddmonte's Rothmans International winner runs in the Breeders' Cup Turf. 
Juddmonte will also run Sunshack and the filly Bolas in the Turf. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Classic development, John Mabee said that one of his contenders, 
Dramatic Gold, will run, but he will wait until today's first-payment deadline 
to decide whether to supplement Best Pal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thoroughly convinced that we should run Best Pal," Mabee said Sunday. 
"I'm going to sleep on it. The Breeders' Cup has my credit-card number in case 
we decide to go."

NEXT STOP: ATLANTA; U.S. OLYMPIC SOCCER COACH LIEKOSKI PICKS UP WHERE WORLD CUP 
TEAM LEFT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine having spent two years in the Finnish army and then coming to United 
States at age 20 to find a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 And getting drafted within a month of setting foot on American soil. 
</P>
<P>
 And spending the next two years in the U.S. army. 
</P>
<P>
 And not so much as blinking an eye in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Vietnam era. 
</P>
<P>
 Unthinkable? 
</P>
<P>
 Not for Timo Liekoski. For the unflappable Finn, it was merely another step on 
a long and curious road that took him this month to an appointment as coach of 
the U.S. Olympic soccer team for the 1996 Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
 At 52, the circle had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Helsinki, I lived right next to the Olympic Stadium," Liekoski said, 
impressed by the apparent symmetry of his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Liekoski was 10 when the 1952 Games were staged in his home city. His memories 
of them are remote. He has clearer recollections of summer evenings playing 
goalkeeper on the soccer field or winter afternoons playing forward on the ice 
hockey rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years have passed, but Al Miller remembers when he first saw Liekoski. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, then a future North American Soccer League and U.S. national team 
coach, was playing amateur soccer for a club known as the Kingston Kickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the captain," Miller said, "and one night I saw him standing on the 
sideline and I went over and asked him if he'd like to join us. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was a goalkeeper. He was a great addition to our team. He was a 
nice kid. I started chatting to him, asked him what he was doing in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was looking for a job. He was working part time at a (Catskills) 
resort as a dishwasher or some damn thing. I said 'Why don't you go to 
college?' and he said he'd love to but he didn't know if he could get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who was coaching at New Paltz (N.Y.) State University, soon had a 
promising goalkeeper on his freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Liekoski wanted to be more than promising. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to me during the summer and said, 'I really want to be great 
goalkeeper, can you help me?' " Miller said. "So for two hours a day we trained 
in the heat of the summer and I killed him. I can still see him leaning over in 
the showers, just dead. He started turning out to be something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timo had great reflexes. He was born with them. He was slow as a runner, but 
unbelievably quick over a step. So he was a natural for goalkeeping." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, however, Miller got his first big coaching break at Hartwick 
College in Oneonta, N.Y., a school that takes soccer seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller took three players with him: Liekoski, Terry Fisher and Alek Papadakis. 
At Hartwick, the trio met Francisco Marcos and the odd chemistry of Finn and 
American and Greek and Portuguese sparked something into life. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller went on to become one of the NASL's top coaches and U.S. national team 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher became coach of UCLA and later the NASL's Los Angeles Aztecs, among 
other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Papadakis became a starter with the NASL's Atlanta Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos held various administrative posts in the NASL and today is commissioner 
of the 72-team U.S. Inter-regional Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 And Liekoski, well, Liekoski went farther than any of them and still is 
pulling ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe there was anybody probably more destined to become a 
top-level coach, more determined, more dedicated or more analytical, than 
Timo," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody deserves it more than he does. He paid the high price of not only 
staying with the program but surviving when the program wasn't there for him. 
Now, he has the unique challenge of being the Olympic coach, and it's well 
deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller saw the promise early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did summer camps in those days," he said, "and Timo helped. He was quiet 
but he had a great sense of humor and worked hard. He was great with kids. I 
always told him, 'You're going to make a great coach someday,' and he said, 'I 
think that's what I'd like to do.' So he was kind of studying it all along." 
</P>
<P>
 At Hartwick, Liekoski sat out a year, played two years as a goalkeeper and 
then, during preseason camp in his senior year, broke his wrist during 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't slow him. He switched to defender and earned All-America honors that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as even his closest friends admit, he was not likely to have become a 
professional player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to say that he was methodically skillful," Fisher said, choosing 
his words with care. "I don't think that skill was ever his biggest strength, 
but he was very determined, as well as a super-fit athlete, a great competitor. 
He was a tremendous goalkeeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very good player at a certain level," he said. "I mean, he would 
never have been a star because he was not fast, but he was a very good 
tactician. He overcame whatever he couldn't do because of lack of ability or 
speed, by very good positional sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that he was earmarked to become a coach from the word go." 
</P>
<P>
 Liekoski earned his bachelor's degree in economics at Hartwick and later his 
master's in education at Whittier College, but by then soccer had him hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, he set out on a coaching career that already has lasted more than two 
decades and has seen him enjoy success on the collegiate level and 
professionally indoors and out. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite these achievements, it was not until Bora Milutinovic became U.S. 
national team coach in 1991 that Liekoski's fortunes rose higher still. 
</P>
<P>
 They made an unlikely pair, the Yugoslav and the Finn. Milutinovic is an 
extrovert, always laughing, always seeking the limelight; Liekoski is an 
introvert, seldom smiling, always analyzing everything from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 It is typical of Liekoski that he is able to view the relationship from Bora's 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bora) had to approach it (having American assistant coaches forced upon him) 
with a certain degree of skepticism because he didn't know if we would get 
along, if we would be loyal to him, or if we knew anything about the game," 
Liekoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just sort of asked to make sure the American-educated coaches had a 
chance to spend time with him and learn from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our relationship has evolved to the point where he's got complete 
trust in me as a coach and as a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has known Liekoski about as long as anyone in the United States, 
is perhaps best equipped to describe both his personality and his ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "His exposure to Bora and to the World Cup have been very good for him in 
terms of his international knowledge," Miller said. "He is very thorough and 
very bright. He's a very intelligent man. Extremely persistent. Every team he's 
coached professionally has been very well coached. You could look at it and you 
could see him in it. He's just very meticulous. He knows what he wants to get 
and he gets it from his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very quiet. He's a very deep personality. I would say he's a Jekyll and 
Hyde. You get him out at a banquet and he's funny as hell, he's a very good 
speaker. (But) when you meet him, he's an enigma. . . . . He's very into 
himself and very introverted and everything else, but get him at a banquet and 
he's fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos echoes the thought and adds another angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't know Timo, you would just sort of say, 'What planet did this guy 
land from?' Because he basically doesn't smile, he doesn't give the outward 
appearance of being the friendliest type. . . . He's very tenacious. We all 
know about his competitiveness. With Timo, the fire rages within, but if you 
don't know him, you don't know that." 
</P>
<P>
 "He and Bora were the perfect antidote for each other. It was a friendly 
cat-and-mouse situation. They could become each other's confidante, in a way. 
Rather than having two guys who were totally alike, I think they were sounding 
boards for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Bora was very comfortable with it because it was Bora's decision (to 
have Liekoski named Olympic coach). He realized, 'Here's somebody I can trust 
professionally, he's been around enough, he won't threaten my authority, but 
he's not afraid of speaking his opinion, he's not a yes man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid, another of Bora's World Cup assistant 
coaches, Liekoski's almost encyclopedic knowledge of the world game makes him 
an invaluable asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timo is one of the American coaches who is very aware of the international 
soccer scene," Schmid said. "That's one area where sometimes the American coach 
is weaker. Certainly, the World Cup experience helped all of us have an 
international awareness, but I think Timo, along with a couple of others, was 
always aware of the international game. 
</P>
<P>
 "His videotape library is unbelievable. I remember when he was living in 
Mission Viejo he tried to catalogue them and I think he stopped at about No. 
400 and something. And a lot of the tapes have two or three games on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the demands of his job, Liekoski's interests outside the game are 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I lived in Edmonton," he said, "I went to every (Oiler) game I could. I 
had season tickets. That was when they had (Jari) Kurri, (Mark) Messier, 
(Glenn) Anderson, a great team. So it was fun. When we were in L.A., I played 
in an old-timers' hockey league twice a week in Costa Mesa. I'm debating 
whether to go back to my old team here in Cleveland, but I may not have time to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to follow the (Cleveland) Browns, but I haven't been able to watch too 
many games because it just so happens that every Sunday I like to watch the 
Italian League." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to play golf when I get a chance (He has a 12-handicap.). I like to 
hack around; I enjoy it. Obviously, I do some exercising. I try to keep fit 
because I think it's important that I be able to play with the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Just who Liekoski's Olympic players will be, the next 18 months of camps and 
tryouts and overseas tours will help determine. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge of building a team that can contend for a medal is considerable, 
but Liekoski believes he has made the correct decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bora and I talked about it quite a bit," he said, "and both of us felt the 
best scenario was for him to stay with the national team and for me to take the 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, hopefully, after the Olympics, he and I reunite and I continue as his 
assistant and prepare for France (and the 1998 World Cup). After that, who 
knows?"

RAM NOTEBOOK; HUGHES HAS DAY OF RECORD RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saint cornerback Tyrone Hughes set NFL records for kickoff return yards (304), 
combined return yards (347) and tied a league mark for touchdown returns in a 
game (two) Sunday in New Orleans' 37-34 victory over the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started cramping on my next-to-last return or (I) might have had a third 
touchdown," Hughes said. "I had a hole and I tried to accelerate through it, 
but I started cramping and a guy came off a block and tackled me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes also got his first pro start at cornerback in place of the injured 
Tyrone Legette (ankle) and Carl Lee (hip). 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes intercepted a Chris Miller pass that bounced out of the hands of 
tailback Jerome Bettis at the Ram 12 in the second quarter, setting up a 
21-yard Morten Andersen field goal. He also dived and knocked down a pass for 
Flipper Anderson at the Saint five. 
</P>
<P>
 What was more satisfying, his special teams play or his play on defense? 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely the defensive side of the ball," said Hughes, a wide receiver at 
Nebraska until converting to cornerback late in his junior season. "I'm happy 
with the way the return game went because we were long overdue. But I was more 
excited about my performance at defensive back because I didn't let the guys 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 As a rookie last year, Hughes earned a spot in the Pro Bowl. He returned a 
punt 74 yards for a touchdown in a 37-6 victory over the Rams at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, his 92-yard kick return in the second quarter pushed the Saints' lead 
to 24-14. He returned another kick 98 yards for a touchdown on the final play 
of the third quarter, and averaged 43.6 yards in seven returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the Rams continue to kick deep to Hughes after his first touchdown? 
Wouldn't it have been safer to kick short and prevent a big play? 
</P>
<P>
 "In this league you do that and they'll run it back on you," said Wayne 
Sevier, the Rams' special teams coach. "We kick as deep as we can, cover as 
hard as we can and hope you have good players out there executing it. I thought 
this particular group should have done a great job on this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he made two good runs, but we made a couple bad decisions. We had a 
couple guys get inside when they shouldn't have on the first one. On the second 
one, one guy had a shot and missed. When I looked up and saw Tony Zendejas 
chasing him, I knew we were in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add records: Robert Bailey's 103-yard punt return broke the NFL record of 98 
yards set four times. Toby Wright's 98-yard fumble return in the second quarter 
was the fourth-longest in league history, tying him with George Halas' return 
in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sound advice: Even though he was playing against his former team, Everett said 
he had no extra input in the Saints' game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mora said he spoke with Everett at halftime about how the Rams were using 
Bettis, who finished with 63 yards in 18 carries. It was the third consecutive 
week Bettis had been held to fewer than 100 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis rushed for 212 yards in 28 carries against the Saints here last season, 
and the Saints, ranked 23rd in the league against the rush, were beaten for 
three rushing touchdowns by San Diego's Natrone Means last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense came in and had an agenda," Bettis said. "They stuck to it and 
the main thing was to stop No. 36, and they did a pretty good job of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trash talk: Their 3-5 record might indicate otherwise, but the Rams aren't 
down and out quite yet. At least according to assistant head coach Joe Vitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of these guys and I'll go with them any where, any time, any 
place," Vitt said. "This is a proud bunch. You want to call them Lambs? Well, 
don't call them that to their face." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complaint department: Saying he doesn't care if the league fines him for his 
controversial comments, New Orleans Coach Jim Mora blasted game officials on 
four key calls in the game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ejecting Saint safety Vince Buck and Ram wide receiver Todd Kinchen for 
fighting early in the fourth quarter, a week after Atlanta's Andre Rison and 
San Francisco's Deion Sanders traded blows and remained in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked (the officials), 'Why didn't they throw out Sanders and Rison,' " 
Mora said. "They said they have no control over that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the consistency? That's what ticks me off -- no consistency. I think 
it's wrong. One week it's one thing, the next week it's something else. One 
crew does one thing and another does this. It stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruling that Saint running back Lorenzo Neal had fumbled at the Ram two-yard 
line when it appeared he was down. Ram safety Toby Wright returned the fumble 
98 yards for a touchdown, cutting the Rams' deficit to 17-14 in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officials told me Lorenzo was on top of bodies, that he wasn't hitting 
the ground and the ball came out," Mora said. "I saw the replay and it looked 
like Lorenzo was on the ground and Derrick Ned was on bodies. I didn't see that 
one real well." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruling a free ball in the end zone on a fourth-quarter punt that Bailey 
returned 103 yards for a touchdown. "Our guys swore a whistle had blown," Mora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failing to measure on a close first-down call in the fourth quarter until 
the Saints requested it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The official signaled fourth down," Mora said. "When it is that close, it 
seems to me that the official ought to take it upon himself to call for a 
measurement." 
</P>
<P>
 Mora was asked if he thought he would be fined for his criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am," he said, "I'll be glad to pay it."

FANS IN ST. LOUIS WARILY ROOT FOR RAMS; FOOTBALL: AFTER LOSING OUT IN THE LAST 
NFL EXPANSION AND BEING JILTED BY PATRIOTS, THE CITY'S FAITHFUL SETS SIGHTS ON 
ANAHEIM'S TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While more animated members of the St. Louis Rams Fan Club spent Sunday 
afternoon bouncing off their bar stools and screaming at the big-screen 
television, Bryan Herrick absorbed the wild twists and turns of the Rams-New 
Orleans Saints game with stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of confused," said Herrick, 31, wearing a Rams' jersey and using a 
Rams' helmet for a table centerpiece. "Do I root for the Rams with all my heart 
and hope they win because they might move here? Or do I root against them, 
because if they win and go to the playoffs, there's no way they'll leave 
Anaheim?" 
</P>
<P>
 Such mixed emotions seem to be afflicting many St. Louis football fans, who 
are feeling a bit shellshocked these days. 
</P>
<P>
 They thought their city was a lock for an NFL expansion team last year before 
Charlotte and Jacksonville were awarded franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 They thought New England Patriots owner James Orthwein, a St. Louis native, 
would move his team here last January, but New England businessman Robert Kraft 
purchased the team at the last minute and kept it in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now St. Louis is a strong candidate to lure the Rams from Orange County, but 
like the curious kid who puts his finger on a hot stove -- twice -- fans here 
are a little hesitant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of 'closet' fans and it's going to take a while to get them 
out, but they're out there," said Joe Moreno, 28, a medical company employee 
from Edwardsville, Ill. "They're hiding. They're scared. I think everyone's 
hyped up, but after what happened this past year, they don't want to get their 
hopes up too high." 
</P>
<P>
 But they have to do something to show their loyalty to Ram President John 
Shaw, who has questioned whether St. Louis is as good a football town as 
Baltimore, the other city pursuing the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 So they started their own Rams fan club. The group, which has grown to about 
50 or 60 members since bartender Joe DeLurgio started the club, met for the 
fourth consecutive weekend Sunday in Walter Payton's Americas Bar at Union 
Station, which is marketing itself as the official St. Louis Rams headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking in, one could easily have mistaken the place for The Catch Restaurant 
across the street from Anaheim Stadium. Rams schedules and bumper stickers were 
posted around the room, and blue and gold balloons were tied up around the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans wore St. Louis Rams Fan Club T-shirts, Ram hats, and one woman came with 
a Ram goody bag that was stuffed with Rammy Whammy handkerchiefs, blue and gold 
pompons, a Ram calendar and St. Louis Rams pins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have so much Ram paraphernalia it's disgusting," said Suzanne Shrader, 27, 
who grew up in Newport Beach but moved to Chesterfield, Mo., last year. "I've 
been a Rams fan since I was 5 and had season tickets my whole life. I think I'd 
die if they didn't come here. I'd cry, and I'd be really depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Shrader wasn't the only Southern California native in the house. Rob Ackles, 
29, who moved from Anaheim to St. Louis three years ago, and Larry Glascott, 
31, who moved from La Crescenta to St. Louis in July, were among the crowd who 
watched the Saints beat the Rams, 37-34. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the club seemed to consist of former St. Louis Cardinal football 
fans, who endured three years of threats and rumors before team owner Bill 
Bidwill finally made it official and moved the Cardinals to Phoenix after the 
1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Louis getting the Rams would be like the world finding a cure for AIDS," 
said 30-year-old St. Louis resident Thurman Vaught, who works for a courier 
business. "I grew up with the Cardinals and was in tears when they left. They 
took more than a team away. They took my memories away." 
</P>
<P>
 In their wake, the Cardinals left a trail of losing seasons and poor 
attendance records -- at least for their final six seasons in St. Louis -- and 
the city has been trying to fight that image since. 
</P>
<P>
 A great baseball town, St. Louis is. A great hockey town too. But football? 
Forget it, many say. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chad Everett, a 32-year-old from Chesterfield and a longtime Cardinal 
football fan, is convinced St. Louis will support another NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set attendance records at the Sports Festival last summer, but are you 
going to tell me this is a great gymnastics town?" Everett said. "No. We set 
attendance records at an LPGA event here last month. Are we a golf town now? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good sports town. If a football team does the right things and is 
committed to the fans, we're going to be loyal to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Payton, the former Chicago Bear running back who was involved in St. Louis' 
expansion effort, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always how things are but how they're perceived," said Payton, who 
stopped by his bar Sunday. "People here want to be identified with the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 At any price, apparently. A few weeks ago, two St. Louis radio disc jockeys 
were arrested for their role in a street sign caper after sending two interns 
to steal a "Shaw Avenue" sign to send to the Ram president. The interns got 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
 The jocks, from station Q-104, were charged with stealing merchandise valued 
at under $150 and released, and they have a court date of Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to plead Rams insanity," said Isaiah Wilhelm, one of the 
two who were arrested. "We thought we'd send it to Shaw with a note saying, 'We 
like you so much we've already named a street after you.' The St. Louis Street 
Dept. found out, and they made us a new sign that we sent to Shaw last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, we broke the law for John Shaw. We got arrested for the Rams. What else 
can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
 But are fans willing to put their money where their mouths are? Part of the 
city's proposal to the Rams is to raise $60 million to $90 million through a 
seat-licensing plan, in which fans pay a one-time fee for the right to purchase 
season tickets in the new domed stadium, which is under construction downtown. 
A similar program in Charlotte charged fans $500-$5,400 per seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would take a big chunk out of my paycheck and I don't like having to do 
that, but if that's what it takes, I'll do it," Ackles said. "I know the Rams 
would get better support here than they get in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps, Baltimore, Glascott said. The Cardinals had only 10 winning 
seasons in 28 years in St. Louis and made the playoffs only twice. The Colts, 
on the other hand, had a long and storied tradition in Baltimore, where they 
won two NFL championships and one Super Bowl and developed a cult following 
before moving to Indianapolis in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "With such a storied history of the Colts, who knows if people there would 
accept the Rams?" Glascott said. "The Cardinals haven't won a championship 
since 1948, and that's when they played in Chicago. There's not a lot of 
football history here, so our approach to the Rams would almost be like having 
an expansion team, starting over." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram fever is building in St. Louis. The fan club has grown each week, and 
DeLurgio said 10 or so fans are tentatively planning to travel to Anaheim -- 
with a St. Louis Rams Fan Club banner -- for the Rams' Nov. 13 game against the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 People here want to reach out to the Rams, tell them how much they're wanted . 
. . but they don't want to get burned again. 
</P>
<P>
 "For three years (1985-87) we didn't know whether the Cardinals were staying 
or going, and our hearts were on a string," Everett said. "Then there was three 
years of silence. Then there was the expansion debacle, and then the glimmer of 
hope that the Patriots would move here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a carousel of hope, but we've got to be very cautious."

CANYON'S WILKINS TAMING HER CLUMSY SIDE; TENNIS: SOPHOMORE SINGLES PLAYER IS 
GROWING INTO HER 5-FOOT-11 FRAME AND TURNING INTO A POWER PLAYER FOR THE 
NINTH-RANKED COMANCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canyon High sophomore Shannon Wilkins probably wouldn't be someone you'd want 
handling your expensive crystal at a dinner party. And she probably wouldn't 
last too long on a balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the only things she can harm on a tennis court are the ball and 
her opponent, and occasionally herself. This season, Wilkins' opponents have 
gotten the worst of it. As the No. 1 player for Canyon's ninth-ranked team, she 
has won 42 of 45 singles sets and all three of her doubles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 After an awkward couple of years, Wilkins is growing into her 5-foot-11 frame 
and starting to take advantage of her reach and power advantage.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first it was hard because I couldn't catch up to my body," she said. "I 
was all arms and legs, really gawky. I grew so fast. It was frustrating, but 
I'm slowing down now and I'm getting my coordination." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are moments when Wilkins still has problems with her coordination. 
In a match against Villa Park two weeks ago, she crashed into a fence while 
running down a ball. She banged her elbow on a pole and was limited to playing 
doubles the next day against El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could have been worse, Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I did that I fractured my arm, so I'm not doing so bad," she 
said. "I'm just a klutz. I have bruises here and there from running into 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Trager, who has coached Wilkins six years, said it was often frightening 
to watch Wilkins play in her younger days. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd run down anything," Trager said. "She sees that ball and that's all she 
sees. Sometimes, I'd be watching her and think, 'Uh-oh, here comes the net, 
watch out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Wilkins, Shannon's mother who teaches tennis at Anaheim Hills Racquet 
Club, has painfully watched her daughter's development. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really lanky and gangly growing up," Barbara Wilkins said. "It was 
frustrating for her. It was hard for her to get down to that short ball. But 
the last six months to a year, she's come into her body. She's figured it all 
out now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Trager: "She's going to be one of those players that blows people away 
with her power. The strokes are there. My job now is to get her to believe in 
herself. Once she gets that confidence, she's going to be a real bear out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But before Shannon gains that confidence, Barbara Wilkins said her daughter 
might have to endure more growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think she's got some growing to do," Barbara Wilkins said. "My 
husband's sisters were all well over six feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Wilkins is already taller than her friends and one of the tallest 
girls at Canyon. So the begging question is, has she thought about basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never played it much, but I want to try out this year," Wilkins said. "I 
think maybe I could do OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who transferred from University after last year's tennis season, has 
done more than OK for Canyon this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard from one of the kids that we were getting a really good 
transfer," Canyon Coach JoAnn Cutshall said. "But I just figured, 'Well, we'll 
wait and see. How good can she be?' Well, the kids were right. She's pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 She was almost great last week against Villa Park's Faye DeVera, one of the 
county's top players. Wilkins led DeVera, 5-2, and, 40-0, before falling apart 
and losing the set in a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just choked," Wilkins said. "I just got so nervous. I started thinking, 
'Hey, I'm beating Faye,' instead of just playing the match. It got to be a 
mental thing after a while and she got a couple nice breaks too." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday's rematch with DeVera wasn't close; Wilkins was beaten, 6-2. 
After especially frustrating defeats, Wilkins usually turns to Trager for help, 
rarely accepting advice from her parents, who are tennis coaches, or her 
brother, Robbie, who plays at Foothill Community College near San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of hard to take advice from my brother or my parents," she said. "I 
guess I take it too personally." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barbara Wilkins: "We don't like to push her. We tell her things from time 
to time. We just have to pick the right time. That's pretty typical of the age 
she's at. Kids don't like taking advice from their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 But who knows? As Wilkins matures, she might start taking tennis tips from her 
parents and she might even start getting invited to dinner parties.

O.C. ENTERPRISE: FROM DISASTER TO PROFITABILITY; FINGERPRINT SPECIALIST 
PRINTRAK SURVIVES OWN IDENTITY CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a company that sells computer equipment designed to pick people out by the 
arches, loops and whorls of their thumbs, Printrak International Inc. has gone 
through a few different identities of its own since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, originally a division of Rockwell International Corp., was sold 
to London-based De La Rue Group 13 years ago. Printrak's profits slowly sank 
and by 1990 the company had lost more than $90 million. De La Rue, a 
currency-printing company, considered shutting it rather than face continued 
losses, which had risen to $2 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a managerial mess," says Richard Giles, an Englishman who had been a 
financial manager for another De La Rue division, a printing company in 
Colombia, before arriving as Printrak's chief financial officer in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Giles and another executive, Charles Smith, assumed control of 
Printrak's obligations from the parent company and began a restructuring 
campaign that eventually slashed the total number of employees from 425 to 150. 
Many who lost their jobs were engineers hired to work out technical problems 
for specific customers, which further strained customer relations. Annual 
revenues declined 33.8% to $14.5 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agreed to come (to Printrak) because even though it was a huge mess on one 
hand, there was some opportunity," said Giles, who is now president and chief 
executive. "They had a real technical base, and not all the money that had been 
spent was wasted." 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, the cuts paid off. Printrak had profit of $600,000 in 1991, and 
expects to post its third consecutive year of about $4 million in profits. 
Revenues are expected to reach $32 million for the fiscal year ending next 
March 31, said Dan Driscoll, Printrak's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 Printrak customers -- law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the New 
Scotland Yard -- also say they are happier than they were three years ago with 
Printrak's equipment and service. Back then, annual customer conferences 
degenerated into "bitch sessions," according to Debbie Benningfield, an officer 
with the Houston Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 And in June, Giles won a "Turnaround of the Year" award by a panel of Orange 
County executives. One of the judges, Melinda Masson, owner of Merit Property 
Management Inc. in Mission Viejo, said she was impressed that Giles kept the 
company going despite the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you cut staff to that point, a lot of companies don't come back because 
morale is so far down," she said. "When you're a company facing things you 
can't control, what makes one stand apart is having the tenacity, the vision to 
stay with what you've decided to do . . . and we think that's what Giles has 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 But how far back has Printrak bounced? Though it is back up to 230 employees, 
Printrak failed to win a pair of large law enforcement contracts earlier this 
year. And a new market it wants to enter -- sales to social service agencies, 
such as those handling welfare and immigration -- has been slow to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Printrak and its rivals -- including Indentix Inc. of Sunnyvale and Cogent 
Systems Inc. of Alhambra -- are slowing beginning to make sales to social 
service agencies, such as those that administer immigration, welfare programs 
and gun licenses in some countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if such agencies overcome the social resistance to using fingerprints to 
confirm the identity of their clients, present systems meant for police work 
aren't easily modified for confirming the identity of welfare recipients or for 
use at borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerprint experts divide fingerprint-comparison tasks into two types: 
identification of an unknown person and simple verification of a person's 
identity. Police fingerprint systems usually involve the former type, requiring 
a computer system to compare a suspect's prints against a large database of 
wanted individuals or those who have been previously arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the street, you want to see if you have stopped somebody who's wanted. 
They may not want to tell you that," said Steve Ferris, an industry consultant 
in Albany, N.Y. Therefore the "cold searches" used by police agencies may 
involve the comparison of a print to hundreds of thousands of others within a 
few minutes, where a false-positive identification could result in an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Verification systems, on the other hand, are used where clients have an 
incentive to identify themselves correctly with their fingerprints on file and 
their names can be used to match their prints with those in a database. The 
difference makes service-agency work easier than, for example, analyzing prints 
left at the scene of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you've got a live person in front of you, you're better off from a 
technical point of view," said Vance Bjorn, a Cal Tech graduate student who is 
also working on designing security systems, such as door locks, that use 
thumbprints. 
</P>
<P>
 However, social service agencies won't merely buy modified police-tested 
equipment, said Peter Higgins, an FBI deputy assistant director for engineering 
who helps administer the bureau's system. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see social service providers going through the same search 
process when they buy their systems in the next few years that the local law 
enforcement community did," Higgins said. "And it's going to put the same 
demands on (manufacturing) companies to go everywhere they think they'll find 
buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the competitors are trying to differentiate themselves according to 
price, service and accuracy. Certainly none has done all three," Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
 A widening market would probably only help Printrak, which has suffered from 
increased competition and didn't make the final cut in two recent, large 
competitions: 
</P>
<P>
 * A group including Printrak was eliminated from an FBI contract competition 
to design the bureau's automated fingerprint identification system. Instead, 
design contracts worth about $10 million each were awarded in May to three 
different groups of competitors, including Unisys, Martin Marietta and TRW Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Printrak was also part of a group that lost out on a bid to build a similar 
system for the state of Ohio. While Printrak's system performed well, its 
group, led by Harris Corp. of Melbourne, Fla., "priced themselves out of the 
competition," said Gregory C. Berquist, deputy director of the state's bureau 
of criminal identification and investigation. An $8.8-million contract went to 
Cleveland-based TRW Inc. instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Those out-of-the-money finishes won't kill the company, Giles said. "I'd have 
rather won than not, but we dusted ourselves off. It doesn't impede what we're 
trying to do now." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers trace Printrak's difficulties to the late 1980s, when it began to 
face competition from several new rivals in addition to its traditional foe, 
Nippon Electric Corp. The company was also having problems with system 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived, Giles said, he found Printrak "had a lot of different 
contracts and engineers, and every customer had a slightly different demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their solution had been to throw larger and larger numbers of people at each 
problem, and the cumulative result was massive losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Ricord, a senior management analyst at the Florida Department of Law 
Enforcement, which bought a $9-million Printrak system in 1987, said his 
department's dealings with Printrak under De La Rue's ownership were "very 
tumultuous." Florida's system could not complete the 2,000 searches per day 
that the department required, and the company eventually cut its bill by more 
than $2 million as part of a settlement with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that for a while after that period, Printrak wouldn't sign contracts 
with states that wanted the highest level of performance," Ricord said. "I 
think that was a good thing . . . they would no longer commit themselves to 
doing things they were uncomfortable doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Benningfield of the Houston police, Ricord praised Giles for refocusing 
the company on engineering needs as opposed to raw sales totals in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially a few years ago, vendors would do anything, promise you anything 
to get the contracts. Now I think that's changed, and I can see where their 
(Printrak's) experience in Florida pushed them to make those changes," Ricord 
said.

PROPOSALS ADD CONFUSION FOR STATE'S USERS OF ELECTRICITY; UTILITIES: SEVERAL 
DIFFERENT PLANS WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES AND THE PUBLIC TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY BUY 
THEIR POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What electricity customers might at first view as simple -- letting them 
choose where they buy their power -- is proving to be anything but. 
</P>
<P>
 State regulators decided last April to open California's electric power market 
to competition, which many hope would lower Californians' power rates -- now 
roughly 50% higher than the U.S. average. Today in San Diego, in the latest in 
a series of public hearings, they will continue to grapple with how to 
reorganize the massive industry to allow businesses and consumers to make that 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent filing of a new and somewhat surprising plan by Southern 
California Edison, there are now several fundamentally different proposals on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
 All the proposals would in principle permit customers to choose power vendors 
much as they now choose long-distance telephone companies, but they lay out 
vastly different roles for current and future players in the power business. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's new plan would bring retail competition to all businesses and 
residents as early as 1998, far earlier for many customers than under the 
Public Utilities Commission's own plan. "Every proposal has some pluses and 
minuses," conceded Vikram S. Budhraja, Edison vice president for planning and 
technology. But only under the Edison plan, Budhraja contends, can "all 
customers be assured that they are going to continue to get reliable service 
and get the benefits of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Improved technology and changes in federal law in recent years have allowed 
private companies other than regulated monopoly utilities to produce 
electricity. Large industrial power customers, especially, have demanded that 
this electricity be directly available in a competitive market.  
</P>
<P>
 Seeing competition as inevitable, the commission proposed deregulating much of 
the electric-power business from 1996 through 2002. Eventually, all customers 
would be able to choose a supplier. In some cases the local utility might be 
reduced to an intermediary which in effect rents customers the wiring required 
to deliver the power. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of Edison's new proposal is a regional power pool through which 
all electric power -- whether produced by a utility generating plant or a small 
private power producer in a neighboring state -- would compete for customers. 
Based on a continuous auction, the pool would set a spot price for power as 
often as every 30 minutes. Utilities, brokers or individual customers would buy 
power from the pool. San Diego Gas & Electric also wants such a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new wrinkle, however, Edison would also allow direct deals -- so-called 
bilateral contracts -- between power generators and customers outside the pool. 
But Edison doesn't believe that most customers -- particularly small-business 
and residential users -- would want to play the power market so directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would not be efficient," Budhraja said. "Four million customers couldn't 
go to a bilateral contract world. . . . To make a regional power market work, 
you have to have a system that includes the most players." 
</P>
<P>
 Planners at Pacific Gas & Electric, however, see such a power pool as 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers say we don't want to be contracting with an intermediary," said 
Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E executive vice president.  
</P>
<P>
 PG&E proposes placing only what it calls a supply coordinator between the 
customer and the power generator, to be sure that the correct voltages and 
system balances are maintained. A market would develop much as it has under 
natural gas deregulation -- through individual, bilateral deals between power 
generators and individual industrial users, or between generators and brokers 
representing groups of small businesses and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in an effort they term the Hunt for Green October, 
environmentalists have sketched out their own plan to cut electricity costs in 
a competitive market while preserving California's current support for energy 
conservation and for using wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and other renewable 
energies to make electric power. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists propose that the utilities give up all control over 
electricity generation and transmission, leaving them primarily as distributors 
of power to customers' meter boxes. Fees to continue subsidies for low-income 
customers and to encourage renewable fuels and energy conservation would be 
levied as part of the charges customers paid for the electric lines -- as 
opposed to the power that flows over the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In their plan, selling the utilities' interest in the transmission grid -- the 
interconnected network that carries power over long distances -- would release 
cash to resolve one big sticking point in any deregulation: what to do with 
existing, high-cost generating investments such as nuclear plants and older 
contracts between utilities and independent power producers.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; LOOK WHO'S HERE; WHAT'S ENTREPRENEURIAL, SMALL, 
PRIVATE AND YOUNG? THE TYPICAL L.A. COUNTY FIRM, A NEW STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare close-up glimpse at who is doing business in Southern California, a 
new study suggests that the typical company operating in Los Angeles County is 
small, private, entrepreneurial and relatively young. 
</P>
<P>
 And surprisingly healthy and optimistic, given the gyrations of the economy in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, you are more likely to find a firm whose problem is very rapid 
growth than you are to see a company that is in the depths of despair," said 
David Friedman, a lawyer and urban economist who headed the two-year effort, 
dubbed the New Economy Project, which was conducted with public and private 
funds. The project compiled a database of more than 18,500 local companies in 
six industries and followed up with in-depth surveys and interviews with nearly 
350 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerged is a snapshot of business, Los Angeles-style. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the founders of these companies dug into their own pockets 
for start-up financing. They opened here primarily for convenience, locating in 
Los Angeles because the founder already lived or worked here rather than to be 
close to companies in the same industry or to key clients and markets. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't export much. They plan to hire in the future. Their work forces are 
diverse. They train their employees themselves, having little use for 
university or government-sponsored programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest local challenges they say they face are an unfriendly regulatory 
climate and the high cost of business -- and they're pretty unhappy about 
those. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are generally self-financed entrepreneurs who are trying to find 
constantly changing and improving markets for their products," Friedman said. 
"The most successful of them have found other companies to collaborate with." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, released last week, has been embraced by the Riordan 
Administration as a companion to Los Angeles' economic development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 525 Post Production is a fast-growing part of the Los Angeles economy. Casa 
Herrera is another. Neither is pleased with what the city has had to offer it 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
 525 Post Production inhabits the glitzy world of Hollywood, music videos and 
television images. The 7-year-old company does post production -- editing, 
sound mixing, special visual effects and the like; its name refers to the 
number of scan lines on a TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Herrera manufactures equipment to make tortillas and chips, and is 
situated in an industrial area south of downtown. It was founded 44 years ago 
by a door-to-door salesman named Frank Herrera. Now, three years after his 
death, eight of his nine children work at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 At 525, business has been good despite the economy's problems, said President 
Steve Michaels, who founded the company with two other investors and with help 
from the Virgin Group, a London-based company better known for its records and 
airline. (Virgin has since purchased all of 525.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were good at what we did," Michaels said in explaining the 
company's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Herrera has benefited with the world's growing appetite for Mexican food, 
which has sent the Herreras to such far-flung places as China and Saudi Arabia 
to install machinery. Even Mexico is opening up as a market, President Al 
Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 But 525 (95 employees, $19 million in revenues) and Casa Herrera (160 
employees, $15 million-plus in revenues) have encountered roadblocks. (Both 
companies were among those surveyed as part of the New Economy Project.) 
</P>
<P>
 For 525, it is crime that scares customers away in the evening from its 1937 
Art Deco building. For Casa Herrera, it is an aging factory that is about 
one-third the size of what is needed. They say they could use some help but 
have not been able to find any. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is the big issue for us," Michaels said. "We're in a 24-hour business, 
and we lose business in the evenings because people don't want to come to 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Herrera is actively looking for a new factory and has found that other 
parts of Southern California are much more aggressive than Los Angeles in 
courting them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has kind of ignored us a little bit," Herrera said. "We would like 
to stay in Los Angeles, but it depends on what they can put on the table and 
how soon." Herrera said he considers it a good sign that he received a phone 
call from Mayor Richard Riordan last week. However, he added, the contact came 
two months after he had sought help from the city in finding a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The New Economy Project looked at firms accounting for nearly 10% of the 
county's work force in metalworking, mechanical engineering and aerospace 
subcontracting; biomedical; environmental instruments and consulting; textiles; 
computer hardware and software, and entertainment crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its finding a healthy industrial base, the study also, in its 
relatively small sample, sketches a portrait of the typical Los Angeles 
company: 96% are privately owned, and 97% have 100 or fewer employees. A 
whopping 78% were founded in Los Angeles County simply because the people were 
already here. Two-thirds of the companies started with family funds, 13% used 
bank loans, 6% used venture capital and 1% got government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 These companies plan to hire in the future. A total of 51% reported such 
plans, indicating overall an intention to increase work forces by about 14% 
during the next five years, or about 3% per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work forces are diverse: Minorities are in 32% of management positions 
and in 40% of research and development jobs. Most use internal programs to 
train employees; 11% turn to universities or local trade associations, 7% to 
California programs and 3% to federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 An average of 49% of revenues are derived locally, and an average of only 11% 
of revenues come from exports, indicating "the possibility for substantial 
regional growth if additional export encouragement or assistance was provided 
to local firms," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies' biggest general business challenges are economic: finding new 
markets (23%), regulations and the cost of doing business (15%), new product 
development (15%), access to capital (13%) and improving competitiveness (10%). 
Their biggest local challenges are unfriendly business climate (30%), the high 
cost of business (30%), declines in the quality of life (11% to 14% on each of 
the three choices in the survey) and recession and loss of confidence (11%). 
"Despite the region's still substantial economic strengths," the report notes, 
area firms "have a strikingly negative view" of the regulatory and social 
environment they operate in. Business, Los Angeles Style 
</P>
<P>
 A detailed in-depth survey of nearly 350 local firms conducted by economist 
David Friedman found an all-but-forgotten economy composed of small 
self-reliant companies that are relatively healthy and optimistic about the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why They Are Here 
</P>
<P>
 The typical Los Angeles business was started here not for proximity to 
competitors or clients or markets, but for a very simple reason: The founder 
was already here. Respondents were allowed to give more than one reason. 
Reasons Cited for Opening a Firm in Los Angeles County: Convenience (founder 
lived, was educated or worked in the region): 78% To be near companies in the 
same industry: 24 Proximity to clients and markets: 15 Growth potential -- good 
business climate: 15 Infrastructure (ports, freeways, airports, etc.): 10 
Quality of life (weather, crime, etc.): 10 Labor availability: 7 Proximity to 
suppliers: 6 Proximity to Pacific Rim: 3 To promote exports: 1 * Employment

PROS SAY MANY NASDAQ TRADES REPORTED LATE; SECURITIES: THE PRACTICE, A BLATANT 
VIOLATION OF RULES, CAN MEAN ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION. NASD SAYS IT WILL NOT 
TOLERATE PURPOSELY INACCURATE REPORTING. 
</P>

 Within minutes after the end of the trading day on Nasdaq, a peculiar thing 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Large trades -- sometimes the biggest of the day for certain stocks -- are 
suddenly reported on Nasdaq's "tape," the public running list of trades. They 
have an "s" next to them, indicating that they are being reported late. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq rules strictly require that trades be reported within 90 seconds after 
they've been executed. The only permitted excuses for not doing so are if a 
trading ticket was accidentally lost or if a dealer had a computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
 But several prominent traders for pension and mutual funds -- speaking out on 
the topic for the first time -- contend that Nasdaq market makers deliberately 
hold trades off the tape in what often amounts to illegal manipulation of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Deliberate late or false reporting, known in Wall Street lingo as "painting 
the tape," is one of the most blatant possible violations of Nasdaq rules. But 
these pension and mutual fund traders say Nasdaq is doing little to stop the 
practice. And some senior officials of the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers, which owns and operates Nasdaq, concur. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the NASD says it will not tolerate purposely inaccurate reporting. 
"I have no interest in having games played on tape reporting on Nasdaq," says 
Richard G. Ketchum, NASD chief operating officer. Nevertheless, the NASD says 
it has taken no disciplinary action for late reporting this year.

Group of mutual funds, said deliberate delays in reporting trades, especially 
large trades, occur "very frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 times in the past year, Bradley said, he has experienced market 
makers delaying the reporting of his trades on the public tape by as much as 
several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any afternoon," he added, "I can run through any 10 stocks (on Nasdaq) and 
they will have (late-reported) sales go up after the bell." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly A. Stark, senior vice president in charge of trading at New York-based 
Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher & Co., a firm that manages more than $3 billion 
for pension funds and foundations, also says the practice is pervasive. Stark 
said she was disturbed to see market makers delaying reports of trades she had 
ordered "close to a dozen times" this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the problem is the fact that large trades, once reported, tend 
to make a stock's price move. Report of a big purchase -- or even a relatively 
small one in a thinly traded stock -- can make the price jump, because other 
market makers and public investors may think there is a sudden demand for the 
shares. A big sale can drive the price down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers may have several motives for reporting a trade late. 
</P>
<P>
 If a dealer has just bought a large amount of stock, for example, he may not 
want competing dealers to know about the volume of shares he has added to his 
inventory; if they knew, he might not get as good a price for the stock when he 
goes to resell it. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, a market maker seeking to buy 50,000 shares of a stock for a 
customer might make several separate purchases along the way to complete the 
order. Instead of reporting each purchase as it occurs, as Nasdaq rules 
require, the dealer might lump them all together and report them at the end of 
the day as a single 50,000-share trade. 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping the individual purchases secret, the market maker will have avoided 
driving up the price of the stock before completing the order. (Indeed, some 
traders say, institutional investors sometimes ask market makers to improperly 
delay reporting trades made on their behalf.) 
</P>
<P>
 For individual investors, the direct effect is that they end up paying too 
much to buy or receiving too little when they sell, says Junius W. Peake, a 
University of Northern Colorado finance professor who was once vice chairman of 
the NASD's board of governors. An investor buying just after a big unreported 
sale, for example, may see the price of the shares drop when the trade is 
reported minutes or hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Inaccurate reporting of this sort is extremely rare on the New York Stock 
Exchange, veteran traders say -- in part because computers on the NYSE floor 
report trades automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior NASD officials acknowledge that deliberately late reporting of 
trades happens frequently on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 William R. Rothe, a member of the NASD board of governors, said he does not 
dispute that such improper activity "does occur" -- although he says it is 
strictly forbidden at his firm, Baltimore-based Alex. Brown & Sons, where he is 
head of over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothe said there are often legitimate reasons for reporting a series of trades 
late early in the trading day, when a mass of orders that piled up just before 
the opening may make timely reporting impossible. But he said he knows of no 
legitimate reason why there would be clusters of big trades reported late just 
after the close at 4 p.m. Eastern time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothe said the NASD has long been aware of complaints about late reporting. 
"Clearly the large trades that are reported after the close of the market as 
'sold' (market jargon for trades reported late) is something that both the 
institutions and the other market participants are not happy with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD says it routinely looks for evidence of late reporting when it 
conducts its regular examinations of market makers. However, when asked why 
many big trades are reported just after the close, Ketchum declined through a 
spokesman to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 The pervasiveness of late reporting on Nasdaq is often most evident in the 
trading of smaller stocks. A random look at relatively thinly traded stocks on 
two recent trading days turned up these examples, among others: 
</P>
<P>
 * On Oct. 14, seven of the 17 trades during market hours in Medisense Inc., a 
Waltham, Mass., maker of home testing kits for diabetics, were reported late. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also that day, 18 trades, representing 19% of the trading volume in shares 
of New York-based Winstar Communications Inc. -- some 152,700 shares -- were 
reported late. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Oct. 10, just two minutes after the close, a 15,000-share trade was 
reported late in the stock of Molex Inc. -- much larger than any of the 28 
trades that had been reported during the regular trading day. 
</P>
<P>
 * The same day, a 30,000-share trade in the stock of Intergraph Corp. was 
reported late, just after the close. That one trade represented 13% of the 
day's trading volume in Intergraph. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman James D. Spellman said the NASD would not respond to requests for 
information or comment about the incidents of late reporting. But he said the 
NASD plans to look into the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 John Chiricotti, Medisense chief financial officer, said he knew of no reason 
why so many trades were reported late in his firm's stock on Oct. 14. Nasdaq 
"doesn't tell you anything about what's going on in the trading," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clusters of big late trades, especially ones reported just after the close, 
are quite common for big Nasdaq stocks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Printouts of "time and sales" reports for one afternoon -- Oct. 14 -- show 
nine trades reported late in the six minutes after the market's close in shares 
of Microsoft Corp., the biggest company listed on Nasdaq. These included two 
very big trades, of 50,000 shares each; the others were from 1,000 to 7,000 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotus Development had 13 trades reported late just after the close that day, 
including one for 25,000 shares; MCI Communications had six reported just after 
the close. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer that day had only four late-reported trades, totaling 9,100 
shares. But on Oct. 10, a very heavy trading day for the stock, Apple had 12 
trades reported late just after the close, including one for 25,000 shares and 
another for 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Treasurer Gregory B. Maffei said he was not aware of any 
irregularities in trade reporting in the company's stock but said the firm 
would look into reports of delays in posting trades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if there are improprieties, it's a matter that concerns us," 
Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rebecca Seel, a spokeswoman for Lotus, said, "I think the point is that 
Nasdaq has its own surveillance systems, and the onus is really on them to 
track this kind of stuff." Apple spokeswoman Betty Taylor declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Securities and Exchange Commission says timely trade reporting is 
one of the most important elements of a fair, competitive securities market, it 
has done little to monitor reporting practices on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq's chief rival, formally 
urged the SEC to look into Nasdaq's trade reporting practices. But Mark D. 
Fitterman, the SEC's associate director of market regulation, confirmed that it 
never did so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never seen a systemic problem with respect to the timeliness or 
accurateness of trade reporting," Fitterman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD has the power to impose large fines and suspend market makers who 
break the trade reporting rules. Indeed, if it can be proved that the actions 
were part of a deliberate plan to affect a stock's price, market manipulation 
can be prosecuted criminally. 
</P>
<P>
 However, James M. Cangiano, the NASD senior vice president for market 
surveillance, said the organization has taken no disciplinary action this year 
for late reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cangiano also said he could not provide figures on the percentage of Nasdaq 
volume reported late so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving requests for the data from The Times two weeks ago, he said he 
had his staff instead calculate late reports for a period in mid-August. During 
that period, Cangiano said, less than 5% of the volume was reported late. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century's Bradley said he has never gotten responses from the NASD 
when he has called to complain about late reporting of his own trades. "It's 
very frustrating," he said. "They've never gotten back to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cangiano responds that although the NASD may have owed Bradley "a courtesy 
call," it is not obliged to disclose the results of its confidential 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, he said, such cases are difficult to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 If the NASD calls a market maker who reported a large trade late "and he says, 
'Oh, well, I turned on my fan and my order ticket fell on the floor, and I only 
found it at 4:05,' how do you prove that this was done willfully?" Cangiano 
said.

 A computer record of Nasdaq trading in shares of Microsoft Inc. on Oct. 14 
shows that market makers reported nine trades out of sequence -- including two 
big ones for 50,000 shares each -- after the close of trading at 4 p.m. EDT

 Home Loan Program: The city of Los Angeles and the mortgage banking unit of 
Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank Corp. are set to announce a program Thursday aimed at 
overcoming traditional barriers to home ownership in South-Central Los Angeles: 
the lack of down payments and the inability to qualify for mortgages. PNC 
Mortgage, which plans to open an office in South-Central, will offer a new 
mortgage product for consumers who do not meet traditional credit requirements, 
as well as loans that require only a 3% down payment.

 20th Century Report: 20th Century Industries of Woodland Hills is expected to 
delay the release of its third-quarter results while it works up a proxy asking 
shareholders to vote on a proposed $216-million infusion by American 
International Group of New York. AIG could end up with 43% of the 
earthquake-battered insurance company's stock. 20th Century is exiting the home 
insurance market, after seeing its quake damage claims rise steadily from less 
than $100 million -- announced the day after the Jan. 17 Northridge quake -- to 
its latest estimate of $815 million. One problem the company hasn't yet settled 
is how or when it will pay policyholders $119 million in auto insurance 
rebates, court-ordered as a result of Proposition 103.

 Economic Forecast Due: The first of the season's crop of 1995 economic outlook 
reports for Orange County will be delivered Friday at Cal State Fullerton by 
economics department Chairman Anil Puri. This is the third annual county 
forecast by the university's Institute for Economic and Environmental Studies 
and comes at a time when the signals are quite mixed.On the negative side, a 
long-awaited recovery is being threatened by a series of major plant closures 
and continued aerospace and computer industry layoffs. But state employment 
officials also say they underestimated job growth in California and that there 
may have been 200,000 more jobs created than originally thought. Against that 
backdrop, Puri will deliver his reading on the county's economic future, while 
First Interstate Bancorp economist Lynn Reaser will discuss the state and 
national forecasts.

 Whistle While You Watch: The videocassette version of Walt Disney's 1937 
classic, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," which finally goes on sale this 
week, is expected to dwarf other video sales to date.The Burbank entertainment 
giant has confirmed that it has already received a record 27 million orders 
from retailers. Some are predicting that "Snow White" could become the first 
video to break the 30-million mark in units sold, besting the 24 million units 
of "Aladdin" that Disney sold and the 22 million units of "Beauty and the 
Beast." For Walt Disney Co., the video should fatten its pre-profits by more 
than $200 million.

 FTC Gives Final OK to Adobe-Aldus Deal: The green light for the consent accord

innovation. Adobe markets the Illustrator program and Aldus the Freehand 
program, both of which are used with Apple Computer's Macintosh and Power 
Macintosh computers. Under the deal, the merged firm will sell the Freehand 
software within six months to Altsys Corp., a software maker based in

 Orange County Jobless Rates Rises: California's Employment Development 
Department reported that Orange County's unemployment rate edged up in 
September to 6%, from 5.9% in August, with several key sectors showing job 
losses.Overall, the county saw an expansion of 5,400 jobs last month from 
August, all of it seasonal, as an army of teachers and other school workers 
returned to their jobs. But a decline in payroll employment in manufacturing, 
retail trade, finance and real estate helped to lift up the county's jobless 
rate in September. The jobless rate increase contrasted with significant 
declines for the nation and the state.

 Linking of Utility Executives' Pay to Minority Advances Urged: At an annual 
review of utility efforts to increase hiring and outside contracts with women 
and minorities, Robert L. Gnaizda, general counsel to the Greenlining Coalition 
of minority and consumer organizations, Friday called for linking utilities' 
CEO salaries and bonuses to improvements in these areas. "Progress is stalling 
and, in some areas, backsliding," Gnaizda said at a hearing in Los Angeles of 
the Assembly Committee on Utilities and Commerce, chaired by Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore (D-L.A.). In one part of the coalition's "Report Card," the group rated 
progress in giving out contracts to minorities as: Southern California Edison 
B-plus, Pacific Bell B, AT&T C, PG&E C, Southern California Gas C, GTE C.

 Gasoline Prices Dip: Prices at the nation's gas pumps have dipped about a half 
cent during the past two weeks, an industry analyst said Sunday. The average 
at-the-pump price of gasoline was 120.47 cents per gallon on Friday, down 0.63 
cent from Oct. 7, said analyst Trilby Lundberg, whose newsletter conducts a 
survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide.

 Advanced Micro, Intel Agree to Preliminary Injunction: Advanced Micro Devices 
Inc. said it and Intel Corp. agreed on terms of a preliminary injunction that 
will let Advanced Micro continue to ship Am486 microprocessors under certain 
conditions. Among other things, the terms of the preliminary injunction provide 
that Advanced Micro will ship no Am486 products containing the disputed Intel 
code known as ICE microcode after Jan. 15, 1995, Advanced Micro said. Earlier 
this month, a federal magistrate ruled that Advanced Micro does not have a 
license to copy or distribute the ICE microcode.

 FileNet Corp.: Ted Smith, president and chief executive of the Costa 
Mesa-based company, was selected CEO of the Year by the Software Council of 
Southern California last week.Smith said the company had made a difficult but 
correct decision to shift its focus from computer hardware to software programs 
in recent years. The shift "was a major risk, but it's a strategy that paid 
off," Smith said. The company now focuses on business computer programs to 
manage images, data and text.

 Community Psychiatric Centers: Shares plunged $3 to $9.50 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Friday after the former Orange County company said that its 
fourth-quarter earnings would not meet analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said that we thought the estimates were too high and that, basically, 
analysts should bring them down," said Community Psychiatric Centers 
spokeswoman Suzanne S. Hovdey."We didn't discuss specific figures, and the 
fiscal year ends Nov. 30, so we won't have year-end figures until about 
January." 
</P>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric Centers, which moved its corporate headquarters to Las 
Vegas from Laguna Hills this past summer, had traded as high as $19 earlier in 
the year. About 3.5 million shares traded on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 of the company's corporate staff members are still working in Laguna 
Hills. Those employees will move to Las Vegas by early next year.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WEIGHING THE COSTS OF A VOTE FOR CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rightly or wrongly, serious investors are generally stereotyped as 
card-carrying Republicans, and most are assumed to hold dear the Republican 
principles of lower taxes, smaller government and a strong U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems logical enough to assume that if the Democrats suffer a massive 
defeat at the polls on Nov. 8 -- perhaps losing majorities in both the House 
and Senate -- Wall Street will be thrilled and markets will zoom. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, though. Many big investors, while as angry with President Clinton 
as the general population seems to be, are doubtful that a Republican sweep of 
Congress would be a panacea for stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are reasons to worry that a Republican victory could aggravate 
the already devastated bond market in the near term -- sending interest rates 
still higher -- if the GOP's insistence on a middle-class tax cut sparks fears 
of a fresh expansion of the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, even Clinton's critics admit that his handling of the economy has 
been largely commendable, or at worst non-damaging, on balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, given that Clinton is a Democrat, controlling the federal deficit 
while presiding over a growing economy may turn out to be his greatest victory 
in his first two years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 John Williams, economist at Bankers Trust in New York, estimates that the 
federal deficit in the year ended last Sept. 30 was just under $200 billion, 
down from $255 billion in 1993 and the record $290 billion of 1992. In fiscal 
1995, Williams sees the deficit tumbling to $175 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 With his package of spending cuts and tax increases in 1993, Clinton put 
deficit-reduction at the top of his economic agenda. He believed, correctly as 
it turned out, that if he cut the deficit long-term interest rates would drop, 
invigorating the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked all right, sending bond yields to 20-year lows by the fall 
of 1993 and bolstering the economy's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But part of Clinton's problem today is that his focus on the bond market's 
needs may have worked too well. The economy has been growing briskly all year, 
so much so that the Federal Reserve Board has been raising short-term interest 
rates to slow things down and keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Clinton, the federal deficit is long forgotten. Now 
investors' obsession is whether the economy is too strong, and how high 
interest rates may have to go to cool consumer and business spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the President doesn't directly control the Fed, so it's hardly fair 
of Wall Street to blame Clinton for higher short-term interest rates. If the 
question is simply whether Clinton's policies so far have been good for the 
economy, the answer is yes, many big investors admit. Officially, after all, 
stocks are still in a bull market, even if bonds aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to give Clinton good marks on the economy," says William Gross, a 
principal at giant Pacific Investment Management in Newport Beach and a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the deficit-reduction plan, Gross notes, Clinton also 
pleasantly surprised Wall Street by focusing on concluding last year's two 
major trade pacts, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the global 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Then what, exactly, is the investment community's problem with the President? 
As with the public at large, money managers have developed a nebulous but 
nagging distrust of Clinton that crowds out any constructive feelings about his 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan White, a principal at Woodside Asset Management in Menlo Park, believes 
that Clinton's grand plan for national health care reform soured Wall Street by 
threatening the creation of a huge new federal bureaucracy. That ran counter to 
Clinton's campaign pledge that he represented a "new kind of Democrat," White 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what (angered) Wall Street was Clinton's thinking that the federal 
government could run health care better than the private sector," White says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big investors say they're taking their cue from the dollar's puzzling 
weakness this year, despite the economy's strength. A sinking dollar suggests 
that foreign investors have no faith in Clinton, his critics argue, though 
they're hard-pressed to show proof of that. In any case, as long as the dollar 
stays weak, foreign investors have no incentive to buy U.S. stocks and bonds, 
keeping a critical source of demand out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 For many veteran Wall Streeters, distaste for Clinton ultimately flows from 
his management technique, or lack thereof. A lot of investors "just don't like 
his management style," says Ralph Wanger, head of the Acorn stock fund in 
Chicago. "He is inconsistent, opportunistic, and he tells everybody what they 
want to hear. He just doesn't prioritize well." 
</P>
<P>
 But would the arrival of a GOP Congress provide some dramatically positive 
offset to Clinton's weaknesses and bring buyers flocking back to bonds and 
stocks? 
</P>
<P>
 If the key plank in a GOP Congress' platform is a tax cut -- as proposed in 
the "Contract with America" pledges recently unveiled by leading Republicans -- 
it's conceivable that markets could become enthusiastic, some money pros say. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Investment's Gross argues that "lower taxes historically have been a 
positive for any country's currency," by promising a healthier economy in the 
long run. If foreigners view the United States in that light, a tax-cut pledge 
could pump up the dollar and bring foreign capital flowing into U.S. stocks and 
bonds, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Shulman, investment strategist at Salomon Bros. in New York, worries 
that the bond market will see things differently -- that lower taxes will equal 
a rising federal budget deficit if Congress and the President can't agree on 
deep spending cuts as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bond market may begin to worry about a tax-cut bill spinning out of 
control," Shulman warns. 
</P>
<P>
 For some money managers, the most encouraging thing about a Republican victory 
in November would be the neutralizing of Clinton "big ideas" like health care 
reform. "The concern is that left to his own devices, he'd be a real problem" 
for the economy's going forward, Shulman says. For the markets, gridlock isn't 
a bad word. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is a chance that voting for change will simply help investors 
feel better about the future, even if they aren't sure exactly why they should. 
That could translate into at least a short-term rally in stocks and bonds 
post-election. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just get fed up and want a change," says Jim Stack, publisher of the 
InvesTech market newsletter in Whitefish, Mont. Things could always get worse 
under Republican rule, but if people believe the status quo isn't acceptable, 
change becomes less fearful an option, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They figure, 'Without change, there's no chance of it coming out better,' " 
Stack says.

WHICH PARTY IS GOOD FOR THE MARKET? WHY NOT FLIP A COIN? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 History isn't much help if you're trying to weigh whether a Republican or 
Democratic Congress would be better for stock and bond markets. Both parties 
have -- and haven't -- been. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1919 through 1930, the Republicans had the majority of seats in both the 
House and the Senate, and they also owned the White House. The 1920s was a 
period of tremendous economic growth worldwide. In the United States, interest 
rates were flat or declining for much of that decade, commodity prices fell and 
stock prices rocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 But near the end of that decade rising prosperity fueled a speculative frenzy 
on Wall Street, which led to the stock market crash of 1929 and set the stage 
for the Depression of the 1930s. The Democrats were swept into power in the 
1932 election, taking control of both the House and Senate, as well as the 
White House (under Franklin D. Roosevelt). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, the voters turned on the Democrats and gave the Republicans a 
majority of seats in the House and Senate. But their two-year reign produced no 
bonanza for the stock market. The total return on the Standard & Poor's 
500-stock index was just 5.6% in 1947 and 5.4% in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, the Democrats returned to power in Congress. With the exception of 
Republican rule from 1953 to 1955 (on Dwight D. Eisenhower's coattails), the 
Democrats had control of both chambers until 1980. So a Democratic Congress 
presided over most of the stock market's dramatic advance in the 1950s and 
1960s -- and also over the market's stagnation in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, when Ronald Reagan took the White House, the Republicans also took a 
majority of seats in the Senate, while the House remained Democrat-controlled. 
Stocks rallied briskly in 1980 in advance of the Reagan win, then slumped in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The split Congress, with Reagan, presided over the great 1980s bull market 
that began in 1982. The Republicans surrendered their Senate majority back to 
the Democrats in the 1986 election. TOM PETRUNO

COOL INVESTOR RESPONSE TO JAPAN TOBACCO INC. THREATENS PRIVATIZATION; MARKETS: 
EVEN BEFORE CIGARETTE MAKER IS LISTED ON TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE, THE ISSUE HAS 
ALREADY FAILED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's rocky efforts at selling off government assets are lurching forward 
with preparations to offer shares in Japan Tobacco Inc. on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before Japan Tobacco -- the only company allowed to make cigarettes 
in this nation of heavy smokers -- is officially listed on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange, the issue, in effect, has already failed. It follows several similar 
privatization efforts in which stocks initially surged and then crashed. The 
poor reception last year for the listing of the government's East Japan Railway 
Co. (JR East) was widely blamed for triggering a prolonged 21% drop in the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the Japan Tobacco public listing, the government conducted a lottery 
to give certain investors the right to buy the shares in the former government 
monopoly that still enjoys broad regulatory protection. However, two-thirds of 
the lottery winners have declined to buy shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lack of enthusiasm makes it highly likely that Japan Tobacco's price -- 
now pegged at $14,600 (1.43 million yen) per share -- will fall on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably it will be a disaster," said Takefumi Suzuki, senior analyst at 
Baring Securities Ltd. "Many people, including individuals, are quite 
pessimistic, and institutional investors won't buy at that level. The price 
will go down below the 1-million (about $10,500) level eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because the market is already pessimistic about Japan Tobacco's 
prospects, there is little chance that the new listing will trigger a broad 
market plunge, similar to the drop that followed last year's JR East issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan Tobacco listing "won't have such an effect on the market because 
it's already discounted," Suzuki said. "It's clear that it's already failed." 
</P>
<P>
 The overall impact will also be lessened, analysts say, because investors are 
not as pessimistic about the economy as they were last year when JR East made 
its market debut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Finance, which is in charge of the privatization, has also 
pledged to limit the fallout from a decline in Japan Tobacco's price by 
withdrawing shares from the market if the price falls immediately after the 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry can also provide broad support for Japan Tobacco shares, and the 
general market, by instructing government pension funds and the postal savings 
system to increase their purchases of shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the government has to resort to such measures, analysts say, it would 
be a setback for the overall privatization effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The government initially planned to sell 666,666 (a third) of Japan's 
Tobacco's 2 million shares. Sales of shares to the public have so far been 
conducted in three stages. 
</P>
<P>
 First, large-lot investors, either institutions or individuals, submitted 
sealed bids for 230,000 shares. The weighted average of winning bids came out 
to $14,600. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 436,666 shares were then offered at that price to lottery 
winners. When most declined to buy, the same offer was made to lottery 
runners-up. Securities analysts say that in this second round, the purchase 
rate appears to have fallen to about 20%. That means that more than 200,000 
shares are likely to remain unsold before Thursday's listing. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan Tobacco also faces other liabilities. The anti-smoking movement is much 
weaker in Japan than in the United States (38% of Japanese smoke compared to 
25% of Americans), but concern about the health hazards of cigarettes is 
growing here. 
</P>
<P>
 A national coalition of 70 groups campaigning against smoking sent a letter in 
August to institutional investors asking them not to participate in the Japan 
Tobacco auction. The letter warned that tobacco is a declining industry and 
therefore not a good investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan Tobacco has started efforts to diversify into other fields, including 
real estate and pharmaceuticals. But sales of tobacco and cigarettes still make 
up nearly 99% of its total revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The key interest of the Finance Ministry appears to be to make as much money 
as possible from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Finance needs to raise money from privatizations "because they 
are facing an extreme shortage of funds because of the tax revenue shortfall," 
said Jesper Koll, head of market and economic research at J.P. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the government made its final decision to move forward with the Japan 
Tobacco sale, institutional investors and brokerage firms "warned the Ministry 
of Finance repeatedly, asking them to postpone the issue and wait for better 
market conditions," Koll added. "You've seen a decline in stock volumes in 
Tokyo over the past 12 months. The stock market clearly is not very strong. An 
increase in new issues is likely to be a dampener." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with so many investors declining their rights to purchase shares, "the 
big loser is the Ministry of Finance," Koll said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ministry is forced to hold back shares, it will make nearly $3 billion 
less than it expected to gain from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big loser may be the government-held JR West, another spinoff company 
from the former Japan National Railways system, which expects to go public 
early next year.

 Small Firms Hampered by Yen's Strength: Only 5% of Japan's small companies say 
they can break even if the yen remains at between 95 and 100 to the dollar, 
according to a survey by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency. In 
mid-September, the ministry surveyed 137 small export-dependent companies and 
550 other small companies nationwide.Asked at which exchange rate they can 
break even, 28.8% of the firms said the 105-110 yen level and 18.6% said the 
115-120 yen level. None said it could make a profit if the dollar falls below 
90 yen. Companies are trying to counter the yen's strength by increasing 
domestic sales, cutting costs and developing new products, the survey said. The 
dollar finished at 96.68 yen in Tokyo trading on Friday.

HE SHAKES SACRAMENTO'S BRANCHES FOR NEW SCHOOLS; MOORPARK: SUPT. TOM DUFFY'S 
LATEST COUP WAS GETTING $14 MILLION TO BUILD MESA VERDE. SOME WONDER IF THE 
MASTER OF BUREAUCRACY IS SELLING CURRICULUM AND TEACHERS SHORT.

<P>
 He is Moorpark's man in Sacramento. Not so much a wheeler-dealer, but an 
insider who knows the rules when it comes to finding money for his schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In these times of huge state budget deficits, Moorpark School Supt. Tom Duffy, 
46, has pulled more than $55 million out of Sacramento to help pay for seven of 
his district's nine schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest coup was $14 million delivered for the construction of what many 
parents and school officials are calling the crown jewel of the district, Mesa 
Verde Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched on a ridgeline, the newly opened school boasts some of the best views 
in the city. Its 20-acre lot alone cost $6.5 million. The state paid for 
everything -- for the land and the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the degree of Duffy's success is difficult to gauge precisely, because no 
other local district grew as quickly as Moorpark during the 1980s boom, said 
Ken Prosser, business services director for the county schools office. And 
growth is the most important factor in securing state construction money. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Oak Park came close to Moorpark's fivefold student increase in recent 
years, Prosser said. But because Oak Park voters approved a tax hike for school 
construction, that district never had to depend on state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're just looking at a dollars-and-cents comparison, it isn't going to 
mean much," Prosser said. "Every school district is different -- different 
sizes and different growth rates. But if you start calling around, not just 
locally but statewide, and ask people who they think is the most knowledgeable 
about state financing, I bet they'll mention Tom Duffy's name." 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade, Moorpark was one of the state's fastest-growing cities. In 1988, 
Duffy's first year as superintendent, school enrollment surged by 24%. Although 
the district is still relatively small with 6,100 students, the early growth 
helped Moorpark qualify for state funding -- and that bolstered Duffy's 
stature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Duffy has a statewide reputation," said Alicia Cruz, school district 
planning director in Poway near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Poway district has grown nearly as fast as Moorpark's. But Cruz said her 
district, which is five times as large as Moorpark's, received only about twice 
as much state construction money over the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom understands the very complex process of state financing," she said. "He 
knows the right people, and he's willing to help other districts. I've been to 
several workshops that he has conducted. I think he's a mentor for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Moorpark district receives some money from fees charged for each 
new house, it has relied on the state to pay for new schools partly because 
local voters rejected a $25.5-million bond issue in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, the district has had to show that enrollment is overtaking 
classroom space. Once it qualifies, the district enters a complex application 
process laid out in state law. A study done by Price Waterhouse of that process 
showed 54 steps through four separate state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a growth spurt like Moorpark did, you have to refocus your 
attention as superintendent," said Shirley Carpenter, superintendent of the 
Pleasant Valley school district in Camarillo. "You need to be up there in 
Sacramento or have someone up there for you to dog these requests, or you won't 
get the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy said he travels to Sacramento about once a month, pulling the levers of 
the state funding apparatus. For that, Duffy has sometimes been criticized by 
school board members for being out of the district too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Clint Harper has questioned Duffy's frequent trips to the state 
capital, but he does not complain much because of the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any other district in the county that has been able to get 
the kind of consistent funding that we have had for new site development," 
Harper said. "Quite frankly, we are in awe of his ability to get state 
funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have also wondered aloud about whether Duffy's focus on state 
financing detracts from his support of teachers and an innovative curriculum 
for students -- the true business of a school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say curriculum is not his primary interest," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gillis, president of the Moorpark teachers union, declined to comment 
on Duffy because teachers are in protracted contract negotiations. But Gillis 
has previously criticized Duffy for finding construction money but not coming 
through for teachers, who have gone four years without a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics have accused Duffy of manipulating the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tom Duffy is very controlling," said Eloise Brown, a former City 
Council member who worked for years as a liaison between the council and the 
school board. "He's an individual who feels his decisions are more valid than 
ones the board might make." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that Duffy seems to purposely confuse the board members with 
sometimes long-winded, jargon-laden explanations of school policy. But that 
might be more a symptom of Duffy's time spent working with government 
bureaucrats than a calculated plan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy bristles at accusations that he puts students' education second. 
</P>
<P>
 He insists that his search for state money has not been at the expense of 
classroom instruction. While he has focused on state funding, a team of 
administrators he picked has worked to improve curriculum, using team teaching 
and computer technology and providing money for creative new programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a premier district here," he said. "I think Moorpark has gone from 
being a sort of small backwater district to one of the best in the county. . . 
. My job is to ensure that we have the right people and the right resources. 
That's what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy cites the district's SAT scores, which put it in the upper 25% of 
schools statewide, as an example of how well students are doing. He also notes 
that Moorpark students won last year's countywide academic decathlon and came 
in second and third the two years before that. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy agrees that his strength is his business acumen. It has been that way 
from the beginning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He first showed an aptitude at wading through the morass of bureaucratic rules 
while working in the county superintendent of schools' business office in the 
early 1980s, Supt. Charles Weis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He entered into school administration from the business side, and I think 
that's where he's excelled," Weis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy worked for the county schools office part time at first, while teaching 
special education classes. In 1985, Moorpark hired him away as an assistant 
superintendent. By late 1987 he was the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy, an athletic man who still has his arm in a sling recovering from a 
rock-climbing accident, learned the process of state funding while getting a 
doctorate from USC in school administration and finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized early on that, with the limited amount of money available after 
Proposition 13, I would have to learn everything I could to be successful," he 
said, referring to the 1978 ballot initiative that slashed property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 During this learning period Duffy has worked both in and out of government. He 
spent time at legislative committees that wrote school funding policy. He has 
also worked with other committees that made sure school funds were spent 
properly. And he was a professional lobbyist: He is a past chairman of the 
Sacramento advocacy group Coalition for Adequate School Housing (CASH), which 
lobbies for more state construction money. 
</P>
<P>
 Billions of dollars are spent building and maintaining schools in California. 
Many local school districts pay for construction with state bond money, which 
is allocated under strict rules under a 1976 law. The state Allocation Board, a 
panel of six legislators and other state officials, reviews the applications 
and decides which districts qualify for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) is the chairman of the board -- and Tom 
Duffy's friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money only goes to where it is needed," Greene said. "But there are a 
number of hoops you have to go through to qualify. Tom Duffy has been 
successful because he has always done his homework. He has the facts and 
figures and he is able to answer questions where others might stumble. The only 
magic he has to getting state funding is his own knowledge of the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's pace of growth is slowing to levels on a par with other districts 
in the county, and school construction has also abated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Duffy still expects to get about $3 million next year from the state to 
modernize Chaparral Middle School. He also plans to build a new elementary 
school at old Moorpark Memorial High School. That would cost about $6 million, 
and Duffy expects to get half from the state and the other half by selling part 
of the high school campus to a developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't know how to ask for the money, you're not going to get it," he 
said. Construction Funding for Moorpark Schools 04,26,12,14,14 School Year

CRIME AND THE ELDERLY OF L.A.; VIOLENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE; HARRY BROWN; 
'THE MOST WONDERFUL, GENTLE PERSON'

<P>
 Delores Lyon had been a widow for three years when she met Harry Rainford 
Brown at a senior citizens dance. "Gentlemen would ask me to dance," the 
66-year-old woman said, "but I wouldn't go out with them." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lyon met Brown on that night three years ago, however, she was 
immediately smitten. The tanned, debonair man of 81 was an accomplished dancer 
and had a smile that opened her heart. The pair were soon engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a retired ink salesman and a widower from Whittier, led an active life 
of golf, shooting pool, painting pictures, swimming with his grandchildren and 
traveling. He and his fiancee danced and traveled the world: New Zealand, 
Thailand, Japan, the British Isles and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like God had sent him," Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago this month, Brown and Lyon attended a performance of "Evita" at the 
Wilshire Ebell Theatre. The event was an AIDS benefit, so Brown was wearing a 
small red ribbon on his lapel when the couple set off for an after-theater 
reception on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 After parking on a side street, the couple got out of the car. When Lyon 
looked down the street, she saw two young men coming their way. There was 
something about their walk and the way they scanned the street that worried 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked back and said, 'Harry, let's hurry,' " Lyon recalled. "I said, 
'They're coming fast, let's get going.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A younger, quicker couple may have reached the relative safety of busy 
Wilshire. But Brown and Lyon were not young, nor were they fast. Brown was 
hampered by a bad knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon had crossed the street and was shouting for help when one of the young 
men reached her. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't stop screaming, you're going to get this," he warned, displaying 
what looked like a switchblade. Lyon fainted but was quickly roused by the 
sound of gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Oh, it's so quiet,' and I heard, 'Bang-bang-bang.' And I said, 
'No, not Harry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Brown was shot three times -- in the abdomen, the shoulder and the 
wrist. He died nine days later in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers stole Lyon's purse containing $35 and credit cards; they took 
nothing from Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the true outrage," said Brown's son, Skip, "is that they were not 
allowed to live their life in peace. He paid his dues and he got it taken away 
from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice widowed, Delores Lyon is trying to go on with her life. But she isn't 
yet sure how. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was," she said, "the most wonderful, gentle person in the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no suspects in the murder.

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: ON HEART RATES, DRIVEN PERSONALITIES AND COMMUTER 
STRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's official: Bad traffic can be hazardous to your health. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientific studies show it can make you crabbier, make you more easily 
frustrated, make you drive more impatiently and make your blood pressure rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised? 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it's not exactly a cure for cancer or the common cold. It doesn't take 
a rocket scientist to figure out that gridlock is a bummer. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does take a psychologist at one of Southern California's most respected 
educational institutions to put the imprimatur of serious academic inquiry on 
what seems like basic intuition to most of us Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 15 years, UC Irvine Prof. Raymond W. Novaco has examined the 
effects of commuter stress in studies that may be unique in the United States. 
His monographs demonstrate that long commutes can intensify negative feelings, 
lead to lower productivity in the office and even make us sick. 
</P>
<P>
 In less obvious findings, Novaco has also discovered that heart rate is not 
affected by traffic, women get more stressed than men on the daily drive, and, 
in a twist on pop psychology, Type B personalities -- the more mellow folks -- 
become more agitated in traffic than Type A control freaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 True, not everyone is impressed with such scholarship, especially its more 
predictable aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like saying if there's increased crime in your neighborhood, you're 
going to be more frightened," says Santa Monica psychiatrist Mark Goulston. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the first suggestion that he studies the self-evident, Novaco bristles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you know there aren't heart-rate effects? Would you know there aren't 
positive-mood effects?" he says testily, challenging a reporter to "bring your 
bank account" and bet on the outcome of his next study if the results of 
commuting stress seem so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 By "positive-mood effects," Novaco means the curious finding that if you leave 
in a happy frame of mind, a bad commute isn't likely to sour you. But if your 
temper is already worn thin by the kids or the job or Robert L. Shapiro or 
Marcia Clark, traffic congestion will further blacken your mood, especially at 
the end of the day, the peak commute-stress time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Sediva believes that. 
</P>
<P>
 Sediva, owner of a Downtown publishing business, endures a daily 22-mile 
commute between his office and his Hacienda Heights home. On some nights, it 
can take Sediva more than an hour to reach his front door, in a mood bordering 
on antisocial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get home on those days, I go up to my room, I turn on the TV, I lay down on 
the bed and I stay there by myself," he says. "I've got a son who comes home at 
that time eager to talk about anything, and I don't want to hear it. And then I 
feel guilty about the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sediva notices physical effects, too -- or at least psychosomatic ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do make it home at a good pace, you can almost bounce out of the 
car. But when it takes that long, it just seems that . . . every bone in your 
body starts hurting. It's not a physical thing. It's just something in your 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of it is purely psychological, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Novaco's research shows that the farther the commute, the higher the blood 
pressure of the commuter, although the heart rate stayed constant. Subjects 
with frustrating commutes experienced a higher incidence of illness and chest 
pain. Also, the more roads a person takes during the commute, the more likely 
he or she is to call in sick. 
</P>
<P>
 People will change jobs because of a bad commute. That, coupled with reduced 
productivity and morale from transportation stress, might make it wise for 
companies to sponsor alternative ways for employees to get to work, like 
ride-sharing, says Novaco. In fact, ride sharers report lower blood pressure 
than solo drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 So how long does it take Novaco himself to drive from home to work at UCI? 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight minutes or less," he says. "It'd be a total waste of time to spend an 
hour in the car. It has a bad effect on me when I have to drive to Downtown 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more intriguing findings in Novaco's studies are the differences 
between personality types and between the sexes in coping with the daily 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
 Women don't do well. Although in Novaco's study groups they had the highest 
household incomes and greatest levels of involvement in their jobs, women who 
drive alone are the most prone to commuting stress and feel the most rushed in 
the morning getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 This might have something to do with the many competing demands women must 
juggle at home and the office, but -- at least to Novaco -- "that remains 
unclear." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular logic, Type B personalities, people who tend to go with 
the flow, also fare worse in gridlock than their more uptight Type A 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrist Goulston hypothesizes that Type A folks approach traffic with the 
same wound-up style they confront the rest of life with. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of their life's like a pressure cooker, and a traffic jam is just 
like a pressure cooker. They tolerate it better," Goulston says. "Whereas for a 
Type B personality, who does everything in moderation, a traffic jam is not 
like the rest of their life. It's like an immersion into a Type A type of 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Novaco notes that Type A people also try to optimize their commuting 
environment by listening to educational tapes or installing a car phone to 
maximize the drive time. 
</P>
<P>
 But of course there are exceptions. As a solo woman driver, Dawn Reisner of 
Bellflower falls into the highest stress category. But the 20-mile drive to her 
job selling men's suits at the Redondo Beach Nordstrom doesn't faze her. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can do about it," says Reisner. "No reason to have any more 
gray hair than I have now."

CRIME AND THE ELDERLY OF L.A. ; VIOLENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 These were supposed to be the Golden Years -- a time for pleasures deferred, 
for enjoying the rewards of a lifetime of hard work. But for many of Los 
Angeles' elderly residents, old age has become a time of vulnerability and 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Although anxiety about crime has permeated all segments of the population, the 
elderly have been especially unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
 They know that a violent encounter -- one that a younger person could easily 
survive -- may end lethally for them: A purse-snatching becomes a homicide when 
an old woman falls to the pavement and dies in the hospital; an old man is 
brutalized and dies when he loses his will to live; an elderly couple are 
unable to flee their home during an arson fire, dying in the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such incidents make up just a small fraction of Los Angeles County's 
more than 1,000 annual homicides, each one packs a crippling psychological blow 
for senior citizens everywhere, who feel particularly susceptible to 
victimization. As Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen of the Glendale Police Department put 
it: "Many of our elders become prisoners in their own homes. They're locked in 
behind bars on their windows and afraid to go to the store." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Los Angeles senior citizens were once again reminded of 
their vulnerability when two Van Nuys women in their 70s were murdered within 
days of each other, one beaten to death, the other stabbed. The slayings 
prompted Councilman Joel Wachs last week to push for beefed-up police patrols 
in areas where elderly people live and congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear of crime has gripped all Angelenos," Wachs said, "but none more 
noticeably than our senior citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that the rate of violent crime in Los Angeles and throughout the 
nation is declining and that elderly people are actually less likely to be 
targeted than other age groups. Still, that hopeful trend offers little comfort 
to the families and friends of those being robbed of their final years by 
society's criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's records show that in 1993, 92 people over the age of 60 were 
murdered in Los Angeles County, a number that authorities say has remained 
relatively constant. Amid those impersonal statistics are the stories of good 
people who, in the words of one veteran detective, led "honorable lives." Eight 
of those lives are remembered here today.

 The neighborhood children gave her valentines. She was the sweet old woman in

 Eighty-year-old Doris Osterhold lived a quiet, ordered life: gardening around 
the house, dinner with friends a couple times a week and, always, church on

 So when Osterhold didn't show up at Kingdom Hall for Jehovah's Witness 
services, her friends became concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Dossey and his wife decided to check on her. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived at Osterhold's house about 4:30 p.m., the signs were 
ominous. Osterhold's bucket and rake were lying in the yard. There was blood on 
a rock wall leading up to the porch. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the door with a spare key, the Dosseys discovered their friend lying 
dead on the couch, strangled or smothered. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been stripped from the waist down and her blouse was open. Her knees 
were bloody, apparently from being dragged from her beloved garden into the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't have been much of a struggle. The elderly woman was no bigger than 
a child, less than 5 feet tall, weighing 80 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was kind of quiet and reserved," Dossey said. "She was not abrasive or 
talkative. She was real, real nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised by an overly protective aunt and uncle, Osterhold never married. 
</P>
<P>
 Until her retirement, she worked in a newspaper office and lived alone in the 
old house that her aunt and uncle had left to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterhold lived modestly, driving a 1956 Chevrolet that a friend kept in 
running condition for her. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was comfortable, always had plenty of food and other necessities and 
could afford to dine out regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 And she had her garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, her house stands empty, the flowers and shrubs dying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the plants are dry," said 9-year-old Damian Calderon, who lives next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "And she used to take good care. . . . She was always nice and kind," the 
child added. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no suspects in Osterhold's murder.

CROWDED CITY COUNCIL RACE SIGNALS THE END OF AN ERA; PORT HUENEME: FOURTEEN VIE 
FOR 3 SEATS BEING VACATED BY VETERANS. THEY HOLD WIDELY DIVERGENT VIEWS ON 
BUILDING AN OCEANSIDE RV PARK AND THE FUTURE OF THE POLICE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT and CHRISTINA LIMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past two decades, City Hall elections in Port Hueneme have been 
predictable. The same men ran for the same seats year after year. And voters in 
the tiny seaside town gladly put them back in office. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, that pattern has changed dramatically. There are 14 candidates 
vying for three seats being vacated by longtime council members. And many of 
them hold widely divergent views about how the city should be run. 
</P>
<P>
 With a majority of the five-seat council up for grabs, the outcome of the 
election could chart the city's course for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could change the complexion and vision of the city," said Alvah Ingersoll, 
a candidate and longtime community activist. "It is certainly critical to the 
direction our city takes." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years the normally sleepy city has erupted in controversy over 
several issues. The most heated and prolonged debate has focused on a city 
proposal to add cash to the treasury by building a $2-million oceanfront 
recreational-vehicle park. 
</P>
<P>
 But other hot topics are swirling around this election, the candidates say. 
They include a proposal to disband the city's Police Department to save money, 
a debate over taxes and arguments about whether City Manager Richard Velthoen 
wields too much power. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is set against a sagging economy that has forced virtually every 
city in California, including Port Hueneme, to search for new ways to pay for 
municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Dorill B. Wright, with 24 years on the council, Ken Hess, a 12-year 
veteran, and James Daniels, an eight-year councilman, announced they would 
retire this year, candidates rushed forward to fill the open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most divisive issue is the proposed recreational-vehicle resort. 
City leaders in 1991 suggested building the park on a city-owned lot at the 
southern edge of Hueneme Beach as a way to generate $400,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing environmental concerns, however, the California Coastal Commission 
earlier this year refused to approve the project. The issue has remained open 
because the City Council voted last week to resubmit the plan with 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision angered residents opposed to the resort and unleashed a torrent 
of opinions among council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the candidates -- Anthony Volante, Terry Bruno, Reno Carter, Jim 
Gilmer, Frank McElfish and Valorie Morrison -- support the idea of building an 
RV resort as a way to bring money to the cash-strapped city. 
</P>
<P>
 Another eight -- Ingersoll, Robert Turner, Robert Stovall, David Goodman, Jon 
Sharkey, Ernest Brown, Billy Kimberling and Madeline White -- say they are 
opposed to the concept for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 67, a certified public accountant who owns a condominium near the site 
of the proposed RV park, said he wants the land to remain undeveloped. Brown 
said he will improve management of the city's $13-million budget so it remains 
within cost constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruno, 45, said his top priority is stemming crime in the city. His goal is 
for Port Hueneme to have one of the lowest crime rates of cities in the county, 
Bruno said. The city had a lower crime rate than the county as a whole last 
year, but trailed the cities of Camarillo, Moorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the city has had eight homicides during the past three years, many 
more than in previous years, the candidate said he will do whatever he can to 
keep the city's Police Department intact. He also advocates forming 
Neighborhood Watch patrols, Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Carter, 45, also hopes to keep the city's Police Department 
running. The house painter has lived in Port Hueneme for 20 years and said he 
thinks city government has done a good job transforming the once-blighted 
oceanside area into a serene setting of condominiums, houses, a cultural center 
and a fishing pier. 
</P>
<P>
 He supports dismantling a beach assessment district that taxes homeowners who 
live nearest to the ocean, Carter said. He would rather see such a tax applied 
citywide, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmer said his focus is to provide more educational and recreational 
opportunities for the city's lower-income children. The former director of the 
now-defunct Zoe Christian Center in Oxnard, Gilmer said he is concerned that 
teen-agers are graduating from high school without the skills needed to succeed 
in today's society. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmer, 40, who is African American, said he would also bring diversity to a 
council that has long been dominated by older white males. Another goal is to 
increase the city's housing stock for low-income residents, Gilmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingersoll said he would consider the option of contracting with the county for 
Sheriff's Department services if the city is not capable of supporting its own 
Police Department. It was wrong for the council to recently approve a 4% 
utility tax to pay for police services after a public measure on the issue was 
shot down at the polls, Ingersoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingersoll, 64, also is interested in reorganizing a city staff that has been 
decimated by cost cuts and retirements during the past three years. He would 
use money saved by contracting for police services to help hire new city staff, 
Ingersoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling, 67, agrees that the RV park proposal should be dropped. If 
elected, his priority will be to "reunite the city," which Kimberling believes 
has been torn apart by the RV controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling supports contracting with the Sheriff's Department and said he will 
work to "trim the fat" from city budgets instead of imposing new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 McElfish said he wants to protect city revenues from any further invasion by 
the state. The 46-year-old works for Symtech in Camarillo, which sells 
engineering services to defense-related industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides protecting revenues, McElfish wants to beef up the city's General Fund 
by finding entrepreneurial ways for the city to make money. The RV park is one 
idea that has merit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison said her main objective is to keep the local Police Department 
running. She supports continuing the utility tax to pay for police until 
another venture brings in cash, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-year-old owner of a bait and tackle shop at the foot of Port Hueneme 
Pier, Morrison said she also wants to continue assessment districts that pay 
for maintenance of city parks and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 White, a 59-year-old tax preparer, thinks the RV issue should be put to rest. 
A city with 22,000 residents should not waste so much time, money and effort on 
a recreational project, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The RV park controversy has factionalized the city and Velthoen must take much 
of the blame, White said. If elected, she will examine existing assessment 
districts and the utility tax to see if the city can balance its budget without 
them, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volante, 59, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel, said he wants to increase city 
revenues by attracting more tourists and businesses to Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will also work closely with the chamber of commerce, the port 
district and Port Hueneme naval base to increase commercial opportunities 
within the city. Another goal is to retain the city's police force, Volante 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, 52, a dentist, said his main goal is to attract more small businesses, 
such as telecommunications firms, to Port Hueneme. To increases sales tax 
revenues, he would lobby for funds to provide freeway access to Port Hueneme 
through the Rice Road corridor, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, a former commissioner on the Port of Hueneme port district, said he 
also would work to improve relations between city and port officials. He is 
opposed to the RV park because he thinks it would be a poor investment for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall supports keeping the Police Department and would retain the utility 
tax to pay for it. The 39-year-old pipefitter said he also wants to attract 
more businesses to Port Hueneme as a way to increase tourism and bolster sales 
tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not support the RV resort under any circumstance, Stovall said, 
because he does not believe it will solve the city's funding problems. He wants 
to work closely with a county committee that is lobbying Washington, D.C., to 
keep the local naval bases open, Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, a 33-year-old beekeeper, said he decided to run for office because he 
was concerned about the city's dogged determination to pursue the RV resort in 
the face of heated opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman wants to form a task force of city leaders and residents to 
investigate other ways to generate revenue for the city. He is opposed to the 
beach assessment district, but thinks the utility tax is necessary to retain 
the city's Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The former probation officer also wants to curtail gang and graffiti problems, 
and advocates requiring parents of convicted taggers to pay for graffiti 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey, 45, said he supports building a city-owned reverse-osmosis 
desalination plant because it could raise cash for the city. The 
entertainment-industry technician said charging other communities for use of 
the water-treatment plant may allow the city to eventually phase out the 
utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey favors signing a joint-powers agreement with the city of Oxnard for 
police services as a way to save on costs. And he wants to draw more commercial 
investment to build a stronger local economy.

STREET SMART: YIELD SIGNS, THOUGH ODD, NECESSARY FOR ODD INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm confused about who has the right of way at Via Baja and Via Plaza in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 This intersection is unusual, because instead of stop signs there are yield 
signs on each corner. These signs seem to confuse just about everybody who 
drives through. 
</P>
<P>
 Why this odd signage, and who has the right of way? 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Hoff, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The signage is odd, admits traffic engineer Nazir Lalani. But it is the best 
way the city has figured out to deal with the T-shaped intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic workers tried installing a stop sign on Via Plaza, but the road is so 
short -- just a few hundred feet -- that cars sometimes had a hard time coming 
to a complete stop by the time they got to the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic flow has increased dramatically at this intersection in recent 
months, probably because cars are seeking an alternate route to Kimball Road, 
which has been closed intermittently for major repairs, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 He promises that once the Kimball Road repairs are completed, the city will 
reassess traffic at Via Baja and Via Plaza and decide if the signage should be 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding protocol at yield signs, it's the same as at stop signs: Whoever 
gets to the intersection first has the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 The only difference is that, unlike intersections with stop signs, if no other 
cars are present at the yield sign intersection, vehicles can pass through 
without stopping. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I appreciate your response to my question in the Sept. 19 Street Smart column 
concerning the very long red light at Telephone Road and Johnson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I was not entirely satisfied with the response. 
</P>
<P>
 You quote a traffic engineer who says that the signal stays red for so long 
because of heavy traffic, which he claims lasts from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it hard to believe that the traffic flow remains at a high volume for 
that entire 13-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this same theory apply to other major intersections around the city? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the city traffic engineer insists that at no time during the signal 
cycle is traffic in all four directions at a complete standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree. I suggest you check this intersection for yourself, and you will 
find that all traffic does come to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 This might do away with glib non-answers, although they are probably good 
enough for government work. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Crosser, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura traffic engineer Nazir Lalani says he is sorry if he seemed glib in 
his response to your question. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact remains, however, that traffic does stay heavy for most of the day at 
major intersections throughout Ventura, Lalani says. That is why signals 
operate on cycles that are nearly two minutes long during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the pause in the traffic flow, you are right. All traffic does come to 
a complete halt for two seconds out of every 110-second signal cycle, Lalani 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all seen the crazy drivers who speed through the intersection after the 
light has turned red," Lalani says. "Adding a two-second pause before the light 
turns green for cross traffic helps cut down on accidents." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Each Sunday I check the Road Work box provided by The Times to find out if I 
need to alter my regular commute from Moorpark to Simi Valley to avoid delays. 
</P>
<P>
 I also make frequent trips to Thousand Oaks. But to my dismay that city is 
never listed in the box, even when there is major road work going on around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 I lived in Thousand Oaks for 15 years, so I'm very much aware that it is not a 
little town. 
</P>
<P>
 Please tell me, why isn't Thousand Oaks included in the list? 
</P>
<P>
 Krista Muhe, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Street Smart wants your driving experience to be as painless as possible and 
is pleased to learn that you find the Road Work box a helpful guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the omission of Thousand Oaks from the list, traffic engineer John 
Helliwell says he will begin alerting Street Smart of major road projects, so 
that his city can be included in the Road Work list. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, expect major road work on Thousand Oaks Boulevard and on 
Erbes Road.

FAMILY-STYLE FINALE; SNEAKERS REPLACE SEQUINS AT CIVIC ARTS PLAZA FESTIVITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lovers of the arts traded in their tuxedos and sequined gowns Sunday for jeans 
and shorts as hundreds of families joined the finale of the three-day grand 
opening of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the glitz of grand-opening concerts on Friday and Saturday 
evenings, the Sunday arts festival maintained an exclusively low-key air. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller Genuine Draft replaced champagne in the outdoor bar, chocolate-chip 
cookies aced out miniature cream puffs on the snack tables, and Mickey Mouse 
took over hosting duties from a tuxedo-clad mime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a kid person, so I prefer this," said Thousand Oaks Arts Commissioner 
Karen LaFleur. "Plus, I get to wear these shoes," she added, pointing to her 
well-used sneakers. "I hate girl shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 While tickets for the grand-opening concerts cost $25 to $100, most of 
Sunday's activities were free or very inexpensive. Visitors wandered past 
crafts booths crammed with paint-smeared children, a towering lion made from 
10,000 aluminum cans and an art show stretching across the newly seeded lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2 p.m., a Community Showcase in the main auditorium attracted a sell-out 
crowd of 1,800 who paid $5 each for their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched with an enthusiastic rendition of "There's No Business Like Show 
Business," the performance featured half a dozen local groups singing and 
dancing on the same stage that had hosted Broadway veteran Bernadette Peters 
the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks resident Dawn Feeney said she enjoyed the casual and friendly 
atmosphere of the arts plaza on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel good that it's in Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 As she spoke, Feeney scanned the ground outside the Civic Arts Plaza, looking 
for the ceramic tile that her 6-year-old daughter Zara had painted during a 
city program this summer. Zara's artwork was among the 1,500 child-decorated 
tiles scattered along the park's meandering walkway. The tiles were dedicated 
Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 While children focused on outdoor fun, adults clustered inside the Civic Arts 
Plaza during an open house at the $64-million facility, which houses both the 
theater and a new government center. Nibbling on cookies, visitors toured the 
new City Hall -- some with delight, some with dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 The stark, industrial look of several department offices at the basement level 
surprised some visitors. Despite city staff's effort to warm the atmosphere 
with plants and balloons, several residents described the exposed concrete 
walls as too austere. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction is that it looks unfinished," Thousand Oaks resident Mort 
Tomashoff said, after glimpsing the basement, where steel support rods peek 
through the concrete walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The layout of the entire complex drew a few complaints. With so many guests 
arriving and leaving throughout the day, the parking garage was continuously 
busy and crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting into the place seems a little awkward," resident Bill Auda said, 
peering from the top of the five-story garage. "We have to go all the way down, 
walk over (to the auditorium) and then go all the way back up to the balcony." 
</P>
<P>
 To top it off, the auditorium's main elevator broke Sunday just before the 
Community Showcase. Patrons had to either walk two long flights to the balcony 
or settle for a seat in the soundproof viewing booth on the orchestra level. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, each minor complaint seemed counterbalanced by lavish compliments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Sherwood resident Jennifer Lee summed up many visitors' feelings with a 
broad grin and a few words. Stretching out on a low outdoor wall, gazing toward 
the reflecting pool, Lee said simply: "I love it."

CRIME AND THE ELDERLY OF L.A.; VIOLENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE; ELIZABETH HOLT; 
'SHE NEVER THOUGHT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER . . .' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was Christmas Eve and Elizabeth Holt was eager to buy a last-minute gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The 78-year-old retired file clerk from Torrance had been invited to the home 
of a relative for dinner on Christmas Day and didn't want to arrive 
empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt had just recovered from a broken wrist, which she had suffered in a fall, 
and was finally able to drive again. She left home early that morning, hoping 
to beat the holiday shopping crowd. It was only 9 a.m. when she pulled her 
Dodge Colt into the parking lot of Del Amo Fashion Center, several blocks from 
her apartment. With her purse over her shoulder, she hurried toward the See's 
Candy store. 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-ager, who had been sitting in a van in the parking lot, ran up behind 
Holt, yanked her purse from her arm and shoved the elderly woman to the 
pavement, according to police. Holt's purse contained $40 and some credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 A younger person almost certainly would have recovered from the injuries 
suffered in such an incident. But Holt's bones had become fragile with age, and 
so her pelvis was broken and her shoulder was dislocated. She also suffered a 
severe head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt briefly regained consciousness in the hospital and spoke to a neighbor, 
Joan Williams, who had become a surrogate daughter to the elderly woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really upset," Williams said. "She never thought something like that 
would happen to her. . . . She was really a trusting person." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after speaking to her friend, Holt fell into a coma. On Jan. 5, she 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Yoon, 19, has been charged with murder-robbery in connection with Holt's 
death and is scheduled to stand trial Oct. 31. Damian Cogan, 18, a passenger in 
the van, pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old girl who drove the van admitted to robbery in Juvenile Court, 
but her sentence was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crime is absolutely despicable," said Denis Petty, head deputy district 
attorney in Torrance. "They were picking on a particularly vulnerable victim."

CRIME AND THE ELDERLY OF L.A.; VIOLENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE; OTTO HILL; 'I

 Otto Hill was an amateur boxer in his youth, and the tough little guy from 
Oklahoma could always handle himself. So he wasn't worried when neighbors in 
his Whittier apartment complex warned that they had heard that someone was 
planning to mug him. "I don't give a damn," he snapped. "I'll take 'em to the 
park." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hill was 72 and did not appreciate that even the toughest of life's 
customers can be slowed by age -- a fact that his assailants apparently 
understood well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they thought he was too old to take care of himself," said close 
friend and neighbor Mary Kline. "And I guess he was." 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers came pounding on his door at 2:40 a.m. in December. 
</P>
<P>
 They knew he had cash, neighbors say, because Hill, who did maintenance at the 
apartment building where he lived, would flash a wad of money and peel off 
bills for almost anyone who asked. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill and his wife, Verna, were awakened by the pounding, he pulled on a 
bathrobe and went to the door. Apparently unafraid, he left a .38-caliber 
revolver in a bedside table drawer. When he opened the front door, two young 
men, one of them with a BB pistol, pushed their way inside and a struggle 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 Overmatched, Otto shouted to his wife: "Get the gun!" 
</P>
<P>
 Verna grabbed the revolver from the bedside table but, at 76 years old, she 
had fallen victim to arthritis and apparently was unable to handle the heavy 
weapon. "We play cards a lot," Kline said, "and she can't even shuffle the 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the intruders rushed into the bedroom, snatched the gun from Verna and 
threw her across the room. She fell to the floor, shattering an elbow. Before 
she could get up, Verna heard a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto died on his living room floor from a single gunshot wound to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Garrison, 25, and Franklin J. Rardin, 20, were charged with murder, 
robbery and burglary in connection with Hill's death and are awaiting trial. 
Rardin, who testified that he had been duped into accompanying Garrison to 
Hill's apartment, was found innocent by a jury Sept. 7. Garrison is scheduled 
to stand trial Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Verna Hill, she has moved and lives behind security bars, guarded by a 
pit bull. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't wake up every night like she used to," Kline said. "But it has 
destroyed her life. She planned to spend the rest of her life with him. He took 
care of her. He was good to her."

CRIME AND THE ELDERLY OF L.A.; VIOLENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE; ETHEL LEE 
MILLER; 'IT'S A REALLY TRAGIC STORY. THESE ARE NICE PEOPLE . . . GOOD, 
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE'

 When Ethel Lee Miller got home from visiting her hospitalized husband, George, 
in the summer of 1993, she was worried sick he might succumb to a serious heart 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Ethel, 73, who did not survive the night: She was murdered in the 
South-Central Los Angeles bungalow she and her 83-year-old husband shared for 
four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really tragic story," said Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Arneson. 
"These are nice people . . . good, hard-working people." 
</P>
<P>
 Before retirement, George worked in the Long Beach shipyards. Ethel worked as 
a nurse's aide and custodian, sometimes on night jobs that caused her husband 
to worry about her safety. The couple bought their house on West 50th Place, 
with its wide front porch and deep eaves, long before the surrounding area had 
gone violent and crazy with gangs and drugs. Back then, George recalls, the 
neighborhood was occupied by "settled" people, and there was little fear of 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple continued to work and save, finally able to build a small, 
two-story apartment building next to their home and to invest in other real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Millers grew old, the surrounding neighborhood began to deteriorate, 
bringing crime to their small street. They gave in and installed a white 
security gate in front of their door. George bought himself a secondhand gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel, who had a habit of carrying a lot of cash, was an otherwise cautious 
person. But she must have trusted someone enough to open her door on the night 
of her murder, police say, because there was no sign of forced entry. 
</P>
<P>
 She was found the next day, sitting in a living room chair, strangled with a 
phone cord. The house was ransacked. Police believe robbery was the motive. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and doctors were initially afraid to tell George about his wife's 
murder because of his bad heart. They told him only that she couldn't visit his 
sick bed because she too had been hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was home two days before they told me what happened to her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, George keeps busy working around his property. He recently plowed 
some ground so his tenants could plant a garden. And he thinks about his wife's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to tackle me," he said. "But they'll 
meet my gun because I keep it right by me." 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made.

CRIME AND THE ELDERLY OF L.A.; VIOLENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE; ARTEMISA 
GUERRERO; 'PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREET, SHE WOULD OPEN THE DOORS TO HER 
APARTMENT TO THEM'

 The late Cesar Chavez once called her "grandmother to the farm workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Artemisa Guerrero devoted her life to helping the poor, the downtrodden, the 
despised. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 68 -- suffering from arthritis, seizures and a once-broken hip 
that left her with a limp -- she nevertheless made regular rounds to produce 
markets and food banks, anywhere to scrounge groceries for farm workers, church 
organizations, poor neighbors and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero had few worldly possessions. She survived on a small pension from 
work as a retail clerk. Her old car had long since burned out. She lived in a 
one-bedroom apartment in a dreary complex next to the Pomona Freeway in 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, her door was always open to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even homeless people that she saw walking down the street, she would open the 
doors to her apartment to them," said Maria Valenzuela, manager of the 
apartments. "She would let them stay over." Guerrero often failed to lock her 
home and ignored warnings of family and friends that, like many elderly people, 
she was too trusting. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would just let anybody in her apartment," said Rosie Rodriguez, former 
manager of the complex. "I always told her not to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, on the morning of June 17, Guerrero was up early as usual. She was 
supposed to meet a friend who often drove her to pick up food for the poor. 
When Guerrero didn't show up, her friend went to the apartment where so many of 
the needy had been welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero lay in a pool of blood in the ransacked bedroom. She had been 
strangled and repeatedly stabbed. Her body showed evidence of sexual 
molestation. Sheriff's detectives have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 If Guerrero had realized that trustfulness and generosity could lead to death, 
would she have been more cautious and less giving? 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Ruby Medrano, did not hesitate with an answer: "I don't think 
she would have changed a thing."

CRIME AND THE ELDERLY OF L.A.; VIOLENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE; CLYDE KENNEDY; 
HE WAS VULNERABLE TO PREDATORS: 'IT WAS LIKE BEATING A CHILD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There are few cases that more tragically illustrate the vulnerability of the 
elderly than that of Clyde Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 72, Kennedy was a friendly man who liked to keep busy. But the retired 
electrician was weakened by throat cancer and chemotherapy. His larynx had been 
removed and it was hard to understand his words through his electronic voice 
box. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kennedy, a decorated World War II Navy veteran, spent most of his time 
simply sitting on the small patio next to his trailer home in Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just an old man who never bothered anybody," said Audrey Sanchez, a 
neighbor. "He was a helpless old man." 
</P>
<P>
 And he was vulnerable to predators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who cleaned Kennedy's trailer also cleaned out his checking account by 
forging his name to several thousand dollars worth of personal checks. Marcos 
Valentine Ramos, a sometimes neighbor, also wanted some of the old man's money, 
according to Kennedy's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, a 46-year-old drug addict, has been in and out of state prison since 
the 1970s, mostly for burglary. He walks with a cane from an injury suffered 
several years ago when he got drunk and fell from a roof, according to his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 On a warm, sunny afternoon last Nov. 18, a drunken Ramos accosted Kennedy as 
he sat in front of his trailer, neighbors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy later told relatives that after demanding money, Ramos punched him, 
beat him with his aluminum cane, kicked him when he fell and then poured a beer 
over him as he lay bleeding on the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it was like beating a child," said Luz Gueits, manager of the trailer 
park, who called police. "The cops and everybody else were in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While police put out a bulletin for Marcos' arrest, Kennedy was transported to 
Santa Marta Hospital on the Eastside, where he was treated for a badly cut 
scalp, a broken rib and severe bruises on his body and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been hospitalized for little more than a week when his daughter-in-law, 
Miriam Kennedy, said she received a call from a Santa Marta social worker who 
unexpectedly said that the hospital was discharging Kennedy immediately because 
his Medicare benefits had run out. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned, Miriam told the woman that no one was able to pick him up, that she 
was sick and that her husband was working the night shift. Hospital officials 
were unmoved, saying that they would send the patient home in a taxi. 
</P>
<P>
 It was well after dark when Clyde Kennedy's cab arrived. Miriam was too ill to 
get out of bed, so her 16-year-old daughter, Shanan, went outside to help 
Kennedy into the house. Because the old man was extremely weak, Shanan asked a 
neighbor for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked in the taxi, I was shocked," said the neighbor, Harriet Clouse. 
"He looked like something out of Auschwitz." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chilly night, Clouse said, and the hospital had sent the gaunt 
Kennedy home wearing only a short hospital gown and slippers. She could see 
that he had been fitted with a catheter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't naked," Clouse said. "But he might as well have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the cabdriver offered to carry Kennedy into the house and put him 
in bed. The elderly man was unable to move or speak and had to be fed. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after his discharge by Santa Marta Hospital, Kennedy's son took him to 
the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Long Beach, where he was admitted 
with possible aspiration pneumonia, slight dehydration and general pain from 
the beating. Three weeks later, Kennedy died of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office initially termed the death a homicide stemming from the 
beating, but later concluded that Kennedy died of natural causes. Ramos was 
arrested by sheriff's deputies in April, five months after Kennedy was beaten. 
He faces charges of assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse. His trial 
began Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's family members are bitter about what they consider the two 
indignities suffered by the elderly man in his last days: the beating and his 
later treatment by Santa Marta. They believe that Marcos should be prosecuted 
for murder and that Santa Marta Hospital contributed to Kennedy's death through 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Marcos) took the fight out of my dad," Bill Kennedy said. "When I saw him in 
the hospital, he didn't have the will to fight back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Marta Hospital officials admit that Kennedy's release was not handled 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could have done a better job than we did," said Will Malari, 
hospital administrator. "We screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Malari explained that the hospital had arranged for a visiting nurse to see 
Kennedy the day after his release. He also said that a staff member's vacation 
had contributed to the poor release procedures and that hospital officials had 
difficulty reaching Kennedy's family by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's no excuse," he acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the propriety of putting a patient in Kennedy's condition in a cab 
alone, Malari said: "We could have used our own van. I basically think we did 
not do enough TLC."

CRIME AND THE ELDERLY OF L.A.; VIOLENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE; JACKIE CHAMBERS; 
'I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE MY OWN SISTER'

<P>
 Jackie Chambers always watched out for others. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that the 90-year-old woman did not look out well enough for 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers lived in a small second-floor apartment in a tough area of Long 
Beach. If suspicious-looking strangers came around, she would alert her 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chambers, who lived alone, had a dangerous habit: She would sit up at 
night behind a locked screen door, her apartment door wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her she shouldn't do that," said neighbor Evelyn Welch, "but she kept 
on doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of July 25, 1992, Chambers once again left her door opened. 
Earlier in the evening, she had spoken by phone to her twin sister, Marie 
Jackson. She told Jackson that dinner was in the oven and that she was going to 
eat in the living room while watching a televised speech by then-presidential 
candidate Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never got to the kitchen," Jackson said. "She never got to have her 
dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves cut through the screen door, rushed in, beat the elderly woman, 
dragged her into the bathroom, closed the door and ransacked the apartment. 
They stole the money she had saved for her own funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 When neighbors saw the slashed screen, police were called and Chambers was 
taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lord," Jackson said, "I went to the hospital and I didn't recognize my own 
sister, she was so beat up. I said, 'Oh, no, no, that ain't my sister. That 
ain't my sister.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her injuries, Chambers was expected to recover. "The prognosis was 
that she was probably going to get better," Long Beach Police Detective Ron 
Pavek said. "But age worked against her." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Chambers fell into a coma five days after she was beaten and died eight 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no suspects. "She was an easy prey to attack," said Long Beach 
Police Detective Tim Cable. "There was no way she could protect herself."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SATICOY; OLD GRAVEL PIT WILL BECOME RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Paula-based water district is transforming an abandoned gravel mining 
pit into a reservoir, creating water storage that will help stem the flow of 
seawater into fresh underground water basins. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Water Conservation District, which monitors pumping and replenishes 
underground water supplies for much of the county, plans to have the new 
reservoir in operation by mid-February, said Frederick J. Gientke, United's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion of what once was CalMat Co.'s Noble Pit will help restore water 
levels in the upper Oxnard Aquifer for the first five years. After that, its 
water supply will be used to reduce pumping from the valuable Fox Canyon 
Aquifer beneath the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Canyon, the largest underground water basin in the county, has been 
overdrawn for the last 50 years by growers and cities that have pumped more out 
each year than rainwater can replenish. That has allowed seawater to gradually 
penetrate the aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for the shallower upper Oxnard Aquifer, but United has 
already launched projects to help replenish its supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, we're able to directly attack the overdraft in the Fox 
Canyon," Gientke said. "With the Freeman Diversion and the Saticoy and El Rio 
spreading grounds, only about 15% of the water went into the lower aquifer." 
</P>
<P>
 United purchased the 144-acre pit from the Saticoy-based CalMat Co. for $2 
million and will spend another $2.5 million grading and preparing the pit and 
building pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir, called the Fox Canyon Seawater Intrusion Abatement Program, 
will store up to 3,000 acre-feet of water per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freeman Dam on the Santa Clara River at Saticoy now diverts water during 
heavy flows after storms. That water is funneled into nearby settling ponds, 
which allow water to sink down into the ground and percolate into the aquifers 
below. 
</P>
<P>
 Excess water that the settling ponds cannot handle will be shunted off to the 
Noble Pit. For the first several years, the water will be allowed to percolate 
into the shallow water basins. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the pond seals itself off with silt in four or five years, the 
district will build a small pumping plant and ship the water via existing 
pipeline to growers on the Oxnard Plain. In turn, those growers will decrease 
the amount of water they pump from the Fox Canyon Aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 The water will cost about $110 an acre-foot, which is enough water to supply 
two families for one year. Once the project is paid off in 20 years, the will 
cost drop to $3 per acre-foot, said United board President Dan Pinkerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that time, over 60,000 acre-feet of water will have been conserved," he 
said. JOANNA M. MILLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOORPARK; PEREZ BACKS MIKELS AFTER FOE'S 187 FLYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez has announced that he is endorsing Ventura 
County supervisorial candidate Judy Mikels, saying her opponent issued a flyer 
he found offensive to Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said he was supporting Mikels, a Simi Valley councilwoman, because of 
her government experience,integrity and honesty. Perez said he had initially 
planned to remain neutral in the race because his Moorpark council colleague 
Scott Montgomery is Mikels' opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perez, the only Latino on the council, said he changed his mind because he 
believes Montgomery is trying to exploit the emotionally charged issue of 
illegal immigration to boost his candidacy for a countywide post. Perez said 
immigration was a federal matter and had no place in the supervisorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery mailed flyers to 12,000 absentee voters this week that featured a 
picture of illegal immigrants with the words: "This isn't 'immigration.' This 
is an invasion. And you're paying for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery denied that he was trying to exploit the immigration issue to his 
benefit, saying he believed there are things the county can do to reduce the 
cost of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer outlines Montgomery's five-point plan to "Stop the Illegal Alien 
Rip-Off" in the county, including turning over illegal immigrants to federal 
authorities. The plan also calls for support of Proposition 187, the statewide 
ballot initiative that would bar most government services to illegal immigrants 
and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to ride the coattails of Proposition 187," said Perez, an 
outspoken critic of the measure, which statewide polls show voters favor 2 to 
1. "It's not a campaign issue. People are going to see that it's purely a 
political maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, who has not taken a public stand on Proposition 187, said she was 
pleased to have Perez's support. She said she also believes Montgomery is 
trying to appeal to voters by bringing the immigration issue into the county 
race. "It's typical desperation politics," she said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SCIENTISTS TO USE DYE TO TRACK RIVER FLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Government scientists will pour fluorescent dye into the Santa Clara River on 
Tuesday in an experiment designed to reveal the river's inner workings. 
</P>
<P>
 The dye will be traced downstream from Piru Creek, providing water officials 
with information that will eventually help them schedule releases from the 
Santa Felicia Dam, U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist Eric Reichard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to find out what happens to water in the river. Where does it 
infiltrate the ground? Where does ground water enter the river?" Reichard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichard said the test will involve a few gallons of the dye, which will 
appear red when poured into the river but will quickly become invisible to 
everything but scientific instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 The two- to three-day test will be harmless to the environment, officials 
said. The river water is eventually sold to residential and business customers 
by the United Water Conservation District. IRA E. STOLL

MOORPARK COUPLE DIE IN AN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE; VIOLENCE: POLICE SAY PATRICK 
DINO D'ATTILE SHOT HIS WIFE AND THEN HIMSELF AFTER AN ARGUMENT ABOUT HIS 
DRINKING PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The lives of a Moorpark couple ended violently after Patrick Dino D'Attile 
allegedly shot his wife and then put the gun to his own head following an 
argument over what police said was D'Attile's drinking problem, officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies found D'Attile, 33, dead at the couple's 
apartment and his wife, Mary E. D'Attile, 30, critically injured shortly after 
D'Attile told emergency operators that his wife was bleeding to death, 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators arrived at the bottom-floor apartment in the 100 block of 
Majestic Court minutes after the 10:15 p.m. call Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller left the phone off the hook after telling operators, "She's 
bleeding to death," police said. The dispatch operator then heard what sounded 
like a single gunshot, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary E. D'Attile died about an hour later at Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center from a single gunshot wound to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 A semiautomatic handgun was found near D'Attile, who died from an apparently 
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors told police that the couple had been arguing earlier in the evening 
about D'Attile's "drinking problem." Friends of Mary D'Attile said Sunday that 
she often talked about her husband's alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew she was having problems with him before," said Eric Bowman, an 
assistant manager at the K mart store in Moorpark, where she had worked since 
May. "It was always domestic. She'd come in (to work) crying." 
</P>
<P>
 County Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said D'Attile was a commercial welder, but 
could not say Sunday whether he was currently employed. He said the couple had 
no children and are survived by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said D'Attile had recently been passed over for a promotion, and 
that his wife worked at home as a hairdresser in addition to her part-time job 
as a retail supervisor at K mart. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Kouns, who lives next door to the D'Attiles, said she heard little the 
night of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really a nice couple," Kouns said. "This whole thing just shocks 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said the couple argued 
regularly, including a dispute earlier Saturday evening. The woman said Mary 
D'Attile had sought help from another neighbor minutes before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd been having some problems," the mother of two small children said 
Sunday. "She'd tried to get some help from the neighbors. But when she came 
back, he was ready (with the gun)." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at K mart on Sunday were shocked and saddened by the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just in here a month ago," clerk Danny Melchiorre said. "She 
trained me on the cash registers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said Mary D'Attile was well-liked by her co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was outgoing and friendly with everyone," Bowman said. "She was always in 
a good mood, except for the days she was having problems with her husband."

LANDMARK DELI'S COMEBACK SPECIAL; BUSINESS: LAST WEEK'S REOPENING OF ART'S, A 
LEGENDARY SHOW-BIZ HANGOUT IN STUDIO CITY, PROMISES TO REVITALIZE A STRETCH OF 
VENTURA BOULEVARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pastrami rose from the ashes last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Nine months and a day after its fiery destruction in a Northridge earthquake 
aftershock -- long enough to have a baby, long enough to whet a million 
appetites -- Art's Deli reopened on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a birth, it was the rebirth of a San Fernando Valley and show-biz 
institution -- a return from limbo for an entire neighborhood badly smashed in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was it like around here without Art's? A four-letter word: D-e-a-d ," 
said Marty Petersil, 52, owner of The Flask liquor store a few blocks away. 
"That proved, as if anyone doubted it, that this is the hub of the boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Added his friend, lawyer Hugh Lipton, 51: "You knew it was bad around here 
when you could always find a parking space." 
</P>
<P>
 Parking was scarce again Wednesday morning, even at 6:30 a.m., as friends and 
customers drove in from as far away as Simi Valley, Newhall and Culver City to 
line up outside in the chilly dawn for a chance to have eggs and onions, maybe 
some lox (could it hurt?), and welcome their mishpocheh , their family, back to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Ginsburg himself -- the restaurant's owner, maitre d', godfather, 
impresario -- looked as high as a helium-filled balloon, his feet barely 
tethered to the ground, a rose pinned to his blue dress shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited this morning that my legs were shaking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deli, founded 37 years ago with a few tables and a long counter, survived 
the main shock of the Jan. 17 quake with only a cracked front wall. At 3 a.m. 
the following day, however, an aftershock caused an electrical fire that burned 
it down. Ginsburg arrived with family members just in time to see flames shoot 
through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cried and watched it go -- and then smiles came across our faces and we 
began to plan what we wanted to fix!" said Ginsburg. "It was like watching a 
child get hurt, then it was like watching it in the hospital getting chicken 
soup as the workmen built it back up from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ginsburg family credits its accountant, David Levi, with quickly 
developing the menu for recovery: Hire a contractor, wrangle with a 
recalcitrant insurance company and lobby their councilman for help with a 
variance on city parking requirements (the deli has only six spots -- the city 
originally demanded 65). 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Levi the consigliere sat at a table of honor with Ginsburg's 
son-in-law and other regulars. Between bites of poppy-seed bagels and sips of 
hot coffee, they showed off the new wainscoting, the graceful wood chairs 
("Roberta picked them out, you like 'em?"), the shiny white-and-black tiled 
floor. And they toasted their new fire walls and foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's haimisch , it's homey, it's like a big Jewish family here," said Manny 
Celnik, a veteran barber who said he attended Art's opening in 1957. "My wife 
Goldie and I missed it when it was closed; we didn't go anywhere else. We 
waited! Fish like this you cannot find." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a cluster of celebrity noshing, too, you shall not find -- at least for 
breakfast. Now, you want name dropping? No Ginsburg would hesitate to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Ivan Reitman is a regular, said Ginsburg's son-in-law, and so are MCA 
chief Lew Wasserman, producer John Landis, comedian Steve Martin and actors 
Richard Dreyfuss, Ed Asner and Rob Lowe. Warner Bros. has a regular Saturday 
table; their late chief Steve Ross had Art's cater meals to his corporate jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous CBS television shows order up to 200 lunches a day. The restaurant 
lets 500 individuals and businesses keep running accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The waitresses are proud of their boss and proud of their customers. Kitty 
Sherman called Ginsburg "the greatest boss in the world," then caught sight of 
a favorite ponytailed customer and alternately whispered and yelled: 
</P>
<P>
 "He's O.J. and coffee. . . . How ya doin' honey! . . . I remember when he came 
to town and drove a truck. Now he's a millionaire -- a real Hollywood story!" 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, all but four employees returned to the restaurant. During 
rebuilding, they received unemployment insurance checks for a while, then 
Federal Emergency Management Agency money. 
</P>
<P>
 Now neighborhood businesses are likewise waiting to reap the reward of having 
the deli back. By some merchants' estimates, business on the block is down 40% 
since Art's 1,000 customers a day stopped walking off their meals by 
window-shopping along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Valley Gem Shop co-owner Susan Frieder: "I have a feeling of completion 
now after the earthquake. With Art's back, and people looking in our door 
again, you feel like things will finally get back to normal."

</P>
<P>
 Lucifer's grave ignites in flames when anyone approaches at Gary Farajian's 
and Dave Cash's fourth annual earthly haunt. The two friends have excavated 
most of Farajian's yard, digging two waist-deep graves and an underground 
tunnel system. On Halloween night, the two hosts will alternately be "killed" 
and thrown into the grave, only to escape through the tunnel and sneak up 
behind an unsuspecting audience. The other side of the yard sports a 
guillotine, hangman's post and headsman's ax. The executioner's gory handiwork 
is strewn about. Free. 
</P>
<P>

 A sophisticated sound system with 40 speaker channels and trick projection 
techniques helps set the atmosphere in the graveyard of the desolate spirits,

organist assist in hosting Gary Corb's 22nd annual event. Shows are continuous

 Take a stroll through the sixth annual haunts of 13-year-old Keith La Prath 
and his grown-up partner in horror, Dick Norton. The two yards feature mummies, 
zombies and a scarecrow. In the cemetery, a hand emerges from a grave and what 
happens then to the gravedigger is worse than death -- but not as bad as what 
happens to those who sit in the electric chair. Free. 
</P>
<P>
 Other free residential haunts in Burbank: 1219 N. Myers St., 806 E. Olive 
Ave., 3500 View Crest Drive, 2440 N. Orchard Drive, 1817 N. Pepper St., 3322

Free.

</P>
<P>
 At Joann Hutchinson-Butler's 10th annual haunt, spiders are perched in sticky 
cobwebs, a corpse sits bolt-upright in a coffin and mourners walk around the 
horrifying graveyard to the shrieking delight of neighborhood children. Black 
lights and background music lure horror-seekers of all ages. Free. 
</P>
<P>
 7. HAUNTED CROWN ROSE MANSION 
</P>
<P>
 * 1247 N. Garfield Ave., Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
 In the fright-filled tour through this 1892 mansion, visitors will find the

the graveyard. This free event is geared toward children from 6 to 9 p.m. on

LAGUNA'S FIRE VICTIMS FARE WELL ON INSURANCE; RECOVERY: WHILE SOME CLAIMS 
DISPUTES HAVE ARISEN, COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FEWER THAN IN OTHER RAVAGED AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the city grapples with rebuilding a year after the disastrous firestorm 
that consumed some 400 homes, it can count one stroke of fortune: Homeowners 
have fared better with the insurance industry than other scorched Southland 
communities have. 
</P>
<P>
 State regulators and many of the city's fire victims give reasonably good 
marks to insurers, who have processed nearly 2,600 claims totaling more than 
$350 million in the aftermath of the Laguna blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Insurance has recorded fewer complaints from 
homeowners in Laguna Beach than from the Malibu and Altadena areas savaged by 
similarly catastrophic fires last October. While the Insurance Department 
fielded 17 complaints from Laguna fire victims, they handled 78 after the 
blazes in the two Los Angeles County communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy the way the industry has responded to the majority of folks in 
Laguna," said state Sen. Art Torres, chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee 
and Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner. "The majority of cases 
were or are being resolved. I just wish it was the same way elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 With the first anniversary of the disaster at hand, 98% of the claims in 
Laguna have resulted in at least a partial settlement. The three biggest 
insurers in the area -- State Farm, Allstate and Farmers Insurance -- have paid 
out nearly $195 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been problems with some of the smaller companies, but on balance 
Laguna Beach came out very well," said Jerry Cohen, a retired engineer whose 
home was destroyed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Many feared it wouldn't be that way. After the firestorm obliterated his small 
Canyon Acres cottage last October, Terence (Chuck) Gibian turned anxiously to 
his insurance company for help. Like other victims in Laguna, he had heard 
insurance horror stories after the 1991 fire in Oakland Hills, in which many 
homeowners discovered they were woefully underinsured and couldn't afford the 
cost of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibian's consternation, however, quickly turned to calm. His agent arrived 
with a healthy bailout check "before the smoke stopped rising." The firm 
offered guidance on architects. They also agreed to pay the full price of 
rebuilding his house, including the extra foundation work and other upgrades 
needed to meet today's tighter codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insurance companies got yelled at after Oakland," Gibian said. "In 
Laguna, a lot of them have made accommodations. I think they wanted to recoup 
some of their lost reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents and state officials cite a variety of reasons that Laguna 
Beach did better with insurers than other Southland areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homeowners in Altadena and Malibu, two regions considered 
high-risk because of a history of wildfires, don't have the sorts of top-shelf 
policies that provide guaranteed replacement of a home, including the costly 
structural upgrades necessary to meet present-day building codes. In such 
areas, those homeowners are covered under the California FAIR plan, a 
quasi-public insurance program that provides limited coverage to residents in 
high-risk zones. Typically, FAIR policies only cover a portion of the cost of 
rebuilding, a level of protection that one state insurance official described 
as "mediocre." 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast, Laguna Beach has not been plagued by costly wildfires and 
was not designated a FAIR zone, meaning homeowners there were able to obtain 
the best policies private insurance companies offer. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey of homeowners in Mystic Hills, one of the neighborhoods 
hardest hit in the Laguna blaze, found that 59% of the residents had policies 
that financed full replacement of their homes. Another 16% were paid based on a 
market appraisal of their homes' worth before the blaze, a figure that normally 
doesn't cover the entire cost of rebuilding. Meanwhile, 19% were paid based on 
fixed values declared in their policies, while 6% had yet to be paid, even up 
to the limits set in their insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the peculiarities of the insurance industry, a variety of other 
factors came into play to help Laguna Beach. Early on, local and state 
politicians weighed in on behalf of the victims of the fire. Soon after the 
flames subsided, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), whose district 
includes Laguna Beach, joined Torres at a well-attended meeting at a local 
church. Consumer groups that flowered after the Oakland fire also made the 
trip, offering warnings and advice. 
</P>
<P>
 But the insurance industry, which saw its reputation scorched along with the 
hillsides in the Oakland firestorm, also deserves credit. 
</P>
<P>
 After Oakland, insurers were faulted for failing to inform consumers about the 
limits of their coverage, shuttling adjusters around so that consumers could 
not get consistent treatment, giving "low-ball" estimates of rebuilding costs, 
providing inadequate advance payments for fire victims' living expenses and 
needlessly dragging out the claims settlement process. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry continues to dispute most of those charges. "People who knowingly 
opted for lower policy limits in order to save a couple dollars on their 
premium came back with all kinds of reasons why they should be paid far in 
excess of their policy limits," said Jim Snyder, president of the Personal 
Insurance Federation of California, an umbrella group representing many of the 
industry's largest companies. "The tragedy was used by many as a windfall for 
betterment." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, after the Oakland Hills fire many of the firms launched programs to 
better communicate the fine details of their policies and to rewrite policies 
of homeowners whose limits weren't close to covering the cost of replacing a 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fires hit Laguna and other spots around the Southland, many insurance 
companies reacted with dispatch. A number called in additional adjusters from 
around California or out of state and established toll-free claims hot lines. 
They stationed representatives at disaster relief centers. Several also changed 
their claims handling procedures to designate a single person as responsible 
for each file, so consumers would be assured of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 While industry advocates such as Snyder bemoan what they saw as opportunism by 
some victims of the Oakland fire, several insurance firms took the politically 
safe route in Laguna and ratcheted up coverage after the fact for burned-out 
residents whose policies were too limited to restore what they lost. Such 
concessions came in Oakland only after intense political pressure was exerted 
on the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts say a number of problems have persisted. Cindy Ossias, an 
Insurance Department senior staff counsel, said some firms weren't working fast 
enough to upgrade policies and were sticking to replacement formulas that 
drastically undervalued the cost of rebuilding a custom home on a hillside lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some victims who have recouped full replacement value for their 
structures have not received enough to replace their personal belongings -- 
clothes, furniture, carpets, TVs, personal computers and such -- that went up 
in smoke. Policies typically set a replacement level for belongings at 75% of 
the cost of rebuilding the house, but critics say that figure is arbitrary and 
doesn't always cover the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Robert F. Gentry. The Laguna Beach councilman, who saw 
not only his personal residence burn down but also a nearby rental house he 
owns, has experienced a "roller-coaster ride" of both good and bad in dealing 
with his insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations that Gentry describes as "creative tension" culminated with the 
insurer agreeing to bump up his policy limits to a level that he hopes will 
cover the cost of rebuilding. The company also agreed to honor the city's 
domestic partnership registry and cover the cost of replacing the belongings of 
Gentry's partner, Dennis Amick. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there's the bad part. Even with his final settlement, Gentry is still 
$100,000 short on his belongings, mostly because he had amassed a house full of 
family antiques that included 17th-Century Victorian furniture, silver, art 
pieces and marble statuary. His insurer also refused to continue offsetting the 
$1,550 in monthly income he was losing on his burned-out rental, which is just 
now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry, a philosophical sort, chalks it up to "lessons in life" and adds: "I'm 
a much better insurance consumer today than I was a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor of Gentry's has a grimmer tale with a happier ending. Two weeks 
before the fire erupted, Bill Halbert talked to his insurer about getting a 
full replacement plan. When the flames consumed the 2,500-square-foot view 
home, Halbert breathed a sigh of relief knowing he had gotten the upgraded 
policy just in time. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few weeks later the insurance firm called to tell the 54-year-old health 
care marketing executive that the company didn't believe he had signed up and 
were not going to honor the new policy. His old policy limit would pay maybe 
half the rebuilding cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Devastated is not exaggerating the way we felt," recalls Halbert, who had 
raised three children in the house with his wife, Ginny. "It seemed like the 
whole rest of our lives was in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Halbert got an attorney and ultimately the case was taken to arbitration, 
where a judge ruled last month against the insurance firm, USAA, which provides 
coverage to active and retired military personal and their families. "It's the 
first sigh of relief we've had in over a year," said Halbert, a former Army 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the firm still believes it was correct, it has abided by the 
arbitration judge's decision and issued the Halberts a check reflecting the new 
limits, said Paul Schattenberg, a USAA spokesman. He also noted that the firm 
settled 131 claims in the Laguna fire -- including 29 total losses -- at a cost 
of $42.6 million without problems and maintains one of the lowest complaint 
ratios in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims remain in a tug of war. In a case reminiscent of the insurance 
struggles after the Oakland Hills fire, Bernard and Mary Anderson have sued 
their insurer, Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., claiming they put their faith in 
the firm's representatives to provide them with adequate coverage. Instead, the 
$193,000 of limits will only partially cover replacement of the house. Aetna 
had no comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some fire victims who ultimately reached a satisfactory settlement with 
their insurers said they were troubled by the negotiation process. One resident 
of Canyon Acres, who asked for anonymity for fear of reprisals from his 
insurer, said he was continually put on the defensive and chastised for not 
keeping records of his belongings somewhere besides his house, which burned to 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who kept good records didn't suffer such a fate. David Horne, president 
of the Mystic Hills Homeowners Assn., had stowed in a bank safe deposit box 
complete lists, receipts and a videotape documenting his belongings. The last 
thing Horne's wife did as flames raced toward their house was go around 
snapping photos for further proof. 
</P>
<P>
 A few said they felt the Northridge earthquake, which dwarfed the fires both 
in terms of victims and property loss, prompted insurers to make quick 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake helped, I think, in the sense that some firms didn't have time 
to deal with Laguna in detail," said Cohen, whose insurance carrier had three 
total losses in the Laguna Beach fire but more than 40,000 claims in the 
earthquake. "Everything was liberalized in favor of the homeowner."

CANDIDATE AMONG 50 DEAD IN SRI LANKA BOMB ATTACK; TERRORISM: OPPOSITION LEADER 
IS KILLED BY A SUICIDE ASSASSIN AT AN ELECTION RALLY. TAMIL GUERRILLAS 
SUSPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A suicide assassin detonated a bomb at an election rally outside Colombo late 
Sunday, killing about 50 people, including the opposition candidate for 
president and top leaders of his party. 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination of Gamini Dissanayake came just 2 1/2 weeks before the 
election and just one day before peace talks were to resume with Tamil 
guerrillas to end the country's 11-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissanayake was an outspoken critic of the talks that began this month, and 
the government had warned him three weeks ago that the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eemal would try to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks scheduled for today were called off, government delegate Navin 
Gunaratne said. No new date was set. The election has been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb ripped through the rally on the outskirts of Colombo shortly before 
midnight. Dissanayake had just finished speaking and was stepping off the stage 
to greet supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police believe this was the work of a suicide bomber," military spokesman 
Gemunu Kulatunga said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bomb was apparently at the front of the stage," said Weerasooriya 
Wickrema, campaign manager of Dissanayake's United National Party. "It was a 
very powerful bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate claim of responsibility, and police said it was too 
early to say who set the blast. But the Tigers have a long history of 
assassinations and suicide bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 The same kind of explosive was used by a suicide bomber last year to kill 
President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The Tigers were blamed for that attack but have 
denied responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels were also blamed for the May, 1991, assassination of Indian Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the killings of dozens of Sri Lankan politicians and 
military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital official said about 50 bodies had been brought to General Hospital 
in Colombo following Sunday's blast. A Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said more than 200 people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the others killed were the United National Party's general secretary, 
two former Cabinet ministers and a member of Parliament, Wickrema said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emergency meeting early today, Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga's 
Cabinet decided to postpone the Nov. 9 election, in which she was to stand as a 
candidate for the ruling alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The armed forces were put on alert, and the government reimposed emergency 
measures giving the army and police a free hand to maintain law and order. The 
measures, in place for 11 years, had been lifted in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers have been fighting since 1983 for an independent homeland for the 
Tamil minority in the north and east of Sri Lanka, where they say they are 
discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority. The Tamils make up about 18% 
of Sri Lanka's 17 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 The new peace talks, to be held in the guerrilla stronghold of Jaffna, were to 
focus on a cease-fire and the opening of a land route for supplies to the 
rebel-held Jaffna peninsula, one of the guerrilla negotiators, who asked not to 
be identified, said earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round was held Oct. 12-14 and in Jaffna, 185 miles north of Colombo. 
Those discussions centered on economic issues and the repairing of roads, 
canals, schools and hospitals ravaged by the war, which has killed more than 
34,000 people.

MILITARY DRAFT UNDER FIRE IN LATIN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Latin America, where obligatory military service is a tradition, the draft 
is under fire. And in some countries, it's a lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's Congress is pushing through a law to eliminate the draft next 
year. The Honduran National Assembly passed similar legislation in May. Uruguay 
and Nicaragua had already done away with the draft. And Panama has eliminated 
its armed forces altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, from Guatemala to Chile, the draft is a subject of debate in 
parliaments and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilean youth groups have organized protests against obligatory military 
service; Paraguayan legislators are discussing changes in conscription law, and 
human rights groups in Guatemala are blowing the whistle on the army's 
abduction-like practice of forced recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region once dominated by men in epaulets, generals today have less clout 
to defend the draft. And some, mindful of examples in Europe and the United 
States, are beginning to see advantages in downsized, modernized, all-volunteer 
armies. 
</P>
<P>
 Public criticism of military service and the draft was taboo in many Latin 
American countries when they were ruled by armed forces in the 1960s and 1970s. 
In those decades, many of the region's armed forces advocated a "national 
security doctrine," which they used to justify military intervention in 
government and ruthless action against Marxist movements perceived as threats 
to stability. The draft was a way not only to fill military ranks but also to 
control and indoctrinate young men. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, military regimes gave up power in country after country as a 
wave of democracy swept through Latin America. Almost everywhere that they had 
governed, the armed forces had lost prestige because of human rights 
violations, economic mismanagement or corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 As democracy has taken root, militaristic policies have come under increasing 
question. Growing sensitivity to human rights has further nourished sentiment 
against conscription and mistreatment of draftees. Meanwhile, Marxist movements 
have waned and guerrilla wars have wound down or come to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War, which fed both revolutionary action and the doctrine of national 
security, is over. "This refocuses the subject of the armed forces in society 
and on the new international scene," Chilean historian Claudio Fuentes said. 
"The communist threat is no longer there." 
</P>
<P>
 Border disputes between Latin American countries also have become less 
volatile as civilian governments have sought to resolve differences 
diplomatically while strengthening commercial ties. That trend has further 
reduced the role of the armed forces and the need for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But that does not mean the draft is heading for extinction in all countries of 
the region, Fuentes said. Military establishments still exert strong influence 
in some countries, and many generals still hold on to the draft as a hallowed 
tradition. Also, where military budgets are too small to support a 
professional, volunteer army, low-paid draftees are sometimes seen as a 
necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 The current controversy over the draft in some countries, therefore, centers 
more on how obligatory service can be reformed than on whether it might be 
eliminated. In some countries, reforms have already been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, for example, has become the only country in Latin America with 
legislation that permits alternative civilian service for conscientious 
objectors. The provision was written into Brazil's 1988 constitution, enacted 
four years after the armed forces left power. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-1980s, military service throughout the region has endured the 
worst beating perhaps in this century: Uruguay abolished the draft in the late 
1980s; Nicaragua did the same after President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took 
office in 1990. In Honduras, President Carlos Reina won congressional approval 
in May for a bill to eliminate obligatory military service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizens between the ages of 18 and 30 will join the military service 
voluntarily in time of peace, under the modality of an educational, social, 
humanist and democratic system," the new provision says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago this would have been impossible," said Victor Meza, a Honduran 
political analyst. "This is symptomatic of the consolidation of civil society." 
</P>
<P>
 As legislators voted on the draft ban, young Hondurans held a hunger strike 
outside Congress to demand its passage. It passed unanimously but must be 
ratified by the next legislative session in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama became the second Latin American country to abolish its army with the 
Legislative Assembly's final approval Oct. 5 of a constitutional amendment. In 
practice, the Panamanian Defense Force had ceased to exist after the December, 
1989, U.S. invasion that removed Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rica's army was abolished in 1949 by the late President Jose (Pepe) 
Figueres, father of President Jose Maria Figueres. 
</P>
<P>
 In Argentina, the army had planned a gradual transition from obligatory to 
voluntary military service as part of a modernization program. Then, this 
spring, a draftee was reported to have been beaten to death in an artillery 
regiment. The scandal consolidated public opinion against the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, seeing political advantage in following 
popular sentiment, sent a bill to Congress to abolish the draft in 1995. The 
bill passed the lower house Sept. 21; approval by the Senate is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes said it is unlikely that Chile will follow Argentina's example in 
replacing the draft with an all-volunteer force. "The military has said it is 
impossible because of the cost," he said. And the civilian defense minister, 
Edmundo Perez Yoma, has said the administration of Chilean President Eduardo 
Frei supports obligatory military service. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chile's anti-draft movement is more active than ever. Jose Sabat, a 
Chilean university student and president of the non-governmental Youth Rights 
Commission, helped organize a protest against the draft Sept. 19, the day of 
Chile's annual military parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Society must discuss "the elimination of the obligatory nature of military 
service," protesters said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabat acknowledged in an interview, however, that hardly anyone sees 
elimination of the draft as a realistic goal for now in Chile, where former 
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet still commands the army. Political and human 
rights activists are concentrating on such reforms as conscientious objector 
status, alternative service and reduction of service time. Two Socialist 
members of the Congress introduced a bill at the end of July to reform draft 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In many Latin American countries, it is not difficult for middle- and 
upper-class youths to avoid the draft. Many Chileans obtain exemptions with 
questionable doctor's certificates. Others receive student deferments and are 
never called up again. In all, only about a quarter of all draft-age youths are 
inducted; most of them are from Chile's working class. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, obligatory service is also loosely enforced. "A lot of people get 
out of it by paying someone else to do it for them, or by paying some 
lieutenant," said Roderic Camp, a professor at Tulane University in New Orleans 
who has written about the Mexican army. 
</P>
<P>
 In several of the region's poorer countries, the draft exists legally but is 
not actually used. Peru and the Dominican Republic, for example, fill the draft 
quota each year with jobless volunteers who have little education and see the 
army as a way to survive and perhaps learn useful disciplines and skills.

A TALE OF TWO CITIES, GLOBAL VILLAGE STYLE; IMMIGRANTS: WITH HIGH-TECH 
COMMUNICATIONS AND EASY JET TRAVEL, YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN -- OFTEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the dim, amber candlelight of morning Mass, the town's aging parish is 
lined with souls. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowded in the rough pine pews are hundreds of worshipers who fled Mexico when 
their faces were smooth, their ambitions grand and their dream destination was 
truly the city of Disneyland -- Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los ausentes, " they call them. The absent ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Yearly, they are drawn to the towering pink-stone, colonial church of this 
Jalisco village for wistful reunions and dazzling white-fire rocket bursts that 
celebrate the simple rites of a global village. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hometown is a state of mind, a village of cobblestone on one side of the 
border and suburban tract homes on the other, with boundaries made of faxes, 
flights and videotapes. "Transnational community" is the fashionable academic 
description for such hybrids, whose inhabitants have efficiently intensified 
immigration through a complex chain of hometown friends and high technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Other exotic strains are flourishing throughout California, mixing the 
tenement buildings of South-Central Los Angeles with the Mayan hamlets of 
northwest Guatemala or the bungalows of Monterey Park with the urban high-rises 
of Taipei, Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about how corporations are going global. The reality is people are 
going global," said Timothy P. Fong, an assistant professor at Cal State 
Northridge who has studied the immigrant chain linking Taipei to Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 So many highly paid Taipei professionals jet between lives in Taiwan and 
California, for instance, that their countrymen have coined a nickname for 
these masters of the universe -- "tai kun fei jen" -- spacemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology has reduced travel time, eased communication and slashed 
immigration costs in such a way that new-wave immigrants are able to share 
countries like neighbors borrow cups of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 From San Miguel, Guatemala, an isolated parish priest has fashioned an 
international pulpit with a video camera that he uses to deliver sermons and 
charity appeals to his missing flock of Kanjobal-speaking Mayans in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The homemade videos are flickering images of parish members pounding nails on 
the village church or sentimental scenes of Sunday Mass with the sober chimes 
of the new chapel bell. Facing the camera, the priest does not dwell long on 
the heavenly; the hometown parish desperately needs money for repairs, he 
intones. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar pleas in other languages have resulted in a shower of civic gifts for 
Latin American and Asian global villages: new ambulances, rodeo corrals, paved 
roads, restored churches, youth centers. Often, these desperate messages are 
delivered personally by priests, politicians or visiting dignitaries such as 
"Miss Indigenous Guatemala," who have trailed their countryfolk northward. 
</P>
<P>
 "To understand what's going on you have to think of time," said Father Ed 
Poettgen. The priest has followed Mexican parishioners from their Catholic 
churches in Anaheim and Stanton to Cargadero, Zacatecas and Jalostotitlan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people say they're going to Mexico, it sounds like a long way," he said. 
"But when I think of Guadalajara, it's actually a lot closer to fly to than, 
say, Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 Technology has so compressed time that it's a relatively simple matter for a 
group of immigrants to alert relatives and hometown friends to a job opening in 
a San Gabriel Valley computer factory or a low-priced apartment in Santa Ana. 
It has allowed Oaxacan Indians from Mexico to savor minute details of a 
15-year-old niece's Southern California birthday party with a two-hour video. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we send audio cassettes to Guatemala, our relatives tell us it's like 
having you there in person. They say, 'It seems like you're right there sitting 
in front of me,' " said Leonel Say, 23, of Los Angeles, who ships his tapes 
through a special courier service to his family's hometown in San Miguel 
Acatan. 
</P>
<P>
 Poettgen, the priest, discovered the global nature of his former parish in 
Anaheim one Saturday afternoon while listening to whispered confessions. "All 
of a sudden I hear this band starting up," he said. "It was a bus from Tijuana 
with the (statue) of San Rafael." 
</P>
<P>
 In the darkness of a cramped confessional, he remembered an encounter in 
Mexico with a Zacatecas priest who bemoaned that he had lost many members of 
his Cargadero parish to Anaheim. In sympathy, Poettgen invited the priest for a 
California reunion, failing to realize the invitation would also draw the 
municipal band's tuba section. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the tubas and bus rumbled south, but the statue of Cargadero's 
patron saint was left behind and circulated among the living rooms of more than 
200 immigrant families for a year of prayer and rosary chants. 
</P>
<P>
 The elaborately robed icon offered more than divine inspiration; San Rafael 
strengthened the hometown bonds that social anthropologists consider one of the 
major driving forces in mass migration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paisanaje" is the Spanish label for this relationship. It means common 
origin, a form of kinship that becomes a vital lifeline for immigrants from the 
same hometown who draw together in a foreign country to cope with the hardships 
of a new culture. 
</P>
<P>
 These paisanos -- whose families have lived together in the same hometown for 
generations -- are expected to share information about jobs, pool resources, 
loan money and provide room-and- board to newcomers who have followed the path 
of their hometown pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 That camaraderie extends even to raising money for the one-way ticket for a 
friend's final trip home returning to the hometown in a simple coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 In many transnational communities, so many dollars stream home that in some 
hometowns, there are more U.S. dollars circulating in their economy than pesos, 
according to University of Pennsylvania sociologist Douglas Massey, who has 
studied immigration chains in western Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time you get to this level, jobs become relatively less important in 
drawing people," said Massey. "Immigration becomes supported by social networks 
and the whole process takes on a life of its own. When people come of age, it's 
just assumed that's what one does." 
</P>
<P>
 The network acts with the same efficiency of an underground railroad line, 
drawing people to established stations even though other cities and states may 
be geographically closer. 
</P>
<P>
 To a large extent, the chains explain why more than two-thirds of Mexico's 
U.S.-bound migrants come from seven of the country's 31 states and usually from 
particular villages within those provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 It also explains the immigration of upper middle class professionals and 
computer firm owners from Taiwan who were drawn to Monterey Park initially in 
the 1970s by a Taiwanese real estate agent who promoted the suburb as the 
Chinese Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image of Monterey Park as Little Taipei has really facilitated a lot of 
immigration. The U.S. is really Los Angeles County for people from Taiwan" said 
Yen Fen Tseng, a sociologist from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tseng herself is a "spacewoman," shuttling between jobs at UCLA and Tun Ghei 
University in Taiwan. The frenetic life, she said, is considered a status 
symbol for Taiwanese men who can afford to send their wives and children to Los 
Angeles while they remain behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Charity flows in the same direction; the wealthy Buddhist welfare agency, Tse 
Ze, sends money to the Los Angeles area to support programs for Taiwanese 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communities are not just bonded by geography," said Rob Smith, an assistant 
sociology professor at City College of New York and director of the 
Transnational Migration Project at Columbia University. "They are more 
powerfully bonded by people. And once a community is established in a foreign 
country, it lowers the cost of immigration tremendously, both psychologically 
and financially. Your community is waiting for you." 
</P>
<P>
 As morning dawned in Jalostotitlan, the slow-motion stroke of church bells 
thundered through the town's deserted plaza, calling the ausentes home. Slowly 
the square filled with sun-bronzed men in cowboy hats and women carrying fresh 
palm branches and gladiolas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Reynoso, 22 years in Anaheim and still yearning for the colonial 
town of his birth, once understood the language of the tower bells. Now he 
knows only that they summon him home to a small town of sherbet-colored 
colonial houses nicknamed "Jaloswood" for the huge white letters spelling out 
Jalostotitlan along the emerald green hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're divided, but Jalostotitlan is part of me," said Reynoso, 38, a 
custodial supervisor at St. Boniface Church in Anaheim, who has returned to 
initiate his 14-year-old U.S.-born son, Roberto, in the rites of his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they have wandered the town, pausing at Reynoso's old school and the 
festive plaza where young men in slender, faded jeans toss plastic confetti at 
girls strolling in endless circles in an old-fashioned dating ritual called the 
paseo. Reynoso gazes at them thoughtfully, remembering when he used to scoop 
the confetti in handfuls from the concrete because he couldn't afford to buy 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to California when I was 16, but I was born and raised with their 
rules, their morals," said Reynoso. "My hometown made me the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
 His soft voice is suddenly overwhelmed by the town band's doleful music, the 
tubas bellowing and drums pounding. Behind the band are men and women singing 
mananitas, traditional songs of celebration, trailing a delicate, white-robed 
statue of the Virgin of the Assumption, the town's patron saint. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious procession of mostly California immigrants stretches the length 
of a grassy soccer field and wanders up the hill toward the grand iron-grill 
archway of the 300-year-old parish of Jalostotitlan. Each pilgrim wears a lime 
green and white name tag that permits entry into a special Mass for ausentes , 
an event so crowded that last August parish priests limited services for El Dia 
de los Ausentes services to returning immigrants, who numbered more than 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing patiently in line is Reyes Jauregui, 61, a father of seven and a 
retired sugar beet farmer from Chico, Calif. with a stiff-brimmed cowboy hat 
shading his walnut-colored skin. A man who by nature carefully selects his 
words, Jauregui speaks with passion about the first glimpse of his hometown in 
37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart practically jumped out of my body," said Jauregui, his weathered 
hand stroking his chest. "I was remembering the farms, the people." 
</P>
<P>
 People like Miguel Gonzalez, 61, the Anaheim patriarch of a family with 13 
sons and daughters, children -- most of whom followed their father to Southern 
California after he moved there in 1966 to bus tables at the Biltmore Hotel in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Gonzalez and his sons would launch an Anaheim supermarket called 
Northgate, which would spawn 10 other family-owned stores selling Mexican 
products. Although the family is scattered throughout Southern California, they 
still return twice a year for hometown festivals in Jalostotitlan, staying in 
an airy downtown house that they use only during family visits. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge sign touting the Northgate market in Anaheim is painted in the interior 
of the corrida de toros, the bull ring where fights are staged twice a year 
during the town's annual carnival and its religious festival for the Virgin of 
the Assumption. The Gonzalez family posted the advertisement to help their 
Mexican hometown and -- more importantly -- their Anaheim businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come here because our roots are here," said Gonzalez's son and business 
partner, Miguel, 44. "This is where we were born and we come to share with the 
hometown. Visiting here is a way of recharging our batteries." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other large families of Jalostotitlan have painstakingly fashioned the 
same chain. First, the fathers emigrated to Southern California when farmers 
were recruiting Mexican workers through the bracero program of the 1950s. 
Later, their sons or brothers would follow them north even though the road trip 
to California was lengthier and far more grueling and lengthy than a trip to 
the Texas border. Eventually, the daughters, sisters and wives would take the 
same path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, you have two towns next door to each other. And one town heads for 
Texas and the other for California," said Devra Weber, an assistant professor 
of history at UC Riverside. "And the reason usually is that someone has gone 
there first, learning the ropes, getting established." As tiny communities took 
hold in the 1970s and 1980s in South Gate and Anaheim, the move to California 
became a basic rite of passage for the young men of Jalostotitlan. Townspeople 
said the wanderlust seemed to seize their boys about age 16. That's when they 
started yearning for shiny Thunderbirds and stylish designer jeans sported by 
the returning ausentes.  
</P>
<P>
 Others simply drifted north, pulled by links in the family chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family pushed me to go," said Maurilio Romo, 34, a solar energy research 
technician from Palmdale who faithfully attends his hometown's annual 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're from a big family and we didn't have much money," Romo said. "My older 
brother was already there and he said it's not enough to work in a Mexican 
factory. You can make more money in the U.S. I was always dreaming of going 
there ever since I was a small kid. At that time, people in the U.S. had money. 
So people here treated them like they had university degrees. They had nice 
cars, clothes, spending money." 
</P>
<P>
 When Romo decided to head north in 1977, he called his brother, who wired him 
money for a ticket and offered him room and board. A job was waiting in a San 
Fernando Valley lamination factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, eight of the Romo brothers live in Southern California, returning often 
to the colonial house in Jalostotitlan where they were born. The cool tile 
floor, huge stained glass window and hand painted mosaics are a tribute to the 
work of the California immigrants who have paid to remodel their parents' home 
while living in the states. 
</P>
<P>
 Their success story draws others to the underground railroad; but the trip is 
not always pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez Delfino, a 30-year-old hotel clerk in Jalostotitlan, remembers trying 
to cross the border 15 times during a two-week period before he finally left 
Tijuana for Southern California. From there he caught a bus bound for Anaheim, 
where a hometown friend was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the finale to his U.S. adventure did not have the same triumphant ending 
of other ausentes who return to Jalostotitlan's festivals with golden tales of 
prosperity and the shiny cars to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobless for nearly three months, Delfino relied again on a hometown relative 
for housing and a hometown friend who shared restaurant leftovers. And although 
Delfino had traveled to the United States to improve his life, he found himself 
so poor that he could afford to eat little except potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 With his hunger driving him, Delfino caught a one-way ride on the underground 
railroad. Last stop: Jalostotitlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning ausentes expect to be questioned about the California dream when 
they gather in the town for fiestas. Tact is the preferred approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times the old men will ask us, 'How's California?' " said Jose 
Padilla, 22, of Los Angeles. "They kind of have these illusions that it's a 
paradise. They say how is the beautiful weather? They think everyone is rich. I 
don't want to shatter their dreams and I also don't want to show off. So I tell 
them it's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The return of younger ausentes like Padilla is particularly intriguing to 
anthropologists who wonder whether a global village can truly flourish past the 
first generation of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla, a graduate engineering student at USC, doesn't know about such 
theories. He only knows that he and nearly 20 other young cousins from 
California are drawn to Jalostotitlan every year to a sea-green corner house on 
Calle Zaragoza that generations ago was the fabled location of the town's only 
whorehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 There, a grizzled 94-year-old man in a vanilla cowboy hat rests in a plastic 
chair, his metal cane leaning against aquamarine tiles, his dark, brown eyes 
doleful and patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Matias Jauregui is the first link in the family chain of those who left 
for the United States during the Mexican Revolution. And during most days of 
the year, he rests on the porch waiting for the return of some of more than 300 
relatives who followed his path to El Norte.

'3 STRIKES' LOOPHOLE CAN GIVE OFFENDERS A BREAK; LAW: SOME FELONS' NEW ARRESTS 
ARE TREATED AS PAROLE VIOLATIONS, WHICH AT MOST DRAW ONE YEAR IN PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scores of prison parolees arrested for felonies in Los Angeles County have 
slipped through a little noticed loophole in the "three strikes" law and 
avoided stiff new penalties prescribed by the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of striking out when arrested on new charges, these offenders have 
lucked out. 
</P>
<P>
 A loophole in the law allows a parolee's new arrest -- even for a brutal or 
serious crime -- to be processed as an administrative parole violation, outside 
the reach of the get-tough crime law signed by the governor in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney E. Hudson, for example, had already amassed six strikes when he was 
arrested for violently assaulting a fellow resident of a homeless shelter in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson, who once burst into the quiet living room of a Riverside family and 
opened fire while absconding with his loot, could have faced 25 years or more 
in prison. But instead of pressing charges, the district attorney's office 
referred him to parole officials, who imposed their maximum penalty -- one year 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the most recent case was flawed, largely because police 
could not locate the victim for further questioning -- even though he was 
subsequently found by parole authorities and The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy District Atty. David Traum, whose unit screens such cases, said his 
office refers felony arrests to parole officials only if the cases are very 
weak or the offenses are relatively minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not supposed to be a way to get rid of cases," Traum said. "If they're 
doing that, it's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years prosecutors, especially those in Los Angeles County, have 
relied on parole revocations as a swift, sure and economical way to dispose of 
certain felony cases and send ex-convicts to prison for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice has continued under "three strikes" but the stakes have changed 
dramatically: Now the courts can impose up to a life sentence for some crimes 
while a one-year prison term remains the maximum penalty for a parole 
violation, no matter how serious the offense or how many strikes the parolee 
has in his past. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times examined police, court, parole and prosecutor files for 100 of the 
239 felony arrestees sent by the district attorney to parole authorities from 
mid-March through the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that many parolees who were not prosecuted are violent, repeat 
offenders -- the sort of criminals expressly targeted by the new "three 
strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said he has not studied the cases 
his deputies have referred to parole authorities. This area, he added, is 
"probably something I need to reflect on." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti acknowledged that there is a potential for prosecutors to circumvent 
the "three strikes" law by referring prosecutable cases to parole authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say it is (a loophole) if in fact there's a concerted 
effort by the people in any D.A.'s office throughout the state to avoid 'three 
strikes,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney stressed, however, that his office is committed to 
following the letter and the spirit of "three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which does not even mention the word "parole," is aimed at criminals 
with prior convictions for serious or violent crimes. The penalties are doubled 
for felons with one prior strike. Those with two or more strikes face terms of 
25 years to life. Voters will be asked to affirm the new law on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new statute drastically reduces the discretion of judges in 
sentencing, prosecutors have retained great latitude in determining whether 
charges should be filed in the first place, or the case should be sent to 
parole officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In examining 100 felony arrests referred by prosecutors to parole authorities, 
The Times found: 
</P>
<P>
 In one out of five cases, the parolee had a petty or nonviolent criminal 
background with no prior strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 In one out of four, prosecutors lacked information in their files to determine 
whether the parolee had prior strikes or not, and was subject to an enhanced 
penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the parolees had accumulated at least one prior strike for 
serious or violent crimes, or were facing a strike as a result of their most 
recent arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had multiple strikes for crimes including murder, rape, arson, robbery 
and residential burglary. For example, records show that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Norman Anthony Moore had one prior strike for setting fire to an apartment 
occupied by his ex-girlfriend and her two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was arrested in July on suspicion of using a screwdriver to kill a man 
who had been flirting with a female friend. Deputy Dist. Atty. Theodore Loewen 
said that it was "clear" Moore committed the murder, but that the admissible 
evidence "may be insufficient" to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
 * Andre Juniel is a veteran gang member with five prior strikes for robberies, 
including the armed holdup of an elderly man. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several police officers observed Juniel fleeing with a gun in his 
waistband in March, they did not recover the weapon when they arrested him for 
possessing a gun. Juniel initially confessed but later retracted his statement. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Traum said, "To be honest, some D.A.s might file this case," 
but he added that he believes the case could not be won. "Maybe I'm wrong . . . 
but we'll never know because we never filed it." 
</P>
<P>
 * James Brewer had accumulated two strikes -- for shooting into an occupied 
dwelling and for sodomizing an 8-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Police pulled him over for a traffic violation in April and observed a loaded 
gun on the front passenger floorboard of the car, a gun case on the seat next 
to him and 23 rounds of ammunition in the back seat. Brewer denied owning the 
gun or the vehicle, so Deputy Dist. Atty. Jaime Hernandez decided not to file 
charges. "If he'd confessed, we'd be home free," said Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cornell Stefin had one prior strike for murdering his grandmother, then 
stealing her car to escape and pawning her valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Stefin admitted to police that he stole his sister's property, 
valued at $1,500, and pawned it for money to buy drugs. Loewen declined to 
prosecute Stefin for grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Loewen's boss, Traum, reviewed the case after a reporter's inquiry and 
concluded that charges should have been filed. "I think we could have convicted 
him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loewen said he was "not absolutely" certain but recalled that the victim had 
refused to testify. The victim said in an interview that she was willing to 
testify and was disappointed when prosecutors took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the above cases, parole officials determined that there was a 
preponderance of evidence supporting the alleged offenses and returned the 
parolees to prison for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the new parole violation -- regardless of its severity -- is not 
recorded as a "strike" because, under the law, only court convictions can count 
as strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he would like to review all the cases his deputies have referred 
to parole. "If we found, 'Hey, these are some cases that could have been 
prosecuted,' then we can change that," he said. "We can tell our people, 'You 
should be filing these cases within the system.' " 
</P>
<P>

 The central complaints unit of the district attorney's office in Downtown Los 
Angeles is staffed by 12 veteran full-time and six part-time deputy district 
attorneys who rarely set foot in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 They tediously screen dozens of arrests each day to size up which should be 
prosecuted or rejected, or referred to parole authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although deputies are obliged to file charges whenever there is sufficient 
evidence to prove a crime, Garcetti said his office is under "pressure from the 
courts and everyone involved in the justice system . . . to limit the number of 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
 In the complaints unit, decisions must be made quickly, because arrestees must 
be charged or released within 48 hours of arrest. Often, police work on the 
case is unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workload is so great in some divisions," said prosecutor Hernandez, "that 
patrolmen don't even have time to get the names of witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints unit is described by one veteran deputy as "high-pressure, 
high-volume work with little recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first six months the new law was in effect, the district attorney's 
various complaints units filed 33,000 felony cases, including 7,789 first- or 
multiple-strike cases. 
</P>
<P>
 They rejected 14,000 felony arrests for prosecution, including many cases 
referred to parole authorities by police or prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 239 of the cases rejected for filing, prosecutors filled out computerized 
forms specifically earmarking the matters for parole authorities. Additional 
cases were referred there by prosecutors, but were not listed as parole 
referrals, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In rejecting cases, prosecutors often noted weaknesses such as insufficient 
evidence, unavailable witnesses, reluctant victims, or incomplete or sloppy 
police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't file just slam-dunks," Traum said. "We file difficult cases, but we 
have to believe we can prove a case before we file it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, a case is bungled so badly by police that prosecutors decide it is 
doomed in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Weber blamed inept police work in April for ruining 
any chance of convicting parolee Charles Carter, who was facing a third strike. 
Weber noted that police accidentally mixed cocaine recovered from the 
arrestee's pocket with some other cocaine they found on the floor of the police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good case ('three strikes') turned to s---," Weber said in a case summary. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 36, already had two strikes against him from a 1984 robbery and brutal 
beating of a sleeping 73-year-old man. In the latest case, parole authorities 
gave Carter nine months in prison, but he was released in half that time for 
good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, flawed police work or reluctant victims unquestionably left 
prosecutors little choice but to decline filing charges. But in others, the 
decision angered victims and police or surprised parole officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A carjacking victim said she was so distraught when prosecutors declined to 
press robbery charges against her assailant that she called and complained 
bitterly to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Daniels, a parolee with two prior strikes for robbery, was arrested on 
suspicion of attacking her April 14. He allegedly held a gun to her head, 
choked her and stabbed her foot with a screwdriver before tearing the jewelry 
off her ears and fingers and fleeing in her car. Daniels had been convicted of 
a strikingly similar robbery a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Detective Richard Record said he objected when the district attorney's 
office declined to press charges in the carjacking. However, he said, it was 
the victim who finally persuaded prosecutors to reverse themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe how hard I had to push these people just to do their job," 
said the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Loewen said he initially rejected the case for prosecution 
because the victim appeared to lack credibility. But he said he changed his 
mind after they talked on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 A 19-year-old student who was jumped and badly beaten in August by gang 
members is another victim upset with prosecutors. He was allegedly insulted 
racially and attacked with rocks and sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to my injuries, I couldn't walk, could barely see because of dizziness 
and had aches and pains in my legs," he said in a written statement from his 
hospital bed. He asked for prosecution "to the fullest" of parolee Manuel 
Sanchez, 20, who had a prior strike for using a gun to steal a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lucienne Coleman said that because the victim was not hit 
in the head or beaten severely, it would be difficult to prove felony assault 
charges against Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman referred his case to parole officials, but the police detective did 
not alert parole authorities because he said he did not think he was required 
to, and Sanchez was mistakenly released. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted by a reporter, parole authorities did not know of Sanchez's arrest 
or his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Police usually notify parole officials when a parolee is arrested. While the 
alleged violator remains in custody, parole authorities must investigate but 
have the discretion to release him and take no action. 
</P>
<P>
 Parolee Michael Hilliard, who already had three strikes, was simply ordered by 
parole officials to stay 100 feet away from a woman whom he allegedly 
terrorized in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Hilliard broke through her door, demanded food stamps and 
ransacked the kitchen, while she and her children cowered. 
</P>
<P>
 He already had amassed two strikes for armed robberies and a third for forcing 
a woman to perform oral copulation on him at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Wendy Moss said that since Hilliard did not take 
anything, she could not prove that he intended to commit felony burglary. "He 
may have trespassed or committed malicious mischief," Moss said, "but that's 
not a felony." 
</P>
<P>
 Another parolee, Daniel Rodriguez, who already had one strike for shooting at 
a police officer, suffered no consequences whatsoever from his illegal weapons 
arrest in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Police observed Rodriguez standing at a corner brazenly swinging nunchukas, 
martial arts fighting sticks that can be used for striking or strangling 
people. The weapon was booked into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a cut-and-dried case and it got rejected," said Police Officer 
Victoria Shroyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Hernandez said he declined to prosecute Rodriguez in part 
because judges typically reduce cases involving nunchukas to misdemeanors 
punishable by a maximum of one year in county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Hernandez referred the case to parole officials, they took no action 
and Rodriguez remained free. 
</P>

<P>
 Unlike court trials that cost taxpayers an estimated $6,000 a day and can last 
for weeks, parole revocation hearings are inelegant, low-budget proceedings 
that rarely take more than about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 They are held amid tight security in the cramped hearing rooms of state 
prisons or county jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding are a dozen hearing officers, without gavels or robes, who travel 
the state like the circuit judges of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
 They typically finish six cases a day with the proceedings memorialized by a 
cassette tape recorder instead of a stenographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually no attorneys are present, but testimony is given under oath. Parolees 
are warned that what is said at the hearing can later be used against them in 
court. They frequently make rambling statements to deny or explain their 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearsay evidence is allowed, which means that when victims or witnesses do not 
attend, police officers or parole agents are allowed to relate their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of parolee Rodney Hudson -- the six-strike man accused of attacking a 
fellow resident in a homeless shelter -- was heard May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson had racked up strikes for armed robberies and assaults as well as 
convictions for burglary, drugs and battery, various parole violations and a 
lengthy juvenile record. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Debra Starr said she declined to prosecute Hudson for 
assault with a deadly weapon because police were unable to locate the victim 
and failed to book into evidence Hudson's alleged weapons -- a telephone and 
bug spray. She said it "certainly would have made a difference if the victim 
were available." 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported that Hudson punched the victim and dragged him across a 
parking lot, suspecting that he had stolen his watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Hudson allegedly followed the victim into the shelter and pummeled him in 
the office of the supervisor, pinned him to the floor, struck him with a 
telephone, and sprayed his mouth with a can of ant and roach spray. 
</P>
<P>
 "That man is dangerous," the victim told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim missed Hudson's parole hearing. He called in to say he was late and 
had missed the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers and a principal witness, the shelter's supervisor, also failed 
to attend. Hudson admitted fighting with the victim but denied striking him 
with the phone or spraying him. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, based on a parole agent's summary of the case, the hearing 
officer found good grounds to believe that Hudson had committed battery and 
attempted to commit assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing officer Monica Smith said in an interview that she could not remember 
Hudson's case, but that she hears matters every day involving violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Often prosecutors filed no charges in these cases, she said, because "certain 
information hadn't surfaced until the (parole) hearing, or the investigation 
wasn't completed or something just fell through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, she said, a parolee makes an admission or a victim or witness 
comes forward to provide a break in the case. But she said it is unusual for a 
prosecutor to display interest at that point in a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that out of 9,000 parole revocation hearings held statewide 
during the first six months of this year, the tapes of only 38 were subpoenaed 
by prosecutors, including just three by the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office. None involved cases filed since "three strikes" went into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty rare you get something you can use," explained Traum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he is considering developing a new policy to help prosecutors 
"follow up" on parole hearings on the chance that new evidence surfaced, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran parole hearing officer Richard Washington sees up close the cases that 
prosecutors have declined to pursue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (prosecutors) let us revoke them instead of prosecuting," Washington 
said, adding that this has been common practice for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pontrell Williams was arrested July 5 after an off-duty police officer 
observed him and another suspect gun down a man who owed them money. Though 
Williams was not the triggerman, he was identified as an accomplice and driver 
of the getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the objections of the homicide detective, Deputy Dist. Atty. Coleman 
declined to prosecute Williams, mainly because of the difficulty in proving he 
knew a murder was going to take place. Instead, she referred the case to parole 
authorities because Williams had admitted selling drugs at a rock cocaine 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 After a parole hearing that lasted about half an hour Aug. 19, hearing officer 
Washington concluded that Williams had not only sold cocaine and acted as an 
accessory to the murder, but attempted to commit murder as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 24, who had already served three prison terms for stealing cars and 
evading police officers during a dangerous high-speed chase, received the 
maximum penalty of one year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said he is frustrated that he cannot impose any greater punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see more murder cases than the average Superior Court judge sees in a 
lifetime," he said. "I saw six in one day. It's not unusual to see two in a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the unprosecuted parolees) are delighted, because they've beat the big 
rap. We give them just a year and they say, 'Oh, I can do that standing on my 
head!' " The Paths Back to Prison 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of prosecuting parolees for new felony arrests, the district attorney 
can send parolees to state parole authorities, who operate out of reach of the 
new "three strikes" law. The maximum penalty parole officials can impose on 
parolees arrested for new crimes is one year in prison, no matter how serious 
the parolee's new offense or how many strikes the parolee has accumulated. The 
chart below illustrates two paths back to prison for parolees, and the vast 
difference in length of prison terms that can be meted out by the courts and by 
authorities.

 About 24,000 parolees returned to prison by parole authorities for parole 
violations and new arrests in 1992. These include 6,000 parolees arrested for 
violent crimes, 4,000 arrest for property crimes and 4,000 arrested for drug 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18,000 parolees returned to prison by the courts with new sentences for 
new crimes in 1992. These include 2,800 parolees convicted of violent crimes, 
8,200 convicted of property crimes and 5,400 convicted of drug offenses.

<P>
 After felony arrests, these parolees with prior strikes were referred by the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office for administrative parole 
hearings: 
</P>
<P>
 DERRICK BOWIE 
</P>
<P>
 In late March, Bowie was arrested for assaulting a woman motorist with a 
broomstick and taking her property from her car after a traffic collision and 
brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowie already had one strike for brandishing a firearm at a peace officer, as 
well as arrests on suspicion of murder and kidnaping that had not been 
prosecuted. As a juvenile, he was convicted of murder and four counts of 
assault with a firearm arising from a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the March incident, police got statements from various witnesses and 
recovered the broomstick that Bowie allegedly used as a weapon. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Rebecca Lewis, who reviewed the arrest, was the same prosecutor who had 
won the murder conviction against Bowie 13 years earlier. In declining to file 
assault charges against him, she noted that witnesses gave conflicting accounts 
and that Bowie had claimed self-defense. She referred the case to parole 
authorities. They returned Bowie to prison for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 TONY WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
 Washington was arrested in mid-March on suspicion of grand theft auto when he 
was spotted driving a car reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Washington had already piled up six strikes for residential 
burglaries and one for robbery, as well as convictions for selling narcotics 
and numerous parole revocations for alleged offenses that were not prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested in March, he told police that he had borrowed the car 
from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Washington had keys to the ignition, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ellen Berk 
declined to file charges. "If somebody has the keys and makes no incriminating 
statement and doesn't run, it's normally not a filing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, parole officials concluded that Washington had committed grand theft 
auto and returned him to prison for nine months. He did not contest their 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 ALGIMANTOS ENREKUS 
</P>
<P>
 Enrekus was arrested but not prosecuted in May on suspicion of setting fire to 
a halfway house. Enrekus, a Russian immigrant who spent 35 years in Siberian 
prisons, had one prior strike for attempting to commit arson. Probation 
officials identified him as the suspect in 11 blazes set in two Lithuanian 
communities where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, residents of the halfway house said the fire broke out just a few 
minutes after Enrekus was rattling the windows to get in after curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ellen Berk declined to press charges against Enrekus, 
despite strenuous objections from arson investigator Derek Chew, who said in an 
interview: "We've convicted people with less (evidence)." 
</P>
<P>
 Berk characterized the evidence against Enrekus as "less than circumstantial," 
and urged investigators to try to locate an unnamed witness who reportedly had 
seen him fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrekus asked through an interpreter at the parole hearing: "If I am really 
considered to have started an arson, and this is a criminal offense, why am I 
not being tried in a court of law?" He was returned to prison for a year by 
parole authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 WALTER AUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
 Austin was arrested in April on suspicion of assault with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 He had previous convictions for drugs and weapons, and a prior strike for 
firing a semiautomatic weapon, point-blank, at a victim who backed away begging 
for his life. One of the bullets lodged in the victim's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Theodore Loewen decided that Austin's April arrest would be 
"better handled as (a) parole violation" because the victim failed to make a 
timely report of shots that Austin allegedly fired during a dispute over money. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Officer Christopher Amador, who arrested Austin, agreed that proving an 
assault charge in court would be difficult, but said prosecutors could have 
charged a lesser offense -- ex-convict in possession of a gun -- that could 
have subjected Austin to a seven-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 At his parole hearing, Austin was returned to prison for 10 months, after the 
hearing officer concluded that he had violated parole by possessing a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 HUGO LICEA 
</P>
<P>
 Licea was arrested in May for robbery after he allegedly approached a car, 
reached in the window and grabbed a gold chain from the driver's neck. Licea 
admitted to police that he had asked the victim for money but denied taking 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Licea already had a conviction for selling drugs and one prior strike for 
pulling a knife on a pedestrian, robbing him of his wallet and tearing off his 
gold necklace. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Loewen declined to prosecute Licea in May, noting that 
police did not recover the chain and that the only witness was a friend of the 
suspect's. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was cooperative and testified at Licea's parole revocation hearing, 
where it was determined that Licea had committed robbery. He was returned to 
prison for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Licea's parole agent, Michael Mays, said, "If the D.A. had . . . convicted him 
in court he'd have a second strike, and he could get life next time" that he is 
convicted of a felony.

STATE'S BUDGET MESS: WILL IT EVER CLEAR UP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When California's Republican governor and the Democrats who control the 
Legislature struck a deal to pass the budget in 1991, they declared that they 
had erased a $14-billion shortfall and put the state on the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 That road turned out to be a dead-end street. 
</P>
<P>
 A recession that the state's leaders assumed would be short instead became a 
major economic downturn. What they perceived as a momentary gap between tax 
revenue and spending was in reality a long-term imbalance that dogs the state 
to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it seems clear that the next governor -- either a reelected Republican 
Pete Wilson or his Democratic challenger, Kathleen Brown -- will confront stark 
choices as he or she prepares a proposed budget that must be delivered to the 
Legislature by Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, the options are simple: either raise taxes, cut the cost of 
services, or enact some combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a deeper sense, California's leaders face profound decisions about the 
future of a state that once was a model for the nation in many areas but now 
struggles to reconcile an ever-rising demand for public services and an 
electorate reluctant to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The public schools, losing ground to inflation, increasingly must rely on 
donations from parents to buy everything from pencils to toilet tissue. The 
universities, which once charged only nominal fees, now cost thousands of 
dollars a year. Highways, water systems and parks haven't kept up with the 
demands of a growing population. And the safety net for those who fall through 
the cracks is far less generous than it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 Some question whether the state's leaders have the political will to solve 
these daunting challenges. But even those who are eager to take on the job say 
they are hamstrung by an array of restrictions that a suspicious electorate has 
enacted over the years to limit the flexibility of those they elect to govern 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of all these factors, the state has careened from one budget 
crisis to another, raising taxes one year, cutting services the next, shifting 
property tax and sales tax revenue around to plug fiscal leaks in local 
government and the schools. One thing the state has not done is balance the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the Depression has the state run up this much red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no fiscal policy in the state of California," says Assemblyman 
Philip Isenberg of Sacramento, a centrist Democrat. "We've adopted a deliberate 
and intentional policy to spend money we don't have -- and to borrow to pay for 
it. It doesn't take a genius to figure that one out." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993-94 fiscal year ended in June with a deficit of nearly $2 billion. To 
put that figure in perspective, consider that the state could cut $200 per 
student from school funding, release 10,000 felons from the prisons and cut 
welfare grants by 20% -- and still not erase its shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be surprising, then, that the election-year budget adopted by the 
Legislature and signed by Gov. Pete Wilson in July did little to bring the 
state's books closer to balancing. By the middle of 1996, in fact, the deficit 
is expected to grow to more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a far cry from 1987, when the state's revenues were growing so fast 
that the constitutional spending limit forced the rebate of more than $1 
billion to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1987 and 1991, the state's general fund tax receipts kept growing at a 
4% annual clip. But spending climbed even faster, at a rate of more than 6%. 
Welfare caseloads, subsidized health care rolls and the number of state prison 
inmates all were growing faster than either the economy or the state's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 In three out of four years, the government spent more money than it took in. 
And those were the good times. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bottom fell out of the state's economy, and the budget went south 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 A worldwide recession coupled with deep reductions in federal military 
spending cost the state a half million jobs -- and the taxes those wage earners 
would have been paying. In 1992, per capita personal income in California fell 
for the first time in half a century, an ominous signal of just how bleak 
things had become in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, most policy-makers thought California was in the midst of a typical 
slump in the business cycle that would last a year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in his first year in office, tried to bridge the gap with a 
combination of tax increases, budget cuts and onetime bookkeeping shifts. The 
governor and the Legislature raised the income and sales taxes and slapped 
higher levies on automobiles and alcohol while raising college fees, cutting 
welfare grants and suspending automatic cost-of-living increases. 
</P>
<P>
 These steps reduced the shortfall, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
 In the following year's budget, Wilson and the Legislature avoided tax 
increases, shifted part of the problem to local government, held the line on 
education spending and took another slice out of health and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 But these measures also failed to erase the stubborn shortfall, and since then 
the state has been rolling much of its deficit forward from one year to the 
next while trying to keep it from growing any larger. The current budget is 
financed with the help of billions in loans that the state, as of now, lacks 
the resources to repay. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting debt, while viewed widely as fiscally irresponsible, probably 
represents an accurate reading by politicians of the one fiscal course they can 
chart that will alienate the fewest voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the plunge in Wilson's public approval rating after the huge 1991 
tax increase, the electorate is in no mood to hand over more of its income to 
the government. But the alternative -- cutting services -- is no more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizens want something for nothing," says John Ellwood, a professor of 
public policy at UC Berkeley. "They have been led by public officials of both 
parties to think they can get more services without raising taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, policy-makers have been given less freedom to make fiscal 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, voters passed Proposition 13, which capped property taxes at 1% of 
assessed values, limited increases and required a two-thirds vote of the 
Legislature to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later came Proposition 98, which sets aside about 40% of the budget 
for kindergarten through community college education programs. It takes a 
two-thirds vote of the Legislature to suspend that requirement, and even then, 
any money that is diverted must be repaid to the schools when good times 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Other restrictions written into law: Revenue from a 25-cent-a-pack tobacco tax 
is dedicated mainly for health care for the poor. Motor vehicle license fees 
must go to local government. Gasoline taxes are for roads. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 While the general fund, which pays for most programs, this year amounts to 
about $42 billion, another $12 billion is set aside in special pots of money 
that cannot be diverted without changing the law, often with the approval of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the money not restricted by state law must be spent according to the 
federal dictates that come when the state accepts money from Washington for 
programs such as Medi-Cal and Aid to Families with Dependent Children. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts, meanwhile, already are telling the state how much it must spend on 
dental care for the poor and may soon set policy for the health care of state 
prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that in a situation of fiscal emergency, the state has one 
hand and four fingers tied behind its back," said Tracy Westin, executive 
director of the California Citizens Budget Commission, a self-appointed group 
reviewing the budget process. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin added: "The state doesn't have enough information to make intelligent 
decisions and doesn't have enough flexibility to make rational decisions. It's 
in a straitjacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the fractious administration of many government programs makes it 
difficult to improve their efficiency. The state and federal governments, for 
example, split the tab for welfare grants and set most of the rules, but the 
program is run by the counties. The people closest to the service, in other 
words, are those who have the least to do with paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you think welfare needs fixing, do you go to the counties that offer the 
service or the state, which sets the grant levels, or Congress, which pays for 
half of it? 
</P>
<P>
 "The connection between spending and results has become very difficult for 
citizens to ascertain," said Elizabeth Hill, the nonpartisan state legislative 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiscal situation has gotten so bad that many people believe the public is 
ready to accept a fundamental restructuring of the way government finance works 
in California. A bipartisan commission recently began a review of the state 
Constitution that is expected to include a close look at ideas to help 
policy-makers fix the budget mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our elected officials need to be given the freedom to fund state programs at 
whatever level they believe appropriate, and then they ought to be held 
accountable by the voters for the decisions that they've made," said Steven 
Merksamer, who got a firsthand look at the problem as chief of staff to former 
Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 But any changes in the process will come too late to help whoever wins this 
governor's race fashion the next budget. It probably will be at least 1996 
before any revisions can be put before the voters. Even then, getting enough 
political support to make such changes may prove difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Isenberg said he fears the problem is so bad as to be almost 
insoluble. The state will be lucky to be back on its feet before the next 
recession hits, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financial consequences of our irresponsibility are going to haunt the 
next governor for the next four years," he said. "Most of the money that will 
come from a modest economic recovery will be used to pay off old debt. We won't 
be able to do anything new or better or different without some very bold 
steps." About This Series 
</P>
<P>
 In the heat of a gubernatorial campaign, the candidates sometimes dwell on 
matters that have little to do with the larger problems facing Californians in 
the years ahead. This series looks beyond the rhetoric. The initial story set 
the stage by exploring the limits -- and possibilities -- of gubernatorial 
power. Other installments in the series: 
</P>
<P>
 * Earlier this month: The living conditions of California's poorest citizens 
-- and what they augur for the state's future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Yesterday: Are demographic forces reshaping California more quickly than the 
political system can react? 
</P>
<P>
 * Today: Can the state government solve its budget problems and provide for 
future growth? 
</P>
<P>
 * Economy and education: Are California's schools providing an underpinning 
for the state's economic future? 
</P>
<P>
 * Environment: How will California balance environmental protection against 
the pressures of economic need? State of the State: the Budget 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY 
</P>
<P>
 * Deficits: State spending has exceeded revenue in six of the past seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Debt: The state will borrow $7 billion to finance its budget over the next 
two years but lacks the resources to pay it all back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Credit: The state's credit rating has been downgraded by Wall Street, 
forcing taxpayers to pay more when the state borrows to cover its deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consequences: The budget remains out of balance despite a record tax 
increase in 1991, cuts to local government, universities, and health and 
welfare services to the poor, and austere funding levels that have forced 
kindergarten through community college education to lose ground to inflation.

<P>
 KATHLEEN BROWN 
</P>
<P>
 "Fairness, it seems to me, ought to be a fundamental principle in balancing 
the budget. Pete Wilson has balanced the budget not only on the backs of higher 
education but also on the poor." 
</P>
<P>
 "No new taxes. We cannot afford new taxes in this recessionary environment." 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic recovery cannot be achieved through collective denials of this 
deficit. It will only be realized when our leaders tell the truth to 
California's taxpayers and offer responsible, common sense solutions that will 
help us begin building for the economic prosperity the people of California 
expect and deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 PROPOSALS 
</P>
<P>
 * Roll all of the state's short-term debt into a single bond that would be 
repaid over five years with annual payments of about $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extend for five years an income tax surcharge on wealthiest California 
residents that is due to expire at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate tax deductions for lobbying expenses and club dues, extend sales 
tax to catalogues printed in California, withhold state taxes from payments to 
independent contractors as is now done with salary and wages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut welfare grants 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut 3% a year from projected growth in state programs not protected by the 
Constitution -- including prisons and higher education.

<P>
 PETE WILSON

 "When I took office four years ago, our state budget was a runaway train 
headed for a wreck. We turned it around. We haven't just slowed the growth of 
government, we actually cut the size of government."

 "We were on auto-pilot spending. We've cut spending by more than any state in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have sent a clear message to the citizens of this state that their

NEWS ANALYSIS; SMALLER WAR CHEST MAY BOX IN U.S. MILITARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is rapidly approaching a major crossroads in the 
battle over its defense strategy: whether to abandon its plan to cut the size 
of the armed services still further or risk damaging military preparedness at a 
time when it is frequently resorting to military intervention in hot spots 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the military budget and the size of the armed forces have declined 
sharply, the number of missions on which U.S. troops are being sent has been 
soaring -- Haiti, Cuba, Rwanda and the Persian Gulf in the last year alone, and 
now possibly Bosnia and the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parts of the military plainly have been stretched thin -- with sometimes 
disastrous results, such as the mistaken downing of two Army helicopters by 
U.S. F-15s over Iraq in April. 
</P>
<P>
 There are pockets in each service where military preparedness has begun to 
slip. All the services began running short of money just before the end of the 
fiscal year. Navy pilots suddenly saw their training flights halved. Army units 
had to cancel key practice maneuvers. Maintenance schedules were cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration fiscal strategists had always known that downsizing the 
military would prove a bumpy process. But they had hoped to avoid any really 
serious crunch through an intricate juggling of some major elements of the 
defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long run, they plan to boost the effectiveness of the nation's 
rapidly shrinking fighting force by supplying it with more sophisticated 
weapons, such as laser-guided bombs, and equipping it to deploy far more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 That ultimately would require added spending. But defense planners had hoped 
to get around that by temporarily cutting back on big weapon programs until the 
Pentagon could capitalize on projected savings from base closings and reform of 
the purchasing system. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that those savings are proving more elusive than the 
Administration had expected, and the President's propensity to deploy troops is 
driving up the military's operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States will get back from its allies part of the money 
that the Pentagon has spent on international peacekeeping, much of it will be 
siphoned from the services' day-to-day operating budgets, crimping training and 
threatening military preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also has been hit with the added cost of a congressionally 
mandated military pay raise that the Pentagon had doggedly omitted from any of 
its previous long-term budget planning. 
</P>
<P>
 What all this adds up to is a gap of $40 billion to $140 billion between what 
the military says it needs in the next five years and what it expects to have 
on hand under current budget projections. 
</P>
<P>
 While the lower end of the range -- an average of $8 billion a year in budget 
cuts -- may seem modest in an annual Pentagon budget of $260 billion, defense 
experts say it is magnified by the combination of previous years' budget cuts 
and mounting demands on the military. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many analysts say they believe that Clinton will be forced to 
decide this year whether to provide more defense money to finance the armed 
forces properly or sharply restrict the number of times that he sends troops 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that the force that (Clinton) has designed is no longer affordable 
without some sort of major mid-course correction," said Don M. Snider, a former 
Pentagon planner now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a 
centrist defense-monitoring group. ". . . Either he's going to have to use the 
military less or he's going to have to generate more savings -- by closing a 
lot more bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew F. Krepinevich, director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan 
defense-monitoring group, foresees tough choices for Clinton. "Ultimately, he 
may have to decide whether to cut domestic programs or raise taxes," 
Krepinevich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Military preparedness is a special concern. Retired Gen. Edward C. Meyer, Army 
chief of staff in the early 1970s, warned that readiness "does not decline 
gracefully" under the influence of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he said, preparedness worsens gradually and then plummets. When that 
happened 20 years ago, he called the result the "hollow forces" -- a large 
military that wasn't very effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's activist foreign policy has heightened the risk. Because combat 
troops are on the go more than they were during the Cold War, the military's 
tanks, planes and ships require much more maintenance -- and will need earlier 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 The "operating tempo," as the military calls it, is also straining military 
personnel and their families. Soldiers and Marines returning from duty in 
Somalia were abruptly sent off to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 There are already some signs that the strains are taking a toll. New surveys 
show a decided decline in re-enlistment. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, Pentagon planners worry that the perpetual high-gear pace in 
some military units may be affecting performance. The air controllers involved 
in the helicopter downing over Iraq, for example, had been deployed away from 
home far longer than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has pledged to "hold the line" on military cuts beyond those he has 
already proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a limit to how much we cut our national defense and still protect 
the security of America and the vital interests of America, and I tell you that 
I think we have reached that limit," he told a business group. "We have cut 
defense all we can." 
</P>
<P>
 But the President's budget already calls for a full 10% decline in defense 
spending during the next two years, after inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department's civilian leaders, straining for ways to cut spending 
in fiscal 1996, ironically are beginning their cuts with the same weapon 
development programs that they had hoped would help the military keep its edge 
in the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo in August, Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch ordered the 
services to submit plans for possible delay or even cancellation of 10 big 
development programs, including the Air Force's F-22 advanced fighter and the 
Navy's new attack submarine. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry has vowed to protect readiness and such 
quality-of-life issues as the number of days that service personnel must spend 
on overseas deployment each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But some military analysts say they fear that cutting research, weapon 
programs and training now will only risk eroding military preparedness even 
more.

VOTERS RELUCTANT TO CREDIT CLINTON FOR RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Working Americans to Bill Clinton: Yes, Mr. President, it's still the economy. 
But it's hard to believe in a recovery that you can't see or feel. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become perhaps the biggest puzzle in this extraordinary election 
season. The recovery appears to be in full swing but Americans aren't giving 
Clinton and his fellow Democrats much credit for it. If the economy is going so 
well, why are so many voters in such a foul mood? 
</P>
<P>
 The politicians and pundits might be stumped by the mysterious absence of a 
Clinton economic bounce this year, but some economists believe that they have 
found the answer. And it is a surprisingly simple one: For the typical American 
family, they say, things aren't so great after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatively robust growth of the economy and the drumbeat of positive 
economic reports emanating from Washington mask an underlying and far more 
troubling trend: American wages, benefits and living standards have continued 
to slide during the first two years of Clinton's presidency, even as many 
workers are putting in longer hours at less secure jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, American businesses are enjoying booming profits and surging 
productivity. But most of the rewards are going to a relatively narrow slice of 
the electorate -- highly educated, affluent households -- while the typical 
American family continues to tread water. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the corporate cost-cutting and layoffs that have been the 
hallmark of the early 1990s have left deep scars on worker psyches, making them 
more fearful of the future and less willing to pressure employers for bigger 
salaries and better benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder that most Americans aren't impressed when they hear Clinton and 
his advisers tout the recovery, which has increased the economy's annual growth 
to 3.7% since Clinton took office, or the beneficial effects of the 
Administration's economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's mysterious at all," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at 
Lehman Brothers Global Economics in New York. "There is a squeeze on American 
workers today. . . . Productivity gains and low inflation are coming on the 
backs of American workers. We've got what looks like the healthiest economy in 
decades, but that doesn't sound good if you are working two or three jobs 
without any benefits, and your wife is working, and you're just keeping even 
with where you used to be, and you don't have much leisure time or time for 
your family." 
</P>
<P>
 One troubling piece of evidence was provided this month by the Census Bureau, 
which reported that the median family income declined 1% in 1993, after 
adjusting for inflation. Today, median household income is stuck at its lowest 
level in a decade, down more than 7% from its 1989 peak. The steady erosion of 
household income has continued unabated since the recovery officially began 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changes in income is a better barometer of political trends than national 
unemployment rates or changes in the national economic growth rate," said Jack 
Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont. 
"Income is what Ronald Reagan was talking about when he asked: 'Are you better 
off than you were four years ago?' " 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Los Angeles Times Poll suggests that Americans are riven with 
economic anxiety. Of those surveyed, 50% said they disapprove of Clinton's 
handling of the economy and 63% said they think the economy is on shaky ground. 
Only 41% said they believe that a recovery is under way, while 53% said they 
believe that the economy is still mired in recession, and 75% said they are 
convinced that the unemployment rate in their communities will remain about the 
same or get worse in the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some findings seem to defy reality. Although the economy has created 
approximately 4.8 million new jobs since December, 1992, and the jobless rate 
has dropped from 7.6% to 5.9%, only 20% of those polled said they believe that 
the unemployment situation is improving. (The survey, supervised by Times Poll 
Director John Brennan, queried 1,272 adults, including 1,016 self-identified 
registered voters, from Oct. 17 to Oct. 19. The margin of sampling error was 
plus or minus 3 percentage points.) 
</P>
<P>
 Without widespread appreciation of his economic accomplishments, some analysts 
believe, Clinton becomes vulnerable to a host of other voter concerns, from 
controversies concerning his personal affairs to doubts about his leadership 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, some analysts say, the lingering perception of economic 
stagnation seems to be generating a poorly focused sense of anger that is 
directed not just at Clinton but also at Washington as an institution. In their 
view, Clinton is a victim only because he is the latest leader to get in the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has done some good things, but things are just not as good as they 
should be," said Charles Daniel, a 50-year-old mechanical supervisor for a 
construction company in Liberty, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still at the same pace of life that we've been at for the last three 
years. . . . People are still out of work and companies are still moving 
overseas. I've been working steady, I haven't been laid off in four years, but 
I don't have any benefits and I've got to have health coverage through my 
wife's job," said Daniel, who participated in the Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Marvin, a young mother in Ottawa, Kan., expressed similar frustration. 
"I'm really disappointed with what Clinton is doing . . . around here, it just 
doesn't seem to be doing too good. There's still a lot of people laid off 
around here. . . . I've been trying to find a job, but it's really hard for 
someone who hasn't completed college," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This voter antipathy toward Clinton and his economic policies has the White 
House frazzled. Many in the Administration believe that Clinton has been denied 
the rightful political benefits that generally accrue to an incumbent President 
during a period of solid economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides tick off the numbers: three years of declining budget deficits 
for the first time since the Harry S. Truman Administration, an economy 
contributing more than twice as much to world growth as the other six major 
industrialized nations combined and rapid job creation combined with consumer 
inflation that remains below 3% per year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more than 4 million people out there working who weren't working 
before Bill Clinton became President," said Alicia Munnell, assistant Treasury 
secretary for economic affairs. "They have families, and you'd think they would 
be happy. . . . But you don't even see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, recent surveys show that consumer confidence has been rising at the 
same time that many Americans voice deep dissatisfaction with the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know there is a recovery, sort of; they recognize the numbers," said 
political analyst Kevin Phillips. "But they don't see it as a strong recovery, 
or as a recovery that is strong enough to restore their economic standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts are convinced that the recovery's failure to generate any real 
wage growth or narrow the income gap between highly and poorly educated 
Americans explains much of the public's ambivalence toward Clinton's economic 
policies. The striking disconnect between the macro-perspective provided by 
government statistics and the micro-view observed by the public seems to be at 
the heart of Clinton's political troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the numbers contain a note of caution for Republicans. These 
are not the kind of economic trends that typically benefit conservatives. And 
they are not directly addressed by the Republican Party's new "contract with 
America," which calls for a balanced budget amendment and tax cuts for 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders are clearly trying to steal the "middle-class squeeze" 
issue away from Clinton by noting that middle-class families have fared worse 
under Clinton than they did under Reagan. Even so, current economic conditions 
could foster anger with incumbents of either party. 
</P>
<P>
 Other statistics bear out the complaint of many Americans that they seem to be 
working harder but taking home less. The average number of overtime hours U.S. 
workers put in recently hit its highest level since 1970, according to the 
Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Productivity, as measured by hourly output per worker, has zoomed to an 
all-time high, rising 19% since 1980. That's great news for U.S. corporations, 
but it means long, hard days for the average worker. 
</P>
<P>
 While the recovery has created millions of new jobs, at least half of them are 
what economist Sinai terms "soft jobs" -- many are part-time or temporary, pay 
low wages or offer limited benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment at temporary-service agencies as a percentage of the work force is 
at its highest levels in at least a generation, while the number of Americans 
with employer-provided health insurance fell from 62% in 1988 to 57% last year. 
Employment in manufacturing -- a traditional source of high-wage, full-time 
work -- has posted a net decline of 280,000 jobs since the recovery began. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that the majority of people don't have reason to feel good about 
the economy," said Harvard University economist Lawrence Katz. "And most of the 
growth that we are seeing is benefiting people with relatively high levels of 
education and who are already relatively affluent, and that is worsening our 
income gap." 
</P>
<P>
 This growing inequality is based in large part on educational achievement. A 
study issued this month by the Federal Reserve Board shows that the only broad 
population group to experience income growth between 1989 and 1992 were 
higher-income families headed by college graduates. A Census Bureau study shows 
that college-educated workers have suffered only a slight decline in health 
coverage; most of the benefit reductions have befallen poorly educated workers 
in low-skilled jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Administration officials have begun to echo their 
predecessors in the George Bush Administration. Perhaps the White House hasn't 
communicated its accomplishments clearly enough, they say, or perhaps Americans 
should show more patience and give the recovery -- and Clinton's policies -- 
more time to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the message hasn't been heard, or maybe this wasn't a typical recession 
and we haven't had a typical recovery," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chief of the 
Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the President talked in 1992 about how Americans were working more for 
less, and you can't change a trend like that -- which has been going on for 15 
years -- in a period of 20 months," she said. "We have put the recovery on a 
strong foundation, and now we have begun a strategy to deal with the economy's 
long-term problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House recognizes that such assurances won't help much in this fall's 
elections. So Administration officials are eager to prove to impatient voters 
that their policies are beginning to improve the lot of all Americans; the 
Administration recently released a preliminary study showing that more jobs in 
high-wage industries were created in the first few months of 1994 than in the 
past five years combined. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, White House officials point out that last year's expansion of the 
earned-income tax credit for the working poor, which took effect in April, will 
provide significant relief for 15 million working families when they receive 
big tax refunds next spring. Other Clinton programs are just now kicking in as 
well. His re-employment and retraining initiatives for the long-term 
unemployed, for example, began to pump money into state programs in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democratic leaders, express hope that voters will soon judge Clinton's 
economic policies more objectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are grudgingly beginning to see that progress is being made," 
said Rep. Vic Fazio, (D-West Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee. "As the public takes a second look at 
Republicans, I think they will be interested in seeing that our progress 
continue."

COLUMN ONE; SPILL LEAVES OIL, FISH ON THE SKIDS; THE FUTURES OF ALASKA'S 
BIGGEST REVENUE PRODUCER AND ITS LARGEST EMPLOYER LOOK GRIM. VIRTUALLY ALL THE 
STATE'S RESIDENTS ARE SUFFERING IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE PETROLEUM DISASTER.

<P>
 It was the tail end of winter in 1989 -- the deer season given out, herring 
beginning to spawn their succulent roe -- when the rhythm of economic life 
changed permanently in this traditional Native Alaskan village. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Vlasoff and her neighbors heard about the Exxon Valdez spill from -- 
where else? -- "Good Morning, America." Though less than five miles from the 
spreading crude, they could only guess that emergency crews had tried to burn 
the oil off the water when acrid smoke rolled through their homes and past the 
sky-blue cupolas of the Russian Orthodox church. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, "people haven't been able to handle the stress," Vlasoff recalled 
recently. "Now we'll never be the same. Our confidence has been shaken. We had 
a certain way of life." 
</P>
<P>
 From subsistence hunters to investment bankers, virtually all Alaskans have 
found their futures rearranged by the five-year saga that followed the largest 
petroleum spill in North America, dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil in a 
body of water about two-thirds the size of Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-billion court judgment against Exxon Corp. in late summer refocused 
attention among Americans in the Lower 48 on the problems of Alaska's 
fishermen. But Alaskans worry about the deep, potentially long-term harm done 
to the state's two biggest industries, fish and oil. And the state's lifeblood 
oil production has been slowed sooner than everyone had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 After the spill, Congress, facing an angry, skeptical public, dropped all 
notions of allowing oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- 
located atop what appears to be Alaska's last big oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after years of bitter wrangling -- in court and over dinner tables -- 
many in the state that bills itself as the "last frontier" accept the notion 
that Alaska's golden promise of financial opportunity may never be quite the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 In peoples' homes and businesses, changes range from the basic diets of Native 
Alaskans living near the spill to the larger specter of the state's economic 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 In this wrenching adjustment, once-healthy businesses have folded, 
particularly in fishing, the state's biggest employer. Oil industry layoffs 
have become depressingly familiar. New service industries have added jobs, but 
the overall wage rate has dropped. People now routinely attribute their 
divorces partly to financial stress from the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area that seemed to be ignored by Exxon and everyone else was not the 
damage to the land, but to the people," said Stan Stephens, who has owned and 
operated tour boats in Valdez for more than 30 years. "It's been enormous, and 
it goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly in the fishing communities, which had little else to offer 
residents when the salmon and herring disappeared, "You have a whole lot of 
people who don't have anything to do," said Steve Picou, a sociologist who 
studied stress in Prince William Sound communities for four years after the 
1989 disaster. Picou contends that the spill "seriously disrupted the fabric of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, people also adjust and thousands of Alaskans -- including fishermen 
-- made money on the spill cleanup. Certainly some changes wrought by the 
disaster have also been positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Among legislators and business leaders, there is lots of talk -- though little 
action yet -- about diversifying the state's economy. And the U.S. Coast Guard 
and the oil companies are far better prepared for future spills. Mixed 
Blessings 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism was also up 10% this summer over last, as cruise lines cut prices and 
expanded operations in the state. Though traces of the spill remain around the 
sound, including on Knight Island, where some of the first beaches were hit, it 
long ago lost its toxicity and is now mostly out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier this summer, after years of grinding litigation, Exxon was ordered 
to pay $5 billion in punitive damages -- equal to twice this year's state 
government budget -- to Prince William Sound residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever survives Exxon's appeal likely will be divvied up in proportion to 
damages awarded in other trials. But the sound's 10,000 commercial fishermen, 
the largest group of plaintiffs, are expected to see most of it. Most say they 
could use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon runs are notoriously unpredictable. At the moment, the fishermen are 
celebrating a big pink salmon season. "This is really the first good news they 
have had in years," said Joe Sullivan, resource program manager for restoration 
for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are hatchery-grown fish that were spawned in fresh water from the 
surrounding Chugach Mountains. Wild pink salmon, and herring, Prince William 
Sound's other big commercial species, spawn in the sound. They haven't come 
back and seem to be genetically damaged by the oil, according to Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the spill, Tom Lopez has had a hard time of it on his 50-foot salmon 
boat. For three years he couldn't make the boat payments, and he's had to 
support three children by driving a truck for a contractor on the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's a lot leaner," he said of himself and his fellow fishermen. "I 
lost my wife, maybe because of the stress. After the spill, I had to step off 
the boat." And the once-coveted pink salmon fishing permits -- which Lopez says 
traded in the industry for $350,000 the day the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef 
-- can be had today for just $26,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond L. Cesarini, president of Sea Hawk Seafoods, a fish processor in 
Valdez, once had $12 million in annual sales. After the spill, that was cut in 
half, then to nothing, for lack of fish and workers willing to clean salmon for 
$7 an hour. Cleaning oily rocks paid $17. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 10,000 people working on the oil spill," he said recently, "it was hard 
to find help." And one bad year leaves no savings to buy fish the next season. 
"You're out of money, honey," Cesarini said. Boom to Bust 
</P>
<P>
 Cesarini's wife, also his business partner, left him in 1990. Even a deal to 
sell his plant -- to be turned into a marine mammal rehabilitation center in 
the event of another spill -- has fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Alaskans in the sound are still waiting for their seal, sea lion and 
ducks to return. While they do, they have to generate cash to buy more 
store-bought beef, which they don't much like. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tatitlek, a village of just over 100 people where visitors have been 
welcome by invitation only, the need for cash has brought forth a string of 
modest economic development projects. One hope: to attract tourists to their 
postcard-perfect village by enlarging its small dock and port and extending the 
village landing strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying for start-up money from funds set up as a result of earlier spill 
damage suits, as well as a share of the $5-billion Exxon judgment, the village 
hopes it will finance a smoked-fish business, a clam-restoration project and 
expansion of an oyster mariculture operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Martha Vlasoff has left the village and is separated from her 
husband, a subsistence hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that my husband was such a good hunter that . . . if the rest 
of the world was destroyed, we could live off the land," she said recently in a 
small apartment in Cordova. The village now has "a lack of confidence in our 
natural resources," she said. " . . . But it's not the nature of a hunter to 
admit something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But the shift that affects all Alaskans is the accelerated end of the state's 
oil boom. 
</P>
<P>
 As the gigantic Prudhoe Bay oil field plays itself out, efforts have so far 
failed to find another Alaskan "elephant," as the oil industry terms the 
biggest fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The most promising source of new oil -- the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- 
abruptly became off limits to exploration when the nation vented its anger over 
the spill and the environmental havoc it created. 
</P>
<P>
 Exploration in the refuge would literally take an act of Congress. All 
legislation to open the area to drilling died the day after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has agreed to put this in deep freeze," said one industry insider, 
describing the de facto truce between Washington lawmakers and Alaskan 
supporters of the oil companies. "In exchange for us not pushing for it to be 
opened, they won't push to make it so it won't be opened forever." 
</P>
<P>
 When North Slope oil production first began to slacken in 1989, a popular 
bumper sticker read: "Please God, Give Us Another Oil Boom. We Won't Screw This 
One Up." Now, no one finds humor in a hope that has faded like the winter 
sunlight. Alaskans dread a future of economic decline that has already begun, 
as the oil hunt moves overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 All the big companies have been shrinking their Alaska operations. Los 
Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., which dug disappointing test wells in 
Cook Inlet and the Beaufort Sea in recent years, has dramatically cut its 
Alaskan exploration budget even as it announced new investments overseas, not 
the least a $1-billion deal in Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Less and less oil is daily pumped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline from the 
North Slope to Valdez. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil company consortium 
that operates the pipeline and its Valdez loading terminal, just laid off 70 of 
its 1,300 employees and says more job cutbacks are coming. Little Relief in 
Sight 
</P>
<P>
 These are cruel times to a state government 85% dependent on taxes and 
royalties from oil, and to local governments like Valdez. The state of Alaska 
spent its last cash reserves in 1993 and is operating at a deficit, which will 
likely force lawmakers to adopt an income tax. The annual payment to every 
Alaskan from oil revenues -- $900 each, last year -- will also likely be capped 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 As less oil is produced on the North Slope, property values at the Valdez 
terminal decline, eroding the city's tax base. Last year, Valdez lost more than 
$1.5 million in terminal taxes, or more than 6% of its annual budget of $24.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ordinary Alaskans are deeply angry at environmentalists and Lower 48 
politicians for deciding how Alaskans can exploit the state's natural resources 
-- particularly the Arctic refuge. And they're angry at their own leaders 
because no one has come up with an Alaskan solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has a crystal ball about how to deal with this, and our state and 
federal politicians don't plan for the future," said Judy Meidinger, an oil 
industry consultant. "They're going to leave it to the next generation to 
figure out." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, the government and the oil industry are undeniably 
better prepared to deal with oil spills -- and have created a substantial new 
oil spill safety industry in Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet. By most 
accounts, credit goes to the far-reaching federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 
known as OPA 90, that was prompted by the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contingency plan (before the Exxon Valdez spill) was a farce," said a 
federal regulator who declined to be identified. "A lot of OPA 90 has been 
very, very good." Safety Regulations 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agencies overseeing tanker safety still have their critics. Just 
last week, the Natural Resources Defense Council and a host of other 
environmental groups filed suit against the Coast Guard and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to speed up safety improvements required 
by the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, under OPA 90 the Coast Guard now has sharper teeth to oversee tanker 
activities, and better equipment. In Valdez, for example, the Coast Guard is 
about to activate a vessel-tracking system that will give duty officers the 
location within 10 feet of every tanker in the sound. Oil-corralling boom is 
now stored at the waterline near salmon hatcheries and at other sensitive 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Shippers must plan for and practice to contain big spills. Alyeska, the 
pipeline operator, and one or another large oil company hold major drills twice 
a year, with smaller unscheduled tests in-between. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, more than 500 emergency workers were part of the most 
aggressive and elaborate drill that Arco has launched since the Exxon Valdez 
spill. On one team, two community relations workers and a bush pilot braved 
rain-blasting winds across Prince William Sound to bring a satellite phone and 
fax to Tatitlek. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers had tried for days after the Exxon Valdez accident to get a 
telephone call through to the authorities. Today in a spill they would have 
direct contact to the emergency operations center in Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 federal law also brought the residents of Prince William Sound into 
the oil-spill picture. During this drill, Tatitlek sent its own well-trained 
cleanup team to a beach near the simulated oil spill site to help set up pumps, 
skimmers and oil-containment boom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drills mean a lot to us, to be able to get on top of things," said village 
chief Gary P. Kompkoff in his office down the road from the church. In the real 
thing, he said, "rather than relying on outside personnel, we would have direct 
reports from village residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Arco spent as much as $400,000 on this cleanup drill. Capt. Jerry A. Aspland, 
president of Arco Marine Inc., has seen "a tremendous amount of emphasis on 
response and cleanups in the industry," particularly because the costs of 
cleaning up -- and the now-common accompanying lawsuits -- have soared in the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have not witnessed as much emphasis on prevention," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens, the tour boat operator, agrees, noting that even in good conditions, 
only about 10% of any free oil is recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens is also president of a regional citizens advisory committee created 
by the 1990 law. These days, he is most concerned about shippers' crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailors still get drunk, he pointed out, despite tightened drug and alcohol 
testing of all oil-industry crews. The Coast Guard recently charged two escort 
vessel captains with being under the influence of alcohol while on duty. One 
captain nearly died when he fell into icy Valdez harbor trying to jump between 
two docked ships at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem they still haven't solved," Stephens said, "is the human 
element."

ROLLO MAY, PIONEERING PSYCHOLOGIST, DIES AT 85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire and Staff Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rollo May, a founding father of existential and humanistic psychology and the 
man who introduced a generation to the so-called Age of Anxiety, has died here. 
He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 May, who died Saturday, was renowned for his pioneering theories on human 
behavior and for the witty, stylish prose with which his dozen groundbreaking 
books brought psychology to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 May gained fame in the 1950s for his book "The Meaning of Anxiety," in which 
he argued, at the dawn of the Cold War, that mental health did not necessarily 
mean living without anxiety: "As long as it is not out of proportion to a 
situation, anxiety is actually good for you," May wrote, "because there is a 
close relation between anxiety and creativity, originality and intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding on that idea to The Times in 1978, he said, "Civilization itself is 
a result of anxiety. . . . Anxiety has its negatives but it makes life sharp 
and vital. . . . If we allow it to paralyze us, to render us unable to work and 
think, then anxiety is harmful. But we have the option of turning it into an 
energizing force, to solve our problems." 
</P>
<P>
 May's work was much influenced by the German theologian Paul Tillich, in whom 
he found a mentor and friend, said his biographer, Robert Abzug. 
</P>
<P>
 Earning a master of divinity degree in New York in 1938 after studying under 
Tillich, May then spent two years as a Congregationalist minister in New 
Jersey. He left the ministry to seek a doctorate in clinical psychology after 
realizing that his religious training did not adequately equip him to deal with 
his parishioners' problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of May's best-selling books -- "Love and Will," "The Meaning of Anxiety," 
"Power and Innocence" and "Man's Search for Himself" -- attained the status of 
classics over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 May was "a gifted therapist and a writer capable of translating for the lay 
public philosophical and psychological ideas while retaining their richness and 
subtlety," Abzug said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Ada, Ohio, in 1909, May cut the figure of a cosmopolitan philosopher 
during the pinnacle of his fame in the 1960s and 1970s, but his roots were in 
the Protestant heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 After contracting tuberculosis in his 30s -- he was hospitalized for 18 months 
and read theology, psychology and existential philosophy -- he embraced a 
tragic view of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a valuable experience to face death, for in the experience I learned 
to face life," May told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 That insight was developed into "Love and Will," which set forth the idea that 
awareness is not separate from life but is essential to it. May also took 
exception to Freud's argument that man is the prisoner of his own history -- 
making May unpopular with many psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
 The book opened a new era in May's life. It influenced many in the political 
and cultural movements of the civil rights and Vietnam War era. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, May moved to Tiburon, and gained ongoing importance among humanistic 
and existential psychologists as a powerful critic within the profession. He 
moved to personalize therapy sessions according to patients' needs, so they 
could discover their own unique "pattern of potentialities." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1987 gathering of therapists in Berkeley, May charged that the Age of 
Anxiety that he identified in the 1950s had turned into the Age of Despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "One word frees us of all the pain in our lives," he said. "The word is love. 
My theme is that human life begins on the far side of despair." 
</P>
<P>
 At various times, May was a visiting professor at Harvard, Princeton and Yale, 
and in recent years he had often lectured on the progressions of psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 May was surrounded by family and friends during his last hours. He is survived 
by his wife, Georgia, two daughters, a son and a brother.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; VOTERS SAY THEY WANT MORE VISION, LESS VENOM; MEMBERS OF 
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY GROUP CONVENED BY THE TIMES HAVE GROWN WEARY OF NEGATIVE 
CAMPAIGN TACTICS. THEY WANT CANDIDATES TO OFFER CLEAR, CONCISE PLANS FOR 
IMPROVING CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

<P>
 Mary Kranz, fed up with negative political advertising, says she yearns for a 
positive message from the candidates running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kranz, a college librarian, found a copy of Kathleen Brown's 62-page 
economic plan as soon as it was published and stayed up late one night to glean 
its insights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that exciting," Kranz said later. "More money was needed for every 
single thing she was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz's tepid review of Brown's booklet illustrates one problem the state 
treasurer faces as she struggles to overtake Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in the 
final weeks of a contest the Democrat once was expected to win: 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kranz, many California voters say they are tired of what they view as the 
infantile tone of the modern political campaign. But candidates who try to 
elevate the discussion risk having their proposals picked apart by their 
opponents, the press and a skeptical, if not cynical, electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz was among a group of San Fernando Valley voters who gathered in 
Chatsworth last week to discuss politics with a Los Angeles Times reporter and 
editor. It was the second in a series of three meetings for the group, which 
The Times convened to put a human face on the numbers spewed out by public 
opinion polls that sometimes dominate analysis of the campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 While far from a statistically significant sample, the panel includes a mix of 
men and women, Republicans and Democrats, from a variety of backgrounds, and in 
many ways reflects the profile of the swing voters that candidates and 
initiative campaigns must reach to win in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they last met as a group two weeks ago, these voters have grown no less 
angry or frustrated with the political process. They still feel as if no one is 
listening to -- or talking about -- their concerns. More than ever, they want 
candidates to stop slinging mud and instead talk more about where they would 
lead the state if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 As a group, they are still leaning toward Wilson, although they remain open to 
Brown. Some members of the group were more receptive than before to Mike 
Huffington's challenge to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. And they are increasingly 
wary of Proposition 187, the anti-immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But what rankles them most is that they have yet to hear anything they think 
approaches an intelligent discussion of the direction California needs to take 
for the next four years and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like watching 7-year-olds pointing at each other and saying, 'He did 
it,' 'She did it,' 'They did it,' " says Marilynn Bierman of West Hills. "They 
haven't said anything about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Jurick, an aerospace engineer with Hughes Aircraft, does not want to 
hear any more from the governor about how tough he's been on criminals or how 
weak Brown might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It repulses me," Jurick says of Wilson's tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 In a climate such as this, one might assume that a booklet spelling out a 
candidate's proposals in positive terms would be a hit with voters. Indeed, 
almost everyone in the group had heard about Brown's plan for California. But 
only a few had actually seen it and the reaction to it was decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Rothschild, recently laid off from her job as a real estate secretary, 
says she is impressed that Brown took the effort to publish a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it that Kathleen Brown said something, she said she has her plans, she 
would cut waste and apply the money saved to certain programs," said the West 
Hills Democrat. "I don't know that she will do it. But I want somebody to tell 
me what they want to do, and she did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Green, a Northridge lawyer, had not seen the plan. But from what he had 
heard, he had misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it going to increase our taxes?" Green asked. "Normally, the pattern for 
Democrats is they want to increase taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Frame, an accounting manager from Reseda, says she won't read Brown's 
plan because it is too long. The candidate, Frame says, should have been able 
to communicate her platform in a more concise form. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult enough reading the ballot," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For many in this group, Brown appears to have missed the mark. While correctly 
gauging the desire for a positive alternative to Wilson, Brown is dishing up 
details when it is vision that these voters want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about the individual things," says Kranz, the librarian. "In 
three months, the circumstances change and in four years we've forgotten what 
they're arguing over now." 
</P>
<P>
 She adds: "Someone has to come along with a value. . . . You want someone 
saying, this is where we're going, this is our ideal. That's the positive that 
no one is talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 The same theme turned up when the panel discussed the one and only debate 
between Wilson and Brown. About half the group had watched the Oct. 14 debate. 
As viewers, the voters said, they were less interested in the claims and 
charges than they were in the way the candidates carried themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looked well," Rhoda Glassman, a Northridge businesswoman, said of Brown. 
"Her makeup, clothing, posture, everything about her was very, very healthy 
looking. Gov. Wilson kind of looked like Jimmy Carter at the end of his 
presidency. He looked like he had truly aged. He looked tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Corinne Squire-Strompf, a medical transcriptionist from Northridge, thought 
Wilson showed disrespect by referring to Brown as "she" rather than calling the 
candidate by her name or using her title. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, Squire-Strompf said, "seemed almost intolerant of her views. Almost 
like, go away, you really don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 But others thought Brown was too well prepared for her own good. As a group, 
they tended to mark her down because she seemed overly packaged, even 
insincere. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was polished, and that's what I found to be negative," said Toby 
Friedberg, a self-employed Winnetka Democrat. "I didn't like her smug attitude. 
She seemed to have everything rehearsed. Something about the way she presented 
herself turned me off. Wilson just seemed down to earth -- the way he always 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown's use of an anecdote about the date rape of her daughter touched a 
chord with a few of the voters in the group, several more were skeptical. They 
saw this deeply personal revelation as no more than a political tactic to 
combat Wilson's advantage on the crime issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a candidate appeals to a certain group, it always turns me off," said 
Takuro Nakae, a retired engineer from Winnetka who thought the comment about 
rape was intended to win over women voters. "I say, 'What about me? I'm not in 
that group.' The next time, she's going to tell me something I like, but she's 
going to turn someone else off." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Hershman, a contracts manager for Litton Industries, said Brown's use 
of the story reminded him of an old military term: firing for effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, Hershman said, knew she could not overcome Wilson's edge on crime but 
wanted to shake him up anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what I thought it was," Hershman said. "I know I can't hit 
you, but let's see how close I can come." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the criticism of Brown, though, she appeared to have made some headway 
with this group during October. Although all of the participants began the 
project undecided in the governor's race, they went overwhelmingly for Wilson 
when pressed to make a choice at the first meeting. Two weeks later, the 
governor's edge was only 3-2, with the rest either refusing to choose or saying 
they would vote for a minor party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, polls show that Wilson's strong stand against illegal immigration 
and his support for Proposition 187 have been helping him against Brown. But in 
this group, which agrees that illegal immigration is a serious problem, the 
governor's harsh rhetoric on the issue appears to be starting to backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Rothschild says she thought Wilson made sense when she heard him make 
a pitch for the initiative, which seeks to deny public services to illegal 
immigrants. But she felt she had been deceived when she explored the issue 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was all for it until I actually read it," she said. "Now I'm going to vote 
against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Green, the lawyer, calls the measure "probably the dumbest proposition 
I've seen on the ballot in this state for a long time" -- although there is a 
chance he still might vote for it to send a message. And as for Wilson: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed. He is impressing me less and less every time he opens his 
mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the panelists also are taking another look at the U.S. Senate race 
and are considering a vote for Huffington. While they still lean heavily toward 
Feinstein, some said they believed the wealthy Santa Barbara congressman was 
getting a bum rap in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm beginning to feel sorry for him," said Squire-Strompf. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington appears to be benefiting from his unprecedented onslaught of 
television commercials, even though most of them are the negative kind that so 
many panelist say they deplore. 
</P>
<P>
 These voters, for instance, know that Feinstein has voted with President 
Clinton more than 90% of the time, and they are aware that the incumbent 
senator voted to confirm a federal judge who had overturned the death penalty 
of a Florida killer. They learned these things from Huffington's 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, they know that Brown opposes the death penalty, and some question 
her commitment to select tough judges -- points Wilson has made in his ads. 
They even know that one of Brown's economic advisers quit her campaign, and 
they believe he left out of disgust for her plan, which is what a Wilson ad 
implies, though it is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they criticize the negativity, some of these voters acknowledge that 
it's the bad news that sticks most with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody listen to or understands the positive," said Hershman, the contracts 
manager. "So he who throws the stone the farthest gets elected." Another Visit 
With Select Group 
</P>
<P>
 To learn what voters are thinking, The Times, assisted by Davis Research of 
Calabasas, selected a group of San Fernando Valley residents who have voted in 
at least two of the past three elections and were undecided about the race for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The group included a cross-section of voters but was far too small to 
represent a scientific sampling of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The second in a series of discussions took place over dinner provided by The 
Times at its Chatsworth office. The Times intends to talk to the same voters 
one more time before the Nov. 8 election to learn what has made them decide how 
to vote.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN FOCUSES ON CRACKDOWN AT THE 
BORDER; AFTER DECLARING HER OPPOSITION TO PROP. 187, SHE SAYS SHE BELIEVES THE 
IMMIGRATION BATTLE WILL BE WON OR LOST AT THE POINTS OF ILLEGAL ENTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This is the nation's most porous section of international border, and in the 
pitch dark on Saturday night, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein watched as an agent 
demonstrated how a brand-new night-vision scope she voted to fund in Washington 
this year is changing the battle against illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after she announced her opposition to Proposition 187, the ballot 
measure cutting education and health benefits to illegal immigrants, Feinstein 
shifted her attention to the border, where federal officials say millions of 
dollars for new trucks, computers, electronic detection equipment and personnel 
is helping reduce the flow of illegal crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three weeks ago, federal officials launched an ambitious border crackdown 
called Operation Gatekeeper, which quadrupled the night assignment of guards to 
the nation's busiest five-mile stretch of border. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation is so new that its successes have not been advertised. But with 
a close election just two weeks away, good news is not something for which 
Feinstein can wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've been trying to do for two years now, through appropriations, is get 
the Border Patrol the tools they need to do their job," Feinstein said at an 11 
p.m. press conference outside the Imperial Beach Border Patrol station. "Then 
we'll see if the job can get done. I believe it can." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration is such a major issue in California, Feinstein said, that 
she could lose her bid for reelection because she opposes Proposition 187 at a 
time when the measure shows strong support in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator said, however, that she believes the battle over illegal 
immigration will be won or lost at the border. Proposition 187, she argued, is 
unconstitutional and it will not work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anybody think that this proposition puts one new border guard on the 
border?" she asked at a fund-raiser Saturday evening in San Jose, shortly 
before flying south on a campaign jet. "Do you think it sends back one illegal 
immigrant? What it does is it strikes out at children. What it does is put into 
every teacher and every doctor a responsibility of being an immigration agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's Republican challenger, Rep. Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara, 
contends that providing public school classes and health care to illegal 
immigrants is tantamount to a reward for lawbreakers. And according to polls, 
most Californians agree. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Feinstein's campaign has been briefly sidetracked as it has been 
forced to quickly defend a politically unpopular position in the final days of 
a close election. Her strategists expect that it will hurt the campaign -- the 
only question is how much. 
</P>
<P>
 With Saturday's tour, Feinstein was able to demonstrate the changes she thinks 
are more effective than Proposition 187 in addressing the problems caused by 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials proudly showed the senator the busiest spots along the 
border, where hundreds of people used to gather before crossing the mile-wide 
stretch of dry riverbed between the lights of Tijuana and neighborhoods of San 
Ysidro. This time there were only handfuls of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Summers, spokeswoman for the border guard at Imperial Beach, said it is 
still early to tell, but officials estimate a 60% reduction in traffic through 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Operation Gatekeeper, Summers said, between 200 and 300 people were 
apprehended each night at the Imperial Beach station. When the new program 
began Oct. 1, apprehensions jumped to more than 800 and have dropped sharply 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the border stations further east have reported as much as 
three times the normal level of traffic, indicating that the crackdown on the 
beach has forced border crossers to try elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But Summers said that is part of the federal strategy, since at the more 
rural, eastern locations, it takes about three hours for border crossers to 
reach a U.S. neighborhood where they can hide, compared to just minutes along 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, the difference is incredible, it really is," Summers said. "It is 
incredible because it is just so quiet out there. Before, on any other given 
night, you would have seen a lot more people." 
</P>
<P>
 In Feinstein's first stop on the tour, her fourth visit to the border since 
taking office, she saw a demonstration of a new computerized booking operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a room where detainees' names used to be recorded in logs with paper and 
pencil, the job was now done at 16 hastily made plywood computer stations. The 
computers also allowed agents, for the first time, to take fingerprints 
electronically and instantly search criminal records for a match. 
</P>
<P>
 The headquarters also includes a control room where hundreds of seismic 
sensors planted in the ground are monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, riding in a four-wheel-drive station wagon through the rugged terrain, 
Feinstein passed some of the shiny new Chevy Blazers that agents use to patrol 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Summers said, about 20 agents would monitor the five-mile stretch 
of border. Now, there are more than 80 deployed at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 More are expected, she said. Congress has already funded 1,300 additional 
border agents, with most of the deployment assigned to Southern California. So 
far, Summers said, about 74 new agents have recently taken positions in the San 
Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reinforcements, combined with the reassignment of some office staff to 
the field, have already made a difference, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, agents were often "pinned down" as they parked in front of a crowd 
that was waiting for them to leave before it crossed. Then, she said, the 
alarms set off by seismic sensors were often ignored because agents were 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-mile stretch of border is also watched now by three night-vision 
scopes, compared to just one previously. Some are mounted on tripods. The 
$156,000 model Feinstein viewed had a turret-mounted camera on top of a 
four-wheel-drive vehicle that was monitored by a video screen in the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope, purchased from the Defense Department, could spot a person crossing 
in the dark more than three miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The border, I can tell you, is just night-and-day different," Feinstein said 
after her tour. "The operation is very dramatic and very much improved."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN FIRES UP CAMPAIGN STYLE; THE DEMOCRATIC 
CHALLENGER, WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED AS TOO CONSERVATIVE, TAKES ON WILSON AND 
PROP. 187 IN A FREE-WHEELING NEW APPROACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a fiery speech to teachers union supporters Sunday, Democrat Kathleen Brown 
branded Republican Pete Wilson as a cynical career politician who will do 
anything to get reelected and who is pitting Californians against one another 
on the emotional issue of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, assumed an aggressive, free-wheeling campaign 
approach that she claimed will defy the opinion polls and the pundits and carry 
her to victory on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget precision campaign strategy, she told a cheering crowd of about 650 
local and regional leaders of the California Teachers Assn. in the ballroom of 
a hotel near San Francisco International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the time to motivate and mobilize undecided or uncertain Democrats to 
go to the polls, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major criticisms of the Brown campaign for months has been that it 
was far too conservative in hewing to a careful strategy aimed at middle-class 
California voters. As part of that scenario, Brown the candidate often came 
across as overly controlled, tentative and programmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her appeal, which is heavy on budget cuts to keep the state solvent, was also 
failing to inspire traditional Democratic constituencies such as liberals and 
minority groups, her critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shift over this past weekend was Brown's seizure of Proposition 187 as 
a potentially winning issue, by aggressively opposing the ballot measure that 
would cut off state-funded health and education services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has never made a secret of her opposition to Proposition 187, but rarely 
mentioned it in her prepared speeches and often discussed it only after being 
asked by audiences or reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But opposition to Proposition 187 -- and sharp criticism of Wilson by virtue 
of his support of the measure -- was a keystone of Brown speeches to partisan 
and supportive audiences both Saturday night and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown gave a preliminary address at a fund-raising event featuring President 
Clinton in San Francisco on Saturday night. There, she joined both Clinton and 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein in criticizing Proposition 187. Feinstein came out in 
opposition to the measure late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown aide said campaign polls had shown support for Proposition 187 
"dropping like a rock" over the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
 After her California Teachers Assn. speech Sunday, Brown was asked whether she 
thought Proposition 187 had become the defining issue of the 1994 campaign, 
which has been dominated by crime up to now. 
</P>
<P>
 She replied that it is one of many issues, but then she added that Wilson is 
"a career politician who has used the issues of crime and immigration cynically 
just to keep his political taxpayer-paid job." 
</P>
<P>
 In her speech, Brown accused Wilson of using his campaign to "divide us and 
identify us by the color of our skin, by our last name and the accents we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 "And it causes people to start to look at people differently, instead of 
looking at people and saying, 'They're Californians, and they're Americans and 
they're people.' We need to have a governor who is going to reach out and play 
upon those things that will pull us together again, bring us together and 
inspire our hopes -- not play on our fears . . . our anger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most statewide polls have shown Californians strongly behind Proposition 187 
-- overwhelmingly, its backers claimed. The measure has been a bedrock campaign 
issue, along with crime, for Wilson, who has sued the federal government for 
compensation for the nearly $3 billion he says it costs the state to provide 
education, health care and other services to people who are in the country and 
the state illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has said Wilson's posture is cynical because as a U.S. senator, he voted 
for the federal law that requires states to provide such services. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Proposition 187's opponents -- including the California 
Teachers Assn., have become much more vocal and have launched an advertising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 This past week, many GOP conservatives were surprised when former Republican 
Cabinet members Jack Kemp and William Bennett announced their opposition to the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In her attack on the ballot proposal, Brown said it would do nothing to 
control the U.S.-Mexico border or crack down on employers who hire illegal 
immigrants, nor would it save any money. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for comment, Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur said, "It is disturbing that a 
candidate for statewide office like Kathleen Brown would intentionally blur the 
distinctions between legal immigration and illegal immigration for her 
political agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "Most Californians understand that legal immigration is something to 
be applauded, to be rewarded. But illegal immigration is not. The people of 
California understand the difference and that's why she is losing this 
campaign."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: POLITICIANS LAY OUT CARDS IN PROP. 187 GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's voters are getting lectures and advice from every political angle 
and corner of the country on Proposition 187. They're being told it will spread 
TB, cost the state billions and smacks of Nazi Germany. They're also being told 
that is all hogwash and that 187 is the only way to message Washington they're 
sick of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The political heavies now have weighed in -- the latest being President 
Clinton -- and you can tell Washingtonians by their language. They're the 
pundits and politicians who speak of Californians backing 187 as "nativists." 
</P>
<P>
 An example: the surprise joint statement last Wednesday by Washington think 
tankers William J. Bennett and Jack F. Kemp, who inferred that 187 "would help 
contribute to a nativist, anti-immigrant climate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, for one, began loudly arguing early last year that 
unless tough steps are taken to control illegal immigration, there will be a 
nasty backlash against all immigrants. But on Friday she said one such step 
should not be 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians who had been hiding their Proposition 187 cards suddenly started 
showing them last week. The question is whether voters were paying much 
attention and, more precisely, whether it will change their attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus of political strategists I've talked to is that 187 likely will 
pass, but many voters probably are rethinking their views and the measure may 
not carry by as big a margin as polls have indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters tend to resent lectures from the Establishment, whether it be from 
politicians, professors, pundits or prominent people in town. But the preaching 
invariably is heard, if not always heeded. And the opposition will have a lot 
more money to broadcast its message than will the 187 sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The card playing started with the "conscience" statement of conservatives 
Bennett, the former education secretary, and Kemp, the ex-housing secretary who 
is plotting a presidential race. Theirs was a wild card because it came out of 
nowhere and put them in conflict with many Republican allies. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued, among other things, that the 187 provision requiring school and 
health officials to report people they "reasonably suspect" of being illegal 
immigrants is "a highly intrusive Big Brother approach" and "profoundly 
anti-conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 But while condemning candidates who back 187 for "political advantage," they 
also offered political advice: The GOP shouldn't be seen as "turning away 
immigrants . . . Asians, Hispanics and others" or it could pay a long-term 
"political cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning away illegal immigrants ostensibly is every politician's goal, whether 
they're for or against 187. But politicians think politically. And the real 
goal for most is attractive posturing and/or survival in the face of strong 
public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, however, was "speaking from the heart," advisers say. Whatever, he 
undoubtedly hurt himself with party activists who are pushing 187. The Los 
Angeles native has been banking on a victory in the 1996 California primary to 
win the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Commented Gov. Pete Wilson of Kemp and Bennett: "When you spend too much time 
in an ivory tower think tank, you begin to lose touch with reality. . . . 
They're wrong because they have failed to make the distinction between legal 
and illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson intends to do just that in a new TV ad starting today. It will say 
there's a right way and a wrong way to immigrate; people should play by the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of 187, of course, argue the measure does nothing to control the 
border, and it's foolish and mean-spirited to deny public schooling and health 
care to illegal immigrants. Backers contend these services are incentives and, 
in any case, it's unfair to force taxpayers to provide benefits for people who 
do slip into the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Kemp and Bennett announced their opposition, Rep. Mike Huffington 
immediately curried the favor of 187 backers by declaring his support. He also 
jabbed at Feinstein for not taking a stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Feinstein came out against 187, noting this could cost her the 
election. An early crusader against illegal immigration, she nevertheless found 
187 offensive. But she delayed her announcement for weeks to reduce the time 
Huffington would have to attack her position in TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore and, then, President Clinton proclaimed 
their opposition. So did several California corporate heads and hundreds of 
striking Pacoima middle school students. Commentator Patrick J. Buchanan 
endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
 For politicians, this is political. But for regular people, it's very 
personal. Many may not decide their vote until they enter the quiet privacy of 
a ballot booth.

U.S. TRANSLATOR KILLED IN HAITI; ARISTIDE MULLS CHOICE FOR PREMIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Miami man working as a translator for the international police force here 
was electrocuted Sunday, the first accidental death in the multinational effort 
to restore Haiti's elected government. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Presidential Palace, meanwhile, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was 
choosing a new prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 His top candidate, interim Foreign Minister Claudette Werleigh, was ruled out 
because of her leftist bent, and Aristide was leaning toward a prominent 
businessman to replace caretaker Prime Minister Robert Malval, who resigned in 
December, a source close to the government said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide was expected to meet Sunday with the leaders of Haiti's upper and 
lower houses, Chamber of Deputies President Frantz-Robert Monde, a political 
opponent, and Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis, a supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Aristide had favored Werleigh to be the new prime minister, but 
encountered such resistance from political opponents that he was considering a 
longtime associate in the business community -- a choice intended to placate 
the fears of business people. 
</P>
<P>
 The death Sunday of Elder Rousseau, 42, was the fourth American death since 
U.S.-led forces arrived Sept. 19. The other three were American servicemen who 
took their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosseau was killed when he accidentally came in contact with a live electrical 
wire about 3:30 a.m. as he patrolled with U.S. military police and Haitian 
police officers, according to Paul Browne, deputy director of the monitoring 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Rousseau, of North Miami, was hired by Dyncorp, a Miami firm providing 
translators for international police monitors under a contract with the State 
Department, Browne said.

BIOGRAPHY REVEALS CHARLES' AFFAIRS WITH OLD FLAME; BRITAIN: THE PRINCE TURNED 
TO CAMILLA PARKER-BOWLES FOR THIRD TIME WHEN HIS MARRIAGE BROKE DOWN, BOOK 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, had three affairs with Camilla 
Parker-Bowles over a 20-year period, according to excerpts from his authorized 
biography published here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles also initiated the separation from his wife, Princess Diana, two years 
ago because he thought he was being denied access to his two sons, William and 
Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations published in the London Sunday Times were contained in 
journalist Jonathan Dimbleby's book on the prince, who reportedly cooperated 
with Dimbleby's research and gave approval to friends to talk to the writer. 
</P>
<P>
 The book says that Charles had an affair with Camilla Shand in 1972 when she 
was single and he was a 23-year-old naval officer. The romance ended when he 
was on an eight-month cruise on his warship and she decided to marry an army 
officer, Andrew Parker-Bowles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charles-Camilla romance resumed in the late 1970s, according to Dimbleby, 
and ended only when he became engaged to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince once again turned to his old flame at the end of 1986 when his 
marriage to Diana had "irretrievably broken down" because of what he considered 
her difficult, neurotic personality, Dimbleby writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles was said to have made it clear that he was not unfaithful with any 
other woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the revelations in the excerpts were the prince's avowal that he has 
never considered giving up his succession to the throne and that the Archbishop 
of Canterbury, head of the Church of England, believes Charles can become king 
even if he divorces and remarries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not once," says the account, "even in moments of despair over his personal 
life and the media coverage of it, did he contemplate surrendering what he has 
always thought to be an inescapable duty, nor has he ever favored abdication." 
</P>
<P>
 The book points out Charles' insecurity as a young man. His first serious 
romance was with Lucia Santa Cruz, whom he met at Cambridge University and who 
introduced him to Camilla Shand. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that self-doubt and sensitivity which made him so beguiling to women," 
Dimbleby writes, "he had already confided to his intimates that he could not 
conceive that anyone he might hope to marry would want to marry him. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Camilla Shand, however, he dared to hope that he had stumbled across a 
resolution to that conundrum." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Telegraph reported that the prince now regrets his decision to 
cooperate with Dimbleby on the authorized biography. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles was said to be concerned that the views expressed in the book by 
members of his circle or by Dimbleby are being mistaken for his own -- 
especially those about his relations with his parents and his wife.

BRITAIN DENIES ASSURING LEADER ABOUT IRISH UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Irish nationalist leader Martin McGuinness claimed here Sunday that he had 
received private assurances from the British government last year that it was 
working toward a united Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuinness' explosive statement came in a BBC television interview during his 
first visit to Britain since Prime Minister John Major lifted an exclusion 
order on him Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican 
Army, declared Sunday that early last year he had met with a government 
official who spoke with "the full authority of the British prime minister and 
the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Patrick Mayhew. There is no doubt 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 McGuinness refused to identify the official or indicate whether he was a 
politician or civil servant, but he added, "I think the British government is 
slowly disengaging from Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayhew immediately denied McGuinness' claims, declaring, "This is patent 
nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 "No British government representative," he said, "has ever been or will ever 
be authorized to say that we support a united Ireland unless it is by the 
consent of the people of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it is for the people of Northern Ireland to decide the future of 
Northern Ireland. So long as it is their wish to remain in the United Kingdom, 
the British government will uphold that wish. This has always been our 
position, and it will never change." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since December's Downing Street Declaration by Major and Irish Prime 
Minister Albert Reynolds, Northern Ireland unionists have worried that some 
secret deal may have been made to encourage the current IRA cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Major has repeatedly insisted that no secret agreements have been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The British view Sunday night appeared to be that McGuinness was engaged in 
"mischief-making," as one official put it, aimed at reassuring IRA hard-liners 
who are still not convinced that they should participate in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Major and Reynolds will meet in Britain today to discuss the next step in the 
complex process of setting up all-party talks and an agenda on the future of 
Northern Ireland.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: KEMP STILL WONDERING WHERE HE FITS INTO GOP PICTURE; 
WEIGHING ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL BID, HE'S UNSURE IF VOTERS ARE INTERESTED IN HIS 
'COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At this moment of Republican euphoria, Jack Kemp is strangely subdued. Like 
all Republicans, he's enthusiastic about the prospect of taking back the House 
or Senate, or both. But he is uncertain that the sleek, sharp-edged GOP machine 
now driving briskly toward power has any room for his brand of "compassionate 
conservatism" -- with its missionary fervor about reviving the inner cities by 
bringing capitalism to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said over breakfast in a Pensacola, Fla., hotel a few days 
ago. "I'm not feeling beleaguered, but I am feeling I have had a setback 
somewhat. Because I don't know there is much of a constituency for that right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp sighed; it had already been a long day. At 5:30 that morning, he was 
standing under a light drizzle in a muddy field on a quiet street helping the 
volunteer organization Habitat for Humanity raise a house for a widow and her 
three children. The night before, he delivered a gracious and generous speech 
at a reception for those who had gathered to hammer and plaster and saw: All 
Americans, he said, shared an obligation to end "the stain . . . of people 
without homes, people without hope." It was a speech almost impossible to 
imagine from any of Kemp's potential competitors for the 1996 GOP presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kemp spoke, Millard Fuller, Habitat for Humanity's gently indomitable 
founder, came to the microphone and, by way of thanks, said: "He's a 
Republican, but he's a human being." Well-intentioned, the remark cut into Kemp 
like shrapnel. Later that night he repeated it at a fund-raiser for the Florida 
Republican Party. "I don't ever want that to be said again," he said. "The 
party has to care about every single city, every single inner city. Every 
single child of God. We are not going to be entrusted with government at any 
level if we cannot prove we understand we must leave no one behind." 
</P>
<P>
 In one form or another, Kemp has been preaching that sermon for more than a 
decade, as a young congressman, an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1988 
and an exuberant housing and urban development secretary who chafed under 
President George Bush's disinterest in domestic affairs. After keeping a low 
profile during most of President Clinton's first two years, Kemp's now 
traveling the country, campaigning for Republican candidates and, by his own 
account, "testing the waters" for another presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he run? "I think the critical people have a sense that Jack is running," 
one supporter said. "That's different in the past 30 days." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp has begun talking privately with GOP strategists like John Sears, the 
original architect of Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign. But in conversation, Kemp 
still sounds genuinely conflicted. Partly his hesitation springs from the usual 
concerns: Can he raise the money, build the organization. But there is a larger 
issue: Are enough Republicans still interested in what he has to say? 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp's message has always been an odd hybrid: one part supply-side economics, 
the other social gospel -- an improbable mix of Arthur Laffer and Dorothy Day. 
In Pensacola, when he wasn't lecturing about empowering the poor, he was 
proselytizing for capital-gains tax cuts, tariff reductions and a rollback in 
all the tax increases passed not only under Clinton but also under Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 As a political (if not necessarily an economic) matter, the tax cuts are fine: 
Republicans are turning back to cutting taxes as though rediscovering an old 
flame. But when Kemp says the nation cannot afford to leave anyone behind, he 
expresses a weight of social obligation that virtually no candidate in either 
party now dares to endorse. 
</P>
<P>
 That vision is especially discordant with the GOP's message in this midterm 
campaign. Kemp joins in the Republican criticism of Clinton urban priorities -- 
like a potentially vast public jobs program for welfare recipients and the 
$30-billion anti-crime measure with its cascade of new social programs. But 
across the country, Republicans this fall are not talking about Kemp's 
alternative of rebuilding inner cities by expanding enterprise zones, slashing 
taxes on the working poor and subsidizing the sale of public housing to its 
tenants. Instead, they are offering the iron fist: cutting off welfare, 
cracking down on illegal immigrants, sending more violent teen-agers to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp feels alienated, almost besieged by all of this. "The party is coming 
dangerously close to being portrayed as (though) all we want is little 
government and big prisons," he said. "There's nothing wrong with wanting 
smaller government, less intrusive government, as a philosophical point, and 
there is certainly nothing wrong with defending the idea that violent criminals 
should be locked up. . . . But people want a bigger menu, they want a bigger 
vision of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Without ever noticing the turnoff, Kemp now finds himself traveling a 
different road than most Republicans on issues of race and poverty. At a 
National Review dinner last spring, he confronted Edward I. Koch over a speech 
in which the former New York City mayor argued that the nation's crime problem 
was essentially a problem of "black crime." Last week, Kemp passionately 
denounced Proposition 187, the California ballot initiative to cut off public 
services to illegal immigrants, which is backed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, 
as a threat to civil liberties, racial harmony and "the soul of the 
(Republican) party." 
</P>
<P>
 He bristles at the explosive suggestion in Charles Murray's new book, "The 
Bell Curve," that low IQ largely explains the poor's predicament and virtually 
dooms them to poverty. "That's ridiculous," Kemp said. "I'm not a sociologist 
and I don't have any empirical data to prove my point, except I believe that 
there is a spark of creativity in all of our people and the purpose of our 
society is to unleash that talent." 
</P>
<P>
 He rolls his eyes dismissively at the emphasis on trying more juveniles as 
adults. And although he denounces the existing welfare system as a "cancer," 
Kemp doesn't have much patience for Murray's idea of eliminating welfare 
benefits for women who bear children out of wedlock -- a proposal that has 
generally transfixed conservatives. Better, Kemp says, to expand "economic, 
social and educational mobility" through tax breaks, job training and school 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what gets me," he said. "If conservatives believe that government can 
cause problems by incentivizing the wrong thing, why don't they believe that 
government can reverse its policies and encourage productive human behavior . . 
. (like) families and work and saving. We are great as conservatives at saying 
how bad government is. Why can't government do the right thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Such intemperate optimism has opened Kemp to charges of naivete from left and 
right alike. Liberal critics see him slighting the role of government by 
depending on private-sector incentives to combat poverty; conservative critics 
disparage his emphasis on economic opportunity as a refusal to accept the 
cultural diagnosis of inner-city chaos that constitutes the cutting edge of 
conservative social thought. On the right, some whisper Kemp's time has already 
passed, before it ever entirely arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Effusive, voraciously empathetic and prolix, Kemp is an easy target for both 
sides. But amid intensifying racial and political polarization, he is a rare 
voice of inclusiveness -- insisting that the GOP can become a majority only by 
attracting more blacks and Latinos through demonstrated concern for the poor 
and the underclass. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most Republicans, and even many Democrats, worry less about including 
the underclass than isolating it through tougher law enforcement and the 
reduction of welfare benefits. Although no one will say as much, that agenda 
approaches a strategy of quarantine. If Jack Kemp has a future in national 
politics, he will have to convince the Republican Party that's not enough of an 
answer to America's most pressing social problem, and right now he's not sure 
he can.

ABUSE OF CONSCRIPTS HELPS TO GIVE DRAFT A BAD NAME IN LATIN AMERICA; MILITARY: 
SUICIDES AND BEATINGS HAVE PROMPTED EFFORTS TO DOCUMENT INCIDENTS AND APPRISE 
SOLDIERS OF THEIR RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Draftee Cristian Uribe was a day overdue at his regiment after a September 
furlough. Other soldiers found him and brought him in. His superiors tied his 
arms and sent him through a gantlet of recruits under orders to beat him. Uribe 
was hospitalized with serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Argentine artillery battalion, conscript Omar Carrasco asked for a chair 
at a meal one day in March. A sergeant, considering the request out of line, 
beat up Carrasco. A lieutenant beat him again the next day for not doing guard 
duty. Carrasco died of his injuries. His body was hidden for a month before his 
parents learned what had happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardo Castro, shy and overweight, cried when drafted into the Colombian 
army at age 17. A lieutenant taunted him and beat him. After being forced in 
March to do extra exercises when he forgot to polish his boots and put on his 
name tag, Castro committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 These and many other incidents of abuse of conscripts have made headlines in 
Latin America, helping to give the draft a bad name. While such abuse persists 
worldwide, it has grown controversial in this region because of declining 
military influence, a more aggressive press and a heightened awareness of human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Uribe's beating in the northern Chilean city of Iquique stirred a storm in 
Santiago, the capital. A lieutenant and a sergeant have been charged in 
military court in the case, the latest of many that have triggered protests by 
Chilean human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conscripts are continually pressured and humiliated," said a statement by the 
church-oriented group Service, Peace and Justice in Chile. "Their own 
companions are ordered to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, one of Chile's most influential 
research institutes, has proposed that a commission be created to investigate 
complaints of mistreatment of Chilean conscripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Sabat, president of the Youth Rights Commission in Chile, said his group 
hopes to distribute leaflets outside barracks advising conscripts of their 
rights and asking them to report abuses. He said the commission has discussed 
the idea with Defense Ministry officials and "I think they are going to accept 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the commission is not well-known among draftees, it has received 77 
complaints about conscript abuse in the past two years. Sabat said beatings, 
psychological harassment and other mistreatment are common in the army but 
rarely reported by conscripts fearing reprisals. So far this year, he said, 
three Chilean draftees are known to have committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, 71 suicides occurred in the armed forces last year, according to 
an internal military investigation cited by the press. Psychologists said 
reasons for the suicides ranged from loneliness to verbal threats and 
punishments by superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Draftee Castro, who killed himself in March, had hoped to study mechanical 
engineering at a Bogota university instead of going into the army. He was the 
top student in his Cali high school. With only three months to go before his 
release from a year's tour in the Presidential Guard, he shot himself in the 
head in his barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian judicial authorities are investigating scores of cases of suicide, 
homicide, injury and verbal abuse in the military. Some complain that officers 
beat soldiers in the testicles and pummel them with rifles. Soldiers speak 
openly of the "water bath," a beating on the buttocks with a sandal dipped in 
boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian Defense Ministry created an office of human rights for the armed 
forces this year; soldiers can now present complaints freely and anonymously 
with the possibility of seeing disciplinary or criminal sanctions meted out. 
</P>
<P>
 In Argentina, meanwhile, a lieutenant, a sergeant and a private have been 
charged with the beating death of draftee Carrasco. 
</P>

 Times special correspondent Steven Ambrus in Bogota, Colombia, contributed to 
this report.

CLINTON SAYS GOP IS DISTORTING HIS RECORD; POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT ASSAILS 
REPUBLICANS AS HE CAMPAIGNS IN WASHINGTON STATE. ANALYSTS TAKE NOTE OF THE 
HOUSE SPEAKER'S ABSENCE DURING HIS STOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton on Sunday urged Democrats to "wash America's windshield" of 
Republican disinformation as he appeared at a fund-raising gathering notable 
for the absence of the state's most powerful Democrat, House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting that made about $60,000 for state Democratic candidates, Clinton 
said Republicans have distorted his Administration's record out of a belief 
that "if they can make people mad enough, and disoriented enough, they will 
just lash out" and vote against all incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to wash America's windshield off in the next two weeks so (voters) 
can see the light coming in," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks, at the larger of two fund-raising events, came on the second day 
of a three-day campaign swing that took him on Saturday to Northern California 
and ended late Sunday in Ohio. He was scheduled to appear today in Cleveland 
and Akron before leaving Tuesday for a five-day trip to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal Washington fund-raiser, at the Seattle Center, attracted nearly 
a full showing of the state's most powerful Democrats, including four members 
of Congress, Senate candidate Ron Sims, Gov. Mike Lowry and Seattle Mayor Norm 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foley, the Democratic Party's third-most-powerful figure, was hundreds of 
miles away in Spokane, closeted with aides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a debate this evening, and our policy is to spend some hours 
preparing beforehand," said Todd Woodard, a press aide for Foley. The debate, 
the third with Republican challenger George Nethercutt, was scheduled before 
Clinton's trip, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said it may have been just as well that Foley was far from 
Clinton during a race when his credentials as an insider have been made the 
principal campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, who represents the rural and largely conservative 5th District, is 
facing a tight race with Nethercutt, an adoption attorney. One recent poll 
showed each with 45% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 One other member of the state's Democratic congressional delegation, Rep. 
Jolene Unsoeld, also begged off from appearing with Clinton, claiming she had 
to campaign in her district. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton went out of his way Sunday to tell reporters that he had no intention 
of trimming Social Security or Medicare, despite a suggestion in a newly leaked 
memo from Budget Director Alice Rivlin that the Administration might consider 
such options in order to further reduce the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not support cuts in Social Security, and I believe any savings we 
achieve in Medicare should be used in health care," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo, he said, only listed options that may be considered by various 
groups, including Republicans and the bipartisan Kerrey Commission, which is 
looking at ways to reduce entitlement spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's fund-raising remarks heavily stressed his Administration's foreign 
policy efforts, an emphasis that would have been inconceivable in 1992, when he 
was campaigning to be a President focused on domestic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, sounding even a bit like former President George Bush, Clinton reeled 
off a list of areas where, he said, his Administration has brought peace, or at 
least made a difference: South Africa, the Middle East, Haiti and Northern 
Ireland.

INMATE SEIZED IN 4 PRISON FARM KILLINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An inmate at a state prison cattle ranch is accused of killing the director, 
the director's wife and two inmates Sunday and burning the bodies in a house, 
prison officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelvin O'Neal Washington, 27, was arrested in the slayings hours later on 
prison property, said John Hale, a spokesman for the state Department of 
Corrections.Washington is serving a 20-year sentence for a 1984 theft and 
assault conviction. A motive in the slayings was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 A body believed to be that of 74-year-old Charles A. Farquhar, director of the 
prison named in his honor, was found bludgeoned inside his brick ranch house, 
which had been set ablaze, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bludgeoned body of Farquhar's 68-year-old wife, Doris, and the body of one 
of the inmates were also found in the house. The body of the second inmate was 
found in the carport. The inmates were shot, authorities said.

SOME IN HAZARD AREAS LOSE COVERAGE; POLICIES: 'IT'S TOUGHER TO GET RENEWALS . . 
. IN AREAS CONSIDERED POTENTIAL FIRE AREAS, AND THE MAIN REASON IS BECAUSE WE 
HAD THE FIRE,' A LAGUNA HILLS INSURER SAYS.

 Raymond Rubio, a firefighter for seven years, considers himself a victim of 
last year's firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
 His Laguna Hills tract home -- seven miles from the Laguna Beach fire -- is 
unscathed. But two months ago, Rubio was abruptly told that his fire insurance 
policy was being canceled. The reason: "a significant exposure to brush," a 
reference to a creek bed that lies a football field's length away from Rubio's 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio, a Los Angeles County firefighter who battled the Malibu blaze and knows 
the ins and outs of fire prevention, was shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just homeowners in a residential area," said Rubio, 35. "I don't think 
I'm being fairly treated. I could see if I was in a place that had a major fire 
before, but they are kind of running the gun a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio is one of the casualties in what insurance experts call an "industrywide 
crisis." Insurance companies are reeling from a quick succession of major 
disasters -- first the Altadena fire, followed immediately by the Laguna Beach 
and Malibu fires, with the Northridge earthquake jolting the Southland less 
than three months later. Only two years earlier, some 2,700 homes were 
incinerated when fires swept across Oakland. Insurance companies have been hit 
with more than $10 billion in claims from residents whose homes were destroyed 
or damaged in the earthquake or fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies, fearing financial ruin, have begun to re-evaluate their clients, 
weeding out those whose property they deem at high risk for brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio is not alone. The Laguna Beach City Council has identified three 
residents whose homeowner policies have been canceled, said City Manager 
Kenneth C. Frank. A spokesman for Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. said there were 
36 non-renewed policies in the Laguna Beach area this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January's quake, Glenn Robinson, owner of Robco Insurance Services in 
Laguna Hills, has received about 30 to 40 calls from non-renewed homeowners 
begging him to refer them to a carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tougher to get renewals and insurance in areas considered potential fire 
areas, and the main reason is because we had the fire," Robinson said. "It's a 
tough market for homeowners. I've been in this business for 23 years and I've 
never seen it this tough." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no central clearinghouse that documents numbers of non-renewed 
insurance policies. However, the California Department of Insurance began 
tracking complaints after 58 homeowners in a single week said they had received 
non-renewal notices. Rubio's insurance company admits to dropping policies 
worth $3.5 million in premiums in the last five to six months, or about 10% of 
its total premiums, in an effort to reduce its risk exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio said he has lived in his two-story home on Sara Lane for three years 
without making a claim. In a cancellation letter his company said Rubio's home 
was situated within 300 feet of a dry creek bed. But after county fire 
inspector Robert Frick examined the neighborhood at Rubio's request, he told 
the homeowner it rated a 3 out of 10 on a scale of hazard zones and was not a 
fire risk. What the insurance company called a dry creek bed is the "Aliso 
Creek trail," where an asphalt bike trail lies along the edge of a 
four-foot-wide stretch of creek bed with running water. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Kagley, 64, is another non-renewed policyholder. The Laguna Beach 
resident has been with Fireman's Fund for three years without making a claim. 
But in August she received a letter telling her that her policy would not be 
renewed because of her home's "proximity to hazardous brush/risk (areas) . . . 
it does not meet the underwriting guidelines of 1/4-mile brush clearance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked. At first I couldn't believe it," she said. Kagley's one-story 
home on La Mirada Street lies about two miles from the site of the fires last 
October. A canyon, about 10 yards away, is considered by the company to be a 
fire hazard. She pointed out that it has never caught fire in the 12 years she 
has lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 Kagley said her area may be a risk, but "almost everybody lives near a 
canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 "That would certainly do a lot of people in," said the former Orange Coast 
College counselor. "On one hand, I could see why they'd be wary. But on the 
other hand, I don't know why any companies are in the insurance business if 
they are afraid of risk. . . . I don't believe the insurance companies are 
broke. I think they have plenty of money. I don't think it's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 City manager Frank said officials have held three meetings with some major 
insurance companies to discuss what the city is doing to improve fire safety. 
The meetings were initiated by the homeowners' association in Mystic Hills, one 
of the areas hardest hit by the fire. "Most companies are very positive," Frank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies say they have no choice but to drop higher-risk clients. 
Rubio's insurer, Residence Mutual, has been "severely hurt by the earthquake 
and put in a position where we no longer have a surplus. We have to reduce the 
number of policy holders," said Vice President Stephen Wasulko. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had "not necessarily been inspecting every house" when it 
originally issued policies, Wasulko said. "We had to come back and evaluate 
what (policies) we should be writing. Those who live in brush areas, have a 
history of frequent losses, those are the ones that we reluctantly have to 
discontinue." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasulko acknowledged that the insurance crisis "does make a real problem for 
the policyholder and we deal with that everyday. We just have no choice at this 
point in time. . . . I feel for the customer." 
</P>
<P>
 "California is in a unique situation," said Stephen Dreyer, director of 
ratings at Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, a firm that tracks the industry. 
"We see the companies looking much more carefully, in a minute, detailed way, 
at their concentrated risk. Their alternatives are pretty limited. It's not a 
pretty picture for the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just current homeowners who are feeling the pinch. Anyone buying a 
home must obtain fire insurance before lenders will approve a loan, and 
beginning about four months ago, that became much more difficult, up and down 
the state, said Rita Payenaka, a Century 21 real estate agent in South County. 
"Major carriers are not carrying and secondary carriers are running out of 
surplus money. They are either not covering or are pulling their coverage. The 
first thing we have our customers do is look for insurance. It really affects 
first-time buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of the companies that sell homeowner insurance in California, such 
as 20th Century Insurance and Republic Insurance Group, are not accepting any 
new business. Others have sharply pared the number of policies they are 
writing, among them Allstate, State Farm and Farmers, according to the 
California Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every insurance carrier is rewriting its guidelines, said Linda 
Mallory, Department of Insurance associate underwriting officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory said many insurers issue "hundreds of policies a month" through 
mortgage companies, only doing spot checks to assess property. But after 
dramatic losses this year, carriers are "checking up on every piece of 
business. They are looking at, for instance, Laguna Hills," she said. "No one 
ever thought a firestorm was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The fires have exacerbated an already shaky insurance situation. Under 
California law, insurers must offer earthquake coverage with homeowners 
policies. After the Jan. 17 temblor, many larger companies have limited the 
number of new policies they sell, wary that claims from another quake as big or 
bigger than last January's could financially ruin them. Others have completely 
stopped writing new policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio, who has shopped around for a new policy, knows that firsthand. "I've 
gone down the list of all the major companies. There is nobody writing 
policies," he said. When a company did offer a policy, the cost was outrageous, 
Rubio said. He is now finalizing coverage with a small Hollywood firm, Century 
National, for a slightly higher annual premium but a nearly doubled deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy of Pam Otto, 46, who lives close to Kagley on Wykoff Way, was 
canceled by Fireman's in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was outraged. I thought, 'Why the heck would they do something like this? 
We have a perfect record,' " the Laguna Beach resident said. "It seems real 
haphazard, very subjective. I never saw them come out and inspect the area. 
There needs to be a lot more homework done by the insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Fireman's said the company is now conducting a statewide 
re-examination of brush-country areas that afford poor accessibility to 
firefighting vehicles and contain houses with wood shingles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kagley said she found a local agent, but in order to transfer companies, she 
must also buy automobile insurance with the company. "I've been with the Auto 
Club for 40 years and I don't want to change it now. They kind of have me over 
a barrel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the companies she spoke with charged much more than she was paying, 
she said. "As a retired person, I have a set salary. I couldn't afford most of 
the other policies. I had two other quotes for twice the amount I was paying."

DIVERSION OF VIOLATORS IS 'EPIDEMIC'; JUSTICE: IN 1992, THOUSANDS OF PAROLEES 
AVOIDED COURT AND WERE DISCIPLINED BY PAROLE OFFICIALS AFTER ARRESTS FOR 
VIOLENT CRIMES. STATE PANEL DECRIES SCOPE OF PRACTICE. 
</P>

<P>
 About half of California's prison inmates are parole violators who were 
arrested and sent back to the penitentiary. But most were not prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last two decades, records show, only 1 in 4 parolees in prison was 
sent there by the courts. The rest were returned by parole authorities -- a 
practice that continues today outside the reach of the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 While the courts can impose up to a life term under the new law, parole 
officials can give only a maximum one-year penalty, no matter how serious the 
parolee's current arrest or how numerous his prior convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, about 8,800 parolees in 1992 were arrested for violent crimes such 
as murder, rape and robbery. Yet about two-thirds avoided criminal prosecution 
and instead were disciplined by parole officials. These unprosecuted parolees 
included 141 accused of homicide and 1,203 accused of robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 A report on the state's criminal justice system in January pointed out that 
parole violators have reached "epidemic proportions," putting a severe strain 
on the system. 
</P>
<P>
 It warned that the long-established practice of prosecutors to divert parolees 
away from the courts was a convenient but ill-advised method to dispose of 
thousands of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, according to the report by the state's Little Hoover Commission, 
is that "criminals who should be punished for their new crimes escape with a 
light sentence. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes" has created a huge difference between the amount of prison 
time the courts and parole authorities can impose on offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old sentencing laws, for example, the low term for a felony drug 
conviction was 16 months. Under "three strikes," a felony drug conviction for a 
defendant who already has accumulated two prior strikes could bring 25 years to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say they evaluate parolee arrests just like all others -- filing 
charges in court when they believe they can prove them beyond a reasonable 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the most recent year for which comprehensive data is available, about 
24,000 parolees were returned to prison by parole authorities -- about 6,000 
more than were prosecuted and sent back to prison by judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these 24,000, hundreds were the result of referrals from prosecutors. State 
Department of Justice records show that the vast majority of such cases come 
from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Hoover Commission found that most parolees actually receive prison 
terms of less than one year. In 1991, the average prison term meted out by 
parole authorities was 7.3 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommended that parole authorities be empowered to hand down 
prison terms longer than the one-year maximum.

BARS FACE NFL'S LEGAL BLITZ; LEAGUE'S GAME PLAN IS TO TACKLE SCREENINGS OF 
BLACKED-OUT CONTESTS; TARGETED OWNERS JUST TRYING TO AVOID A SACK 
</P>

 Carlos Suarez contends that he's being exploited by a big and powerful 
adversary, one that has millions of dollars and teams of attorneys "ready to 
put the squeeze on until I pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Suarez's opponent has forced him to hire his own attorney or risk losing as 
much as $200,000 in U.S. District Court, where last week the National Football 
League filed suit against Suarez and 19 other owners of area bars and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably pay them something," said Suarez, who owns the Player's Club on 
Main Street here. "I can't afford not to. I just don't need the hassle. I feel 
like David going up against Goliath." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the NFL has targeted bars and restaurants that somehow found a way 
of showing games that did not sell out 72 hours before kickoff and thus were 
blacked out within 75 miles of where the game was being played. But in recent 
weeks, the league has been especially vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the start of the football season, similar suits have been filed in 
Cleveland, Miami, Detroit, Houston and New Orleans. In each area, the league 
alleges that bar and restaurant owners unlawfully "intercepted, received and/or 
exhibited" one of its games. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of spiraling costs and escalating player salaries, league officials 
say they have to be ever protective of their primary source of revenue -- 
television -- even if it means hiring former FBI agents to ferret out violators 
of the blackout rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to Suarez, his problems with the NFL actually started Sept. 25, when 
his satellite dish picked up a "raw feed" of a blacked-out Los Angeles Raiders 
home game. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he's also being sued for a second incident Oct. 2, when the first 25 
minutes of a blacked-out Los Angeles Rams game in Anaheim Stadium popped up on 
television screens in the Player's Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone else named in the 21-page action, Suarez pays a fee to receive 
NFL games via satellite, and, he says, it's the league's obligation -- not his 
-- to scramble the picture on blacked-out telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "To cite me for showing the first 25 minutes of a game that they were 
obligated to scramble, well, that sounds to me like entrapment," he said. "The 
fact that they committed a technical error is no reason for me to be sued." 
</P>
<P>
 And, technically, said Frank Hawkins, legal counsel for the NFL, he is right. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to our knowledge, there were no encryption failures during that week," 
Hawkins said from his New York office. "We don't think it happened that way, 
based on our preliminary review before filing the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Hawkins said, Suarez is bound by law not to show any portion of 
a blacked-out game, regardless of how he receives it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a 500-seat bar shows games and charges for it, and you end up with 1,000 
empty seats," which is often the case at both Anaheim Stadium and the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, "then it hurts the NFL," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 He contended that some of the bars named in the suit had used elaborate, 
black-market equipment to pick up Channel 39, an NBC affiliate in San Diego 
that often shows Raiders home games. Such was the case Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you're using an ordinary home antenna and not charging admission," 
meaning a cover charge, "then we have no problem with it," Hawkins said. "But 
at one of the bars cited, our expert said, 'They have the biggest mother UHF 
antenna I've ever seen,' oriented to San Diego for one purpose -- to break the 
blackout." 
</P>
<P>
 Named in last week's action were the following Orange County establishments: 
Blackie's by the Sea in Newport Beach; Lamppost Pizza in Orange; Lockeroom 
Sports Bar in Orange; Out of Bounds in Huntington Beach; Roundtable Pizza in 
Orange; Texas Loosey's in Fullerton; the Warehouse in Newport Beach; and 
Suarez's Player's Club. Twelve Los Angeles-area bars also were cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Suarez later learned that the NFL had hired former FBI agents to check on his 
establishment and the others named in the suit in an attempt to catch 
violators. The suit alleges copyright infringement and violations of the 
Federal Communications Act and asks for $200,000 from each of the 20 bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe it?" Suarez said. "They were using (former) FBI agents. Maybe 
they could hire the KGB next." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins conceded that the league had hired former FBI agents in gathering data 
for the suit but said it would be unfair to use the words monitor or spy in 
describing their method of investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word monitor is unnecessarily pejorative," he said. "We hired former FBI 
agents to visit the bars. There was no big brother here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Suarez and the other Orange County merchants interviewed last week say the 
NFL's tactics feel like Big Brother. Some complain that the league has done a 
poor job of explaining the do's and don'ts of its complicated policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for the lawsuits vary from place to place. Some bars are being sued 
for signing up for a $99 residential rate -- instead of the commercial rate, as 
high as $2,500 -- for an annual subscription to a new service called NFL Sunday 
Ticket. The subscriptions allow access to every game every Sunday, except those 
falling under the blackout rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Suarez says he has "no sympathy" for business owners "who would try to cut 
corners like that. I pay the full rate. I'm completely legal, completely 
kosher." 
</P>
<P>
 But other merchants, such as Ron Walton, the owner of Texas Loosey's in 
Fullerton and Torrance, said that, in ordering the service, he was never told 
there was one rate for homes and another for bars and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 After the suit was filed, "I called up and said, 'OK, no problem. Let me send 
you a check for the higher amount,' " Walton said. "You know what they said? 
'What can you pay us in a settlement?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Lebovitz, president of the Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights, a national 
organization based in San Diego, said he viewed the NFL's latest round of suits 
as "harassment, entrapment . . . and in my view, the defendants -- not the 
plaintiffs -- deserve punitive damages." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Lebovitz led a nationwide boycott of Anheuser-Busch and the Miller 
Brewing Co., two of the league's biggest sponsors, in a successful attempt to 
curtail the scrambling of games televised via satellite. The moratorium on 
scrambling was lifted Sept. 4 with the introduction of NFL Sunday Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are these people supposed to be lawyers?" Lebovitz said of Suarez and the 
other defendants. "Are they supposed to turn the television off because the NFL 
failed to scramble a blacked-out game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, said Hawkins, the NFL's lawyer, they are. The law prohibits them 
from showing any portion of a blacked-out home game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be very proper at this point for the NFL to come right out 
and say what it wants," Lebovitz said. "Do they want to own half the bars and 
restaurants in this country? Why don't they save us all the frustration, 
aggravation and legal fees we have to spend by being up-front and honest now? 
Just come out and say it and quit beating around the bush." 
</P>
<P>
 The manager of Roundtable Pizza in Orange, who asked not to be quoted by name, 
said he showed the blacked-out Raiders home game Sept. 25 by picking it up from 
an NBC affiliate in Atlanta, which he receives as part of a legal satellite 
subscription package called Prime Time 24. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawkins maintained that only residential subscribers in so-called "white" 
areas -- those without access to a clear signal from a network affiliate -- are 
allowed to receive Prime Time 24. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bigger problem of businesses hoping to pay the cheaper residential 
rate is "widespread throughout the country." The NFL will continue to protect 
its legal copyright, he said, rather than "take the risk of having our product 
compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lebovitz, the fan's advocate, scoffed at such a notion, saying Orange 
County businesses were merely the latest in a nationwide list of targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to say they're trying to protect the industry," he said of the 
NFL. "And I say to that: B.S. What they want is money, and this is nothing more 
than a scare tactic. This is done to bring the average guy in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know no organization out there can match their money or their power in 
Congress. Congress is responsible for this too, for allowing this type of 
harassment. The NFL is not the people -- we are. Where is Congress in all this 
-- getting tickets for the next Super Bowl?"

PTA SURVEYS CANDIDATES IN 22 SCHOOL DISTRICTS; EDUCATION: THE 105-PAGE DETAILED 
DOCUMENT IS TERMED THE GROUP'S MOST AMBITIOUS EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hoping to provide detailed and objective information about candidates for 
school boards throughout Orange County, the 4th District Parent-Teacher Assn. 
has conducted its most ambitious survey ever of those running for office this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Some themes run throughout the candidates' answers: tighten budgets, increase 
parent involvement, emphasize job skills, keep schools safe, and improve 
communication between trustees and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you felt any compassion for the children or openness to parents in 10 
years?" asked Anaheim Union High School District candidate Mary Anne Zimolzak, 
who echoed many challengers' anti-incumbent feelings. "We need a heart at this 
higher level, a heart against -- or, if possible, with -- power." 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates appear to support school uniforms and prefer a back-to-basics 
approach to academics rather than fashionable reform programs such as 
performance-based education. 
</P>
<P>
 But hidden among the responses are some innovative suggestions, such as live 
television coverage of school board meetings with call-in participation and 
formal pairing of high school students with senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, not a lot of information has gotten out," said Barbara 
Ledterman, the county PTA's legislative director, who organized the project. 
PTA councils in each district will distribute the candidates' responses to 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledterman said she was surprised at many of the responses to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just assumed everyone was in (education) for the same reason I'm in it," 
she said with a shrug. "There are people out there who aren't getting involved 
in schools because of interest in kids. There are other agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 105-page document, candidates explain their qualifications for office 
and answer two questions specifically aimed at each district. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 120 candidates for office in 22 local school districts responded to 
the survey; 41 candidates in those districts did not return surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 PTA groups in Irvine Unified and Savanna school districts plan to conduct 
their own surveys, Ledterman said. Fullerton Joint Union High School District 
and La Habra City School District were not included because candidates there 
are running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who responded, half have children attending public schools. An 
additional 36 candidates have children who graduated from public schools, three 
more have children who are too young for school, and three others sent their 
children to private schools for part or all of their education. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight candidates who responded do not have children, and a few said they were 
offended by the question, which the PTA asked of every candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This question betrays the public school Establishment's 'keep-out' 
mentality," said Leon E. McKinney, who does not have children and is one of 
nine running for two seats in the Huntington Beach Union High School District. 
"The vast majority of taxpayers don't have children in school." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph J. Wagner, another candidate in the same district, echoed McKinney's 
concern. "This question reveals an undesirable bias," Wagner responded, 
explaining that he has chosen not to have children. "I understand the insight 
that parenthood can bring to this job, but parents are often less objective 
when hard decisions are needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates, though, emphasized their personal connections to the school 
community, whether by volunteering in their child's classroom, coaching a team, 
or speaking at board meetings. Thirty-two of the candidates who responded to 
the PTA survey are incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about experience over the past five years that qualifies them for 
the school board, 46 of the challengers cited volunteer work with the PTA or 
other school-based organizations. An additional 15 named non-school-related 
community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the candidates who responded to the survey work in public schools as 
teachers or administrators. Four are college teachers or administrators, and 
four more are retired educators.  
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in various districts were queried on a variety of topics in 
education, including bilingual education, multiculturalism, full inclusion for 
disabled students and uniforms and dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they backed a variety of specific programs, virtually all candidates 
stressed the importance of English comprehension. Only Michael Valenti in the 
Anaheim City School District backed a "true bilingual" program, saying he 
wished his own children could learn Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every child must learn English!," incumbent Bobbee Cline of Saddleback Valley 
Unified wrote on her survey. "We need to get rid of state regulations and 
bureaucracy that tie up the funds we need with pointless rules." 
</P>
<P>
 David A. Lampert, a candidate in Tustin Unified, suggested that schools also 
help students' families. "We need to reach out and help the non-English 
speaking families, the moms and dads of these children, and help them to speak 
English too," Lampert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates in the county's urban areas praised the diversity of their 
school systems and stressed the importance of multicultural education and 
ethnic pride. 
</P>
<P>
 But several people decried such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all Americans and the diversity of our people is the American 
culture," said Maurice (Morrie) Hansen, a Capistrano Unified candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Anaheim City School District, candidates were polled about Proposition 
187, the statewide ballot initiative that would deny education, social services 
and all but emergency health care to illegal immigrants. Five of the six 
candidates who responded said they oppose the measure. The remaining candidate, 
John Luckett, said he is unfamiliar with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenti called Proposition 187 "immoral and unconstitutional," while Benny 
Hernandez described it as "monstrous" and promised not to enforce it if it 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Full inclusion of special education students in mainstream classrooms, a hotly 
debated topic in Orange County recently, drew mixed reviews from the 
candidates. Most supported mainstreaming, but expressed caution about also 
balancing the rights of others.  
</P>
<P>
 Dress codes drew strong support from candidates in virtually every district.

THE JUDGE IS GOING TO REST HIS CASE; JUDICIARY: BLAIR T. BARNETTE, THE LONGEST 
SITTING JURIST IN SOUTH COUNTY, IS WRAPPING IT UP AFTER 22 YEARS IN 'A VERY 
LIKABLE COURT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Blair T. Barnette never thought it would work out like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette, 59, said he never expected to be a judge, and now here he is 
retiring after 22 years on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young prosecutor in Los Angeles, he loved courtroom action but did not 
imagine he would get a shot at running one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you really dream of this; that would be looking too far ahead," 
said Barnette. "This is a very likable court, and time went very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette, the longest sitting judge in South County, started and in January 
will end his judicial career at the once sleepy outpost in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1972 when then-Gov. Ronald Reagan appointed Barnette to join only two 
other judges in the new courthouse on the barren hillsides of Crown Valley 
Parkway. In those days, the courthouse also had a branch of the county building 
department and a Sheriff's Department substation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long before, the territory had been called the Laguna-San Clemente 
Judicial District after the only two incorporated cities in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess places that had more cows than people didn't get figured in," 
Barnette said with a laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 But the creeping urbanization of the southern end of the county reveals itself 
in his clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very unique court. Because it's a nice area, our crime most of the 
time is fairly nice," Barnette said. "It used to be real hard to get mad at the 
defendants here, but that's changing. We've had some brutal things down here." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette said he sees more crime, more gangs and more homicides, and fewer 
drunks on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barnette himself hasn't changed much, say his clerks and South County 
attorneys. He's a creature of habit who, unlike many judges, has been content 
to remain in Municipal Court and preside over misdemeanors for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I have the best job in the state. . . . That's why I've been 
dragging my feet about retiring," Barnette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette looks at home in his four-wheel-drive Bronco, and his mail often 
contains more correspondence about his hobby, trains, than judicial matters. 
Those are Topsider boating shoes peeking out from under his judicial robes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't ever underestimate his intelligence, however, local defense attorneys 
say. And don't be late to his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes to be very, very efficient," said Monica Richards of Santa Ana, his 
clerk since 1986. "We used to say 'counter call is at 8:29 a.m. and 60 
seconds.' Seriously, he's like that; he's consistent. He's also very smart and 
very funny and I'll miss him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Said a defense attorney, who asked his name not be used: "He starts court at 
8:30, and if your client is not there by 8:31 there's a bench warrant issued. . 
. . He likes to make people toe the line, but you always know what you're going 
to get with Barnette. In that sense, he's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a court that stays promptly on calendar. David Estrada, a deputy 
public defender who is new to the courthouse, called Barnette "a no-nonsense 
judge with an excellent reputation for integrity. He's very big about personal 
responsibility with everyone, the lawyers and the clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette, a Los Angeles County native, grew up in Arcadia, received both his 
undergraduate and law degrees at USC and then served for two years as a 
prosecutor for the city of Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1960s, he had moved to Corona del Mar where he had spent summers 
as a youngster. Barnette, a Republican, had not been active in politics or the 
county bar association, when he was appointed to the bench.  
</P>
<P>
 In the time since, no one has challenged him for his seat, so "my name has 
never appeared on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 After his retirement, Barnette plans to continue as a judge on special 
assignment from time to time and otherwise spend hours playing golf at his 
second home in Palm Desert, with his wife, Dayna, and on his many hobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 The state judicial system, Barnette said, will remain in fine hands and will 
ably ride out changes, "three strikes" laws or whatever, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have always had predictions of doom about the system, saying 'You'll 
never get through this.' But I don't get concerned about these big changes the 
way I used to," Barnette said. "The system is pretty big, it may bellow out a 
little here and there, but eventually it will absorb the changes and go on its 
merry way."

STREET SMART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: The junction of the Ventura and Hollywood freeways in 
Studio City at Tujunga Avenue presents a treacherous -- often fatal -- choice 
for drivers who do not have adequate warning of the freeway split. Confusion is 
created when the Ventura suddenly becomes the 134 while the 101 continues south 
as the Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 To compensate for the confusion, drivers often quickly change lanes, cutting 
each other off, resulting in sickening collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though signage appears a mile back, it is imperative that drivers must be 
alerted to the upcoming split. Perhaps an overhead computerized board could be 
posted for greater awareness. Something must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Weiss, Studio City 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: We took your question to Caltrans spokeswoman Pat Reid, who said 
engineers repeatedly survey freeway conditions to ensure motorist safety. But, 
she said, there are no plans to increase signs at the Ventura-Hollywood split. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the split is well-signed," Reid said, adding that the roadway is 
also marked with stripes indicating the upcoming interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem may be with the people driving the freeway. Most crashes are the 
result of driver error. Street Smart always encourages people to drive 
carefully and defensively. Although it sounds cliche, it works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: After reading a recent column about the repairing of 
surface streets, I have to bring up the question of Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake destroyed our street north of Rinaldi Street we have felt 
abandoned, left to deal with potholes and rough streets since they reopened 
Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 When will it ever be paved? 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Kazmer, Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: Watch for street crews to patch any potholes in your neighborhood 
within the next couple of days -- if they have not already. Neil Spiva of the 
Los Angeles Bureau of Street Maintenance said last week that he would dispatch 
workers as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As to your larger problem of rough streets, though, a remedy may still be 
months away. Spiva explained that the Northridge earthquake did a lot of damage 
under ground as well as above. Many sewer pipes and other utilities are still 
awaiting repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Until those repairs are made, Spiva said, crews can not resurface streets 
because it makes little sense to repave a road, then tear it up to fix the 
utilities and then repave it again.

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; POLICE TO ACQUIRE $60,000 FINGERPRINT SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department soon will have a high-tech fingerprinting system that 
will cut down on time spent searching for the identities of criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members last week approved the purchase of the $60,000 system that 
will end the practice of fingerprinting suspects on paper cards with black ink, 
Police Chief Steven H. Staveley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently, when someone is arrested, we roll their fingerprints with an ink 
pad and paper and mail it to Sacramento or the FBI," he said. But the process, 
in which state or federal authorities respond to the Police Department, can 
take months. If a quicker identification is needed, an officer takes the 
fingerprints to another Police Department with a sophisticated computer system 
to get the information, which can take hours, Staveley said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the new system, he said fingerprints will be scanned directly into a 
computer without ink, which sometimes contributes to smudges and inaccurate 
information, and an identification can be made in as little as 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County sheriff's and Anaheim police departments and many Los 
Angeles County law enforcement agencies already use the system. Other cities, 
including Newport Beach and Santa Ana, are considering buying it, Staveley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is cutting edge technology," City Manager Lee Risner said. MIMI KO

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SILENT FILMS WILL SCREEN WITH MUSIC AT PLUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fullerton auditorium will be transformed into a silent movie hall for one 
afternoon next month when a nationally known organist performs to the 
flickering images of Laurel and Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Kann, who worked for 22 years as the house organist at the Fox Theater in 
St. Louis, will work behind the console on a Wurlitzer pipe organ that county 
residents have spent the last year meticulously restoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Kann is also expected to give a talk on the history of movie theater organs 
and the role they play in American musical history. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the advent of talking movies in the 1920s, cinemas often employed 
organists who played background music while the silent films were showing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Live music is different from a soundtrack. It's a different sound," said Judy 
Dennis, one of the volunteers restoring the organ. "It's more like you are 
involved with" the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater organs differ from church organs in that they can make a variety of 
unique sounds including bird whistles, cymbal sounds and drum noises, Dennis 
said. The Fullerton organ is at least 60 years old and is now housed at Plummer 
Auditorium, a Fullerton Union High School District building. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and other volunteers have spent the past few months cleaning the 
organ's pipes and rebuilding pieces of the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Kann will perform Nov. 6 at 2 p.m. Tickets are $8. The auditorium is at the 
corner of Chapman Avenue and Lemon Street across from Fullerton High School.

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; PANEL SCRAPS BIKE PATH NEAR GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission, after listening to disgruntled homeowners along 
Tanager Drive, has voted to scrap plans for a bike path that was to be built 
behind houses on the north side of the city golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen homeowners turned out at the meeting last week to tell 
commissioners that the bike path, which would include a 2,400-foot tunnel at 
$336,000, would ruin their view, drive property values down and clutter up 
their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense financially or aesthetically," said Lori Hoskins, a 
homeowner who organized the protest and presented a "before and after" picture 
presentation of how the bike path would adversely affect about 25 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the bike path is a part of the 1974 Master Plan of Bikeways, residents 
pointed out that times have changed and that bike paths often bring more misery 
than good. They said the present bike path on the south side of the golf course 
has not only led to gang graffiti but an increase in crime and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Robert Graham, a resident of Mesa Verde, said he thought something 
should be built along the street -- at the very least a bike lane. Times might 
be changing, but the city must change with them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern isn't to force a bike path that these people don't want down their 
throats," he said. "I just want to look at the options. All the developments in 
South County offer bike paths and greenbelts. Why can't we? If we don't, people 
are going to leave the city and move south." 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes made in the Master Plan of Bikeways included adding a Santa Ana 
River Trail on the newly constructed service road on the east side of the 
Greenville Banning Channel, from Fairview Regional Park to Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a new connection to the Santa Ana River Trail over the 
channel at the end of Gisler Avenue. A bike lane on Hyland Avenue, between 
South Coast Drive and Sunflower Avenue, and one on Broadway, between Newport 
Boulevard and Irvine Avenue, will also be added.TOM RAGAN

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SEARCH BEGINS FOR NEW SUPERINTENDENT

<P>
 The school board praised departing Supt. David E. Brown during his final 
school board meeting last week and set the wheels in motion to find his 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees hired an executive search firm to survey the community. Board members 
also named Deputy Supt. Dean Waldfogel to serve as acting superintendent after 
Brown's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldfogel, one of three deputy superintendents in the Irvine Unified School 
District, said he is not a candidate to replace Brown. Deputy superintendents 
Susan Long and Paul Reed have indicated a preliminary interest in the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, hired in 1987 to succeed A. Stanley Corey, is leaving to take the top 
job at Napa Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been an absolute pleasure," Brown said Tuesday night, complimenting 
administrators, trustees and district employees. "No one's benefited more than 
I have from my IUSD experience." 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Michael B. Regele gave Brown kudos for his leadership 
style. "You pushed others forward so they could shine instead of pushing 
yourself forward," Regele said. In the wake of Brown's departure, the school 
district will pay $9,600 to Management Analysis and Planning Associates of 
Berkeley to develop a profile of what community members want in a new 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process may stop there," Regele said, indicating that the board might not 
seek candidates from outside the 17,500-student school district. The school 
board, which has two incumbents running for reelection, plans no additional 
action on replacing Brown until after the Nov. 8 election. RUSS LOAR

<P>
 The First Step House, a facility used to shelter homeless alcoholics, will be 
able to accept 20 men instead of 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has approved a conditional-use permit for the 
increased capacity after contacting the Police and Fire departments.Both 
departments agreed they may receive more calls from the shelter because of 
increased number, but "the benefit to the community will outweigh the costs," 
according to a planning staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless alcoholics can stay at the shelter for a maximum of 10 days. Though 
there is no structured program or treatment at the site, three volunteer 
committeemen offer help and counseling between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, at 2015 Charlie St., has daily 1 1/2-hour meetings at noon and 8 
p.m., said Jerry Wisegarver, a volunteer who praised the commission's approval 
for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help somebody get off the street and get sober and get clean and 
hopefully help society someday," he said. TOM RAGAN

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CHAMBER HIRES NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce has hired a new executive director who will start work 
on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Klaren, 32, was chosen from a field of 40 candidates and replaces Alan 
Hughes, who worked as executive director for 11 years before stepping down in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaren was most recently the executive director of the West Suburban Chamber 
of Commerce in LaGrange, Ill., and has eight years of experience working with 
marketing and fund-raising for nonprofit organizations, said Jeff Farano, 
president of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a lot of good ideas and appears to be able to follow through with 
them," Farano said.  
</P>
<P>
 Farano said one of Klaren's biggest challenges will be to attract more 
businesses to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider now a very crucial time with a lot going on," Farano said. "We're 
trying to get business back up again and we see the chamber playing a crucial 
role in the economic development of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Klaren will be officially introduced to the business community at a reception 
on Nov. 16. GREG HERNANDEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 Directors of the Tustin Chamber of Commerce have voted to support three 
measures on the Nov. 8 ballot, including Proposition 187, the controversial 
initiative that would deny most public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber also supported local Measures H and J. Measure H would limit City 
Council members to two consecutive terms, and Measure J would require 
competitive bidding for the city's disposal and solid waste collection 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber directors have come out in opposition to Measure I, which would limit 
Tustin council members to serving three consecutive terms. The chamber also 
opposes Measure A, a countywide initiative that would convert the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide measures opposed by the chamber are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 181, which would provide a $1-billion bond issue to expand 
passenger rail services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 184, the "three strikes" initiative, which would increase 
sentences for convicted felons who are repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 185, which would impose an additional 4% sales tax to pay for

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BACHELOR FINDS TRASH BILL TAXING 
</P>

<P>
 Stuart Baron owes nearly $200 to a local trash hauler for unpaid charges he 
doesn't plan on paying. 
</P>
<P>
 The bachelor said he only generates one grocery bag of rubbish per month, 
disposes of it at the business where he works in Irvine, and recycles all his 
paper, cans and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron contends that a mandatory fee charged by the city's hauler, Solag 
Disposal Inc., is a tax because he doesn't receive a service in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have a mandatory fee," Baron said. "It's an oxymoron." 
</P>
<P>
 Baron said he has sought help from City Hall, but officials there say all they 
can offer is a reduced "exemption" rate of $6.59 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city imposed the trash fees in 1992 after it adopted a recycling program 
to meet state goals of reducing the garbage flow into landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Dumhart, a city management analyst, said the exemption rate is for 
residents who don't want Solag Disposal service. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumhart said the fee is similar to a sewer fee, which households help pay that 
goes for capital expenses of a plant. In this case, such expenses would be 
special trucks and barrels that Solag Disposal had to purchase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that this system is the most equitable," Dumhart said. "Even with a 
vacant property, the bushes still grow and waste is produced." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Koutroulis, president of Solag Disposal, said his company is caught in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't request the mandatory fee," Koutroulis said. "We are made (to be) 
the bad guys here." 
</P>
<P>
 Koutroulis said that about 40 to 50 people were given full exemptions in 1991 
before the recycling service began.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the company has not decided what to do about Baron's unpaid bills.  
</P>
<P>
 Several other people are in similar situations, Koutroulis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron said he never received notice from the city in 1991 that he could get a 
full exemption, which is what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absurd," Baron said. JEFF BEAN

<P>
 In an effort to clean up Lilac Avenue, the City Council has approved a 
proposed ordinance that would ban people from parking motor homes on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which is expected to receive final review Nov. 1, prohibits 
vehicles more than 18 feet long and 8 feet wide from parking along Lilac Avenue 
between Richardson Street and Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was sparked by resident complaints about visitors using the area as an 
overnight campground, creating safety and health concerns, City Manager Raymond 
H. Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will resolve the problems that have occurred," Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kromer said those problems included more trash in the area, the dumping of 
waste water onto the street and complaints by some residents who say they have 
been confronted by transients. There has also been prostitution and drug sales 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Elvin G. Miali said people have been cited for sleeping in their 
vehicles and that the ordinance will provide police with an additional 
enforcement tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Raymond, president of Harbor Valley Homeowners' Assn., praised the 
council's action to clean up the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an unsavory situation," he said. "People sleep all night in RVs and 
they do their duties in the gutter. It's blight in the neighborhood." DEBRA

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON RIVER SAND FOR SHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will have an emergency meeting Wednesday afternoon to approve 
the purchase of sand from a Santa Ana River excavation project to replenish 
badly eroded city beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is critical because of a Nov. 15 deadline imposed by federal officials 
on removing the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the threat to workers in the Santa Ana River during the rainy 
season, the Army Corps of Engineers will not allow any excavation work there 
after Nov. 15, Seal Beach City Manager Jerry Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sand was unearthed during a federal flood control project to cement the 
earthen sections of the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular City Council meeting scheduled for today was canceled because 
several council members are out of town. But council members will meet at 2 
p.m. Wednesday to consider expenditures of up to $400,000 to purchase the sand 
and transport it to city beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston said he expected price negotiations to conclude by Wednesday's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are elated over the discovery of a pocket of sand in the Santa 
Ana River near the Anaheim Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 As the winter storm season approaches, the city has been trying in vain to 
locate an affordable source of sand to dump on local beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 A mile-long section of beach between the Seal Beach Pier and the Naval Weapons 
Base has been losing seven inches of sand each year because of erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston said he was hoping to get between 70,000 and 100,000 cubic yards of 
sand. But because of the limited amount of time left to excavate the sand, he 
expects to recover between 45,000 and 60,000 cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A sizable part of the expense is the cost of trucking the sand. One 
double-trailer truckload of sand amounts to only 15 cubic yards. RUSS LOAR

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; COUNCIL UNWAVERING IN SUPPORT OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has stood firm in its support for the Nov. 8 ballot measure 
that would deny illegal immigrants a variety of services, despite pleas from 
about a dozen speakers to reconsider the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ho Chung, who abstained when the council voted in September to 
endorse Proposition 187, joined the endorsement last week, saying that U.S. 
immigration laws must be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have compassion for people who are forced, for whatever reason, to leave 
their place of birth," said Chung, who emigrated from South Korea more than 20 
years ago. "But if you come to a country, you must follow its laws." 
</P>
<P>
 But several speakers at Tuesday's meeting said that it was wrong for the 
council to take a position on an issue that is beyond its jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let individual voters decide," said Pam Harris. "That's why it's on the 
ballot. I don't think this is something the council should be associated with." 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich Nicholson said the council should either stay neutral or oppose the 
ballot measure, which he said is "unenforceable and will not do anything to 
stop illegal crossings." 
</P>
<P>
 Other speakers said Proposition 187 would create larger problems, such as 
increased crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather see these people in schools than in prison," said Joseph Chaikin. 
He said that as many as 30,000 youths could be kicked out of school if the 
measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would bar children of illegal immigrants from attending public 
schools, in addition to denying them non-emergency health care and other social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my tax dollars spent on people who are here illegally," said 
resident Bill Walker, who supports the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which last month voted 3 to 0, with two abstentions, to support 
the measure, did not take a second vote last Tuesday. BERT ELJERA

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CITY OKS DENTAL CLINIC IN RESIDENTIAL AREA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has allowed a dentist to open a clinic close to some pricey 
homes in the Woodward Lane neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 last week to let Mark D. Bedard convert a 
single-family home to a dental clinic, despite some protests from nearby 
residents worried about the encroachment of businesses into their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are entitled to a little protection for our investment," said builder Gene 
Conti, who owns a $600,000 home close to the proposed clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said that the clinic would enhance property values because 
of the improvements Bedard promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard is proposing to remodel a rental house and an adjacent mobile home 
garage on half an acre. He said the area would be landscaped and designed to 
blend with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not an out-of-town investor trying to make a quick buck," said Bedard, 
who said his family has a 40-year dental practice in the city. "I'm not 
planning to do anything weird there." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Leyes, who voted against the proposal, said that it's wrong to 
allow a business in a residential zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission rejected the proposal last month because the area is 
zoned residential with lot sizes of at least 15,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council Tuesday agreed to change the zoning for Bedard's property to 
allow for an office building, and relaxed code requirements for setbacks, walls 
and trash storage areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Krebs, a planning commissioner, said that an office building in a 
residential zone must not be allowed because the clinic may be sold in the 
future and converted to another use. 
</P>
<P>
 Krebs abstained when the project went before the Planning Commission. BERT

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY TO HIRE 6 OFFICERS, SERGEANT, FIELD 
STAFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of assigning eight new police officers to patrol duties, the City 
Council has decided to use two of the positions to add a field service police 
officer and a sergeant to the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg made the recommendation not to hire all eight 
patrol officers, and the City Council this week agreed to his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council recently voted to spend $623,000 to hire the additional officers, 
which will improve response times. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said the mix of personnel will better serve the community while 
adding police on the streets and providing leadership and supervisorial 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said the department has had a below-average ratio of supervisors to 
patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The current staffing has a total of 18 squads with 16 sergeants supervising 
them. This leaves two patrol squads without a sergeant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said the field service officer is a civilian position whose duties 
include crime-scene investigation, evidence gathering and handling some police 
calls, such as a residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is a cost-effective method for freeing additional police officer 
time for patrol and emergency responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg's plan leaves about $70,000 unspent the first year. But he said the 
money will be used to buy new uniforms and safety equipment and pay overtime 
for the additional officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said because of anticipated vacancies due to retirements, a 
selection process was already scheduled for early November. "We'll fill most of 
those (new) positions in the next few months," he said. DEBRA CANO

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA PALMA; BUDGET WOES PRECLUDE PAY RAISE FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved a new, one-year contract with the La 
Palma Police Assn. that does not include any pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief David Barr said the officers reluctantly agreed to the new pact, 
accepting it only because they knew there was no money available. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract with police is retroactive from July 1 and extends through 
June 30.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council had the contract among its "consent calendar" items last 
Tuesday, and there was no debate or discussion of it.  
</P>
<P>
 The consent calendar is usually used for minor, non-controversial matters 
before the council. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the council meeting, Barr said the police association, 
which represents the officers, understands the city's budget problems, but 
added that "they also understand that this (lack of a pay raise) can't go on 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract with police does have one relatively small item of increased 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed to fund $4,200 as a pool of money for "bilingual pay for 
employees demonstrating competency in designated languages."  
</P>
<P>
 Barr said that the money would be shared during the year by officers who are 
taking, or who have successfully completed, foreign-language training. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has said the municipal budget has been severely eroded in 
recent years by cutbacks in city funding by the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 No city management employee has received a pay raise in the past three years, 
according to City Manager Pamela Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 She said police received "a very modest" pay raise last year, and that this is 
the first year officers have been given no pay increase at all. BILL BILLITER

 The Saddleback PTA Council has voted to oppose a ballot initiative calling for 
the conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a commercial 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The group represents PTA schools in Mission Viejo, Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, 
Foothill Ranch, Rancho Santa Margarita, Portola Hills and Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said that the impact of building a commercial airport at the Marine 
Corps base has not been studied adequately, and that noise and pollution could 
affect nearby schools and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the initiative, Measure A, say a commercial airport will create 
new jobs and provide an economic boost to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano PTA Council has also voted to oppose the ballot initiative.

<P>
 The City Council has extended for five more years a franchise agreement with 
Times Mirror Cable Television, parent company of Dimension Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the extension Tuesday, and also asked city staff to 
incorporate into an accompanying ordinance a "fail-safe" method of scrambling 
audio and video of the adult channel "Spice."The vote was 3 to 0 with 
Councilwoman Carolyn Nash and Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeff Vasquez said he was disturbed by a recent news account that 
children from a Laguna Hills family had seen or heard more than they should 
have on "Spice" while switching channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he wanted to ensure that cable subscribers wouldn't be 
inadvertently exposed to the channel's programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Stucky, spokesman for Dimension Cable, said Friday that safeguards 
besides scrambling were in place to allow subscribers the choice of blocking 
out the channel's signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Stucky said Dimension will be working with the city to "make sure that (Spice) 
doesn't go unscrambled." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sensitive to those concerns," Stucky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Cable serves about 8,900 customers in the city. JEFF BEAN

OCEANSIDE AUTHOR REACHES OUT TO ALL CHILDREN; BOOKS: RACIAL PEACE IS AS NEAR AS 
AN ABRAZO, OR HUG, ADVISES VICTOR VILLASENOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relying on hugs and handshakes more than his written words, author Victor 
Villasenor carried simple advice Sunday for adults seeking racial peace: think 
like a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 He practiced what he preached, celebrating the release of his first children's 
book, "Walking Stars," with a street party featuring punch and a pinata that 
went over big among the not-ready-to-read set. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 fans, mostly grown-ups, crowded the sidewalk outside Martinez 
Books & Art to greet the Oceanside writer, who gained national renown with the 
1991 publication of "Rain of Gold," an epic tracing his family's immigration 
from Mexico that was compared to "Roots." 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks that coursed from English to Spanish and back, Villasenor told the 
largely Latino audience that society has scrubbed away child wonderment, 
replacing it with a way of thinking that categorizes, labels and divides 
people. Villasenor, who grew up in Carlsbad, recalled being punished by 
teachers for being dyslexic -- and for being the son of Mexican immigrants who 
had taught him tales of magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed my parents until I started school. They told me, 'No Mexican stuff 
here,' " Villasenor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villasenor -- who once organized a trip to Spain to ritually forgive Columbus 
for invading the continent -- said peace was as near as an abrazo, or hug. He 
even got audience members to embrace each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Villasenor has become a local favorite, especially among Latinos, after making 
a previous visit to the store and doing a speaking tour last year at Santa Ana 
schools. The visits were spearheaded by a Santa Ana police officer captivated 
by "Rain of Gold." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the fact that he's done something is a source of admiration. It's hope, 
I guess," said Michael Peinado, a 16-year-old student at Valley High School in 
Santa Ana. "We have a rich culture. I want people to understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Corina Benavides, a senior at UCLA, said Villasenor's work has helped awaken 
her pride in her Mexican ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can identify with his experience of being marginalized," said Benavides, 
22, who grew up in San Juan Capistrano. "I always wanted to be something I 
wasn't. Being an immigrant -- I was ashamed to say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those attending were too young to understand Villasenor's writing -- 
even his new children's offering, a 202-page collection of short stories in 
which young people are heroes. 
</P>

VALLEY CHRONICLE: PUBLISHER'S BOOK DOUBLES AS MONKEY WRENCH IN SIMPSON SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Oct. 18, Michael Viner was mostly famous for having the good taste to 
marry actress Deborah Raffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffin is cool and blond, cursed with brains as well as beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has lived for almost 20 years in a home off of Coldwater Canyon 
Boulevard near Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 They shop at the Hughes Market on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 They give dinner parties where upscale Hollywood meets the glittering 
literati. 
</P>
<P>
 Viner is the last person you would pick to have put the O.J. Simpson trial, 
temporarily, on the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is the publisher of "Nicole Brown Simpson, The Private Diary of a Life 
Interrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a book that makes you glad you live on this side of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Viner has produced several low-budget but well-received films, including "The 
Dove," about a kid who sailed around the world solo. 
</P>
<P>
 Following all the book-generated legal panic, Viner may be contemplating such 
a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 This saga began several years ago when Viner started Dove, a books-on-tape 
company that became a major player in the business. Book publishing followed as 
a natural extension of the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all low-profile and low-key, like the soft-spoken, introspective Viner. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 18, his low profile blew sky-high. 
</P>
<P>
 The book release was legal dynamite, way beyond what Viner or the authors say 
they expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Viner says he was dazed when he heard that Judge Lance Ito had shut down court 
upon hearing about the book so that he and the lawyers could speed-read it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Faye Resnick book started with a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was approached in August by Warren Cowan, who had been approached by Faye's 
lawyer," remembers Viner. Cowan is a semi-retired public relations executive 
who knew both the attorney and Viner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to what they said about Faye Resnick's material and said I would 
be interested in looking at it," says Viner. He says once he was convinced 
Resnick was viable, a six-figure book deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 He flew Resnick, two secretaries and the National Enquirer's Mike Walker, who 
would co-author the book, to a private home in Vermont, where they worked 
"around the clock" with almost no interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Viner says: "Faye talked into the tape recorder. The secretaries transcribed 
the material, and Mike Walker put it into book form." 
</P>
<P>
 The almost 24-hour-a-day operation, which began in September, at times looked 
like a movie on fast forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he would feel if the book caused the judge to rule Simpson couldn't 
get a fair trial, he answered, "That will never happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Viner was by no means oblivious to the potential hoopla the book might 
engender. Still, on publishing day he sounded like someone coming down with a 
touch of post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of those "you can run, but you can't hide situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Princess Grace is supposed to have said to Princess Diana: "Cheer up 
dear, things are sure to get worse." Survivors Propelled by Grief, Anger Want 
MARC to Matter 
</P>
<P>
 It was a picture-perfect day, Thanksgiving eve, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin and Clark Squires of Northridge were feeling that all was right with their 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Their daughter, Heather, a 20-year-old junior at UC Santa Barbara, was home 
for the holiday. So was their son, Todd, an 18-year-old UCLA freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Their youngest, Marc, a 15-year-old student at Granada Hills High School, had 
called just after 5 p.m. to say he was going to a party after the school 
football game, but to tell Heather and Todd to wait up for him to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 The fixings for Thanksgiving Day were in various stages of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those times when you are thankful to have such a close, happy 
family," Lin Squires says. 
</P>
<P>
 Six hours later, Lin, Clark, Heather and Todd were sitting in the waiting room 
outside the Northridge Hospital Medical Center emergency room, waiting to hear 
if Marc was going to live or die. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd gotten a call during the evening that there had been a shooting and that 
Marc might have been the victim," remembers his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We raced to the place where the party had been held just in time to see 
someone put into an ambulance and taken away," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The family learned at the medical center that it was Marc who had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 All the family could do was "wait, hope and pray," Lin Squires says. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc died on Thanksgiving Day. The gunshot had severed his spine and cut 
through the aorta. The shot was fired by a gang member who had wanted Marc's 
beeper. Family members could never figure out why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marc made money acting as a disc jockey at parties. He wore the beeper so we 
could keep in touch with him. He went to places where he didn't know anyone, so 
he would occasionally ask us to beep him there," according to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he didn't feel comfortable about the situation, he would say he was needed 
urgently at home and leave," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 For several months, the Squires family struggled with the pain. Then, Lin 
Squires, a third-grade teacher, and Clark, a food broker, got mad. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot of their anger is an organization called Mad About Rising Crime, 
which now has a membership of about 500 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Its acronym is MARC, in honor of their slain son. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ordinary citizens who want to take back our communities. We want to 
stop violence, stop gang activities, make our neighborhood safe again," Lin 
Squires says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my belief it doesn't matter where you start as long as you start 
somewhere," says Squires. The organization sponsors seminars, meetings, parent 
groups, teen groups and graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 The next general meeting of MARC will be at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 16 at the United 
Methodist Church in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Her goal is not only to stop crime and make her neighborhood safe again, she 
wants to turn "them" into "us." 
</P>
<P>
 Squires says it doesn't matter so much how the gangs got a stranglehold on 
today's young people but pursuing methods to reverse the trend. The turnaround 
has to start, she says, with parents learning to say "no." 
</P>
<P>
 "Teach your children from the time they are infants that gangs are bad and 
gang membership will not be tolerated in the household. Say 'no' to glamorizing 
gangs or letting your children look like wanna-be gang members," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only a short step from being trendy to tragedy. Kids dressed up like 
gang members may be killed just for wearing the clothes," Squires says. 
Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I read the book because I now don't have to worry about whether the 
Westside singles are having more fun than we old marrieds in the Valley. Those 
people live in singles' hell."

SOUTH COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS GET SURPRISE INFLUX OF PRIVATE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Orange County public schools saw a surprising influx of students from 
private schools and home-schooling programs this fall, though enrollment in 
area private schools is also on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified Supt.Peter Hartman said 584 of his district's 902 
new students this year came to the district from private schools. In Capistrano 
Unified, nearly 700 of about 2,000 children new to the district came from 
private schools or home schools, Supt. James Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel good about it because there is an impression out there that people 
are leaving public schools in droves and moving to private, and we are finding 
and experiencing just the opposite," said Fleming, who plans to discuss the 
issue at his district's board meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming and Hartman both said they think the tight economy has led people to 
reconsider the expense of private school, and that the state's new open 
enrollment policy that allows people to attend the public school of their 
choice, regardless of where they live, has made the public system more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Fleming said, Capistrano Unified's intense marketing campaign 
over the past year about its schools of choice program, and publicity over the 
district's new schools, may have drawn some people to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Private school enrollment has stayed steady in Orange County over the past 
five years, according to the Orange County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's countywide enrollment data for private schools is not yet 
available, but a review of about 100 local schools shows that most have boosted 
their enrollment. JODI WILGOREN

7 HURT IN MISSION VIEJO COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven people were injured early Sunday when a suspected drunk driver ran a red 
light and collided with another car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel D. Masariego, 24, of San Juan Capistrano, was arrested on suspicion of 
felony drunk driving after his 1978 Cadillac, northbound on Muirlands 
Boulevard, smashed into an Oldsmobile, eastbound on Alicia Parkway, shortly 
after midnight, said Lt. William Francis of the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Masariego, who sustained facial and internal injuries, was in good condition 
Sunday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, a nursing 
supervisor said. All four of his passengers, whose names were not released, 
were injured as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oldsmobile driver suffered head and ankle injuries and a passenger 
suffered broken ribs and internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were transported to Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Laguna 
Hills and Mission Hospital. All were expected to survive.

COURT OF APPAREL; CHATSWORTH FIRM IS THE LEADING SUPPLIER OF JUDICIAL ROBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most famous judge in America, Lance Ito, got his there. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the judge who used to be the most famous guy on the bench, Joseph 
Wapner of "People's Court" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John Ouderkirk, who presided over the Reginald Denny beating trial, 
hangs on to his, a gift from when he first took the bench. Judge Stanley 
Weisberg, in charge of the Menendez brothers murder trial, wears his 
faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
 To a man -- and woman, like Judge Judith Chirlin, who presided over the 
"Boxing Helena" case involving actress Kim Basinger -- the verdict is in from 
the bench on the robes produced by Academic Choir Apparel: They're black and 
they're beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth-based, family-owned business is the leading couturier to 
California's newest class of celebrities, the judicial glitterati. Polyester or 
silk, monogrammed or plain, elbow patches or a secret pocket for a gun -- if a 
judge wants it, Michael and Evelyn Cronan's plant delivers. 
</P>
<P>
 They dominate a side of the judge business that's highly visible and yet a 
virtual afterthought -- the business of robes, the uniform that every 
California judge must, by law, wear. It's a business rich in lore and in 
history, and a company notable for innovation -- such as it is, the subject 
being robes. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, conceded Michael Cronan, president of Academic Choir, there's only 
one thing lacking: "The garment industry is about fashion. We're not fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it's about law and economics. 
</P>
<P>
 The law says that a judge must wear a robe in open court and that it must be 
black, reach to the knees and have long sleeves. It also says that judges must 
buy the robes at their own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Because judges purchase their own robes, they tend to become attached to them. 
And because judges typically are given to frugality, they tend to keep their 
robes a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin has had hers for nine years, since she took the bench. Robert Letteau, 
who is the supervising judge of the Van Nuys Superior Court, is going on 13 
years. "It's starting to shred," Letteau said. "I'm starting to feel insecure 
as I take the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 A new Academic Choir robe costs from $127 to $413, depending on the fabric and 
style. Silk costs more; polyester less. The most popular model, a lightweight 
polyester the company calls Coupe de Ville, runs $147 for Style 366, which 
features fully lined, coat-like sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapered sleeves, said Evelyn Cronan, are an Academic Choir innovation, 
thought up by her father, Harry Stanley, who founded the company in 1946. 
Judges complained that the traditional but poofy bell sleeves were always 
getting in the way, she said, so her dad slimmed down the sleeves and found 
customers receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, she said, Harry Stanley rode the circuit, traveling the state 
with his wares. He would show up in the back of a courtroom, she said, and that 
was that -- the judge would call a halt to the proceedings and summon all the 
other judges. "That's all he'd have to do," Evelyn Cronan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business grew by word of mouth, she said, and now the company sells 700 or 800 
robes a year, mostly in California. That accounts for about 10% of the firm's 
revenues; the bulk of business is robes for graduation and for church and 
school choirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's principal California rival, Ireland Needlecraft of Glendale, 
just changed hands and is temporarily out of production. New owner Bob Stotts 
said he hopes to be back in business by next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, judges order robes by mail. Academic Choir graciously provides a 
five-foot-long tape measure and gladly accommodates those judges who find that 
the sedentary nature of the law has left them portly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some real big ones," Michael Cronan said. "We just make them bigger 
across the front, sew in some extra panels, some extra material in back." 
</P>
<P>
 For the best fit, the company inquires whether a judge's shoulders are 
straight, have an average slope or are "very sloped." 
</P>
<P>
 Female judges can opt for Style 366W. The brochure boasts that it allows a 
"woman to look like a woman while retaining the dignity of the office," with 
piping along the neckline and sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is a difference between girl robes and boy robes," said Chirlin. 
"The difference is the pockets. Girls have pockets; boy robes have slits so 
guys can reach in their pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 At no cost, Academic Choir will monogram the inside of the robe, above the 
tag, usually with a judge's initials. Extra are elbow patches ($6), an eyeglass 
pocket (also $6), an added pocket ($5), or, for the gloriously vain, a velvet 
front ($85). 
</P>
<P>
 The Cronans also welcome special orders. A judge in "one of the Dakotas, North 
or South, I don't remember," ordered a robe made from denim, Michael Cronan 
said. Another judge "from back east somewhere" wanted one in green and 
embroidered with a shamrock. 
</P>
<P>
 One Los Angeles judge used to order pink robes. And a judge from Riverside 
County really did order a pocket for a concealed gun. "It was a Beretta," 
Michael Cronan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company fashioned a special pocket inside the robe and lined it with an 
especially smooth fabric so that the judge could whip the gun out with ease, 
Michael Cronan said. "That's what he asked for and that's what we gave him," he 
said. "It was a fairly low-cost option. It was under $20." 
</P>
<P>
 That order, he said, led him to think that a robe lined with bullet-proof 
Kevlar could be a big seller. "But it would take a lot of research to get it 
going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrust into the line of fire, new judges find that wearing a robe takes some 
getting used to. Cecil Mills, the supervising judge of Los Angeles County's 
criminal courts, recalled one of his first days on the bench 19 years ago, with 
a robe that dangled well down toward his ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to get up from the bench and the thing was laying there under my 
chair," Mills said. "As I stood up, it pulled me right down on the floor. It's 
kind of embarrassing to have to climb up from under the bench, to announce that 
you've tripped over your dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced judges highly recommend snaps down the front instead of zippers. 
"Zippers are bad," Chirlin said. "For a woman, you can get your blouse caught. 
Guys get their ties caught." 
</P>
<P>
 The truly savvy take it even a step further. Letteau said his wife sewed 
Velcro straps onto the front of his robe: "So now, as I take off my Superman 
robe, I'm in and out in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, said Irwin Nebron, who retired a few weeks ago from the Los Angeles 
Superior Court after nearly 29 years on the bench, one San Diego judge many 
years back really did think his robe turned him into Batman. 
</P>
<P>
 Flapping his arms and billowing about in the robe, the judge would walk down 
the courthouse halls, crying out, "I'm Batman! I'm Batman!" Nebron added: "He 
was removed from office." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, there's the one about the judge in Sacramento who suffered a 
heart attack on a baking-hot summer day in the Central Valley. The paramedics 
found he had nothing on underneath. "This is all part of robe lore," Nebron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the "best April Fool's joke you can play on a judge, to sew the sleeves 
shut," according to San Diego Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell. "You're 
rushing out into court and you're trying to get your arms through and you 
can't. That happened to me once." 
</P>
<P>
 McConnell still has that same robe -- which is no surprise to the Cronans. 
"It's a work uniform," Evelyn Cronan said. "But it gets to be like an old 
bathrobe. It's comfortable. They don't want to part with it. It gets to be 
personal. Even if it may not be high fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Which, more or less, was the message from Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 He allowed that his robe has his initials inside it, but passed along the word 
through another judge that he thought "he'd hold off on any further comment 
until Mr. Blackwell," the self-appointed fashion snob, "called to inquire about 
his robe."

7 ARRESTED AS PARTY TURNS INTO MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale and Burbank police spent three hours trying to bring under control 
about 200 party-goers who became angry when a police officer arrested a youth 
for public intoxication, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven people -- including three boys under 18 -- were arrested when Glendale 
police responded to a call of loud music at a party in the 400 block of West 
Elk Avenue about 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began when some members of the crowd came to the aid of the youth 
as an officer tried to arrest him for possessing alcohol and being intoxicated, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman officer was pulled inside a crowd of people and beaten, police said. 
After officers rescued her from the crowd, they retreated and summoned help. 
About 30 officers from the Burbank Police Department responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people in the crowd began throwing beer bottles and cans at the police 
and their vehicles, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from Burbank police, Glendale officers arrested seven people on 
charges ranging from lynching to felony assault on a police officer to 
resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was treated for a minor head injury and released, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Sunday would not identify the officer involved nor any of the 
suspects, said Glendale Police Sgt. Richard Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police said all seven suspects violently resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 But party-goers -- including the parents of one man who was arrested -- said 
police randomly singled out people from the crowd and ruined what had been an 
orderly party. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Huerta, 50, and her husband, Santiago, were subdued with pepper spray 
when they approached a Glendale officer to ask about the arrest of their son, 
Jaime, 19, and their grandson, Santiago, Mrs. Huerta said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huerta said the officer struck her son for no reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this. Everybody saw this and got mad because the police aren't supposed 
to do things like that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the boys arrested received a head injury during the melee. He was 
treated and later booked at the Glendale Police Department, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 One man tried to videotape the event, but several party-goers said police 
officers aimed flashlights and a patrol car spotlight at the video camera to 
obstruct the image.

CHILD OF '60S CHALLENGES MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN; ASSEMBLY: SHEILA JAMES KUEHL, 
OF 'DOBIE GILLIS' FAME, FACES OFF AGAINST GOP'S MICHAEL T. MEEHAN IN 41ST 
DISTRICT.

<P>
 No matter how you look at it, voters in the 41st Assembly District have a 
clear choice on Nov. 8: They can send Democrat Sheila James Kuehl, a child of 
the '60s, to Sacramento, or opt instead for Republican Michael T. Meehan, a 
member of Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl is unapologetically liberal, a feminist and a law professor. She gained 
early fame as the brainy Zelda on the television sitcom "The Many Loves of 
Dobie Gillis," and later acclaim as a nationally known expert on domestic 
violence.

 Meehan is a mainstream, law-and-order Republican who works as a reserve 
sheriff's deputy. Though Meehan cannot boast of a hit sitcom, he did serve as 
student body president at UCLA, where Kuehl also earned her bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 The shared alma mater is a rare piece of common ground in their campaigns for 
the open seat in the sprawling 41st, which hugs the coast from the southern 
border of Santa Monica to the Ventura County line, pairing Westlake Village and 
Calabasas with Pacific Palisades and Malibu. They are joined in the race by a 
third candidate -- Libertarian Philip W. Baron of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent records from the county registrar-recorder's office show 51% of 41st 
District voters are Democrats, 36% are Republicans, with the remaining 13% 
either independents or members of small parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered a swing district in which either a Republican or Democrat could 
win, voters two years ago supported liberal Democrat Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) against moderate Republican Christine Reed, a former mayor of 
Santa Monica, who is directing Meehan's campaign. Friedman gave up the seat to 
run for a Los Angeles County Superior Court judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, who steamrollered over her five male opponents in the Democratic 
primary, is widely considered the favorite over Meehan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl has a seasoned consultant, Parke Skelton, and a war chest in the 
mid-$400,000 range and counting. Meehan has raised only $40,000 overall and 
lacks the money for a single districtwide mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Kuehl will be the first openly lesbian or gay member of the state 
Legislature, a point that does not come up on the campaign trail -- nor should 
it, both candidates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sexual orientation is not relevant," Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl agrees, though she has drawn much of her campaign funding from the gay 
and lesbian community, which provided about 40% of her primary war chest, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a lesbian is not a qualification for office," she said. "I'm not 
running as a lesbian candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl emphasizes her accomplishments on women's issues -- nearly all 
California legislation on spousal abuse bears her mark -- as well as a slew of 
endorsements ranging from Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina to 
Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kuehl rejects the label "lesbian candidate," she says being a lesbian 
has been a character builder. Her sexual orientation, she says, cut short a 
booming acting career. And she knows it got her kicked out of her sorority when 
she was an undergraduate at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 During one summer vacation, someone rifled through Kuehl's bureau drawers at 
the sorority house, finding "incriminating" letters that revealed her sexual 
orientation. Kuehl says she was summarily booted from the sorority and further 
humiliated when the stolen letters were spread out on a table for all her 
"sisters" to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated," Kuehl said. "I thought that my life was over." She was 
also so scared of further exposure, she pretended to her parents that she still 
attended weekly sorority meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 She was afraid her sexuality would become known to her bosses on the "Dobie 
Gillis" series, which she acted in during her college years. At the time, Kuehl 
was poised to get her own show, to be called "Zelda." The pilot for the show 
had been a hot commodity, but Kuehl said the phone never rang. Later, Kuehl 
said, the director "sat me down for a little talk." She said the director told 
her: "The president of CBS said you were just too butch." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl went on to work at UCLA, eventually becoming an associate dean of 
students at her alma mater during the turbulent early '70s. She enrolled in 
Harvard Law School, graduating in 1978 at the age of 37. In 1989, she 
co-founded the California Women's Law Center, a nonprofit group she left last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Meehan has a decidedly shorter resume, he, too, has law enforcement 
support, notably the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which speaks for the 
LAPD rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan hopes to paint Kuehl as a leftist, pointing out she was quoted in a 
book describing herself as a "radical." Kuehl says she never made the 
statement, but Meehan says he would use it as the centerpiece of a campaign 
mailer -- if only he had the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he were to send such a mailer, it would backfire among district 
voters, responds Kuehl, who refers to her political stance as "progressive." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing that people call the kinds of issues I work on 'radical,' " she 
said. "My ideas are not radical. . . . If you're calling me a 'lefty,' you're 
saying women's issues are 'lefty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl likes to say she wants to make a difference in real people's lives. Her 
record features years of lobbying -- often successfully -- for legislation 
aimed at helping battered women to obtain protection from the criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kuehl does not shrink from saying things that might be unpopular with some 
voters, even when it might be more politic to be silent. At a recent candidates 
forum, she prefaced comments on illegal immigration and welfare reform with an 
impassioned plea to resist scapegoating poor women, children and others who, 
she says, came to California for work, not welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl opposes both Proposition 187, which would deny state services to illegal 
immigrants, as well as the "three-strikes" initiative aimed at repeat felons 
because it is not limited to violent crimes. Meehan is hoping these positions 
will become her Achilles' heel. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan, who supports both propositions, is also trying to make an issue of 
Kuehl's conflicting statements on Proposition 186, the single-payer health care 
initiative. In one debate she spoke against it, in another in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl's fans include her former cast mates from "Dobie Gillis," who appeared 
en masse at a fund-raiser during the primary. Though a Republican, Dobie 
himself, actor Dwayne Hickman, said he is casting his ballot for the brainy 
Zelda, er, Kuehl. 
</P>
<P>
 Her public identification as Zelda has come in handy, too, she says, by making 
her sexual orientation less threatening. Says Kuehl: "It jams the homophobic 
radar."

 Dorothy Barrett stood in front of her beginning acting students, ranging in 
age from 7 to 20, and gave them the benefit of wisdom gained during a career 
that has ranged from performing in major studio films to coaching future 
television stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not what you say, but how you say it," she tells her 40 students, 
echoing Mae West. "It's not what you do, but how you do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must project yourself to your audience." 
</P>
<P>
 As an actor and dancer, Barrett appeared in hundreds of movies, including 
"Gone with the Wind," "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mildred Pierce." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is best known for her real-life role as a teacher at the American 
National Academy of Performing Arts in Studio City, a nonprofit school founded 
in 1957 by actor Francis Lederer. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett has been teaching at the school since 1964 and is now the academy's 
administrator. The children's workshop, which she started the year after she 
arrived at the school, has been an early training ground for such notables as 
Fred Savage of "The Wonder Years" and Tracey Bergman of "The Young and the 
Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 The students are now preparing for a Christmas show during which they will 
show off the skills they have been learning. "All students receive instruction 
in acting, tap dancing, ballet, speech, jazz dancing and musical comedy," 
Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the academy's students have stayed with the school long after 
completing the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several instructors began as students at the academy when they were as young 
as 3 or 4 years old," said Barrett, who estimates she has worked with nearly 
3,000 young actors and actresses over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
 "The academy believes that one must love the theater," she said. "If we work 
with love, we can not help but succeed."

PEOPLE AND PUMPKINS BY THE TRUCKLOAD; FESTIVAL: CALABASAS EVENT DRAWS 20,000 
FOR CRAFTS, ANTIQUES AND CARVINGS OF THE SQUASH OF HONOR, CARTED IN FOR THE 
OCCASION.

<P>
 If fun was to be had at Sunday's Calabasas Days Pumpkin Festival, it was lost 
on 4-year-old Elliot Arluna. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot, sitting on a bench outside of the National Park Service booth at the 
third annual fair, was searching for someone he recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose a lot of parents at these events," said park Ranger Bryan Sutton, 
trying to draw a parent's first name and description out of Elliot. "Mom and 
Dad are focusing on something else, and the kids are so small they can't be 
seen in the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 After a few tense moments, Elliot's mom, Suzie Wooten, was found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who found you? Did you just walk over here?" Wooten asked a quiet Elliot, who 
responded by shrugging his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "See," Sutton said, "we haven't lost a parent yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, 20,000 fun-seekers made their way out to Paramount Ranch in 
the hills outside Calabasas for the two-day festival, which featured arts and 
crafts, food, country line dancing, games and an antiques auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds under a huge white tent found bargains galore at the auction, which 
included an autographed gold record by Elvis Presley that sold for $125. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me that yesterday the same thing sold for $1,800," said Peggi 
Christopher, 47, of Toluca Lake, who bought the collector's item for her 
21-year-old son. "I hope my son loves it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no pumpkins are actually grown in Calabasas, hundreds were 
transported to the festival to be sold and carved. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Aaron Hoffer, 8, saw the pile of orange squash at the front 
entrance of the festival, he headed straight for the largest pumpkin he could 
find and tried to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately it weighed more than 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't pick it up," he squealed before rejoining his parents a few steps 
ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds surrounded festival volunteer Cindy Cohen, who was carving out 
intricate designs on pumpkins that sold for $25. The painstaking process took 
hours as patrons watched her nimble fingers jiggle a tiny hacksaw blade to 
create a wretched smile on a jack-o'-lantern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes some artistic talent to do that," a man explained to some children 
next to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," answered Cohen. "Just a lot of patience." 
</P>
<P>
 Other carved pumpkins featured the Grim Reaper swinging his sickle, a 
jack-o'-lantern with a smile that spelled "HALLOWEEN" and another with the head 
of a skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Jimi Rogers, 13, and Briana Nelson, 12, were trying to smash a potato 
through a small hole with a sledgehammer at the Monster Mash table. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having fun just smashing these," Briana said. "And in a little while we 
are going to be in the pie-eating contest." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but we are really having fun checking out the guys," Jimi piped up. 
"That's why we keep playing this game."

STUDENTS MARCH TO FUND ANTI-PROP. 187 TV ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To raise money to air anti-Proposition 187 television commercials, about 70 
Latino students, their parents and teachers marched Sunday through the main 
streets of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you are under 18 or you can't vote, students shouldn't just 
stand there," said Oscar Pelayo, 17, a senior at Polytechnic High School in Sun 
Valley."We have to be fighting for our rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Holding signs, waving Mexican and American flags and chanting pro-Latino 
slogans, the demonstrators drew honks of support from passing motorists as they 
gathered in front of the Van Nuys state office before the 10-kilometer 
walk-a-thon. 
</P>
<P>
 Students belonging to chapters of a Latino and Chicano youth organization, 
MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano Aztlan), at San Fernando, Sylmar, Van 
Nuys and Polytechnic high schools and San Fernando Middle School have spent the 
last month gathering sponsors for the walk. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they have collected more than $600 to help pay to produce the 
commercials the youngsters are making themselves and to buy television air 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Political advertisements typically run about $20 a spot on local cable, 
according to the student activists, who will finish taping their messages 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud, but there's a big difference between a proud Mexican national and 
being proud of your Mexican culture. I am proud of my Mexican culture," said 
Gustavo Gonzalez, 17, the president of Polytechnic's MEChA group, who was 
concerned that the public perceives opponents of Proposition 187 as 
un-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez added that the members of MEChA at his school will not be engaging in 
controversial tactics, like those used last week by students at two Pacoima 
middle schools when they walked out of classes.

CITY ENLISTS HELP IN ITS STRUGGLE TO FIND ITSELF; TOURISM: SANTA CLARITA HAS A 
THEME PARK, POETRY FESTIVAL AND AN IDENTITY CRISIS. EVEN AUTHORS WHO CALLED IT 
'FABULOUS' COULDN'T PINPOINT ITS LOCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes it seems as if everyone in Southern California has an agent. Now, 
even the city of Santa Clarita has one. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked into a concrete triangle formed by the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways, Santa Clarita encompasses 43 square miles of prominent ridgelines, 
majestic oak trees and bedroom communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Its population is affluent, dominated by families proud of the area's good 
schools and low crime rate. Its economy is diverse, strong enough to fund 
public services and even launch a regional shopping center during Southern 
California's recent recession. Six Flags Magic Mountain fills much of the 
western horizon and is the valley's most recognizable landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this, Santa Clarita has yet to project an image desirable enough 
to outsiders to lure out-of-town industries, conventions or tourists into the 
city for business or pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image is in a state of flux right now," said Tricia Ezell, chairwoman of 
the Santa Clarita Tourism Bureau. "Whatever positive impact we can have on that 
is (our) goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the tourism bureau, which is a joint effort of the city 
and the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce, commissioned Long Advertising 
of Santa Clarita to help create a marketing campaign to attract visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tourism industry is a multibillion-dollar industry," said Ezell. "We 
certainly want our share of that pie." 
</P>
<P>
 It is but the latest attempt to establish Santa Clarita's identity, an 
obstacle that the city has grappled with throughout its seven-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders first encountered the problem in the months following Santa 
Clarita's incorporation in 1987, when directory assistance operators denied the 
city's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, a slogan contest, cowboy poetry festival and even outside 
recognition of the Valencia community as a desirable place to live each have 
garnered mixed results as the city has tried to cultivate an image of Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the city sponsored a motto contest -- offering free dinners, gift 
certificates, portraits and more to anyone who could sum up Santa Clarita in a 
few kind words. The winning entry was to be printed on city documents, 
stationery and promotional materials. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 suggestions, ranging from simple to sarcastic, poured in. After 
browsing through entries such as "The Crown of North County," "Democracy's 
Playground" and "Land of the Golden Dweeb," City Council members permanently 
shelved the motto idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity crisis popped up again in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's master-planned Valencia community was named one of "50 
Fabulous Places to Raise Your Family" in a 1993 book of the same name. Written 
by a couple from Baldwin Harbor, N.Y. -- a certified financial planner and 
marketing researcher -- the 320-page book praised Valencia as a "family mecca 
complete with exquisite neighborhoods, carefully planned commercial properties 
and awesome recreational possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 It was chosen from among 300 communities nationwide and stood out because of 
its school system and low crime rate. Unfortunately, Valencia was listed in 
Ventura County instead of Los Angeles County and placed about 30 miles farther 
north of Los Angeles than it actually is. Residents were also surprised to 
learn they supposedly receive an average of 10 inches of snow per year. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Santa Clarita hosted a three-day Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film 
Festival that organizers hope will serve as a recurring large-scale tourist 
event. Held for the first time seven months ago, it is too early to tell if 
cowboy poetry will become a defining event for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it drew more than 3,200 people and pumped an estimated $244,000 into 
the local economy, some residents blasted the use of taxpayer money on poetry 
rather than traditional public services such as roads. Additional criticism 
came when Santa Clarita officials unsuccessfully applied for $22,500 in federal 
earthquake recovery funds, saying the festival lost money when its original 
site was damaged in the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the continuing identity problem, Santa Clarita officials believe the 
city has better name recognition than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people know more about Santa Clarita now than they did seven years 
ago," said Gail Foy, city public information officer. "Hopefully, (the image) 
is a little bit of everything. We've evolved beyond 'that place by Magic 
Mountain.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For its latest effort, the tourism bureau has reserved a full-page ad in the 
Automobile Club of Southern California's 1995 travel guide for the 
California/Nevada region. Meanwhile, Santa Clarita brochures have been placed 
in display racks in Bakersfield, Fresno and the San Joaquin Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochures focus on the Santa Clarita Valley's diversity, from auto racing 
at Saugus Speedway to horseback riding on local trails to boating at the 
Castaic Lake Recreation Area. The historic William S. Hart Museum, Saugus train 
station and panoramic Vasquez Rocks are also touted. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, though, Santa Clarita is still a bit of a mystery to those who 
help tourists plan their vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the main attraction there?" asked Mark Lewis, operator of Lewis Travel 
in Fresno. "They have not reached me through any of the publications I keep up 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic Mountain is right there. Other than that, all I know is that it's on 
the way to Los Angeles," said Betty York of Bakersfield Travel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Tourism Bureau is scheduled to meet Tuesday for its next 
regular planning session.
