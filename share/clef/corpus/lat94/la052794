 WISDOM OF AGES: Ventura County is going gray, fast. And in recognition of the 
fastest-growing segment of our population, county officials have declared May 
as Older Americans Month. . . . About one out of 10 county residents is 65 or 
older. These years of experience tend to pool in some communities. Ojai has a 
greater concentration of elderly than other cities, attributed to its history 
as a vacation spot, its public transit and array of senior services. "It's a 
great place to grow old," said Councilwoman Nina Shelley, a septuagenarian. 
"But don't tell anybody!"

 ADDRESS UNKNOWN: The U. S. Postal Service got a lesson on social geography . . 
. from the residents of Thousand Oaks. The Postal Service recently notified 
residents with the 91320 ZIP code that they should use Newbury Park to 
correctly address letters. . . . Newbury Park doesn't have quite the upscale 
image of Thousand Oaks, and residents became unglued. Hundreds blistered postal 
workers with angry calls. "The last thing we want to do is upset our 
customers," Postmaster Douglas Leeds said. He assures that either city 
designation will do.

 CLEAN SWEEP: What better place to locate a police cleanup patrol than a former 
laundry? County sheriff's deputies are converting an old laundry into a new 
storefront station in Fillmore to cleanse the tiny town of its growing gang 
problems (B1). . . . The storefront location, Fillmore Senior Deputy Jim 
Aguirre said, "seems quite appropriate, given our mission." The first order of 
business: scrubbing graffiti from the laundry's walls. 
</P>
<P>
 BATTER UP: Amy Chellevold, a former Thousand Oaks High athlete, is emerging as 
the best hitter in college softball (C14). . . . Chellevold has already 
shattered the record at Arizona for hits in a season, and she's within six hits 
of an NCAA record. She's batting .504, after stepping up to the plate 228 times 
for the defending national champion Wildcats. "It's truly amazing," Coach Mike 
Candrea said, "when someone gets a hit every two times at bat." Aging

BLACK ADULTS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT CHILDREN'S FUTURE, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Black adults are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the prospects of black 
children, citing fears of violence, guns, drugs and gangs, according to a 
national poll released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, commissioned by the Children's Defense Fund and a new organization 
known as the Black Community Crusade for Children, found that more than 
three-fourths of black adults fear that their children or children they know 
will fall victim to violence. The poll did not include comparable figures for 
whites or others. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of the black adults said these are "really bad times" or "tough 
times" for black children. More than 70% of the adults -- many of whom were 
raised during an era of segregation -- believe it is harder for children today 
than it was for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This poll confirms what black leaders already know," said Children's Defense 
Fund President Marian Wright Edelman. "We have a black child crisis worse than 
any since slavery." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll showed that, although 75% of black children said these are good times 
for them personally, they also see major obstacles ahead. More than 
three-fourths of these young people said school violence is a serious problem 
for them; 70% said the same of guns, and 64% said dangerous neighborhoods are a 
major problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do have dreams and hopes and ambitions, but they see the road from here 
to there is laden with obstacles," said Geoffrey Garin, president of Peter D. 
Hart Research Associates, which conducted the poll. The poll, taken in January, 
questioned 1,004 adults and 421 children ages 11 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of adults polled said black children face more problems than 
opportunities, and the vast majority believe that at least half of all black 
children will become teen-age parents, will be denied opportunities because of 
racial prejudice or will have their lives destroyed by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several community efforts were cited as models of creative solutions, 
including "beacon schools" in New York City that stay open until 11 p.m. 
year-round and operate as community centers.

 The Clinton Administration declared a federal fishing disaster in the Pacific 
Northwest and announced a $15.7-million economic assistance plan to help the 
region's coastal fishing communities.Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said he 
declared the disaster because salmon stocks along the Pacific Coast have 
reached a record low. He estimated nearly 8,400 jobs have been affected by the 
recent crisis. Four Northwest salmon species are already protected under the 
Endangered Species Act and several others have been proposed for listing, 
largely because of a series of hydroelectric dams that impeded their migration 
up and down the Columbia and Snake rivers.

HEARINGS SET JULY 12 FOR BREYER NOMINATION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Stephen G. Breyer's nomination to 
become a Supreme Court justice will begin July 12, Chairman Joseph R. Biden 
Jr.(D-Del.) announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the first Tuesday after Congress takes a weeklong recess for the July 
4 holiday, and will be two months after Breyer was nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming his confirmation process goes as smoothly as anticipated, he would be 
confirmed before Congress leaves for its annual August recess. That would leave 
him time to prepare for the Supreme Court's traditional opening day, the first 
Monday in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer was nominated to replace Justice Harry A. Blackmun, whose retirement 
becomes effective at the end of the current term.

PLUTONIUM WASTE POSES DEADLY PROBLEM; COLD WAR: TONS OF RADIOACTIVE MATTER FROM 
WEAPONS PROGRAM MAY HAVE TO STAY IN TEMPORARY STORAGE FOR 20 YEARS, ENERGY 
DEPARTMENT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Energy Department has no permanent solution for disposing of 50 tons of 
radioactive plutonium waste from the Cold War weapons program, and it may have 
to continue using temporary storage facilities for as long as 20 years, 
department officials told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As an interim solution, the department is considering the possibility of 
storing some of the waste in abandoned military bases around the country, 
officials said in a report released earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The disposal issue is one of the thorniest facing the department. Plutonium 
poses "significant dangers to national and international security" because of 
the possibility that it could fall into the wrong hands and be fashioned into a 
nuclear bomb, Energy Undersecretary Charles Curtis said in testimony before the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 10 pounds of plutonium is needed to build a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated 100 tons of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States, 
only half will be retained by the federal government for use in nuclear 
weapons. No plans have yet been devised for disposing of the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), committee chairman, said that, although the 
problem is a serious one for both the United States and Russia -- which possess 
the bulk of the world's plutonium -- the pace of the search for a solution has 
been "torpid at best." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to solving the plutonium disposal problem, the Energy Department 
must decide what to do about the millions of pounds of radioactive waste from 
other sources that is being stored in 29 temporary sites around the nation. 
Many of the containers are rusting and threatening to release radioactivity. 
Inspection teams are attempting to assess the extent of the danger, a 
department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, most of the surplus plutonium is held at relatively few sites, 
the largest of which is the department's Pantex plant near Amarillo, Tex., 
which has the job of dismantling nuclear weapons. About 6,000 plutonium pits 
are contained in so-called igloos on Pantex land. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to store the waste at military installations appears to be the 
result of protests from Texas authorities over the storage at Pantex. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has promised Texas officials to limit the 
storage there, raising the problem of where to put the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to find a permanent storage site have run into a number of technical 
and environmental roadblocks. A federally appointed panel led by Stanford 
University Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky suggested that the plutonium could be used 
in commercial reactors to make electricity or be converted into glass logs in a 
process called vitrification. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnston raised concerns that the only U.S. reactors capable of using the 
plutonium are scheduled to be closed. It would take another decade to build a 
new reactor for the job, Panofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Cochran, a physicist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said 
in an interview that a single reactor can consume on average of one ton of 
plutonium. Using that calculation, it would take 50 years for a single reactor 
or 25 years for two reactors to use the entire surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the plutonium, which remains radioactive for 20,000 years, must be 
buried. After exhaustive research, the federal government selected a site in 
Yucca Mountain, Nev., but years of additional study will be needed before any 
radioactive materials are entombed there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the other proposals, like diluting the plutonium in ocean currents, 
launching it into outer space and detonating warheads, hardly seem to be 
serious alternatives," Johnston complained.

TEACHING THE HOLOCAUST'S LESSONS TO BLACK YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MOFFAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scholars searching for ways to broaden the lessons of the Holocaust told an 
audience at Los Angeles' most prominent black church Thursday that Nazis 
murdered and mutilated African American prisoners of war because of their race, 
and sterilized young children of mixed German and African blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation of previously unpublicized research was organized by the 
Martyrs Memorial and Museum of the Holocaust in Los Angeles, which is working 
with local teachers and researchers to develop curriculum supplements for 
secondary school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers told listeners at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church 
that documents from Nazi war crimes trials show that blacks -- both Americans 
and soldiers from Africa serving in the armies of colonial powers -- were 
singled out for mistreatment once they were captured by the Nazis.  
</P>
<P>
 In one case, said Robert Kesting, an archivist at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial 
Museum in Washington, 11 captured African American soldiers were humiliated by 
SS officers and forced to carry them on their backs before they were tortured, 
executed and mutilated. Other black soldiers were forced to dig their own 
graves before they were executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although white soldiers were also mistreated by Germans, Kesting said blacks 
tended to be treated worse because of their race: Nazis considered people of 
African descent, as well as Jews, Gypsies and handicapped people, to be "race 
polluters."  
</P>
<P>
 In a horrific example of Nazi eugenics -- the pseudo-science of genetically 
"improving" the human race -- hundreds of half-black, half-German children, 
ages 6 to 12, were sterilized under government dictates in the 1930s, Kesting 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The children, labeled the "Rhineland bastards," were for the most part the 
offspring of German women who married African soldiers who were part of the 
French army occupying western Germany after World War I. Hundreds of the 
children later disappeared without a trace. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old Holocaust memorial organization, run by the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles, sponsored Thursday's lecture in response to the 
controversy that erupted after some black high school students in Oakland were 
kicked out of a movie theater for laughing at scenes of the murder of Jews in 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Educators, struggling to get students interested in history that seems long 
ago and far away, said they believe the greater scope of genocide will hit home 
to African American students if they are taught that people of African descent 
were also persecuted by the Nazis.  
</P>
<P>
 Students need to understand that "it could have been me," said Suzanne 
Riveles, a political scientist who teaches at Howard University and 
participated in Thursday's lecture.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Leonard Jackson, associate minister of First AME, said interest in 
the Holocaust in the black community is "little or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is easy to look at a story such as 'Schindler's List' and say, 'So what?' 
But if you realize . . . it was not just Jewish individuals, it was African 
Americans, black Africans . . . that's what makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Museum Director Alex Grobman said the students in Oakland were unfairly 
criticized. They were simply unfamiliar with the history, he said, and could 
not understand that the events on screen really happened. He said he later took 
several of the students on a tour of the museum and found them "very 
receptive." 
</P>
<P>
 In their search for ways to teach the Holocaust in a broader context, Grobman 
and Allan Scholl, the museum's education specialist, began looking for 
Holocaust stories that involved blacks. They found Kesting and Riveles.  
</P>
<P>
 Riveles said the racist attitudes of some Nazi officials were shaped by their 
experiences in German colonies in Africa, where they began to consider some 
races "subhuman." "Germans . . . carried racial attitudes toward Africans very 
far. . . . They later attributed similar negative features to the 'Negro of 
Europe' -- the European Jew," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riveles was born in Berlin, and although her family is not Jewish, she 
suffered at the hands of the Nazis. Her father was executed for his role in 
Resistance activities. She later earned her Ph.D. in African studies at Howard 
University, and she has worked with Amnesty International. Riveles said it is 
important to keep telling stories from the past because the racist attitudes 
they reflect live on today. 
</P>
<P>
 First AME's Jackson agreed: "You ask the Jewish population, 'Why do you 
continue to talk about the Holocaust?' People continue to ask black people, 
'Why talk about history, it happened a long time ago.' (But) as long as we keep 
it on the front page we won't allow it to happen again."

 It turns out we omitted two well-known physicians who once worked in the city. 
One was Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald, the Green Beret convicted of murdering his wife

DECISION ON CHINA: SAD, AND CORRECT; CLINTON UNHOOKS TRADE STATUS FROM RIGHTS 
ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton acted appropriately Thursday in decoupling human rights from 
trade policy in renewing most-favored-nation trading status for China. "We have 
reached the end of the usefulness of that policy," he said, and we must sadly 
agree. It was a difficult political decision, but one thoughtfully made in 
recognition of the need to build a productive, long-term, strategic 
relationship with China. A China engaged and open is far more desirable than a 
communist giant in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to suggest that China has made vast improvements in human rights. 
It has not. Nor should the United States abandon the issue. The President was 
unequivocally clear on two points: that the United States will continue to 
champion human rights and that abuses continue in China. But the attempt to 
leverage trade for improvements in human rights has fallen short. The question 
now is what is the best way to pursue human rights in China? The issue is real, 
but it should not be the defining element in political, economic and security 
discussions with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton now believes that advances in human rights are far more likely under 
improved relations and when they are not beneath the cloud of the annual MFN 
review. MFN is accorded the vast majority of U.S. trading partners without 
annual reviews. The status allows them to sell goods in the United States at 
the lowest possible tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 China's MFN status was not subject to annual wrangling until after June, 1989, 
when Chinese tanks rolled into Tian An Men Square in a bloody confrontation 
with pro-democracy demonstrators. Congress wanted China's MFN renewal linked to 
human rights, but it was unable to prevail over President George Bush's 
preference for unfettered MFN. During the 1992 presidential campaign Bill 
Clinton accused Bush of "coddling dictators" in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year President Clinton renewed MFN for China with an executive order that 
required China to meet seven conditions, related to human rights, prison labor 
and emigration issues. Secretary of State Warren Christopher certified that 
China had made improvements in two, but not the other five. That is probably 
because changing dynamics within China over the last year have slowed 
improvements. Tensions between the central government and the provinces have 
widened with modernization; further stress is resulting because, in light of 
the ages of senior officials, changes in leadership are expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
 With China in flux, Congress should support President Clinton's balanced 
decision on MFN, thereby presenting a united U.S. front to Beijing.

ABOUT A MILE WIDE OF THE MARK; L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DENIED $15-MILLION GRANT 
BECAUSE OF INEPT APPLICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no doubt about it: The Los Angeles Unified School District bungled the 
application for a prestigious $15-million National Science Foundation grant. 
Supt. Sid Thompson called the botched application "a major mistake." As the bad 
old joke goes, that's like saying Quasimodo was a little bit ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's nothing at all amusing about the handling of the NSF grant 
request. All the school district had to do was present a coherent vision of 
what it would do to improve math and science classes for Los Angeles students. 
What was the plan and how would the district work with parents, education 
reformers, academic leaders, the civic and business communities to ensure 
success? Somehow, New York and Chicago managed to articulate their plans, and 
as a result they were awarded major grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles application, on the other hand, was "a shabbily presented 
document and it was very disorganized," said one expert who saw it. Another 
said that the Los Angeles application amounted to " 'Give us the money, we'll 
convene meetings and out of the meetings a plan will emerge. . . .' That is not 
good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it's hard to see any way that the LAUSD application process worked as 
it should have. Thompson assigned the grant writing to two math and science 
instructors -- who may be fine teachers, but the ability to secure a major 
grant is a different talent. The district didn't collaborate with the leading 
education reform organizations in the city, LEARN and the L.A. Educational 
Partnership. Apparently no one considered calling on the thinkers at UCLA and 
USC who certainly could have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 The district came up empty-handed even though it had been given a $100,000 
stipend from the NSF to research and write the grant. Luckily for the public 
school children of Los Angeles, the NSF is giving the LAUSD a second chance to 
get it right by July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 A former President spoke of "the vision thing." Clearly, that's something the 
Los Angeles Unified School District didn't have in this case. It is just this 
sort of inexcusable embarrassment that causes weary LAUSD supporters to shake 
their heads and wonder.

HOMELESS WATCH; CURBSIDE DIGNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few among us haven't known an urgent need and cursed the lack of public 
toilets; imagine this on a grinding, humiliating daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles homeless advocate Alice Callaghan has tried since 1987 to get 
public toilets on Skid Row.She had no luck with Mayor Tom Bradley, and when 
Mayor Richard Riordan seemed slow to respond, Callaghan and friends took the 
issue to City Hall, blockading a men's room to demand a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's office was already working to solve the issue, says Deputy Mayor Rae 
James. So with the help of City Council member Rita Walters, whose district 
includes Skid Row, an agreement in principle was reached to have the city 
provide a few dozen simple portable toilets, the kind you see at construction 
sites. The cost, including daily cleaning of each toilet, is comparatively 
small: $77,000 a year. The city wants eventually to follow San Diego's lead 
with permanent public toilets and full-time attendants, says James, but that 
will take time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts continue to strike down ordinances like the one that Santa Ana passed 
to prohibit public camping, so other cities may increasingly be interested in 
portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, including some Skid Row businesses, fear unattended toilets will 
conceal drug deals and prostitution. They have a reasonable point, and perhaps 
a watchful eye can be funded. But the streets will only improve if basic 
dignity is afforded the homeless and if others are spared the sensory assault 
of reeking human waste. The city and county should speedily issue the final 
permits.

A SERVING OF JUSTICE AT DENNY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unprecedented legal agreement, African American customers who were 
refused service, asked to pay in advance, seated in segregated areas or 
subjected to other hostile treatment because of their race will share in a 
$54-million settlement from Denny's, the restaurant chain. That is the largest 
nationwide settlement in any public accommodations case since the passage of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  
</P>
<P>
 "These settlements . . . put corporate America on notice that discrimination 
in public places will be just as costly as discrimination in housing and 
discrimination in employment," Deval Patrick, the new head of the Justice 
Department's Civil Rights Division said. He said the department is 
investigating 20 such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's admits no wrongdoing, but attorneys who initiated class-action 
lawsuits against Denny's, including some from the Public Interest Law Firm in 
San Jose, cited many examples. The most notorious incident involved six black 
Secret Service agents who were refused service for nearly an hour at a Denny's 
in Annapolis, Md. They were in that state to provide security during a visit by 
President Clinton. While they were forced to wait, 14 white agents and a black 
agent who sat with them were quickly served.  
</P>
<P>
 The Annapolis incident happened on the very day that a federal judge in 
California ordered Denny's to stop discriminating against black customers. That 
case started when 18 black high school and college students who had attended an 
NAACP college information program went to a Denny's restaurant in San Jose and 
were required to prepay for meals or pay a cover charge before they were 
seated. That incident led to a class-action suit alleging 3,000 racial 
incidents at Denny's restaurants in Los Angeles, Costa Mesa, San Diego, 
Sacramento and elsewhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's has also agreed to hire a civil rights monitor, retrain all its 
employees, run racially diverse advertisements and conduct random tests for 
discrimination at its restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial discrimination in public places has long been against the law. But laws 
are meaningless without strong enforcement. The Denny's settlement is a welcome 
sign that Washington once again intends to vigorously enforce civil rights 
laws.

ROSTENKOWSKI CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Michael Uhlmann's May 24 Column Right inquires rhetorically whether "someone 
in the White House may have spoken to someone in the Justice Department" about 
the department's criminal investigation into (Rep. Dan) Rostenkowski's case. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the White House has spoken or will speak to anyone in the Justice 
Department, or vice versa, about the disposition of this case. To do so would 
be contrary to this Administration's written procedures concerning 
relationships between the White House and the department. As the President's 
counsel, it is my responsibility to make sure that no such conversation occurs.

SAFEGUARDING PRIVACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article on surveillance by Thomas B. Rosenstiel (May 18) raises many 
important points about a growing threat to our personal privacy. But it fails 
to report that there is an opportunity for Californians to learn about their 
privacy rights (as well as the shortage of such rights) and how to safeguard 
their personal information. 
</P>
<P>
 California is the only state in the nation with a consumer education program 
dedicated to informing consumers about privacy protection. The Privacy Rights 
Clearinghouse is funded by the California Public Utilities Commission's 
Telecommunications Education Trust. It is located at the University of San 
Diego's Center for Public Interest Law and has been operating since October, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 18 months of the PRC's operation, nearly 15,000 Californians have 
called its toll-free hot line, (800) 773-7748, to ask questions about privacy 
-- a clear indication of the high level of concern consumers have about their 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRC has distributed hundreds of thousands of its free fact sheets, which 
offer practical tips on how to safeguard personal information in such areas as: 
junk mail, telemarketing, credit reports, workplace privacy, Social Security 
numbers, medical privacy, cellular phones, harassing phone calls, wiretapping 
and government records. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRC recognizes the serious problems that exist in this country regarding 
the lack of privacy protection in laws and regulations. By arming consumers 
with information on their privacy rights, it is raising consumers' awareness 
about an important social issue at the same time that it gives them some 
practical tips on how to limit the release of their personal information.

YASSER ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding "Arafat Clarifies 'Jihad' Call; Peres Accepts Explanation," May 
19: It is always interesting to see how PLO leader Yasser Arafat conveniently 
says different things, with the same words, to different people. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat now claims that he meant the word jihad as a peaceful religious term, 
when he talks to the Israelis and the West.But, for the past 30 years of the 
intifada, it has always meant victory through violent warfare and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, when his followers in a mosque heard him state; "Jihad will continue 
. . . our main battle is Jerusalem," they knew exactly what he meant -- it was 
not necessary for him to explain the meaning to them. It meant what it has 
always meant: an attack upon Jerusalem and the driving out of the Israelis from 
their holy city. 
</P>
<P>
 This is typical of the problems Israel has had to face most of the time in 
dealing with the Palestinian Arabs. I realize that Arafat is having problems 
with the more militant among those who hate the Jews, but his blatant attempt 
to cover up his appeal to these people must be exposed and dealt with if 
permanent peace is ever to be achieved in the Middle East.

 * Your editorial "Arafat Says: Who Me?" (May 12) omitted to mention that 
Arafat is having difficulty recruiting even his old allies, because of the 
agreement he signed. An agreement that, for starters, leaves the settlers in 
30% of Gaza; and the settlers' per capita allocation of 100 times the land and 
16 times the water designated for the native Palestinians. Would it not be more 
informative to your readers to explain why the Palestinians are angry?

LOS ANGELES RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "River Rescue" (April 20), and the letter (May 11) from 
Friends of the L.A. River (FoLAR) on May 11: I believe the 11 flood-impacted 
cities of Southeast Los Angeles County are being unfairly treated for 
supporting the proposed Los Angeles County Drainage Area (LACDA) project. The 
cities are certainly not opposed to enhancing water conservation or 
recreational opportunities for our 675,000 residents living in the 
82-square-mile flood plain area, but we are opposed to risking residents' lives 
and the region's economic future on FoLAR's dream to "restore" the Los Angeles 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 What FoLAR refuses to recognize are the economic realities, which were 
demonstrated in a $50,000 USC study commissioned by the Southeast Los Angeles 
County cities. That study estimated our region will lose $32 billion in 
economic activity and 177,000 jobs over a 10-year period without the LACDA 
project relieving the national flood insurance program requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the project is delayed, it exposes our residents to loss of life and 
economic damages totaling $2.25 billion from the effects of a 100-year flood. 
Starting next year, residents will have to pay $131 million yearly for 
mandatory flood insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 FoLAR's idea of restoring the L.A. River to its "natural" or "restored" state 
doesn't make sense. The L.A. River, after all, used to empty into Marina del 
Rey until it changed course in the mid-1800s. To take out the concrete 
retaining walls and widen the river to its "natural" state would mean removing 
40,000-plus structures just for the distance from South Gate to Long Beach.

DEBATE OVER SMOKING BANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Richard Rodriguez is right to ridicule the demonization of cigarettes ("A 
Dance With Death," Opinion, May 22). Though not particularly pleasant, 
cigarette smoking is a minor hazard compared to the battery of present-day 
assaults on our collective health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 If the anti-smoking campaigners could apply the same self-righteous zeal to 
controlling and ostracizing the chemical polluters, petroleum-driven 
automobiles, guns and their respective manufacturers, then the air truly would 
be cleaner and the environment a safer place for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, my very healthy mother puffed her way through three healthy 
pregnancies. She would rather risk losing a few years of life than be deprived 
of her simple, and personal, smoking pleasure.

<P>
 * Your article regarding the payment of $950,000 by the tobacco industry to 
actors for placing their products in movies (May 19) once again highlights the 
hypocrisy of the entertainment industry regarding the ability of movies to 
influence social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry moguls stand up and loudly deny that the constant barrage of 
violence and antisocial behavior which they produce has any effect whatsoever 
on social attitudes, but the next day they accept money for placing products in 
the films, knowing full well that the money is meant to influence viewers' 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 It must work -- why else would the money be offered? If showing people smoking 
in films (or showing Clark Gable without an undershirt) can cause a change in 
mores, does it not follow that continual showing of violence begets violence?

 * A former employee of Brown & Williamson Tobacco has leaked documents which 
indicate that 30 years ago one of their top executives stated that nicotine is 
addictive (May 17). Other memos show that the company vetoed marketing a safer 
cigarette, since it would reflect upon the safety of their other brands. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter this incriminating evidence, what do Brown & Williamson officials 
do? Of course, they sue the employee for theft of the documents. But since 
those very executives have denied knowledge of nicotine being addictive, they 
accuse him of stealing something which did not exist. Or are they worried that 
these "cigarette papers" may be the undoing of their elaborate cover-up? A 
smoking gun?

suggestion that the government fund clinics for smokers with a follow-up 
program for those smokers who revert to smoking, there is help currently 
available to smokers through a National Cancer Institute funded phone line -- 
the Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER.

KNICKS HAVE THE ANSWERS; NBA PLAYOFFS: MOSTLY, THEY INVOLVE DEFENSE IN AN 89-78 
VICTORY OVER THE PACERS IN GAME 2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Back home again in Indiana, beginning Saturday afternoon, maybe the Pacers 
will find some solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 What do they need in these Eastern Conference finals? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A victory, after the New York Knicks took one, 89-78, Thursday night at 
Madison Square Garden with 32 points and 13 rebounds from Patrick Ewing. New 
York leads the best-of-seven series, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A starting small forward besides the Invisible Man. Derrick McKey, who has 
allegedly played 75 minutes the first two games, is in a disappearing act, 
having made two of 16 shots, scored seven points and grabbed nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reggie Miller hitting something besides a courtside printer. After being 
limited to 11 shots in Game 1, about five fewer than in the first 10 postseason 
outings, he broke free for 21 in Game 2. But he made only eight, diluting much 
of the impact of his team-high 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 By the fourth quarter, while making four of 12 in the second half, he was 
obviously frustrated. The Knicks harassed him with everyone from Derek Harper, 
Greg Anthony and John Starks in the backcourt to Charles Oakley denying 
penetration up front. So when Miller lost control of a ball near the sideline 
at midcourt, late in the fourth quarter when the game had all but been decided, 
he gave a computer printer a smash with his fist. 
</P>
<P>
 It cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knick defense didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they took me out of everything," said Miller, who has increased 
his regular-season scoring average of 19.9 points by about 1 1/2 points in the 
playoffs. "I think they made us start our offense much farther out." 
</P>
<P>
 No, they haven't taken Miller out of everything. Only his role as the Pacers' 
biggest offensive threat. Center Rik Smits has outscored Miller, 49-37, in the 
first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks have shut Miller down from behind the three-point line, where, 
after finishing the regular season No. 3 in the league, he is only two of 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a team effort," said Harper, who had 18 points, eight assists and six 
rebounds along with his defensive work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is conscious where Reggie is going on the basketball floor. The 
thing with Reggie, you've got to make him earn his shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pacer Coach Larry Brown: "I think they're contesting every one of 
Reggie's shots. He'll make his share, but they're not giving him good looks." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense that was nice Tuesday -- the Knicks allowed 89 points but scored 
100 -- was downright necessary Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York opened the second quarter with a four-point lead and then made only 
three of its first 20 shots. The Knicks finished the quarter seven of 26 
(26.9%), scored only 15 points and still went into halftime with a 40-40 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 When Miller came out of the game late in the third quarter, the Knicks started 
to take control. A 14-0 run was good for a 71-62 lead with 9:34 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller returned, and the Pacers got a quick basket from Haywoode Workman, but 
Ewing answered with two free throws and a jump shot to spark an 11-6 surge that 
put the game away. Indiana scored only 16 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt an urgency," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to do something to turn the game in our favor. More than anything, 
we had to step up defensively. We wanted to get up and in on guys." 
</P>
<P>
 On the same guys they want to send down and out. That chance comes at Market 
Square Arena with Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Sunday. Indiana is 8-0 at 
home during the playoffs.

TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN; FOR KRICKSTEIN, PAIN IS GONE; SO IS STICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending what seemed like a lifetime in and out of doctors' offices, 
Aaron Krickstein is among the living. 
</P>
<P>
 With five-inch screws holding together each foot and the aches of too many 
other injuries in the last decade to recall in detail, Krickstein returned to 
Center Court at the French Open on Thursday and routed second-seeded Michael 
Stich of Germany, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, in a second-round match that was as 
nondescript as a signpost. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was nice. It really was. But after years of pain on the 
professional tour, Krickstein, 26, is simply happy to be playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing after his victory, Krickstein patiently recited the litany of 
injuries that has kept a once-promising career off balance. He has had five 
stress fractures -- three in the left foot, one in the right foot and one in 
the right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there was the taxi in 1987," he said, a smile coming over his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after recovering from one of his foot injuries in 1987, he suffered 
bruised ribs in New York when a taxi hit him as he stepped off a curb. Another 
car had run a stop sign and hit the taxi, knocking it into Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that mattered Thursday when a physically sound Krickstein met an 
opponent who soon realized it would not be his day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those days when you'd better stay in bed," Stich said.  
</P>
<P>
 Stich, ranked No. 2 in the world, had no explanation for his poor play, coming 
on the heels of last weekend's World Cup in Dusseldorf, Germany, where he 
defeated No. 1-ranked Pete Sampras and defending French champion Sergi 
Bruguera. Although ranked second, Stich has done little in Grand Slam events 
beyond winning Wimbledon in 1991 and reaching the semifinals here in '91 and in 
the Australian Open in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he is off to an abysmal start, losing in the first round in 
Australia to Mal Washington, and now in the second round at Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not so much that Stich lost, but the way he played. He had 57 unforced 
errors to Krickstein's 19. He swung at balls as if he were trying to catch 
butterflies. And he had 10 double faults. 
</P>
<P>
 "If his serving is off, he is not the second-best player in the world," 
Krickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stich, 25, has not been on the scene as long as Krickstein but has gone 
farther in shorter time. And because of that, he summarily dismissed Krickstein 
as a viable opponent. "If he's playing normal and I'm playing normal, I'm going 
to win," Stich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Krickstein: "When you beat someone in three straight in a Slam, that 
is pretty good, whether or not he is playing bad. If conditions aren't perfect 
for Michael, he has trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 With storm clouds blowing over Center Court, Stich was unable to utilize the 
express-train serve that makes him so dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 But the German did not seem to get flustered. He simply played as if he would 
rather be somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Krickstein knows the feeling. After gaining a No. 8 ranking in 1989, he has 
fluctuated between the top 10 and No. 50 when fit enough to play. He currently 
is No. 33 and trying to remain injury-free. 
</P>
<P>
 If it seems that the Michigan player has been around forever, well, maybe he 
has. He was the Assn. of Tennis Professional's youngest tour winner in 1983 at 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've outlived a few guys," Krickstein said. "I'm one of the few guys left who 
started out with a wood racket." 
</P>
<P>
 Krickstein was expected to be the next great American player. But he stalled 
when his body failed him. After his best season in 1989, he suffered an awful 
stretch of injuries the next year. He had a pulled groin, a recurring elbow 
problem and a hamstring strain. And then his father, a pathologist, 
accidentally closed a car door on his right hand late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He won one title last year and has won only nine in 11 years. Now he has a 
chance to reach the fourth round of the French Open for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Stich and No. 3 Stefan Edberg out of the lower half of the draw, 
Krickstein has as good a chance as anyone to reach the final.

MORNING BRIEFING: REPORTING BY COMPUTER: JUST THE STATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a world without sportswriters, a world so computerized that its sports 
pages are entirely produced by someone stroking an "Enter" key.  
</P>
<P>
 Morning Briefing, for example, turned out by some software program. 
Frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Get ready for SportsWriter, software that can turn facts, statistics and 
quotes about a high school sports event into your basic, bare-bones newspaper 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Helms, a Rochester, Minn., hacker who invented SportsWriter, said 82 
newspapers, mainly small weeklies, have bought his product since 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 The system works like this: A fact-gathering form comes with the program. 
Newspapers give the form to high school coaches, who fill in the blanks with 
top performances, check a few boxes and provide a few quotes. A newspaper 
employee then types the information into the computer system.  
</P>
<P>
 In seconds, a story is created.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest problems is you're so dependent on the source," said Mike 
O'Malley, executive sports editor of the St. Paul Pioneer Press, which doesn't 
use SportsWriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're kind of wondering how the coach will reflect what happens. The coach 
may not volunteer that, by the way, there was a free-for-all midway through the 
third quarter and that eight players were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing makes you a little uncomfortable. I mean, if Nixon had called 
in the Watergate results, I'm not sure he would have provided all the details." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is the name of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes' baseball team's 
mascot? Going my way?In the spirit of what the United States is all about, 
Florida Citrus Bowl officials in Orlando are erecting 91 new "No Parking" signs 
around the stadium in anticipation of next month's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 People attending the game virtually will be forced to take a park-and-ride 
service from three locations several miles away from the event and be dropped 
off no closer than a quarter-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle is also in operation for the Jan. 1 Florida Citrus Bowl football 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 1 cost: $3. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup shuttle is a welcome-to-our-fair-city price of $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal count: When Cal Ripken Jr. hit his 300th home run for the Orioles Tuesday, 
it came in his 1,939th consecutive game.  
</P>
<P>
 If his playing streak remains intact, he'll tie Lou Gehrig's 55-year-old 
record of 2,130 in Baltimore's 71st game next season. The Orioles have asked 
the American League to give them home games for next season's 71st and 72nd 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken, batting .298 with 34 RBIs after Tuesday's game, joined two other 
Orioles in the 300-homer club: Eddie Murray (330) and Boog Powell (303). 
</P>
<P>
 Crowd counts: For decades, the California League was a collection of Class-A 
pro baseball teams primarily located in the San Joaquin Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, there are five Southern California teams -- enough to play in 
their own division -- and two of them are setting attendance records.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, in their 6,100-seat, two-year-old Epicenter, are 
averaging 5,650 a game. The Lake Elsinore Storm, in its new 6,816-seat Diamond, 
is averaging 4,653. The remaining three Southern Division teams: Riverside 
Pilots, High Desert (Adelanto) Mavericks, San Bernardino Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Tremor. Uniform number: 4.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Tom Keegan of the Baltimore Sun, after the Milwaukee Brewers lost 
their 14th game in a row Wednesday: "The Milwaukee Brewers are guaranteed of 
having their most productive day in more than two weeks Thursday. They are 
idle." EARL GUSTKEY

MURRIETA'S DAVENPORT AMONG WINNERS IN SECOND ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spanish stars Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez breezed into the 
third round of the French Open Thursday with straight-set victories at Roland 
Garros Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2-ranked Sanchez Vicario routed Noelle Van Lottum of France, 6-1, 6-0, and 
No. 3 Martinez defeated Ginger Helgeson of Alpine, Calif., 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 On a slow day in the women's field, No. 9 Lindsay Davenport of Murrieta Valley 
High advanced past Katryna Nowak of Poland, 6-4, 6-2, and No. 11 Anke Huber of 
Germany defeated Meike Babel, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, the 6-foot-2, 160-pound teen-ager, said she is happy with her 
clay-court performance so far but added: "This isn't exactly my favorite 
surface. . . . I can't really slide that well." 
</P>
<P>
 She did not have to run around too much in overcoming Novak, building a 3-0 
lead in the second set to take command of the match. ELLIOTT ALMOND

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: WITH DANIELS, YOU FIND THAT NICE GUYS NEEDN'T FINISH 
LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports are filled with eccentric and egocentric rich people who fire managers, 
coaches and other employees on whims, raise ticket prices indiscriminately, 
overcharge for concessions and parking, make fools of themselves, call people 
who wear earrings "fruits" and hoard every nickel. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Bill Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever wonder if there was a perfect boss? Talk to employees at Prime Ticket. 
They'll tell you it is Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Jerry Buss started Prime Ticket in 1985 as 50-50 partners. Daniels put 
up $5 million, Buss put up television rights to the Lakers, Kings and Forum 
boxing. Daniels also got 5% of the Lakers, which he still owns. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Daniels bought out much of Buss' interest in Prime Ticket -- although 
Buss maintained 16 1/2% -- and began paying rights fees. To this day, Daniels 
calls Buss "the best business partner I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1988, Daniels hired John Severino as president of Prime Ticket and 
gave him 5% of the company. And when Prime Ticket moved from Inglewood to 
Century City, Frank Price, the former president of Columbia Pictures who owned 
the Century City building that would house the company, got 1% as incentive to 
lower the monthly rent to $50,000 and to permit Daniels to erect a large Prime 
Ticket sign on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels also spruced up the new headquarters. Severino got an office at Prime 
Ticket that was twice as big and twice as nice as the one he had while 
president of ABC. Vice presidents were given offices that most company 
presidents could only dream about. 
</P>
<P>
 When Prime Ticket started "Press Box," its critically acclaimed nightly sports 
news show, the producers were given the best equipment and a new studio. 
</P>
<P>
 And no money was spared last year in starting up La Cadena Deportiva, the 
Spanish-language sports network that is expected to become a national service 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels bought out Severino's 5% when Severino resigned in August 1992, giving 
Daniels 82 1/2% of Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, Daniels sold Prime Ticket, pending routine regulatory approval, 
for more than $200 million. Daniels said the main part of the deal gives him a 
considerable amount of stock from the new owners, Tele-Communications, Inc. 
(TCI). 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket represents about 25% of Daniels' holdings, so he is a 
billionaire, or close to it. He is on the Forbes magazine list of the 400 
richest people in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 And now he will be sharing some of his wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said when he negotiated the sale, it was set up so that $10 million in 
cash would go to what he calls 15 "phantom stockholders" at Prime Ticket. They 
are vice presidents and department heads who will divvy up the pot. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not all. Daniels said the remaining 105 or so employees will share 
a pot of between $1 million and $2 million, which will come out of his own 
pocket. He said they will receive their bonuses when the sale is approved, 
which should be in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to reward the people there for a job well done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder that Alan Massengale, when he reported the sale at the end of 
last Friday's "Press Box" show, said: "There's no way you could work for a 
better boss." 
</P>
<P>
 Severino said: "He is one of the most -- if not the most -- honest, fair and 
decent human beings I've ever been associated with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the acquisition of Prime Ticket, TCI and its chief executive officer, 
John Malone, are on the verge of becoming a major player in the sports 
television business. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI plans to go after the Madison Square Garden network, the country's other 
major regional sports network. That acquisition, which would also include the 
New York Knicks, New York Rangers and the Garden, is expected to cost between 
$800 million and $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 If TCI can get the MSG network, it would then own or be affiliated with nearly 
all of the country's 30 regional sports networks, which reach 44 million cable 
households. That would put TCI in the same league with ESPN and Turner 
Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said he would like to see Roger Werner, Prime Ticket's current 
president who formerly was president of ESPN, head the new network. "He has all 
the qualifications," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another top candidate for such a position would be Ed Frazier of Dallas, who 
is the CEO of Liberty Sports, the TCI subsidiary that oversees the company's 
sports holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 If events had followed a different course, Daniels instead of Malone, a close 
friend and associate, would be on the verge of controlling this envisioned 
major sports cable network. Malone and Daniels started Texas-based Prime 
Network in 1988, and four years later, TCI and Malone bought out Daniels.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point, it was close to being the other way around, but Malone topped 
Daniels' offer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels is generally regarded as the father of cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 This dates to 1952 when Daniels, after flying jet fighters in the Korean war, 
returned home to Casper, Wyo., and got together with a television engineer, Tom 
Morrisey, to start a cable service that brought television reception into 
Casper and surrounding areas from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 They leased a microwave service from the telephone company for $8,500 a month, 
which, Daniels said, "seemed like all the money in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 They charged $150 for a cable hookup and $7.50 a month. Their customers, 
fascinated by this new thing called television, were willing to pay it. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels and Associates, now based in Denver and Carlsbad, became one of the 
country's major cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, 73, is now trying to unload most of his holdings, but he's not 
considering retirement. It's just that as a cable television entrepreneur, this 
is what he does. He has gotten rich by acquiring companies, building up their 
value, then selling them. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels has no immediate family besides his brother, Jack. Jack Daniels lives 
in Albuquerque and once ran for governor of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Daniels, who has been married four times, is currently single. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's he going to do with all his money? He says he doesn't know. But 
someday, there could be more windfalls for loyal employees, of which there are 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kind of boss.

TENNIS / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; USC'S NO. 1, BLACK, ADVANCES, BUT LEACH, UCLA'S 
JANECEK LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-seeded Wayne Black of USC held off an aggressive second-set comeback by 
Tennessee's Chris Mahony to win, 6-1, 7-5, in Thursday's second round of the 
NCAA men's tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But Black's teammate, Jon Leach, fell to Jan Hermansson of Southern Alabama, 
4-6, 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, the hero of USC team title-clinching match against Stanford on Tuesday, 
said he was outmatched by Hermansson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just too good today," Leach said. "If he plays like he did today, he 
will do well in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach was joined on the sideline by third-seeded Rob Janecek of UCLA, who was 
upset by Vaughn Synman of Alabama Birmingham, 6-1, 2-6, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Marcus Hilpert of Arkansas stayed on target for a match against 
Black by beating Tad Berkowitz of New Mexico, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Pepperdine players lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Flanagan of Stanford defeated the Waves' Ari Nathan, 6-4, 6-1, and 
Mike Sell of Georgia defeated Pepperdine's Charles Auffray, 6-1, 6-3.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; GIANTS WIN BEHIND ROOKIE, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a kid from Tennessee, William VanLandingham does a pretty good 
California-cool impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by Matt Williams' National League-leading 18th homer, VanLandingham won 
his first major league start by outpitching Andy Benes as the San Francisco 
Giants defeated the Padres, 5-3, Thursday at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old right-hander was impressive, especially considering that he 
was called up from double-A Shreveport only eight days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't act like a kid," catcher Jeff Reed said. "He acts poised out 
there. He doesn't get all excited easily. Most guys from triple-A, their first 
time they aren't that impressive. When you bring a guy all the way up from 
double-A, that's damn good." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in place of injured Bill Swift, VanLandingham (1-0) gave up two runs 
and six hits in 5 1/3 innings, struck out five and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 11, New York 10 -- The Pirates got eight gift runs as a result of 
three infield errors by the Mets, then rallied on Lance Parrish's game-winning 
single in the 13th inning at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Young hit a game-tying sacrifice fly in the ninth inning, then doubled 
and scored on Parrish's line-drive single. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Seminara (0-1), the Mets' seventh pitcher, needed only three pitches to 
two batters to get the loss. Alejandro Pena (2-1) pitched four innings of 
hitless relief for the victory as the Pirates won for the third time in 13 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 14, Colorado 4 -- John Roper won his third consecutive start 
against the Rockies and triggered an eight-run second inning with a 
bases-loaded single at Denver as the Reds ended a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper, making his second start since being recalled from triple-A 
Indianapolis, limited the Rockies to four runs and five hits in seven innings 
as the Reds built a 14-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati scored twice in the first inning against Greg Harris (2-4) and sent 
12 men to the plate in the second, with the first eight batters reaching base. 
The Reds scored five runs before making an out in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 8, Atlanta 5 -- Ken Caminiti had three doubles and scored the go-ahead 
run in a four-run eighth inning as the Astros won at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Caminiti, who extended his hitting streak to 12 games, doubled off the 
center-field fence in the eighth, the first of four consecutive hits against 
Mike Stanton (1-1). Kevin Bass singled off Stanton's glove as Caminiti took 
third, and Tony Eusebio's single gave Houston a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Andujar Cedeno followed with an RBI single that chased Stanton. Steve Finley 
and Craig Biggio hit run-scoring singles with two out against Milt Hill.

four-year contract with Turner Broadcasting System to become an NBA 
game-of-the-week analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said neither his health nor any conflicts with the Nets' front office or 
players led to his move.

COLLEGE BASEBALL / NCAA REGIONALS; ROBERGE POWERS USC TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.P. Roberge is still in the midst of his USC baseball career, but his name is 
already etched in history at the baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberge, a junior first baseman from Arcadia, has his name inscribed on a 
plaque in Cooperstown, N.Y., for having won the most-valuable-player award at 
the 1991 Senior Babe Ruth World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberge's goal this season is to help the Trojans make some history of their 
own by landing their first College World Series berth in 16 years. He made a 
major contribution toward that end Thursday with five hits, including two home 
runs, during a 19-3 victory over North Carolina Greensboro in the first round 
of the NCAA South Regional at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded USC, which had a season-high 20 hits, plays tonight against 
third-seeded Tulane, a 7-5 winner Thursday over Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the eight, six-team double-elimination regionals advance to Omaha 
for the College World Series June 3-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just one of those days when you're in a zone," said Roberge, who drove 
in six runs and scored five times. "You're seeing the ball real well, it's 
right where you expect it to be and you can hit to all fields. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's offensive outburst was reminiscent of the Trojans' visit to Baton Rouge 
for a regional in 1990. USC defeated Southern Mississippi, 23-5, then beat 
Houston, 26-11, before being eliminated with consecutive losses to Louisiana 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing matches those first two games in 1990 in terms of production," USC 
Coach Mike Gillespie said. "But this was a pretty good way to start off." 
</P>
<P>
 USC shortstop Gabe Alvarez had three hits and three runs batted in. Right 
fielder Jacque Jones also had three hits and drove in a run. Designated hitter 
Glen Carson had two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman right-hander Scott Henderson (4-1), who replaced starter Ben Tucker 
in the second inning, gave up one run, six hits and struck out six in 5 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans scored in every inning, including six times in the eighth, and 
took advantage of four errors. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina Greensboro had a 2-1 lead after one inning, but saw that lead 
disappear when Roberge hit a two-run homer in the second. Roberge added a 
two-run shot during a four-run fifth inning. He also bunted for a hit and had 
two other singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Jay Kuykendall's errant throw to second base on a double-play ball 
during USC's three-run fourth proved particularly costly to North Carolina 
Greensboro, which began its program in 1991 and is making its first playoff 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our inability to execute a pretty fundamental play just opened the floodgates 
for them," Spartan Coach Mike Gaski said.  
</P>
<P>
 Every top-seeded team that opened play Thursday won. Defending national 
champion LSU defeated Southeastern Louisiana, 10-6, in the South Regional; Ohio 
State beat Brigham Young, 6-1, in the Atlantic II Regional at Tallahassee, 
Fla., and Clemson defeated The Citadel, 5-1, in the East Regional at Clemson, 
S.C. The start of the Mideast Regional at Knoxville, Tenn., was postponed until 
today because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State (39-17) opens play in the Midwest II Regional at Wichita, 
Kan. today against Washington (42-16). Cal State Fullerton (41-13) plays 
Northwestern State (44-13) in the Midwest I Regional at Stillwater, Okla.

 Chatsworth High, a 7-6 loser to Woodland Hills El Camino Real in the City 
Division 4-A baseball championship game last year, is favored by coaches to win 
the tournament this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors (24-4), ranked No. 5 in the Southland by The Times, will open 
the playoffs today as the top-seeded team in 4-A when they play host to Van 
Nuys Grant in a first-round game at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairings, set by a coaches' committee, were announced Thursday.

is seeded sixth and will play host to Sepulveda Monroe in its playoff opener. 
</P>
<P>
 East Valley League rivals Sylmar and Polytechnic are seeded second and fourth, 
respectively. Pacific League champion Carson is seeded third.

HIGH SCHOOL TRACK / CITY CHAMPIONSHIPS; WASHINGTON'S MCELROY WINS SPRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After securing a football scholarship to UCLA last February, Jim McElroy 
wasn't thinking about attempting to become the City Section's top sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the advice of some friends, however, the Washington High senior changed his 
mind at the last minute and went out for the track team. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy was rewarded for his decision with victories in the 100 and 200 meters 
at the City finals Thursday at Van Nuys Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been running track since I was in the sixth grade," said McElroy, who is 
expected to play wide receiver for the Bruins. "But with my scholarship in 
hand, I thought I would just concentrate on getting ready for college. I 
decided to help out the team, though, and I'm glad I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dorsey easily retained its team title with 75 points, the spotlight 
was on McElroy. His times of 10.81 seconds in the 100 meters and 21.47 in the 
200 were good enough to edge league rival Leo Settle of Dorsey in both races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been battling Leo all season, and I knew his team was the heavy favorite 
today," said McElroy, who is 5 feet 11 and 155 pounds. "But I didn't want them 
to run away without a fight, and that's what I tried to do." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy also anchored the Generals' 400 and 1,600 relays, which each placed 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three finishers in each event qualified for the State meet, June 3-4 
at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite McElroy's success, the meet belonged to Dorsey, which scored in 11 of 
15 events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured before the meet that we'd score 55 points, so we went beyond my 
expectations," said Ralph Tilley, Dorsey's coach. "We had no disappointments." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey's second boys' title in a row was aided by several second-place 
finishes: Anthony Mabry in the 110 high hurdles, Gene Shepard in the 400 and 
Anthony Wheeler in the 800. The Dons' only victories were in the 400 and 1,600 
relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington finished second with 42 points and Woodland Hills El Camino Real 
was third with 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena easily won the girls' team title with 75 points. Dorsey and 
Westchester tied for second with 47. University, last year's team champion, 
finished in a tie for last place with one point. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' competition was also marked by a strong individual performance in 
the sprints. Senior Lataya McCarthy of Gardena won the 100 (12.3) and 200 
(25.59) and anchored the team's victorious 400 and 1,600 relays.

SOFTBALL / COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; UCLA BATS CAN'T BACK UP WEIMAN

 Despite a 14-strikeout performance from UCLA's DeeDee Weiman, Fresno State's 
softball team scored the game's only run in the seventh inning to beat the 
Bruins, 1-0, Thursday in the first-round of the Women's College World Series in 
front of 1,596 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first opening-round loss in 12 tournament appearances for UCLA, 
winner of seven NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (49-14) scored on Robyn Yorke's two-out single in the seventh. 
She drove in Jo Pini, who was hit by a pitch and moved to second on a single by 
Laura Berg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins answered by loading the bases in the bottom of the inning on two 
singles and a walk. But with two out, Jenny Brewster was caught looking on a 
full-count curveball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling she was going to come inside," Brewster said. "You've got to 
swing and hit the ball in order to score, and I didn't do that. It was too 
close to take." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (41-13) stranded 12 runners and left the bases loaded in the 
fourth, fifth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge (50-8) defeated Missouri, 5-3, in another first-round 
game. Amy Windmiller (25-2) pitched a four-hitter and struck out 11 for the 
third-ranked Matadors. Missouri is 40-22.

 Arizona defeated Illinois Chicago, 8-0, and Utah defeated Oklahoma State, 2-0, 
in the other games.

A WORTHY EXPLORATION OF WAR'S MENTAL WOUNDS -- TAKE 2; THE EYE IN THE DOOR BY 
PAT BARKER ; DUTTON; $20.95, 280 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Manning, posted to the Ministry of Munitions in London during World 
War I in the wake of a front-line injury, is talking to his Army psychiatrist, 
Dr. William Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning begins by describing how he had to shoot one of his men, Scudder, 
after Scudder had become trapped in a mud-filled shell hole, sinking slowly and 
vocally to his death. Reporting to battalion headquarters with another 
serviceman, Hines, the following night, Manning found his superiors extremely 
unhappy; dining on veal and ham and wine, the officers informed Manning that he 
had positioned his company too far forward, creating a bulge in the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning suddenly realized that he and Hines wouldn't be offered even a drink. 
"So I leant across the table," Manning says, "took two glasses, gave one to 
Hines and said, 'Gentlemen, the King.' And of course they all had to struggle 
to their feet." Manning and Hines made a quick retreat, "giggling like a pair 
of schoolboys," before the startled brass "could work out how to put an officer 
on a charge for proposing the loyal toast." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the shell hit, Manning says, pointing to his mangled leg. "Poor 
old Hines. . . . I crawled across to him. And he looked straight at me and 
said, 'I'm all right, Mum.' And died.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Eye in the Door," Pat Barker continues the story started in her highly 
acclaimed novel "Regeneration," which centered on the conflict encountered by 
Rivers in his treatment of wounded, often shellshocked infantrymen, notably the 
soldier-poet Siegfried Sassoon. 
</P>
<P>
 As a doctor and a human being, Rivers wanted to make his patients better, 
whole; but as a British citizen and Army employee, he knew that every medical 
success meant sending one more soldier back to the battlefield.  
</P>
<P>
 Rivers' internal conflict does play a role in "The Eye in the Door," but in 
this novel Barker focuses less on Rivers than on Billy Prior, an angry, 
shellshocked patient from "Regeneration." It's through Prior that we meet 
Manning, whom Prior picks up for a sexual encounter, and begin to see that the 
new novel is not only about inwardly divided minds but about the stress 
triggered by war in society at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior, like Manning, works for the Ministry of Munitions, but he has a much 
bigger chip on his shoulder about the war effort. Manning seems to have made 
his peace with the irrationality of war, perhaps because he still believes in 
what River calls, in another context, a "terminal stiff upper lip."  
</P>
<P>
 Prior, by contrast, seethes with a barely suppressed rage, caused not by 
shellshock but the inequitable divisions in British society. And as it happens, 
at the ministry he can do something about it: A childhood friend, a shopkeeper 
named Beattie Roper, has been sent to prison for threatening to kill Prime 
Minister David Lloyd George. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior visits her in prison and is quickly convinced that she has been 
railroaded; a pacifist from the lower classes who freely admits to hiding 
conscientious objectors, she was an easy mark. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one major thread in "The Eye in the Door." Another is the real-life 
libel trial brought against a London newspaper for publishing articles alleging 
the existence of a German Black Book purportedly giving the names of 47,000 
English sexual deviants, many of them in high places.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter that the Black Book's promoter, Harold Spencer, was later judged 
insane; a similar view is expressed by Prior's boss, Major Lode, when he says 
Britain was being "brought to its knees . . . not by Germany, but by an unholy 
alliance of socialists, sodomites and shop stewards." Prior can't tell Lode, of 
course, that both he and Manning are bisexual, nor that Lode's obsession with 
sexual and social distinctions is part of Britain's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The third major strand in "The Eye in the Door" is Prior's fugue states in 
which he commits out-of-character and sometimes violent acts that his conscious 
mind cannot remember. This Jekyll-and-Hyde theme carries the novel's weight, 
because one of Barker's themes is that authentic feeling, socially acceptable 
or not, will inevitably work its way to the surface and may well become 
dangerous if repressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivers frequently expresses that same concern: It's better to hate war even as 
you do the soldier's job, he tells his patients, than to bury one's disgust at 
needless bloodshed and wade through the killing fields like an automaton. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rivers muses, after seeing Sassoon again upon the writer's return to 
England with a minor head wound: 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps, contrary to what was usually supposed, duality was the stable state; 
the attempt at integration, dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Passages like that make "The Eye in the Door" an exceptional novel, bringing 
substantial and relevant ideas to life through singular, arresting characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivers is the psychiatrist of one's dreams, willing to change places with a 
patient if he believes it will do the patient good; Prior is the friend you 
couldn't keep, unpredictable and angry enough to keep most acquaintances at a 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel has its flaws -- Beattie's story simply peters out, for example, and 
Sassoon's reappearance seems unnecessary -- but it is a worthy sequel 
nonetheless and a fine achievement in its own right.

INK: EDITOR JACKIE O. MISSED THE BEST BOOK OF ALL -- HER OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis worked as a New York book editor for 19 years but 
apparently made no effort to produce one of the most sought-after books in 
publishing -- her autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry colleagues say they knew of no attempt on her part to write either a 
personal memoir or even a more selective account -- for example, of the world 
figures she had known. Indeed, her unyielding efforts to guard her privacy 
prompted one high-level editor to speculate that it was "wildly improbable" 
that she had written a manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never any awareness on the part of her Doubleday colleagues that 
she had any inclination or expectation to write her story," an associate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Onassis chose to shine her celebrity on the books of others. 
</P>
<P>
 After joining Viking Press in 1975 -- she moved to Doubleday three years later 
-- Onassis spoke with reporters at parties launching her books. At one such 
gathering last fall, held at the Consulate General of India in Manhattan to 
mark the publication of "The Garden of Life," an artistic book about the plants 
of India, she mingled with guests and introduced them to her author, Naveen 
Patnaik. When approached by this reporter, a notebook in his hand, Onassis 
spoke about how the book had come together. 
</P>
<P>
 Onassis edited titles that reflected her interest in history and the arts, as 
well as her keen eye for commercial hits. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Doubleday editorial meeting years ago, she laid out her plans for a book 
by a pop singer few in the room had heard of. The author was Michael Jackson, 
the book became "Moonwalk" (1988) and the editor's hunch paid off in handsome 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other books included Bill Moyers' "Healing and the Mind," a leading seller 
of recent years; Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar"; Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's 
"Poet and Dancer"; "The Best of Rolling Stone: 25 Years of Journalism on the 
Edge," edited by Robert Love, and four children's books by singer Carly Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 Onassis also acquired Vasily Peskov's "Lost in the Taiga," an account of 
Russian Orthodox peasants discovered living in remote Siberia, which Doubleday 
will publish in July. Her other project scheduled for release this year is 
"Toni Frissell: Photographs 1933-1967," a collection of striking pictures taken 
by the veteran photographer, who died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The books will speak for her. That is, except for interviews about her 
publishing career that she gave Ms. magazine in 1979 and Publishers Weekly in 
1993, her own documented recollections since her husband's assassination 
consisted mainly of a few minutes of testimony before the Warren Commission and 
interviews with historians Theodore White and William Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Manchester recorded 10 hours of interviews with Onassis as he researched "The 
Death of a President." He gave many of these tapes to the John F. Kennedy 
Library and Museum in Cambridge, Mass., where they are under seal until 2067. 
The library also has tapes of the White interviews, which are off-limits until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Postscript: One of the more surprising details in this week's ocean of ink 
about Onassis comes in the New Yorker (May 30), which devotes all of its "Talk 
of the Town" to memories of her and reveals that she too once wrote an 
unbylined piece for the section. Her article about New York's International 
Center of Photography appeared Jan. 13, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knew? 
</P>
<P>
 A Few Minutes With Judy Krantz: Judith Krantz's success with commercial novels 
rich in steamy sex and glamorous excess began in 1978 with her effort, 
"Scruples," the story of a swank boutique. "Scruples Two" came six books later, 
followed by the new "Lovers" (Crown), the conclusion to her trilogy that has 
more than 400,000 copies in print and will spawn an ABC miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of Krantz's knowledge of conspicuous consumption -- "my beat is not 
the lady next door" -- the resident of pricey Bel-Air confesses that she no 
longer has time to go out and shop on Rodeo Drive or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have managed to acquire clothes, but in lightning forays," said Krantz, 67, 
a diminutive gabber who was clad in a muted green Chanel suit during a recent 
New York visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "J. Crew and J. Peterman are my favorite catalogues. And then I go to Chanel. 
They have a book of the spring and fall collections with swatches of fabric and 
designs, and drawings or photographs. I order from that. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I couldn't afford it, I was shopping anyway. . . . Now that I can more 
than afford it, I don't have the time. It's not a really tragic story, but I 
don't have the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Top Editor Joins Murdoch: Judith Regan has earned more newspaper and magazine 
coverage than any book editor in history, or so it seems, mainly because she 
helped turn manuscripts by Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern and Kathie Lee Gifford 
into best-selling riches. Now, after much speculation about Regan's plans, an 
announcement this week revealed that Simon & Schuster has lost the 
hard-charging editor to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and its subsidiary 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old Regan will become a reporter for a Fox TV newsmagazine in 
development. She will start up Regan Books within HarperCollins Publishers and 
she will develop films for 20th Century-Fox.

LEO KUPER; SOCIOLOGIST WROTE ABOUT WORLDWIDE GENOCIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leo Kuper, an internationally recognized sociologist and scholar whose 
research on genocide set benchmark guidelines in that field, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for his family and the Institute on the Holocaust and 
Genocide, based in Jerusalem, said he died in Los Angeles on Monday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of South Africa, Kuper taught at universities throughout the world, 
including a 15-year tenure at UCLA, where he was a professor of sociology and 
director of the African Studies Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Kuper wrote what is considered his landmark work: "Genocide: Its 
Political Use in the Twentieth Century." In it he created a theme of "the 
odious scourge" that has carried over into other works on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Literary Supplement of London said that "if there were a peace prize 
for sociologists, it should be awarded to (Kuper)." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Kuper was part of a select group of British and American officials 
who formed International Alert. Based in Los Angeles and London, it worked 
closely with human rights groups (particularly Amnesty International) to keep 
ethnic developments firmly in the glare of international publicity, unlike the 
secrecy of the Holocaust, which resulted in the deaths of 6 million Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuper said at that time that he estimated that genocide had claimed more lives 
since World War II than had the Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Kuper wrote "The Prevention of Genocide," in which he analyzed 
the major obstacles to United Nations action in Cambodia, Bangladesh, Timor, 
Indonesia and other African and Asian nations where human rights abuses occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Johannesburg, Kuper practiced law in South Africa until World War II. 
After military service he taught at the University of Natal, South Africa, and 
the University of Birmingham in England, where he also did neighborhood 
planning for the city of Coventry. 
</P>
<P>
 His main books on South Africa, "Passive Resistance in South Africa" and "An 
African Bourgeoisie," were banned in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuper also was a founding member of the International Council of the Institute 
on the Holocaust and Genocide and a contributing editor to its publications. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by two daughters and three grandchildren.

AN AGE OF LIMITS AND DEFINITIONS; CALIFORNIA: WE WALL OURSELVES OFF TO FIND THE 
DREAM, BUT IT'S OUR ABILITY TO EMBRACE CHANGE THAT MAKES THE STATE UNIQUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLIE STODDARD, Charlie Stoddard, 22, graduated this month from Claremont 
McKenna College with a combined major in philosophy, politics and economics. 
She starts work in June for an electronic publications company in Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, I left college behind to traverse Los Angeles in an exhausting 
search for a place to live. For the better part of daylight, I ricocheted 
throughout Santa Monica, bouncing from address to address, hoping to find the 
ideal apartment. Eventually I hoped to find any apartment, as building after 
building was eliminated: earthquake damage, too small, too dingy, olive-green 
shag carpeting. Building eliminations soon led to neighborhood and then 
regional exclusions: the area looked too run-down, "suspicious" cars drove by 
just a little too slowly, shady characters hung around outside the local 
supermarket. It occurred to me that the California in which I grew up was a 
California not available to most people; in fact, it was a California not now 
available to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhausted and depressed, I turned a corner to consult my map and found myself 
in a neighborhood not unlike my hometown of Claremont: quaint bungalows, mowed 
lawns, palms and picket fences. Now this was California -- the California that 
exists in many people's minds and the California that existed in my reality, 
the California ideal, the California of my expectations. The options looked 
brighter and I continued my search with renewed vigor. But this vigor was not 
to last long. There was not an apartment building to be found, and the cost of 
the occasional duplex made me reel. Nothing to rent, lease or even buy within 
this housing oasis. There was no room in this area for those with only 
aspirations of upward mobility and certainly no room for those with no such 
ambition. Living within the environment of the California ideal in which I grew 
up is no longer an expectation, but part of a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 California's history comprises the dream, by arrivals from all directions, of 
a better quality of life for themselves and their families. But that quality 
has become more difficult to attain, and many of those who have achieved it now 
believe they must escape just to maintain it. Those of us who can afford to now 
seem to perpetually run from those now following the same California vision 
that allowed our own success. We form exclusive communities, without looking 
back, hoping never to catch a glimpse of the reality that would require us to 
see these communities as the anachronism that they are rapidly becoming.  
</P>
<P>
 The reality of California occupies more than the occasional glimpse that we 
catch on our way to the airport or the Laker game, when we step outside our 
sheltered bubble. The reality of California is not the microcosm of palms and 
bungalows. The reality of California is what we try to escape. That escape is 
what keeps the California ideal from becoming reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than define ourselves according to a dream available only to the few, 
we need to include in our definition characteristics that make all aspects of 
California and Californians unique: our ability to adapt to the constant and 
unexpected changes in our definition; our ability to rumble, roll, shift and 
shake without warning and still manage to come out standing. It is this 
resilience that defines California, a resilience on which we have always stood 
and on which we should continue to rely. 
</P>
<P>
 With the taste of graduation still lingering and the scent of the working 
world wafting in a bit too quickly, I set out with a new vision of California. 
For me, it is no longer a leisurely ride down tree-lined streets toward the 
park and not yet a frenzied commute down crowded highways toward corporate 
headquarters. While many people see mine as an age of limitless options, it is 
also a time in which seeking limits and definitions is the most important 
option.  
</P>
<P>
 I now set off to define what it means to be a Californian. I may not get my 
own bungalow; more likely, a studio in a multi-unit apartment complex. But 
maybe I'll have a palm outside my window.

PERSPECTIVE ON HAITI; ORPHAED BY ITS LATIN NEIGHBORS; THE PRINCIPLE OF 
NONINTERFERENCE IS JUST AN EXCUSE TO IGNORE THE PAIN OF OUR HEMISPHERE'S 'BLACK 
BOSNIA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIEGO ARRIA, Diego Arria was Venezuela's ambassador to the United Nations 
and participated in the Security Council's consideration of the Haiti crisis. 
He is a visiting diplomatic fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New 
York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haitians go home! And stay there! This is clearly the message to the poorest 
inhabitants of our Hemisphere. The message is most audible in the United 
States, where the fate of the first democratically and constitutionally elected 
government of Haiti has become a domestic political issue, largely due to the 
pressure exercised by black American political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, the U.S. government has its share of responsibility in the 
failure of the international community to restore the government of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But its involvement, limited as it is, has served to 
shield the failings of the Latin American countries to assume, effectively and 
honestly, their collective responsibilities within the inter-American system. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti, after all, is in the Caribbean, not on some faraway continent. It is 
the second-oldest independent country in the Hemisphere (after the United 
States). It is also the world's oldest black republic. It should be known more 
widely that many Haitians died fighting for the United States in its war of 
independence, and that a Haitian president, Alexandre Petion, generously 
assisted Simon Bolivar to finance the campaign of independence of Venezuela, 
Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Panama and Ecuador. As part of these recollections, I 
would add that it was the Haitians who handed Napoleon I, emperor of France, 
his first defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Is is evident, then, that the Haitians have not been free-riders in the 
defense of their rights or in their solidarity with the peoples of the United 
States and of Latin American in their struggles for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians have -- and continue to live -- a tormented history, from 
enslavement by the French to the dictatorships of the infamous Duvaliers and 
their current heir, Cedras; from the richest sugar-producing colony in the 
Caribbean in the 18th Century to the extreme poverty of today. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Haiti is part of the Americas, the general impression in the 
region is that its problems are, and should essentially be, of concern only to 
the United States. This impression is confirmed by the strictly ritualistic and 
formalistic interest expressed by Latin Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 The sacrosanct principle of self-determination has served them well on this 
occasion as an excuse not to get seriously involved in the tragedy of this 
black and poor member of our community. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Haitians keep out" message comes not only from Florida, which already has 
generously received more than its share of refugees, but also from the Latin 
American countries that do not welcome refugees and are, if only through 
passivity, effectively discriminating against their poorest sibling. 
</P>
<P>
 For the future of inter-American relations, it is sad and disappointing to 
witness once more -- as if the case of the U.S. invasion of Panama was not 
enough -- how the Latin American governments continue to yield their 
responsibilities to the United States in affairs in their own back yards. Also 
how they have so easily discarded their historical debt to Haiti, a once 
independent and generous nation. Yesterday the leadership was surrendered to a 
U.S. ambassador, Lawrence Pezzullo; today to William Gray. Are the principles 
of regional sovereignty and independence of action less important than the 
principle of self-determination? Or is it plainly that Haiti is not worth the 
effort? 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Black Caucus of the U.S. Congress and the leadership of other black 
Americans such as Randall Robinson provide the main support for President 
Aristide's return to Haiti. Was it necessary for the cause of Haiti to resort 
to ethnicity? The sad answer is yes. Haiti in some ways is becoming a black 
Bosnia. In the Balkans, the Bosnians are considered Muslim and as such, 
non-Europeans not worth fighting for. The Haitians are black, not Latin, and as 
such, it seems, not worth fighting for. Their only recourse, then, is to appeal 
to their black brothers in the United States to influence their government to 
act.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there are no black caucuses in Latin America to speak on behalf 
of their black and impoverished brethren on the island of Hispaniola. So, for 
their own domestic political considerations, the nations of Latin America will 
let Washington carry the ball and incur the costs that an intervention may 
incur -- as well as thecensure for violating Haiti's sovereign right to suffer 
alone. Only then will Latin America find it useful to remember that Haiti does 
not belong to the United States but to the Organization of American States.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; SHAKING THE STATUS QUO ON WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sound management of water resources is a fundamental issue that goes to 
the heart of Orange County's future. 
</P>
<P>
 For 23 years, grand juries have been recommending consolidations in water 
districts; now the jury has weighed in with a provocative recommendation that 
nine independent water districts be merged into two larger agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A recommendation for consolidation at the wholesale level would be 
unsurprising, but a suggestion for merger of retail districts that sell the 
water directly to households and businesses appears already to have stirred 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the president of the Irvine Ranch water board -- which was the suggested 
managing umbrella district for five others in South County, and might be 
thought to benefit -- said he was not sure that the consolidation of the retail 
districts was really necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury spent six months on the study and is to be credited with 
tackling a subject that has resisted resolution all these years. What the jury 
has produced is a good start, and we should hope that consolidation will not be 
debated for another 23 years before decisions are made one way or the other. 
The recommendations have gone to the county's Local Agency Formation 
Commission, which is charged with taking action. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report says that consumers pay too much for water, but it does 
not say how much is too much, and it does not suggest how much water rates 
would decrease by taking the action recommended. The public needs these 
answers. Obviously, it would be desirable to supply water at rates that are 
more advantageous for homeowners and businesses. But while efficiency is 
desirable in the abstract, these savings need to be spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Water management ultimately should be about the public interest, but in the 
reality of the political world, it is also about the preservation of turf. 
</P>
<P>
 A case must be made that it is worth giving up the sense of "local government" 
that individual retail districts provide in return for bigger districts that 
demonstrably would save money.

DIVISION II SOFTBALL; FULLERTON, FANCUBERTA BEAT CHARTER OAK, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MADDY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 The last time Fullerton won a Freeway League softball title was 10 years ago. 
That was also the last time the Indians won a Southern Section softball title. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton won its eighth in a row and moved a game closer to a repeat of 1984 
with a 4-1 Division II quarterfinal victory over Covina Charter Oak on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Angie Fancuberta pitched a two-hitter and Annette Martinez had two 
runs batted in for the Indians (17-13), who earned a semifinal date against 
top-seeded Saugus (27-2-1), a 4-0 winner over Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really started hitting the ball in the playoffs," Fullerton Coach Scott 
Weber said. "Today, we actually scored some runs -- we have had trouble getting 
people across (stranding 22 runners in two extra-inning playoff games)." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton took a 2-0 lead in the second. A hit batter and a mishandled bunt 
preceded Marianne Emigh's RBI single. Martinez grounded to third, but after a 
pause to look at the runner, Nicole Falls' late throw to first allowed Valerie 
Miller to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton made it 4-1 on RBI singles by Martinez and Amy Simpson. Fancuberta 
(17-12) walked two and struck out three. Her 17 victories matches the 
second-best total in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angie is one of the best pitchers in the county," Weber said. "She just 
battles the whole way. She hasn't struck out a whole lot (five in the last two 
games), but our defense has come through."

FOUNTAIN VALLEY RELIEVER PONCHAK WON'T LET UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Ponchak looked like a beaten man. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior pitcher had been touched -- no, slammed -- for six runs in the 
sixth inning. Fountain Valley's lead had dwindled to 8-6 against Esperanza 
Tuesday in the Southern Section Division I baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak looked physically whipped as well. He had been tagged in the face on a 
play at the plate in the top of the seventh, resulting in a bloody nose. It 
took several minutes, and a cut man, to get him ready to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, Coach Ron LaRuffa was a tad concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris was filthy and bleeding," LaRuffa said. "I mean, he was a real mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Would you trust your baseball team's future to a wobbly pitcher who looked as 
if he'd been through 12 rounds in an under-card bout? 
</P>
<P>
 LaRuffa didn't even hesitate. Neither did Ponchak. He set the Aztecs down, 
1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no doubts," LaRuffa said. "That's a situation Chris thrives on. There 
was something on the line. I had complete confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Few high school teams have relied on a relief pitcher more than Fountain 
Valley. Few have had one like Ponchak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Dog" -- as his teammates refer to him -- has made team after team yelp 
with his nasty fastball and fierce personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak is 7-2 with a 1.88 earned-run average heading into today's 
quarterfinal game at Simi Valley. He has pitched in 18 games this season -- 14 
in relief -- and only failed to deliver once. He has won three games and saved 
four since becoming the Barons' closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other team will have men on base and I start to feel my blood pumping," 
Ponchak said. "I get in and shut them down and the momentum shifts. You can 
feel it. I love that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said outfielder Geoff Wilson: "Big Dog comes in and we all get excited. He 
takes us to a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why LaRuffa made Ponchak the closer in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak, who spent half the season on the varsity as a sophomore, was the 
Barons' No. 2 starter when this season began. He had not won a game on the 
varsity level, but then neither had any of the other pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 With such an inexperienced staff, LaRuffa was looking for the right person to 
use when things got dicey. He didn't have to look far. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak had been a reliever for the Barons during the summer, helping the team 
win the Colt League World Series. He saved the West Regional championship game 
and picked up the victory in relief in the World Series semifinal.  
</P>
<P>
 So he had experience at the job. He also had the right attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris is one of the best competitors I've ever coached," LaRuffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in the Sunset League knows how competitive the 6-foot-2, 
210-pound Ponchak can be. Those who don't haven't seen him play. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak is not one to go quietly about his business. He'll make a pitch, then 
walk toward home plate to get the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a couple times when I made it all the way to the plate before 
I got the ball," Ponchak said. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be be a little unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris knows that," Wilson said. "He knows it's intimidating for a batter to 
see this big guy walking toward him. Chris talks about it." 
</P>
<P>
 To everyone, sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak was brought in against Ocean View with runners on first and third and 
two outs. He threw a strike, then made his customary stomp toward the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy tried to stare me down, so I said, 'OK, here it comes again,' " 
Ponchak said. "I threw a curveball on the corner for Strike 2. He was still 
staring at me. I threw a fastball and he couldn't touch it. Boy, that was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, while Ponchak has a forceful presence on the mound, he was putty in 
LaRuffa's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak won his first four starts and then was asked to become a reliever. 
Tony Liuzzi's development as a pitcher made the change possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But LaRuffa still had to break it to Ponchak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach asked how I felt about being a reliever," Ponchak said. "I told him 
yes, if it was best for the team." 
</P>
<P>
 And it has been. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak, who is also the team's designated hitter, allowed only two runs in 
his last six appearances during the regular season. The Barons won all six 
games to wrap up their second consecutive league title. They entered the 
playoffs as the No. 1-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris was the difference between us being a good team and a great one," 
LaRuffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ponchak was omitted from the all-league team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we used him probably cost him some personal awards," LaRuffa said. "I 
even apologized to him last week. He said he had no complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 What is there to complain about? Ponchak was the winner in the Barons' 
first-round game against Montebello Schurr. He pitched three innings in 14-1 
victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He came back Tuesday and was racked by Esperanza. Ponchak gave up four hits, 
two of which were doubles, hit two batters and walked another in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he had a what-me-worry attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "He finally got the third out and by the time we got back to the dugout he was 
fired up," Wilson said. "I knew he was going to go right back out there and end 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 With Ponchak, there are never any doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mental thing," Ponchak said. "I wasn't going to let our season end. 
I just said, 'Give me the ball.' "

DIVISION I BOYS' TENNIS; BAXI'S SMASH REDUCES STRESS AND DANA HILLS WINS EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After freshman Brandon Fallon's third consecutive singles victory, Dana Hills 
was one point short of advancing to the Division I boys' tennis finals for the 
first time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they led all but one of the remaining matches, the Dolphins remained 
a point away from clinching for the next 15 minutes. But just as the tension 
began to mount and nerves began to fray, Dana Hills junior Mike Baxi ended the 
match with one resounding overhead smash. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Dana Hills' players began dancing around their home courts and Coach 
John Stephens let out a huge sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the pressure dissipated, Dana Hills went on to take three of the last 
four sets to beat Palos Verdes Peninsula, 13 2/3-7 1/3, Thursday at Dana Hills 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-seeded Dolphins (22-0) will travel to Santa Barbara on Wednesday to 
play the top-seeded Dons (24-0), who defeated Beverly Hills, 16 2/3-4 1/3, in 
the other semifinal. Since Santa Barbara has had more road playoff matches than 
Dana Hills, the match will be played at an alternate site in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxi and his partner, Hanley Ernst, had been trailing their match against 
Jimmy Kim and Dean Ho, 4-2, before coming back to win the next four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets me going knowing the match may depend on us," Baxi said. "It shoots 
adrenaline all through my body and points start falling." 
</P>
<P>
 But the points weren't falling for Baxi or his teammates early and Dana Hills 
led, 3 2/3-3 1/3, after one round. Baxi and Ernst lost their first set, 6-4, as 
did the Dolphins No. 1 team of Carlos Betancourt and Justin Rimel, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you right now and I think I speak for all of us, we came out 
nervous," Baxi said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dana Hills settled down to take five of six sets in the second and build a 
9-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That second round nailed us," Peninsula Coach Tom Cox said. "We just stunk 
the joint up. They're a good team. They came out of nowhere. Their doubles are 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dana Hills' singles were also tough -- winning seven of nine sets. Brian 
Navarro, at No. 2, was especially tough and unexpectedly won two of three sets.

DIVISION I SOFTBALL; FOOTHILL UPSETS LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There isn't a senior among them, and their coach is convinced half his players 
don't realize they aren't supposed to be this good, but Foothill already has 
accomplished what few thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the worst draw in Division I, the Knights are one victory away from the 
Southern Section softball championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Built for speed, they won Thursday with power, beating second-seeded Los 
Alamitos at its own game, 7-4, at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing most of the jolt for Foothill was sophomore Tara Lawrence. Lawrence 
hit two two-run triples in what she called the best game of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last three games, I didn't get on base," she said. "Because I was (the 
designated hitter), I knew I had to get on base before they put someone else in 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 No chance of that happening now. Her drive over the right fielder's head in 
the first inning gave Foothill a 3-0 lead, and her triple into right-center 
field finished the job, making it 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence batted .175 during the regular season with only two RBIs and 10 
strikeouts in 40 at-bats. Yet, she hit losing pitcher Debbie Wilson (15-2) as 
if it was batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while, she's capable of driving the ball," Foothill Coach Joe 
Gonzalez said. "We have her in there (batting sixth) hoping she'll get hold of 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she got hold of two, and the Knights needed both. Los Alamitos scored 
twice in the seventh. Los Alamitos (23-5) reached last year's title game and 
was favored to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
 In consecutive games, Foothill (24-6) has beaten Huntington Beach, Kennedy and 
Los Alamitos, which had pitchers with combined records of 40-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence's first triple was preceded by Robin Tessman's triple and Amie 
Barnes' RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson settled down until the fifth inning, when Foothill scored four runs. A 
single, bunt, stolen base, single and fielder's choice scored two runs as 
Michelle Churnock upended catcher Carolyn Wilson. Tessman scored from second 
when the ball went to the backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division I games: 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica 2, Newbury Park 0 -- Pinch-runner Melissa Bunim scored on a wild 
pitch and Amy Smith had an RBI single in a two-run sixth inning as 
fourth-seeded Pacifica (21-5-1) advanced to play Marina in the semifinals 
Tuesday. Toni Mascarenas (15-4) pitched a three-hitter and Pacifica turned in a 
strong defensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park (21-8) had its only scoring opportunity in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 1, Santa Barbara San Marcos 0 -- Marcy Crouch pitched a two-hitter with 
11 strikeouts and Becky Thompson, Stacy Byers and Kelly Flowers each had two 
hits for visiting Marina (24-2), the top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc 2, Fountain Valley 1 (8 innings) -- Lompoc (22-5) tied the game in the 
seventh on a home run and, with runners at second and third, scored the winning 
run on a double play that ended the eighth. Fountain Valley (17-9-1) stranded a 
runner at second in the bottom of the inning.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION II TENNIS; SUNNY HILLS DOMINATES RIVERSIDE POLY IN 
SEMIFINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "You remember Sunny Hills?" No. 1 doubles player Kris Mueller of Riverside 
Poly asked an alumni during Thursday's Southern Section Division II boys' 
tennis semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're still as good as ever," Mueller said as he watched his team lose 17 
2/3-3 2/3 to the division's top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending champion Lancers dominated from the start, leading, 6-1, at the 
end of the first round. By the end of the second Sunny Hills led, 11 2/3-2 1/3. 
</P>
<P>
 Two come-from-behind victories by Sunny Hills (21-1) in first-round doubles 
stunned Riverside Poly (21-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' Joseph Gilbert and Joey Springer, playing at No. 2, took Brett 
Masi and Scott Merryman to a 6-6 tie. Down 1-6 in the tie-breaker, Gilbert and 
Springer scored seven consecutive points to take the set, 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
 David Farkas and Jeff Hartl came back from a 4-5 deficit, breaking serve at 
5-5 and defeating Mark Vanta and Paul Vargas, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first round took a lot out of them," Sunny Hills Coach Steve White said. 
"It took the pressure off us and put it all on them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers again lost only one set in round two, when Farkas and Hartl fell 
to Mueller and Jack Williams, 6-4. Gilbert and Springer went on to sweep their 
sets, 6-2, 7-6, 6-1, and No. 1 doubles team Kevin Kim and Hiren Bhavsar had no 
problems, losing only two games, 6-0, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to win doubles, you always have had to," White said. "Before we 
could develop our doubles, now we have to put our best players in so we can 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 White has moved Kim, his top singles player and No. 1 in the nation in the 
16-year-old division, to doubles and Gilbert, who won the Ojai Tournament 16s 
title also is playing doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers now face Palm Desert, which defeated Redlands, 11-10. The final is 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care who we play. Redlands, Palm Desert and Poly are all about the 
same," White said. "Actually, I think Poly is more consistent in keeping the 
ball in play than the other two."

PREP NOTES: COMPETITORS AT MASTERS TRACK MEET TAKE AIM AT STATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County distance standouts Carrie Garritson of Buena Park and Jaime 
Martinez of Orange will attempt to move another step closer to State titles 
tonight at the Masters Meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Field events begin with the boys' discus at 5:30 p.m. Running events start at 
7.The top five in each event qualify for next weekend's State meet at the same 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Garritson, who will attend Alabama in the fall, won the 3,200-meter race at 
the Arcadia Invitational in April in one of fastest times in the nation this 
season (10 minutes 39.33 seconds). She recently won the Freeway League and 
Southern Section Division II titles in the same event. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, the section's Division II champion in the 3,200, also qualified to 
compete in the 1,600 at the Masters. But Orange Coach Lanny Carter said 
Martinez would skip the 1,600 today so he can concentrate on the 3,200. 
Capistrano Valley's Adalberto Sanchez and Katella's Mike Moreno will join 
Martinez in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other county athletes competing today are Woodbridge's Gary Young 
(100 and 200 meters), Esperanza's Courtney Pugmire (800 and 1,600) and Kristy 
Kierulff (high jump), Newport Harbor's Wade Tift (shot put) and Gina Heads 
(shot put and discus) and Foothill's Tara Oettinger (400 and long jump). MATT

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; BELOVSKY OVERCOMES INJURY TO TAKE 
CYPRESS TO PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last year, Cypress' Josh Belovsky has overcome a career-threatening 
back problem, transferred and worked his way out of the bullpen into the 
starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky is one of three starters to win at least 10 games this season for 
Cypress, which plays Lassen in the opening round of the State tournament 
Saturday at Cerritos College.  
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky (10-1) is joined in the rotation by Aaron France (12-3) and Ron 
Hendren (10-3). All three are sophomore right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky, from Orange High School, started his college career at Orange Coast 
in 1992. He had 3-1 record as a freshman, including a victory over Cypress in 
an early-season tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to OCC last season but experienced soreness on the right side of 
his back early in the season. After a few games, the discomfort increased and 
one day, after an especially sharp pain, he noticed a small lump had formed on 
his back. 
</P>
<P>
 A trip to the doctor revealed a tumor that required surgery. The tumor was 
benign, but Belovsky couldn't pitch again last season. He was given a medical 
redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The only lasting effect from the tumor is a scar, about three inches long, 
that Belovsky is proud to show off with little prompting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never doubted that I would come back," Belovsky said. "That's just how I 
am. I'm an easy-going guy off the field but when I get out there I'm very 
competitive. I don't like to lose -- at anything." 
</P>
<P>
 During rehabilitation, he decided to leave Orange Coast for Cypress, in hopes 
of getting a new start. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent last fall and winter trying to prove himself to a new coaching staff 
and teammates. He started the season as the fourth starter and worked in relief 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky, who throws a fastball, split-finger fastball, change-up and 
curveball, moved into the starting rotation when Rob Crabtree injured his arm 
in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just really stepped it up this season," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. 
"We knew he was going to pitch a lot for us but this has been amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons Belovsky has had such a strong season is the time he and 
his teammates spent lifting weights and running in the fall. The extra work has 
made him stronger in the final weeks of the season when pitchers have a 
tendency to tire more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky and France have become the aces of the staff. Belovsky has been most 
impressive in big games this season. He has three shutouts, including beating 
Rancho Santiago, 4-0, and, 1-0, to keep Cypress in first place. He has given up 
62 hits, recorded 77 strikeouts in 84 innings and has an earned-run average of 
2.14. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense is one of the big reasons I've done so well," Belovsky said. 
"Pickler has beat it into the ground, saying it over and over again, but it's 
true. I know I can leave one hanging and someone still might make a great play. 
When a guy gets on, the first thing I think about is the defense turning a 
double play."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PITCHER GASPAR COULD BE NO. 1 PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels are tentatively planning to select right-handed pitcher Cade Gaspar 
of Pepperdine on Thursday with their first pick in the June free-agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar, who was 6-1 with a 2.30 earned-run average, attended Capistrano Valley 
High School. He was previously drafted by the Houston Astros and New York 
Yankees but rejected both offers. He's expected to command about a $700,000 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also have shown interest in Katella High's Jaret Wright, son of 
former Angel pitcher Clyde Wright, but they favor Gaspar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel catcher Jorge Fabregas sits behind the plate each day, looks up at 
hitters and sometimes has difficulty restraining himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at guys like Cecil Fielder and Mickey Tettleton," Fabregas said, "and 
just say, 'Wow.' I mean, I'm not going to get their autographs right there, but 
I do want to get them before the season ends. I really look forward to these 
road trips just to see these places. When I saw (Tiger Manager) Sparky Anderson 
the other day, I was trying to get close to him just to see him. It's like this 
is still a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas' dream is turning into reality for the rest of the league. Fabregas, 
who has emerged as the Angels' everyday catcher, is serving notice he will be 
around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two or three years from now," Anderson said, "you're going to see one of the 
premier catchers. He's just a kid. He reminds me of a young (Mike) Scioscia." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fabregas: "Wow, you talk about a compliment. You're talking about a guy 
who managed the Big Red Machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas, who was called up when Greg Myers was placed on the disabled list 
April 24, has been so impressive the Angels have decided to keep him when Myers 
returns next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, who's on a medical rehabilitative assignment with Class-A Lake 
Elsinore, has resumed playing after being bothered by a stiff neck. He's 
expected to rejoin the team next week when the Angels return home. They are 
expected to option catcher Chris Turner to triple-A Vancouver to make room for 
him. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BOXING IN IRVINE; LOPEZ GOES DOWN THREE TIMES, LOSES TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Junior lightweight Ben Lopez was expecting Hector Monjardin to stick and move 
the way he did in their fight two months ago at the Olympic Auditorium. Lopez 
was a little off in his prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 Monjardin did a lot of sticking, very little moving and a lot hitting. The 
hitting stopped 1 minute 2 seconds into Round 1 when referee Larry Rozadilla 
mercifully stopped the fight after three knockdowns and gave Lopez's California 
junior lightweight championship to Monjardin on Thursday night at the Irvine 
Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to do what he was trying to do," said Lopez, who lives in 
Upland. "My game plan was to come out quickly. We were both wailing. He got me 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 Monjardin (14-5-1 with six knockouts) got Lopez (20-14-1) with a left-right 
combination. The right caught Lopez flush and sent him down. Lopez slowly got 
up, but he never regained his balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, Lopez was falling down and stumbling into the ropes after 
getting hit with a flurry of blows. Rozadilla let Lopez continue, but Monjardin 
pounced on Lopez quickly and sent him toward the ropes. Finally, Rozadilla 
waved his arms and stopped the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think I looked that bad," Lopez said. "But I guess it would 
look different from outside the ring." 
</P>
<P>
 It looked pretty good to Monjardin, who had said he would end the bout within 
five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought it would be this easy," Monjardin said through an 
interpreter. "I expected a real tough fight because of the last one." 
</P>
<P>
 Monjardin, who lives in Carson, won the last one, a non-title fight, but it 
took him 10 rounds to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the undercard, Costa Mesa welterweight Jaime Valdez (6-3-2) fought to a 
four-round draw with Tony West (6-7-1). Light heavyweight Asludein Umarov of 
Russia knocked out Sergio Guerrero at 2:22 of the first round with a vicious 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero reached his feet, but referee Raul Caiz would not allow him to 
continue. Umarov, who lives in Cerritos, has won all four of his fights by 
knockout.

GREAT EXPECTATIONS; FULLERTON'S POWELL HAS HAD DISAPPOINTING SEASON, BUT MAJOR 
LEAGUE SCOUTS ARE STILL INTERESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Speed is the silver spoon of sports. Some are born with it. Others spend their 
entire athletic careers wishing they had been. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, it rockets you safely to first on an infield roller down the 
line, and carries you to second on a steal with a pop-up slide. Finally, you 
glide home on a base hit that knifes up the middle. But you come home standing 
up, not skidding on your stomach with a face full of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Powell has that gift, along with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel blessed to have the speed and the baseball instincts I have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major league scouts have talked about that natural athletic ability since he 
was playing at Long Beach Millikan High School. He was a supplemental selection 
by Toronto between the first and second rounds in the 1991 draft, but he turned 
down a $425,000 contract to play at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 That talk continued unabated when he moved on to the Titans and hit .307 as a 
freshman and .335 as a sophomore. Honors of all kinds piled up, and he played 
for Team USA last summer in the World Games. Everything pointed to even bigger 
things this season. There was the preseason All-American recognition and, with 
it, even higher expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a burden to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has their own expectations for him," Titan Coach Augie Garrido said. 
"The news media, pro scouts, fans, teammates, you name it. And those 
expectations can all be distractions for him. He's intelligent, sensitive and 
aware, and when he feels he's letting other people down, it bothers him." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, however, that his performance this season has not been what 
Powell and his most supportive fans had hoped it would be. And when the Big 
West Conference all-star team was announced this week, Powell was not chosen to 
either the first or second teams. His name on the honorable mention list, where 
you would least expect to find the name of a player long regarded as a 
first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fullerton begins play today in the NCAA Midwest I regional, Powell is 
hitting .289 with 48 runs batted in, a good total for a leadoff hitter. He also 
has eight home runs in 54 games. He has stolen 40 bases in 47 attempts. That's 
a solid performance . . . if you are someone other than Dante Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are the numbers, and Powell wishes they were better. "I came into 
this season with high expectations for myself, as well," he said. "I was hoping 
to hit in the high threes. I started out hot and finished the season just 
so-so. But I've been trying to just focus on playing baseball and having some 
fun doing it. I think that's what I need to do right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido has been telling him most of the season to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He deserves to be able to go out and play baseball and have fun at it like 
any other player his age," Garrido said. "Everyone has known all along that he 
has all the physical tools, and that's been the burden to him. They've compared 
him to people like Barry Bonds and Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he hasn't done this season is dominate college baseball with his batting 
average, but he has done a lot of other things. I think he's improved 
considerably in the three years he's been with us. He's more mature. He throws 
better, and he makes better decisions. And I think that development process 
will continue. He's also helped the team all season with his leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell says moving from third to the leadoff spot in the batting order has 
been an adjustment. "It's a different mentality when you're batting first," 
Powell said. "When you're hitting third, you're in a position to drive in runs, 
but when you're batting first, you're trying to get on base to set up some 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido believed Powell clearly was "the best person on the team to bat 
leadoff" this season. Garrido moved second baseman Jeff Ferguson into the third 
slot and Ferguson has responded with a .388 average. He recently was chosen Big 
West co-player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fine with me," Powell said. "I felt I was doing it for the team and I 
haven't had any problems with it. The coaches experimented with it in fall 
practice and they liked it. Jeff has been doing a tremendous job driving in 
runs in the third. If I had to sacrifice a little to make the team stronger, 
then that's all right. I think the scouts all know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The pro scouts will be heard from when the the major league draft begins June 
2. Despite a season that has been below par for Powell, scouts still appear to 
admire those star qualities that radiate in his play. He is 6 feet 2, 185 
pounds, a right-handed hitter, and he has been timed from the batter's box to 
first base in 4.1 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The question remains, however, about what the impact of this season will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem for anyone with Dante's ability is that if you don't reach the 
expectations, it doesn't seem like what you've done is enough," Angel scout 
Rick Ingalls said. "But he's had a very good career there and he's a big part 
of that team. I feel he'll probably still go somewhere in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts also say simple numbers don't always tell the full story on a player 
when it comes to evaluating his major league potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look at what a player may be capable of, as well as what he does 
in any one season," Yankee scout Bill Schmidt said. "His athletic ability is 
what is so attractive about Dante. I've been watching him play since high 
school. You have to think he's one of the best pure athletes out there, 
although I do feel he's going to have to hit the ball better than he did this 
season to be successful in professional baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido compares Powell's skills favorably with several of his former players 
who are playing pro baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim Wallach, for example, had all the tools for the position he plays and 
Dante is the same," he said. "It's just a different position, one that requires 
a lot more running speed, and he has that." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell says he's not worried about the approaching draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go wherever I go," he said with a smile. "But that's just the start. A 
position in the draft is not going to make or break you. It's still what you do 
later on the field that will count. I've heard that some scouts have said they 
think I've lost some enthusiasm for the game, but that's not true at all. When 
I hear that, I get frustrated and upset, and I have to fight that off." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell says he definitely plans to sign after this season. "I guess the only 
way I wouldn't would be if I was drafted in the 10th or 11th round or something 
like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Powell is eager to start his "second season" in the NCAA playoffs. He 
hopes it will produce more spectacular results for him, but he says he's more 
concerned with team goals of advancing to the College World Series and then 
winning it. 
</P>
<P>
 How Powell does in the playoffs could be a key factor for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a fresh start for him," Garrido said. "The team will respond to 
his actions because they know what his potential is, too."

JACKSON PUTS ON A SHOW; BASEBALL: HOMER IN FIFTH INNING LEAVES THEM TALKING, 
LEADS ANGELS TO 7-5 VICTORY OVER TIGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The baseball game was dragging into the late afternoon. The fans were bored. 
The players were bored. Even the concessionaires lost interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's game, which had 17 walks and 324 pitches, needed something to spice 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
 It needed . . . Bo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson, who has a way of enlivening games simply by stepping to the plate, 
rescued his team and rejuvenated the 15,858 weary fans as the Angels beat the 
Detroit Tigers, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, helping to give Joe Magrane (1-2) his first victory of the season, 
drove in a season-high five runs that included an opposite-field home run into 
the upper deck at Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets pretty boring when you go through phases like we did today, with all 
of those walks," Jackson said. "Somebody has to do something to wake everybody 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel first baseman Jim Edmonds: "Man, every time he plays, you just 
stand there and hope you see something spectacular. I was standing in the 
on-deck circle just watching. It was almost like I wanted to see an instant 
replay before I went to the plate myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish I could have seen him in his prime, when every day he did 
something spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson arrived at Tiger Stadium expecting to sit on the bench. This was 
supposed to be the day that left-handed hitter Dwight Smith started in left 
field, particularly with the Tigers starting right-handed pitcher Mike Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, while virtually every player relishes the idea of hitting in Tiger 
Stadium, the place has been an albatross to Jackson during his seven-year 
career. He began the series with a .183 batting average in the ballpark, with 
only five homers and 11 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's absolutely mind-boggling to me," Jackson said. "This place is a 
hitter's paradise, but I'd never done a thing here." 
</P>
<P>
 That all changed in three days, during which he was four for nine, with two 
homers and six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken seven years for me to finally get the hang of this place," Jackson 
said. "Now I can't wait to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who started Thursday because of his .400 lifetime batting average 
against Moore, began the game quietly with a sacrifice fly in the first inning 
and a strikeout in the third. The Angels were trailing, 3-2, when he stepped to 
the plate in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one out, with Chili Davis on first base, when Jackson fouled off a 
3-and-1 pitch. He slapped his bat in disgust. It was a pitch he believed he 
should have hit 500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 He settled back in and sent the next pitch halfway into the right-field upper 
deck. It was hit so hard that the ball skipped up the aisle and bounced off the 
back wall, drawing cheers from the partisan crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable," Angel second baseman Rex Hudler said. "That's something 
I can't wait to tell my kids about some day." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann: "There's dynamite in that bat. I've got 
some pretty vivid memories of his strength, and he hasn't damaged any by seeing 
him up close." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson also hit a two-out, two-run single in the sixth inning, and mainly as 
a result of his efforts, Magrane finally got a victory. It wasn't pretty, 
Magrane conceded, but considering that it was his first since returning from 
arthroscopic elbow surgery, he wasn't about to be picky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," said Magrane, who yielded eight hits, four walks and five 
earned runs in 5 1/3 innings, "starting pitchers are judged on wins and losses. 
All the other stuff is scrapbook material." 
</P>
<P>
 While Magrane believes that playing for Lachemann, a former pitching coach, 
can be beneficial to everyone on the staff, certainly no one seems to have 
benefited more than reliever Joe Grahe, who saved his eighth game with a 
scoreless ninth inning. Lachemann appointed Grahe bullpen closer his first day 
on the job, and Grahe has responded by saving four consecutive games for the 
first time since July 24-31, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what (Lachemann) can do to a pitcher's psyche," said Grahe, who 
was successful in 21 of 24 save opportunities in 1992 while Lachemann was the 
Angel pitching coach. "He's a guy I feel very, very comfortable with, and my 
confidence is high right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of the time there's going to be a tomorrow. They say it's 
the guys who can come back after (blown saves) that end up hanging around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be one of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important, Grahe said, he's finally physically sound. He missed a 
month of last season because of rotator-cuff tendinitis, and his arm didn't 
fully recover until two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't lobbing the ball in drills this spring because I thought I was 
big-time," Grahe said, "but it's because I had to lob it. I was worried all 
spring that my arm wouldn't bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I finally feel good again. The confidence is there. The arm is there. 
</P>
<P>

INDIANAPOLIS 500; PART-TIME HOOSIER; IT MUST BE MAY, BECAUSE FITTIPALDI IS IN 
HIS INDIANA MODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Emerson Fittipaldi is a 47-year-old Brazilian millionaire who lives in Key 
Biscayne, Fla., except in May when he becomes a citizen of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For four weeks, I bring my family here, we rent a house and I live like a 
businessman," the defending Indianapolis 500 champion said. "For sure, I love 
coming here each year. There is so much tradition. Each year, the first time I 
walk through Gasoline Alley I get such a good feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about it the other day, and next year I will have spent an 
entire year of my life in Indianapolis." One month at a time for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmo, as everyone calls the former two-time Formula One champion, credits his 
home environment for much of his success here, including his victories in 1989 
and last year -- two of the most competitive 500s at the Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 500s, he has finished in the top five four times, placing second in 1988 
and third in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be starting on the front row for the third time in 11 races Sunday 
after his qualifying speed of 227.303 m.p.h. in a Mercedes-Benz-powered Penske 
was bettered only by pole-sitter and teammate Al Unser Jr. and fellow Brazilian 
Raul Boesel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mentally, Indianapolis is the toughest track because it is the same four 
corners, the same garage, the same people, the same routine for a month," 
Fittipaldi said. "Being mentally prepared is the key to the Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little home cooking and being with my family helps me to relax and recharge 
my batteries. That way, when I come back the next day I am mentally and 
physically ready. It is easy to get worn out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's 500 miles should come easy for him. Since arriving on May 8, 
Fittipaldi has logged 2,052 miles -- more than four complete races -- while 
testing the reliability of the new Mercedes-Benz pushrod engine, designed 
specifically for the Indy 500 by Ilmor Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else is even close in number of laps here this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mercedes is fantastic ," he said, using one of his favorite words. "We 
knew it would have the horsepower, but (car owner) Roger (Penske) wanted to 
make sure of its reliability. He wanted us to wring it out. Junior (Unser Jr.) 
did 500 miles in racing conditions at Michigan before we came here, but we 
wanted to put as many miles on it as we could right here. 
</P>
<P>
 "For sure, we are very pleased. It is not as easy as people say. Ilmor has 
given us the horsepower, but it is no good if you can't get it around the 
corners. That has been what we work on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is different to drive. It has a different torque, a different acceleration 
than the regular Ilmor engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a very fast 500 miles, very competitive, very little passing. The 
cars are so close (in qualifying speeds) that passing will be possible mostly 
on restarts or in traffic. It will be like last year, when 10 cars were still 
on the same lap at the finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi started ninth last year, and although he passed Nigel Mansell and 
Paul Tracy at the start to move into seventh, he lost a lap to the leaders 
during a flurry of yellow flags. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a cold shower when I found myself a lap down," he explained. "I 
had worked so hard getting up to third, and I was right on (Mario Andretti's) 
gearbox dicing for second place when I got caught in the wrong place when the 
yellow came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I lost the lap, it put me in traffic trying to pass slower cars, and I 
wasn't used to that problem. The guys in front of me were running smoothly, but 
they were about 7 m.p.h. slower than I could potentially run on my own. It was 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I got a break of my own when Paul (Tracy) had his accident and I got my 
lap back on his yellow. I was still back of cars, but I felt better because I 
knew I was in a good position to race with them." 
</P>
<P>
 After 400 miles, the race turned on three yellow-flag restarts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Lap 179, Fittipaldi was between Andretti, the leader, and Mansell. On the 
restart, Mansell swept past both into the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard Nigel complaining that he didn't have experience to know what to do 
on restarts," Fittipaldi said, "but he bloody well did a good job on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw Mario back off a little when Nigel passed him, I decided to try 
and pass Mario in the short chute. We were side by side through the second 
turn. His front wheel was inside the wheelbase of my car. I do not know today 
what kept us from contact. It was fantastic at that speed." 
</P>
<P>
 With 17 laps remaining, another yellow flag presented Fittipaldi with an 
opportunity to get the lead for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'It's now or never,' and I concentrated on getting a good 
jump on the restart," he said. "When I passed Nigel before Turn 1, I had clear 
sailing for the first time all day." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven laps from the finish, still another yellow flag slowed the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger (Penske) called me on the radio, but I said, 'Please don't talk to me 
now,' " Fittipaldi said. "I was concentrating so hard. I could not miss a gear. 
I knew Nigel was right behind me, hoping to make the same pass he'd made 
earlier, and Arie (Luyendyk) was right behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi used an old trick to prevent being passed. After accelerating close 
behind the pace car, leaving what looked like a nice opportunity for Mansell to 
accelerate, Fittipaldi suddenly braked hard, narrowing the gap. Mansell and 
Luyendyk had to slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted all the momentum going into the first turn," Fittipaldi said. "Once 
I had braked and caused them some confusion, I accelerated as hard as I could 
to prevent them from drafting on me. The car was spot-on, and two laps from the 
finish I ran the quickest lap of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fantastic. The team did a beautiful job all month. The car ran great, 
the pit stops were right on. It was just a fantastic day. 
</P>
<P>
 "For sure, it took the best race of my life to win. It was like a bonus, 
winning at this late stage of my career. I felt I was driving better than when 
I was 25 because I worked so hard on my physical condition and my diet." 
</P>
<P>
 He was 25 when he won his first Formula One championship in 1972 with the 
Lotus team. His second title came in 1974 with the Marlboro McLaren team, 
beginning a relationship with Marlboro that continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years is a fantastic , long relationship with one sponsor," he said. 
"I don't think many people in professional sports have that kind of 
relationship with a sponsor." 
</P>
<P>
 Going into Sunday's 500, fourth race of the PPG Cup season, Fittipaldi is tied 
with teammate Al Unser Jr. for first place with 37 points. Fittipaldi won the 
Slick 50 200 in Phoenix and was second to Michael Andretti in the season opener 
at Surfers Paradise, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 In 154 Indy car starts over 11 years, Fittipaldi has 21 victories. During an 
11-year period in Formula One, he had 144 starts and 14 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Europe and in South America, I am still referred to as a Formula One 
driver who is driving in the United States, but that is total BS," he said. "I 
am an Indy car driver, and I am very proud of that. I love the United States, 
and I am very honored to be able to live here, to be accepted here." 
</P>
<P>
 What is often overlooked in evaluating his career is that he was retired for 
nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very happy in Brazil, living a normal life and running my businesses, 
when some friends suggested I drive some Super Karts, really powerful go-karts, 
around Sao Paulo just for fun," Fittipaldi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I had retired, I said I would never drive a race car again in 
qualifying, practice or a race. I didn't consider the karts as real racing, but 
I found out it was, and I found that I was enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought perhaps I might do four or five sports car races a year, like 
LeMans. After I drove in the Miami Grand Prix (sanctioned by the International 
Motor Sports Assn.) in 1984, Jose Romero asked me if I would drive his car at 
Indianapolis. I surprised myself by accepting, and my second career took off." 
</P>
<P>
 Not without embarrassment, however. It wasn't that Fittipaldi was not 
competitive. It was that Romero's car was pink, and to carry out the color 
scheme, Fittipaldi wore an all-pink driving suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we have to remember that?" he said, laughing at the thought. "Without 
that, though, I might not have joined Pat Patrick." 
</P>
<P>
 It was with Patrick in 1985 that he won his first Indy car race, the Michigan 
500. Since then, he has never had a season without at least one victory. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain such a pace, Fittipaldi is a fanatic on physical fitness and diet. 
</P>
<P>
 "My priority is to drive a fast race car," he said. "To do that, you must 
commit yourself 100% to the job. That means everything I do is toward racing. 
Most of my day is concerned with maintaining my fitness." 
</P>
<P>
 In the off-season, and between races, he works out three times a day after an 
hour of karate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do some of my hardest work at (what would be) race time, when it is hot in 
Florida," he said. "That way, I get used to the heat -- it can get very hot in 
a cockpit -- and get my body acclimated to working at that time of the day. 
Driving an Indy car is very taxing." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has his own nutritionist, who prescribes a rigid diet. 
</P>
<P>
 For breakfast on race day last year, Fittipaldi had a bowl of granola with 
rice milk, and some fruit. Shortly before the race, he drank a spot of pickled 
plum tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked last year, (so) I will have the same Sunday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi brought orange juice into the Indy tradition last year when he 
quaffed a bottle of it before taking the traditional swig of milk. It cost him 
a $5,000 bonus from the American Dairy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't bother Fittipaldi, who owns a 750,000-tree orange grove in Brazil.

MATADORS SWEEP UP FOR WAC; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: NORTHRIDGE ANSWERS CONFERENCE CALL 
WITH 5-3 VICTORY OVER MISSOURI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In what turned out to be a wacky kind of day in first-round games of the 
Women's College World Series, Cal State Northridge's softball team pulled off 
the Western Athletic Conference hat trick with a 5-3 victory over Missouri on 
Thursday night before 2,644 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (50-8), playing in the fourth and final game of the day, was the 
third WAC team to win a first-round game. It is the first time one conference 
registered three first-round victories in the NCAA national championship 
tournament, which began competition in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to win the first game and excited the WAC won all three of its 
games," Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson said. "I think we're here to make a 
statement and that's us showing the strength of our softball." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State, Utah and Northridge were all in contention for the WAC title 
going into the final week of conference play. Northridge (21-3 in WAC) took the 
title over Utah (22-4) based on percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah and Northridge, which split a conference doubleheader and had another 
rained out this season, play tonight at 6:30 PDT in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a reversal of fortune for Northridge, which lost to Southwestern 
Louisiana in the first round of its inaugural appearance in the World Series 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the third-ranked Matadors committed three errors and had one hit in the 
first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Northridge broke out the bats in the fourth inning, parlaying five 
singles and an error into a four-run inning. Scia Maumausolo's bases-loaded 
single up the middle drove in Jen Fleming for the Matadors' first run. Jennifer 
Parker and Kelly Hunt also contributed runs-scoring singles and Shannon Jones 
hit a sacrifice fly. Jones broke Beth Calcante's school record with her 52nd 
run batted in this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tigers (40-22) were not about to pack it in. They scored three runs on 
three hits in the final three innings and kept Northridge on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Windmiller (25-2), who pitched a no-hitter against Missouri in a game 
earlier this season, allowed four hits and struck out 11, but blamed herself 
for the team's letdown in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take responsibility for that because I came out there throwing hard and my 
balls were working and then in the last few innings my (rise) ball started to 
flatten out a little bit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Vicky Rios misplayed two grounders in the fifth inning, both of 
which contributed to the runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't real happy with the way we played the last three innings," Torgeson 
said. "I thought we went to sleep, we weren't getting a jump on the fly balls. 
I thought Vicky sat back on some balls that she usually routinely plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're gonna continue through (the bracket) with 8:30 CDT games -- we got 
another one tomorrow -- we can't start yawning at 10 o'clock and expect (to 
win)." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge added a run in the fifth when Tamara Ivie (two for two) doubled 
down the right-field line to drive in Calcante from first. It was the 30th 
double of Ivie's career, tying a school record held by Calcante. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to play to the best of our abilities and we might not have done that 
tonight," Ivie said. "But we can play a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 With Northridge clinging to a 5-2 lead and its defense looking suspect, 
Missouri's Gina Anderson led off the seventh with a single. Mary Babb drove a 
1-and-2 pitch deep into the left-center field gap to drive in Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller however, retired the next two batters on three-pitch strikeouts and 
enticed Karen Persinger into a pop fly to right to end it. "We didn't work out 
under the lights," Torgeson said. "Maybe that's an excuse. But we won and we 
won ugly. I'll take an ugly win any day in this thing."

MIKE DOWNEY: HE'S SEEN GOPHER BALLS, BUT THIS WAS RIDICULOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I often write about animals. I write about fast horses. I write about rodeo 
bulls and sled dogs. I write about rams, bears, razorbacks, bruins, penguins, 
tigers, lions and mighty ducks. I have written about a chicken from San Diego, 
about a St. Bernard from Cincinnati and about what a football coach in 
Mississippi had done to an unlucky steer.  
</P>
<P>
 But this, this is a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Dodger-Cub baseball contest Wednesday night at Dodger Stadium, the game 
was interrupted on account of possum.  
</P>
<P>
 Fourth inning, tough situation. Onto the diamond something runs. It is moving 
quickly, so it can't be a turtle. It is really hustling, so it can't be a Cub. 
It is really funny-looking, so it could be a sportswriter.  
</P>
<P>
 The TV cameras zoom in on it. Four-legged creature, pointy ears, pointy tail. 
Is it a mouse? No. A chihuahua? No. Is it the illegitimate offspring of the 
Phillie Phanatic? No.  
</P>
<P>
 I am mystified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Possum," someone says. 
</P>
<P>
 I dig the wax from my ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Possum?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone nonchalantly says, "Sure." Like, you know, you see possums in the 
National League West every day. 
</P>
<P>
 I am mortified. 
</P>
<P>
 Last time I saw a creature this ugly in a ballpark, Dave Kingman had sent 
somebody in the press box a live rat. Man, that was the ugliest creature I had 
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the rat. Kingman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this Possum Night?" I inquire. "Did the Dodgers pass out possums to the 
first 50,000 paying customers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think so, someone says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't Vince Coleman once throw a possum into some Dodger fans?" I suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Could be, someone says. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder what the Dodgers should do. What do you do about a pesky possum 
problem? Call Orkin? Call Terminix? Buy that really, really, really large can 
of Raid? 
</P>
<P>
 A man begins chasing the possum across the outfield grass. He is wearing a 
Dodger blue jacket. Perhaps he is the team's new director of possum personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 No, someone says. Look, it's Kevin Gross, fine Dodger pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin is crossing the field, in hot possum pursuit. He is lugging what appears 
to be an egg crate. It must be a container used to hold baseballs during 
batting practice. Either that or it is Tom Lasorda's takeout tray from lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah ah, Kevin intends to imprison the possum. The crate is his trap. He will 
drop it atop the possum, like Elmer Fudd tying a string to a box while out 
hunting rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher gets his possum. Gross lowers the boom. To warm applause, he then 
returns to the dugout, leaving the helpless animal in baseball-crate jail. 
</P>
<P>
 A clubhouse attendant comes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone says: "Did you notice that the rich pitcher does the hunting, then 
lets the poor clubhouse guy dispose of the hide?" 
</P>
<P>
 I say: "Twenty-three other possums will probably run out of the other dugout 
now and start a brawl." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. 
</P>
<P>
 The possum isn't helpless after all. 
</P>
<P>
 He tunnels out from under, like Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson. It is the 
greatest escape I have ever seen at a Dodger game, with the possible exception 
of Bob Welch striking out Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 My mind races. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did he come from? Does Chavez Ravine have a large possum population? Did 
it sneak through the dugout or come down the aisle? If it came down the aisle, 
why didn't an usher ask to look at its ticket stub? Whenever I sneak down 
there, some usher demands to see mine. 
</P>
<P>
 The possum makes for the gap in left center. The clubhouse guy is right behind 
him, toting the crate. The jumbo scoreboard is capturing every bit of the 
action. It is funny, funny stuff, funnier even than Kal Daniels circling under 
a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, he gives himself up. The old possum suicide squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross is back in the dugout, demanding to renegotiate his contract. He wants a 
$25,000 bonus for being an All-Star, $50,000 for winning the Cy Young Award and 
$100,000 if he traps the Triple Crown, a possum, a skunk and a gopher. 
</P>
<P>
 The possum is taken into the bullpen, which is probably better than taking a 
bull into a possum pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda says later he may use it again in pinch-running situations. 
</P>
<P>
 I say a possum isn't too expensive to keep, doesn't eat much, doesn't do much, 
knows how to play dead. Which means it will probably end up in San Diego.

MIKE PENNER: HOME IS STILL SWEET FOR KNOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chuck Knox was strolling down the aisle, minding his own business, savoring 
the grocery market experience, where life is simpler and more reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, you want a can of peas, you buy a can of peas, you bring it home, you 
keep it in the cupboard for as long as you want. The can of peas doesn't 
suddenly jump out of the cart, screaming, 'No! I can't go! I'm staying in 
Houston!" 
</P>
<P>
 Knox was enjoying himself when a couple approached him, saying, "You look 
familiar. Aren't you Chuck Knox?" 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Knox fessed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the couple and Knox were reminiscing about Isiah Robertson and Lawrence 
McCutcheon, the good old days, before the conversation turned inevitably to the 
depressing present day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team isn't moving, isn't it?" the couple asked Knox. "Please, you can't 
go. We've been Ram fans for years. You've got to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 What could Knox do? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not his call. The head coach of the Rams is as helpless in this one as 
any other Orange County supermarket shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told them," Knox says, " 'I hope we stay, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Georgia Frontiere and John Shaw vs. the Apathetic and Fickle 
People of Southern California, Knox testifies on behalf of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go anywhere, with my wife or whatever, and they come up to me and say, 'We 
really hope you stay,' " Knox says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very positive. They're just very nice about everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox believes Ram fans are "good fans. I think they support us. I think 
they're like everybody else: You go out there and win and there's more support, 
there's more pride. The team becomes something they can talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were here before (in the 1970s), we were winning and we put a lot of 
people in the Coliseum. We had 90,000 for a regular-season game against 
Minnesota. It was really something to go in there, and the fans were just 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes an event -- tailgating in the parking lot and all that. It's a 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ram fans were different then, right? Isn't that the party line? That the 
hard-core constituency dissolved once the team moved to Anaheim and was further 
depleted by the arrival of the Raiders in 1982. That the Southland is far too 
big for two NFL teams. That if the Rams don't move, the Raiders will, or vice 
versa, or maybe both, because they contend that they can't make it here -- and 
if they can't make it here, they're amenable to offers from anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you see yourself working for a newspaper in a town this size with no pro 
football?" Knox asks. "It would be very difficult for me to picture that. 
There's a lot of tradition here, (dating back to) the Rams coming out here to 
the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be be difficult for a lot of people to understand how this 
market area -- one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in the country -- could 
lose two pro football teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox disputes the notion that the Rams and the Raiders can no longer 
co-habitate within a 40-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, this area has supported two teams. I would say that," Knox contends. 
"You've got the population. You've got the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to winning. If we get the program turned around, if we win, the 
people will be into it." 
</P>
<P>
 And they call Chuck Knox a raving conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 The team must win before the fans will follow. What a concept. This is radical 
stuff, coming from the mouth of a 62-year-old football coach whose team's owner 
and executive vice president have pleaded victimization and financial hardship 
thrust upon them by the paying customers of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, who has seen them both, claims to see little difference between the Rams 
fans of the 1970s and the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Same species, different environment, in his estimation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this," Knox says. "When I go through there now before a game and talk 
to them, they seem the same. The difference is that when we were winning five 
straight divisional titles, we were winning . Naturally, people are going to be 
more enthused about winning. Right now, we're just trying to get the program 
turned around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew when we came here (in 1992), this was not going to be a quick fix, 
not something you're going to turn overnight. They'd lost 10 in a row the year 
before we got here and won three games and won five the year before that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I could see some people were excited at times last year. You take both 
end zones. When we're winning and making some plays, they get pretty vocal. 
They respond to some plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you got to do. You got to make some plays out there. Win some 
games. Get people excited. Get pride back in what we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the goal for 1994. Is it too little too late? 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't hurt," Knox says. "It can't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 But is it realistic? What do the Rams of '94 have to offer that the inferior 
'93, '92, '91 and '90 editions couldn't? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I think we'll be better defensively," Knox says. "We added (defensive 
tackle) Jimmie Jones, who should take some of the pressure off Sean Gilbert and 
give him a chance to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the secondary, our corner play should be improved. The safeties, we've got 
some players who can go to the football. We need to get more turnovers, more 
interceptions. At one point last year, we had 10 interceptions as a team and 
Eugene Robinson of Seattle had nine all by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis will be back. Jim Everett will not. These have to be two more 
pluses, although Knox refrains from heaping too much praise on new quarterback 
Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, if I reflect on that, then some people take it as a dig at Jim Everett," 
Knox says. "All I would say is that Miller threw the ball very, very well in 
the work we've been doing this spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox still wants to sign one more veteran wide receiver, and will probably 
have to go outside Texas to do it. Dallas dangled Alvin Harper, then made him 
disappear. Houston's Haywood Jeffires actually agreed to a contract, had two 
Ram coaches fly down to close the deal, then got cold feet and sent the coaches 
back to Anaheim empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox isn't saying who he's pursuing now -- Indianapolis' Jessie Hester, 
perhaps? -- because "then, if we don't get him . . . see what I'm saying? I'd 
rather say it after we get him signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to be a jilted suitor. You chase and chase and chase and all of a 
sudden, it's, 'I thought you were going to the prom with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ram fans, much to their dismay, are beginning to relate.

WORLD CUP '94 / 21 DAYS AND COUNTING; MOVING UP; AFRICAN TEAMS GAINING 
RECOGNITION; NIGERIA STRONGEST OF THREE ENTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixty years have passed since Abdel Rahman Fawzi of Egypt wrote his name into 
the history of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in Italy in 1934, when Egypt became the first African country to take 
part in the tournament. It was a brief appearance, a 4-2 loss to Hungary at 
Naples that sent the Egyptians home right away. But not before Fawzi had scored 
two goals to become the first African to score in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Six decades later, another African is considered a good bet to win the scoring 
title in World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Few American fans may have heard of Rachidi Yekini, but if Nigeria lives up to 
its potential in this tournament, Yekini will quickly become just as well known 
as Cameroon's Roger Milla in Italia '90. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first World Cup in which three African countries will be 
participating, 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon's excellent performance in Italy four years ago having earned the 
continent a third berth. The three nations that qualified are Nigeria, Cameroon 
and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, Nigeria is clearly the one with "most likely to succeed" stamped 
on its passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon is in chaos, its preparations for the World Cup thrown into confusion 
by a lack of funds and constant political interference. Morocco doesn't have 
much of a team and is expected to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nigeria, that's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've proven we're a good side with great individual players," the team's 
winger, Victor Ikpeba, said after Nigeria had won the African Nations Cup in 
Tunisia in April. "There is so much talent we could form two different sides 
and still be the best in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens Westerhof, Nigeria's oft-embattled Dutch coach of the past five years, 
is somewhat more restrained in his enthusiasm. "My only aim is to produce 
results that will surpass Cameroon at the last World Cup finals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That in itself will be no small feat. After upsetting defending world champion 
Argentina in Milan in the opening match of the Italia '90 tournament, Cameroon 
went all the way to the quarterfinals. Only an unlucky 3-2 overtime loss to 
England at Naples prevented it from reaching the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon's showing was the best ever by an African country in the World Cup, 
and its open and attacking style earned favorable reviews in a tournament that 
was almost devoid of adventurous play. 
</P>
<P>
 No player typified this fun-loving spirit better than Milla, who at 38 showed 
he could still dance through defenses with ease. His hip-swinging post-goal 
celebratory dances with the corner flag drew smiles from one end of Italy to 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Milla, Africa's player of the year in 1976 and 1990, is 42 now but still 
dreams of being included in Cameroon's World Cup team for 1994. Henri Michel, 
the country's French coach, is noncommittal, recognizing Milla's popularity 
with the fans and especially President Paul Biya, but also knowing that age has 
caught up with the player known as "the Old Lion." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Yekini, Milla's heir apparent as Africa's World Cup star, is exactly 
a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 At 30, Yekini is closer to the end of his playing career than the beginning. 
But his credentials as a striker are impressive. His eight goals in World Cup 
qualifying play for Nigeria made him the top goal-scorer in Africa's qualifying 
tournament. He scored another five in Tunisia to win the goal-scoring title at 
the African Nations Cup, the continental championships. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is just as prolific with his club team. Although playing for 
unfashionable Victoria Setubal, he leads the Portuguese League in scoring with 
21 goals so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It's small wonder that Nigeria's Super Eagles believe they will fly high this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot more than national pride at stake, however. Cameroon earned 
Africa a third World Cup berth. Nigeria has the possibility of earning it a 
fourth or even fifth spot in the quadrennial world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that FIFA, world soccer's governing body, has decided to expand the 
tournament to 32 teams in 1998, there is competition to see just how the six 
continental confederations divide those extra eight places. 
</P>
<P>
 The Europeans have offered a plan that gives Africa, Asia, CONCACAF (the North 
and Central American and Caribbean region) and South America each one 
additional place while reserving the other four places for the continents that 
provide the four semifinalists in this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially, all four could go to Europe, which has not escaped the notice of 
the Africans and Asians. Both continental groups would like two extra places 
rather than one. 
</P>
<P>
 Much will depend, therefore, on how well Nigeria, Cameroon and Morocco do on 
Africa's behalf this summer and on how well South Korea and Saudi Arabia fare 
in the cause of Asia. Morocco and Saudi Arabia are in the same group, adding a 
little spice. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon is grouped with tournament favorite Brazil, Sweden and Russia. Russia 
-- then the Soviet Union -- defeated Cameroon, 4-0, in the World Cup four years 
ago and is unlikely to be any easier to deal with this time around. Milla or no 
Milla, Cameroon has a tough task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 So does Morocco. Besides the Saudis, the Moroccans must play the Netherlands 
and Belgium in the first round. The best hope for Coach Abdallah Blinda's team 
is a third place, which probably will require defeating Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Nigeria carrying Africa's banner. The Super Eagles have a 
potentially less-intimidating opening round. They play, in order, Bulgaria, 
Argentina and Greece. Bulgaria has yet to win a World Cup match in 16 attempts, 
Argentina's defense is a shambles and the Greeks bear gifts of three points for 
each of their World Cup opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the Nigerians have a chance to do more than just well. They 
could win the group. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which leaves Issa Hayatou with somewhat mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayatou, 47, is president of the Confederation Africaine de Football (CAF), 
soccer's governing body on the continent. He is also a member of the FIFA 
executive committee and is regarded as being in line for the FIFA presidency 
one day. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also from Cameroon, which leaves him hoping that Nigeria succeeds, but 
not at Cameroon's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 During Hayatou's tenure with CAF, African teams have done increasingly well in 
international competition. In addition to Cameroon's quarterfinal appearance in 
the World Cup in 1990, Ghana won the Under-17 World Championship in Italy in 
1991 (Nigeria had won in 1985 and finished second in 1987) and finished second 
in the Under-20 World Championship in Australia in 1993. Ghana also won the 
bronze medal in the 1992 Olympic Games at Barcelona, the best Olympic 
performance by an African team. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the first All-African final in a world championship tournament, Nigeria 
defeated Ghana in the 1993 Under-17 World Championship in Japan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Africa's youth teams are among the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hayatou, the sport in Africa is "in evolution," and with the 
exception of a few national federations, the level of play is rising throughout 
the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a confederation, we are second only to Europe," Hayatou said, adding that 
of CAF's 52 member nations, "there are at least 20 countries that play at a 
very good level -- higher than teams from Asia, Oceania and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as South America is concerned, there are only two countries, Argentina 
and Brazil, that are strong. The others are at the same level as those in 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayatou said there are more than 500 Africans playing professionally in 
Europe, including such world-class stars as Ghana's Nii Lamptey in the 
Netherlands and Anthony Yeboah in Germany; Liberia's George Weah in France and 
Yekini in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 "African football is progressing and improving, and we're going forward to 
seriously challenge Europe," he said. "The problem in Africa is that we don't 
have enough financial means and material and sports infrastructure, and 
therefore we are handicapped. If those conditions were achieved, we could have 
a very worthwhile role in the worldwide soccer family." 
</P>
<P>
 The return of South Africa to the CAF and FIFA fold probably has hastened the 
day when Africa plays host to a World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 For the immediate future, however, all attention is on 1994 and the hope that 
before the World Cup goes into Africa, a World Cup winner can come out of 
Africa. Africa's History World Cup

MULES RULE AT THIS FESTIVAL; FOUR-DAY EVENT AT BISHOP INCLUDES PARADE, RODEOS, 
RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are festivals for art and music, wine and roses, that lift the spirit 
and enhance the culture of mankind. Then there is the Mule Days celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 25th year, this Eastern Sierra town of 10,000 is glorifying the beast 
of burden. There will be four days of rodeos, races, barbecues, mule-packing 
contests, dances and all-round carrying-on featuring more than 500 mules from 
most of the Western states, plus Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade Saturday will proceed for 1 hour 45 minutes without a car or truck, 
making it the world's longest nonmechanized parade, according to Bishop 
officials. All entries will be pulled by mules or, as an alternate source of 
locomotion, horses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mule Days celebration was born of desperation. Even with the fish biting 
in nearby streams, Bishop's motel occupancy over the Memorial Day weekend used 
to be about 30%. So, the citizens looked around to see what their other assets 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 pack outfitters, who take groups into the Eastern Sierra from Bishop 
and its environs, came up with the idea of celebrating the mule. One of the 
packers, Bob Tanner, said: "We probably have more mules than any other place in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner and the other packers initiated and ran Mule Days until it became too 
big, and Bishop's Chamber of Commerce gradually took over. For this weekend's 
silver anniversary, Tanner will receive a founders' Hall of Fame award. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the organizers incorporated, with Marlyn Briggs as general 
manager, and now run the event independently of the chamber. The underlying 
philosophy remains the same: Mules don't get enough respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken out everything that would make the mules look stupid," Tanner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few dignitaries have come to Bishop to honor mules. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was governor of California, Ronald Reagan rode a mule with a silver 
saddle. That time, the parade was delayed 1 1/2 hours because Reagan was unable 
to fly out of Los Angeles until the fog lifted. A liquor store on Main Street 
sold 45 cases of beer during the wait.

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; ANDRETTI IS A WINNER -- IN PRACTICE

 Mario Andretti closed out the prerace routine of his last Indy 500 Thursday by 
running the fastest lap on Carburetion Day. Andretti reached 223.708 m.p.h. 
during an 18-lap shakedown of his Lola-Ford Cosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 All 33 starters in Sunday's 78th annual race appeared briefly for final 
shakedown tests. No cars will be allowed on the track until the start of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, car owner Kenny Bernstein put team driver Scott Goodyear into the 
car qualified by Davy Jones. The planned move was delayed until the end of 
Carburetion Day, in case another car was damaged beyond repair. If that had 
happened, Goodyear would have been the first alternate and both Bernstein cars 
would have been in the race. There were no incidents during the two-hour test. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of Bernstein getting both cars in the race was a longshot. Only 
three times in 77 races has an alternate started the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1929, Billy Landau started in place of Phil Pardee, who had wrecked his car 
during practice the day before the race. In 1984, Chris Kniefel started in 
place of Jacques Villeneuve, who withdrew after suffering a head injury in 
practice. In 1986, Dick Simon started in place of Dennis Firestone, who had 
demolished his qualified car on Carburetion Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve is the uncle of the Jacques Villeneuve, who is in Sunday's race.

AT LEAN 130, HUNGER IS DE LA HOYA'S MOTIVATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya, whose hearty appetite for glory and food has been only 
marginally quenched by a minor title and weeks of discipline to whittle himself 
down to 130 pounds, looks at tonight's opponent, Italian import Giorgio 
Campanella, with undisguised relish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a hungry fighter -- I've worked very, very hard to get down to 130," De 
La Hoya said. "So I think of Campanella as a plate of fettuccine. And I love 
fettuccine." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first Las Vegas headline performance, De La Hoya tops a pay-per-view 
card at the MGM Grand that also features the first title defenses of Roy Jones 
Jr., International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, who has grumbled 
about his place as a headliner being usurped by De La Hoya, and Rafael Ruelas, 
IBF lightweight champion, who is supposed to fight De La Hoya sometime in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 This is De La Hoya's last fight at the 130-pound junior-lightweight limit and 
the only defense of his World Boxing Organization 130-pound title. His next 
fight is expected to be on July 29 against Jorge Paez for the vacated WBO 
135-pound title. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya (12-0, 11 knockouts) said he is eager to face a fighter with 
Campanella's straight-ahead, brawling style. Campanella (20-0, 13 knockouts) 
has never fought outside Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm looking forward to is eating," said De La Hoya, who will earn 
$500,000 for the bout. "Eating after the weigh-in. I'm hungry. Very, very 
hungry. It's going to be a good fight, but I want to get it over with because 
of the weight." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ruelas, who won his title by coming back for a dramatic decision over 
Freddie Pendleton at the Forum in February, the bout against Mike Evgen of St. 
Paul tonight is a major change of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leading up to my title fight, I knew who I had to beat; I was the young 
challenger, (Pendleton) was a world champion," said Ruelas (40-1, 31 KOs). 
"Now, it's like the roles have been reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas, who will be paid $200,000, spent most of his training time preparing 
for Carl Griffith, whose reported substance-abuse problems forced a change in 
opponents to Evgen (25-2, 12 KOs). 
</P>
<P>
 Jones (25-0, 22 KOs) has what he acknowledges is a major chip on his shoulder. 
He was the showcased fighter last August in Bay St. Louis, Miss., when De La 
Hoya was on the undercard. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, will make about $750,000 tonight in his first title defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here with an attitude," said Jones, who is fighting IBF No. 1 
contender Thomas Tate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I have an attitude is I'm 25-0, an Olympic champion, what else do 
I need? And still I have not seen my face on the cover of a major boxing 
magazine or headline a card in Las Vegas? Why? I want to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate (29-2, 21 KOs) is the younger brother of former middleweight champion 
Frank Tate and has dedicated this fight to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bout on the televised card is 19-year-old flyweight Danny Romero 
(16-0, 14 KOs) against Hugo Torres (24-4-2, 12 KOs).

hitters coming up and sometimes has difficulty restraining himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at guys like Cecil Fielder and Mickey Tettleton," Fabregas said, "and 
just say 'Wow.' I mean, I'm not going to get their autographs right there, but 
I do want to get them before the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really look forward to these road trips just to see these places. When I 
saw (Tiger Manager) Sparky Anderson the other day, I was trying to get close to 
him just to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like this is still a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 His dream is becoming reality. Fabregas, who has emerged as the Angels' No. 1 
catcher, is serving notice that he will be around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two or three years from now," Anderson said, "you're going to see one of the 
premier catchers. He's just a kid. He reminds me of a young (Mike) Scioscia." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas said: "Wow, you talk about a compliment. You're talking about a guy 
who managed the Big Red Machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas, who was called up when Greg Myers was put on the disabled list April 
24, has been so impressive during his stint that the Angels have already 
privately decided to keep him when Myers returns next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I get to stay around," said Fabregas, who's batting .289, "because 
I've got to start getting some of these autographs." 
</P>

 The Angels are tentatively planning to select right-handed pitcher Cade Gaspar 
of Pepperdine Thursday with their first pick in the June free-agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar, who was 6-1 with a 2.30 earned-run average, attended Capistrano Valley 
High in Mission Viejo. He was previously drafted by the Houston Astros and New 
York Yankees but rejected both offers. He's expected to get a $700,000 signing 
bonus. The Angels also have shown interest in Jaret Wright of Katella High, the 
son of former Angel pitcher Clyde Wright, but favor Gaspar. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 A judge refused to drop Detroit outfielder Eric Davis from a lawsuit filed 
against him and Kansas City outfielder Vince Coleman by victims of the incident 
at Dodger Stadium last July in which Coleman, then with the New York Mets, 
threw an explosive device into a crowd. Davis, then with the Dodgers, was 
driving the vehicle in which Coleman was riding.Superior Court Judge Stephen 
Lachs did not dismiss allegations that Davis had disregard for the safety of 
others and that he intended harm. "Our system is such that we ask you to sue 
somebody and then find out what happened," the judge said in refusing to 
dismiss the allegations. Davis' attorney, Kevin Stack, said his client did not 
intend harm.

GOLF IS FINE, BUT THIS JOB FITS TO A TEE; HIGH SCHOOLS: FORMER LOARA COACH HERB 
HILL COMES OUT OF RETIREMENT TO BECOME FOOTBALL COACH AT SAN JACINTO HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Man cannot live on golf alone, so when San Jacinto High School officials 
offered Herb Hill the head football coaching job this week, Hill's instincts 
steered him back to his natural habitat -- the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement and the world of fairways, sand traps and putting greens no longer 
seemed to suit Hill, who spent 28 years as Loara's coach before stepping down 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoyed being a member of the Soboba Springs Country Club in San Jacinto, 
playing golf four days a week for the last four years, but when his handicap 
improved about as much as his career coaching record, Hill figured it was time 
to move on to something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Something familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out with golf that more doesn't necessarily mean better," said Hill, 
63, who moved to San Jacinto with his wife, Karyn, in 1990. "If you're a 
hacker, you're a hacker -- it doesn't matter how many times you do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the only things I've had success in is coaching, and I haven't broken 
par yet, so why not do something you're successful at?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who guided Loara to 10 league championships and Southern Section titles 
in 1968 and 1979, had been itching for years to return to coaching in some 
capacity. He offered his services to the previous two San Jacinto coaches, Jeff 
Snyder and John Norman, but both declined. 
</P>
<P>
 When Norman, a walk-on coach, quit in January after going 1-19 in two seasons, 
Hill didn't immediately pursue the position. The school had recommended Don 
Doshier, San Jacinto's basketball coach, to take over the football program in 
late March and even announced the move to area newspapers, but the San Jacinto 
School Board voted not to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Doshier, 53, has since filed a $1-million age discrimination suit against the 
district, claiming it breached an oral contract and alleging that a board 
member said trustees wanted someone younger for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, April and much of May passed, and still San Jacinto, a Skyline 
League school with 800 students, had no football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a call from a friend in the district who asked if I could recommend 
someone for the job," said Hill, whose Orange County record of 191 victories 
was eclipsed by Santa Ana's Dick Hill in 1991. "I said no, because by now, 
everyone is pretty much nailed down. He called the next day and said, 'What 
about you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who has 38 years of coaching experience, met with school officials, took 
a tour of San Jacinto's new, $1.8-million on-campus stadium, took note of the 
90 players in the Tigers' program and then took aim at the job. 
</P>
<P>
 He went through the interview process, was offered the coaching job -- along 
with the responsibility of teaching two physical education classes a day -- and 
accepted. The move, which San Jacinto Principal Dawn Mitchell said was not a 
response to the age-discrimination suit, was approved by the school board 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like he's reborn," Karyn Hill said Wednesday, the day after Herb 
took the job. "He's really enthusiastic. He sees this as an opportunity to 
match the team with this wonderful new facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really beaten down at the end of his stint at Loara, but he was so 
excited about this he couldn't sleep last night. That enthusiasm, I know, will 
translate to the kids and the faculty." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill announced his retirement from Loara in 1989, he said, "I've been to 
the starting post too many times." The stress of competing in the highly 
competitive Empire League and the time demands of teaching a full load of 
courses had taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've had four years to rest up," Hill said. "Cutting down my teaching 
load and getting back to something I enjoy looked like a good opportunity. I 
think I have the energy for this." 
</P>
<P>
 He's going to need it. San Jacinto, which won four league championships during 
the 1980s, has not had a winning season since 1987 and suffered through a 
28-game losing streak from 1991-93. The Tigers' only victory last season came 
over a West Valley team that had only 17 players. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hill, who played at Santa Ana College and Occidental, started the Rancho 
Alamitos (1956) and Loara (1962) programs from scratch, so he knows about the 
construction process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never really stepped into a program that was down and needed rebuilding, 
but I've been in ground-floor-up situations," Hill said. "I'm not going to get 
real fancy in a hurry. I'll emphasize execution, doing a few things with some 
consistency, and playing good, solid defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who plans to institute a year-round weight-training and conditioning 
program at the school, has no intention of holding the job for more than three 
or four years. He'd like to stay long enough to train one of the young coaches 
on staff and have that coach prepared to take over in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is fine with the folks at San Jacinto. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's well-organized, very thorough, very enthusiastic, and he's a master of 
all aspects of the game," Mitchell said. "He can help the boys believe in 
themselves, and he can help the coaches understand how all the parts (of the 
team) become a whole program. He's a legend, and we're happy to have him." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching will surely cut into Hill's tee times, and Hill won't be able to 
putter around the yard and garden as much, a hobby he developed when he moved 
to San Jacinto and installed a new yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the joys Hill discovered in landscaping -- cultivating a bare piece of 
land into something beautiful -- were very similar to the joys of coaching -- 
working with youngsters, molding and motivating them into productive young 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 And those things ultimately lured Hill out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can clear a piece of ground, put some nice plants and ground cover in, 
and when you're finished, it looks great," Hill said. "That's instant 
gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you work with kids all your life you plant seeds, but they don't grow 
real rapidly. It's years sometimes before you see how they turn out, but 
there's great satisfaction in that, too."

COMMENTARY; NOT .400; .400 THE YANKEE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Far from the noise of Madison Square Garden this spring, way uptown from there 
at Yankee Stadium, has been the crack of Paul O'Neill's bat. He does not hear 
the cheers right now that Patrick Ewing hears, or Charles Oakley. Those cheers 
will come. The Yankees are at the top of the standings, and O'Neill has a 
batting average at the top of the world. Uptown from the Garden, on the 
Stadium's great baseball stage, Paul O'Neill sets the stage for summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wants to talk to O'Neill about his chance to hit .400 for the season, 
because after Wednesday night's game against Toronto, he is hitting .472. He 
does not want to talk about that because what is there to say with 119 games to 
go? The real news from O'Neill, the real noise, is the crack of the bat, almost 
every day. When he talks, it is about things that matter. Mostly he talks about 
winning a World Series for the Yankees, because O'Neill is one of the players 
in the room who knows how. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not only the batting average that makes O'Neill the quiet star of the 
New York spring. It is not only O'Neill's sweet swing. He has been a Yankee for 
205 games, but there has been a quiet, old-Yankee grace about him from the 
start. O'Neill showed up from the Cincinnati Reds knowing how Yankees used to 
behave, and do again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been intrigued with the history of the game," O'Neill says. "And 
just in that sense, Yankee Stadium is the only place to be. There are a lot of 
special ballparks in this game, at least the ones that aren't gone. I have a 
picture of myself when I was 4 or 5 years old that my dad took at Crosley 
Field. He always wanted me to appreciate history. So I appreciate Fenway Park, 
and I appreciate Wrigley Field. But you have to start here. I think about it 
every night, walking down the runway from the clubhouse to the dugout. I 
appreciate it every night." 
</P>
<P>
 He is sitting in front of his locker at 4:30 p.m., relaxed, relieved that he 
does not have to talk about his batting average. Before the season gets to 
June, O'Neill already feels talked out about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love coming here every day for the games," O'Neill says. "This is a place 
and a uniform you don't take for granted. And it's a manager and a group of 
players you don't take for granted, either. I look forward to coming to the 
ballpark because of them, too. There's a fraternity here, and you feel it as 
soon as you walk in the door." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're doing all right once you get outside the door," he is told. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good place to hit," O'Neill says, then talks about how he can't try to 
hit home runs, because the only way for a left-handed hitter to get a cheap 
home run there is to hook one down the right-field line, and that is not his 
style; he is better hitting the ball in the alleys. And he talks about the 
wonderful black background in center field, known as "the black" at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks very big out there," O'Neill says. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the big baseball place. O'Neill has filled it up with base hits in April 
and May. The batting average won't come down, and the reporters won't stay 
away. He is 1994's .400 boy, as John Olerud of the Toronto Blue Jays was last 
year. O'Neill doesn't want to talk about it. He wants the swing to tell the 
story, another ball hit hard somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Showalter, his manager, says: "It's not just that he isn't comfortable 
talking about himself. If he thinks that all the attention on him detracts in 
any way from his teammates, he doesn't want to have any part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill makes everyone else in the Yankee batting order better. That is how it 
goes when someone hits the ball this way. The pitcher knows O'Neill is waiting 
for him, fifth spot in the order. It changes innings and sometimes games. "It's 
not just the guys hitting before or after Paul that get help when he's going 
like this," Don Mattingly says. "It's eight or nine guys." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill says: "Everybody wants me to talk about myself, and I keep explaining 
that if the team wins, we all had a good year. And if we don't win, then it 
doesn't matter who had a good year." This was Tuesday afternoon, before he got 
one hit in three at-bats against the Blue Jays and actually saw his batting 
average drop a few points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to know if I'm going to hit this, or hit that," O'Neill says. 
"And I don't look at things that way. I feel like when I go out there tonight, 
I'm zero for zero. It doesn't matter what I did yesterday. The way I've been 
hitting doesn't mean anything to Dave Stewart (the Toronto starter Tuesday 
night). He doesn't care what I hit in April or May. We both start even. At 7:05 
tonight, I start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 But he is the best hitter on the best team right now. He is at the best 
ballpark, one made for big things. It is that kind of stage. O'Neill can be a 
free agent after this season and he is going to be expensive. Maybe he will be 
a Yankee in 1995 and maybe not. He says that no matter what happens, it matters 
to him that he wore Yankee pinstripes at least once in his life. He has heard 
there is no better place in the world to be a winner than New York. He would 
like to find out for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be out there during a pitching change sometimes and I find myself 
staring," he says. "Or just listening to the crowd. The fans here are amazing. 
Sometimes you get more of a sense of the place just by listening." 
</P>
<P>
 He listens to them. They listen to the crack of his bat. Everyone waits for 
summer.

GILLIES STILL A THRILL FOR SAUGUS; HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL: SOPHOMORE PITCHES 
ONE-HITTER IN 4-0 VICTORY OVER CRESCENTA VALLEY. CENTURIONS EARN A BERTH IN THE 
DIVISION II SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Saugus High softball team entered the Southern Section Division II 
quarterfinals Thursday against Crescenta Valley with the same swagger it had 
after surviving one tight game after another this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Jamie Gillies was pitching, and that would prove to be enough as 
the Centurions knocked off the Falcons, 4-0, to extend their high-wire act into 
the semifinals on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's becoming a familiar refrain for the Centurions (27-2-1) -- even with 
their offense struggling, they have won because of Gillies, who shut out the 
Falcons (22-5) with a one-hit, one-walk performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to blow 'em all down," said Gillies (23-2-1), a sophomore 
right-hander. "If we can score one or two runs, we've got the feeling we can 
hold 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Saugus would have been hitless if not for a three-run barrage 
in the fourth inning that ensured the win. One run would have been enough for 
Gillies to work with, and it was when she blanked Mayfair, 1-0, in the second 
round on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been something I've gotten used to," Gillies said. "Close games are 
going to happen a lot and the team came through with some clutch hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad we're going to the next round." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Saugus Coach Ron Hilton: "That's probably the best she's pitched in quite 
a while. Jamie's going to keep us in a lot of ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions were holding a 1-0 lead until Kelli Kranz tripled to lead off 
the fourth and Chris Gill followed with single that made it 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the power hitters have been struggling," catcher Jeanine Giordano said, 
"but we've got others behind them who have helped us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Next up was Giordano, who doubled to drive in Gill. Jennifer Bittick's doubled 
brought Giordano home to put Saugus ahead, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been hitting as well as we can right now," Giordano said, "but 
right now we're getting so pumped and amped we're starting to hit as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus is steadily approaching its second appearance in the championship game 
in the last three years, a fact that is not lost on Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to stress quite so much this time," he said. "Getting there is 
the work. Being there will be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions got the only run they really needed in the second inning after 
Crescenta Valley's Kim Scott walked Giordano. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano was sacrificed to second and scored when Bittick's drive to center 
was dropped for an error.

VAN BUREN TRIAL EXPECTED AFTER JAMES WAVERS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leodes Van Buren will likely stand trial on a felony weapons charge even 
though his girlfriend -- the key witness in the case -- changed her story 
Thursday and testified that the Newbury Park High football player did not fire 
a shot into her home last month, Van Buren's attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing in Ventura County Superior Court, Marcie James, 
mother of Van Buren's 2-year-old daughter, said she previously implicated Van 
Buren because she was angry at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said (Thursday) that some other guy pulled out the gun and shot the door, 
that it was not Leodes," said John Miller, Van Buren's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren has said the same thing since the day after the April 8 incident in 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Herbert Curtis scheduled an arraignment June 9 in Superior Court, 
based mainly on Van Buren's and James' original testimony that he fired the 
shot. A trial date will be set that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I expected," Miller said. "The prosecutor just has to put forth 
some evidence that a crime was possibly committed and the suspect (Van Buren) 
may have some connection to the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren was arrested last month and subsequently charged with one count of 
shooting into an inhabited dwelling, a felony charge that carries a maximum 
penalty of seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Buren said the day after his arrest that a companion actually pulled 
the trigger, and James corroborated his story. However, she has changed her 
story at least twice since then. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Miller, she testified Thursday that she and Van Buren quarreled 
before Van Buren's companion fired a shot from a handgun into the back door of 
the James' home. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 James testified that Van Buren then told her, "I'm going to take the rap to 
show you how much I love you," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren called a 911 emergency operator and reported that he fired the shot, 
and later told the arresting officer the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 James, Western State Conference softball pitcher of the year at Moorpark 
College, told a detective that day that Van Buren fired the shot. Subsequent 
reversals have been linked to the state of her relationship with Van Buren, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was mad at him because he had gone out with another girl," Miller said. 
"The two times she told the story that it was Leodes Van Buren (who fired the 
shot), she said it was to try and get back at him." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren did not testify at Thursday's hearing.

SCOUT MUST BE WHETHER MAN; HE MUST DETERMINE WHICH WAY WIND IS BLOWING IN DRAFT 
</P>

 They spent months crowding ballfields like second-graders over a jar of flies, 
scrutinizing every move made by the finest college and high school baseball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the major league draft Thursday, scouts are immersed in a less 
visible but no less vital part of their job -- determining each player's 
"signability." 
</P>
<P>
 Will a hotshot high school or junior college player choose pro baseball over a 
college scholarship? Will a college junior sign for a six-figure bonus, or 
return for his senior year? 
</P>
<P>
 Inquiring minds in the front office demand answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to bring out all our guns and fire all the bullets," said Kevin 
Malone, general manager of the Montreal Expos. "We have to know, does a guy 
want to play?" 
</P>
<P>
 A scout does more than lounge in the stands wearing a wide-brim hat and a 
poker face, pointing a radar gun at home plate. The job begins and ends with 
providing information to his employer, but it involves more frustration than 
the typical job that pays about $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 This much Scott Stanley learned last year, his first on the job as the Expos' 
territorial scout in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley, who lives in Canyon Country, was named the Expos' scout of the year 
for his dogged work convincing Brad Fullmer, a power-hitting third baseman from 
Montclair Prep, to take $417,000 and give up a scholarship to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding Fullmer was easy -- every scout in Southern California knew of him. 
More difficult was accurately predicting his signability. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous discussions with the Fullmer family convinced Stanley that Brad would 
sign. Next, Stanley had to persuade the Expos to select him, and he made his 
final pitch 10 minutes before the draft. They picked Fullmer in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stanley's work was far from over: He had to get Fullmer's name on a 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was more time on the phone, playing middle man between the scouting 
director and the Fullmer family," said Stanley, who finally signed Fullmer 
nearly three months after the draft. "I enjoyed it. Being a first-year guy, I 
got a look at what a tough sign is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike college recruiters who must follow strict NCAA regulations regarding 
contact with players, major league scouts are governed by the commissioner's 
office in only one area: They cannot mention specific dollar figures to a 
player or his family before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the rule isn't violated. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Fullmer, teams went in and started talking money, which was illegal, 
putting figures in their minds," Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
 A more ethical approach is to offer the family an honest appraisal of the 
approximate round in which the player will be drafted. Signing bonuses are 
determined primarily by the round in which a player is selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the area of value he will land in," the scout will ask. "Will he sign 
under those circumstances?" 
</P>
<P>
 If the answer is affirmative, the team can draft the player with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many scouts regard this as merely another aspect of information 
gathering, personal contact with families is a sales function as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scouts are competing with college recruiters who clearly represent a 
high-class organization," said Ray Poitevint, the Angels' director of 
international scouting. Poitevint, a near lifelong Valley resident, was a 
territorial scout and scouting director with the Baltimore Orioles and 
Milwaukee Brewers for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many scouts are spitting tobacco or wearing blue jeans," he said. "The 
scout is that family's first impression of a major league organization. You 
have to be at your best to secure the high school boy. You have to sell 
professional baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Convincing a player that pro baseball is right for him must be coupled with 
convincing the front office that the player is right for the organization. 
Therein lies the frustration every scout faces. Sometimes he feels like a minor 
part of a major league operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that a green high school kid has big-league potential is how a 
scout earns his pay, yet he often watches helplessly as his team ignores the 
player on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
 Every team employs national crosscheckers, scouts who compare the players 
touted by territorial scouts. A crosschecker might see the top 100 players in 
the nation, and the top 20 or so are evaluated by the scouting director as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional opinions are provided by the Major League Scouting Bureau, a 
collection of scouts nationwide who reports to the commissioner's office and 
provides evaluations to every team via computer. The bureau administers 
personality tests and videotapes the top 300 prospects, allowing a general 
manager to evaluate players from the comfort of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although funding for the bureau was cut in half last year, it remains a 
valuable tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scouting is all information, and the more information a team has about a 
player, the more intelligent selection can be made," said Don Pries, the 
scouting bureau's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime scout George Genovese, for one, bristles at the idea of so much 
input. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think a fellow should be picked in the first three rounds, you have to 
get three to five opinions," said Genovese, a scout with the San Francisco 
Giants for 34 years who lives in North Hollywood. "It's frustrating, because I 
believe in the old adage: Too many cooks spoil the broth." 
</P>
<P>
 Without crosscheckers or scouting bureau reports, comparing players from 
various parts of the country would be a guessing game. Yet when those 
evaluations differ from that of the territorial scout, resentment often 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy drives 40,000 miles in a year, then gets one pick in the 20th round," 
said a former scout. "That's the big burnout of scouting. They have pride, 
competitiveness, they want to see their players in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they watch players who they recommended move up in other organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone, the Expos' 36-year-old general manager, broke into baseball as a 
territorial scout with the Angels in 1985. He retains a high regard for the 
judgment of scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a crosschecker and a territorial scout differ on a player, I'll often 
trust the guy who has seen the player several times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride notwithstanding, a scout caught up in tallying players drafted from his 
territory can be doing his team a disservice. 
</P>
<P>
 "To develop a championship club, every scout has to be unselfish," Poitevint 
said. "The organization has to come first. You can bring 100 players into the 
farm system, but if they are not qualified, you are developing a 
second-division team. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Baltimore, we'd root for one another. If a territorial scout somewhere 
else said a certain player was gonna help get us to the World Series, we'd say, 
'Well, let's go after him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But radar-gun readings aside, evaluating ability is essentially subjective. 
Most scouts use the same rating system, grading present and future ability on a 
scale of two to eight. A high school player typically will be projected to 
improve more than a college player. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future ability of a college player 21 years old won't be much greater 
than what he is showing today," said Sterling Housely, a Houston Astros' scout 
who lives in Canoga Park. "Top high school players, though, have a high 
ceiling, high projectability." 
</P>
<P>
 In this futures market, a lanky pitcher from Quartz Hill barely old enough to 
drive probably will be paid more to sign than a scout will earn in five to 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Every scout in Southern California knows the lanky pitcher is Roger Worley. 
It's tough to keep a 90 m.p.h. fastball under wraps. However, startlingly 
different views of Worley's major league potential exist. Will he become a gold 
mine or is he fool's gold, the proverbial flash in the pan? 
</P>
<P>
 Some scouts believe he is beginning a tremendous learning curve, that his 
place in a major league rotation is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have serious doubts. One scout says Worley's mechanics invite arm 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Who says what? No scout discusses players on the record, especially this close 
to the draft. If information isn't confidential, what good is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Worley's signability, however, is a certainty. He has indicated that playing 
professional baseball is all he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt every territorial scout in Southern California has filed reports on 
Worley's ability and his signability. They have recommended the round in which 
he should be selected and how much money it will take to get him to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 For the scout whose team drafts him, however, the work is not over. As Stanley 
found with Fullmer, it's ink or sink, the final pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't sign the player, your team wasted the draft pick," Stanley said. 
"This is the player you wanted, and someday you want him to help your team win 
the World Series."

SCOUTS ARE IN SEARCH OF THE PRO AND CON 
</P>

<P>
 You spot him standing down the first base line and take a gulp of air. A major 
league scout is here. At your game. 
</P>
<P>
 You know he came to watch the opposing shortstop. Everybody wants that guy. 
But you know in your heart that you'd make a good professional ballplayer too. 
It's all you've ever wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you make an impression? 
</P>
<P>
 "Play hard, show us that you want to play," said Scott Stanley, a Montreal 
Expos' scout whose territory includes the Valley and Ventura County. "You don't 
see that from many guys. If you play hard, I'll notice you. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of stories of guys who went out with below-average tools, but 
because of their work ethic, they end up taking someone's job." 
</P>
<P>
 The very best players are obvious to every scout. 
</P>
<P>
 But scouts pride themselves in seeing potential in a player no one else 
notices. In last year's draft, a record 1,719 players were chosen. Many were 
players who caught the eye of a single scout. 
</P>
<P>
 So you don't throw 90 m.p.h. or run to first base in four seconds flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the ticket to becoming a middle- or late-round choice: 
</P>
<P>
 * Show at least one skill at close to an average major league level. Either 
throw or run well. Either hit with power or hit all kinds of pitching hard. And 
if you're a pitcher, it doesn't hurt to be tall or left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Demonstrate that your skills will improve. You've got a shot if a scout 
files a report that reads, "below-average present skills but high 
projectability." 
</P>
<P>
 * Remain unemotional during games. Never show displeasure with yourself, 
teammates or an umpire. Professional baseball teams play nearly every day and 
keeping an even temperament is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let scouts know that playing professional baseball is the most important 
goal in your life. You bet, tell them, you'll sign for little more than a 
handshake and an airline ticket. Bus rides and bad burgers you can handle. You 
just want to play ball.

CHELLEVOLD FINDS SLAP HAPPINESS; ARIZONA: FORMER THOUSAND OAKS STANDOUT PURSUES 
NCAA RECORD FOR HITS IN A SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Candrea, coach of defending national champion Arizona, makes a diplomatic 
move when asked point-blank if he believes Amy Chellevold is the best hitter in 
college softball. Chellevold, an Arizona junior from Thousand Oaks High, is 
batting .504 in 228 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Candrea doesn't answer directly, perhaps because he believes Chellevold is 
something more than the best hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Candrea invokes the name of Lisa Fernandez, a former UCLA pitcher who finished 
93-7 with a 0.22 earned-run average and batted .510 last year, best in Division 
I. Fernandez, a four-time All-American, is the Babe Ruth of college softball. 
The best who ever played, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's truly amazing," Candrea said, "when someone gets a hit every two times 
at bat. Lisa Fernandez is at another level. She dominated both offensively and 
on the mound. I'm comparing their work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amy Chellevold is like Lisa Fernandez in that she's got great athletic 
ability and, when she realized how good she could become, she put it all 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Chellevold (5-foot-6) already has shattered the school record of 78 hits in a 
season -- she has 117. In Thursday's 8-0 victory over Illinois-Chicago in the 
first round of the College Softball World Series in Oklahoma City, Chellevold 
was two for three. 
</P>
<P>
 She is six hits short of the NCAA record of 123 set in 1992 by South 
Carolina's Tiff Tootle. Chellevold is also a cinch to break Gail Davenport's 
school record .413 batting average set in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Chellevold's average is better than those of seven of the last 10 NCAA batting 
champions, but she won't win the championship this season. Sara Graziano of 
Coastal Carolina finished at .589. But Sean Straziscar, an NCAA softball 
statistician, points out that only one batting champion (Fernandez) has come 
from the West Coast the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitching's better out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chellevold has played against some of the best competition in the nation. No. 
1-ranked Arizona (60-3) has played 39 of its games against ranked teams. Among 
the pitchers Chellevold has faced are two first-team All-Americans, UCLA's Dee 
Dee Weiman and Southwestern Louisiana's Kyla Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of confidence," Chellevold said. "I had a good feeling early in 
the season and it kept going. A lot of people who get into slumps, it's all in 
their head. But I've stepped up there knowing what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Chellevold, a left-handed slap-and-bunt specialist who can also hit 
for power, has turned the heads of fans and psyched out opposing infielders. 
She batted .319 as a freshman and .379 last season. She was a second-team 
All-American in '93. This year she and five other Arizona players (including 
second baseman Jenny Dalton of Glendale High) were selected to the first team. 
</P>
<P>
 But she came to Tucson with little softball recognition. As a youth, she 
concentrated on volleyball and figured any collegiate All-American awards would 
come in that sport. 
</P>
<P>
 She was named one of the nation's top-50 youth players by Volleyball Monthly 
magazine and was a Junior Olympic All-American who played setter on the U.S. 
Junior National "B" team. 
</P>
<P>
 She played softball in youth leagues and in high school, but the sport was 
secondary. She accepted a volleyball scholarship to UC Santa Barbara but left 
the program after her freshman season because she was dissatisfied with Coach 
Kathy Gregory's style. 
</P>
<P>
 But the following semester, she accepted a scholarship to Arizona and joined a 
former Thousand Oaks teammate, outfielder Jamie Heggen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Candrea had never seen Chellevold, he knew she had the speed to 
bat leadoff. Assistant Larry Ray had spotted her at a high school tournament 
during her senior season, timed her running to first base and had offered her a 
scholarship on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jamie Heggen said, 'Coach, you're going to love this girl,' " Candrea said. 
"I had a lot of confidence in Jamie's recommendation because she knew my 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy's father, Larry Chellevold, was a football player at NCAA Division III 
Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. Her mother, Karen, was ranked 10th in the 
country by the U.S. Tennis Assn. in girls' 16-17-year-old singles. Amy was a 
top scorer for a 12-year-old soccer team that won an American Youth Soccer 
Organization national championship. At Thousand Oaks, she played setter for her 
older sister, Julie, on the volleyball team and was named All-Southern Section 
three times and Marmonte League most valuable player twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've loved sports my whole life, and they've pretty much come naturally," she 
said. "I couldn't imagine my life without them. I can pick up on things pretty 
easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, her family has been stunned by what Chellevold has accomplished 
against the best softball competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined this," Larry Chellevold 
said. "But she's always been focused. She hates to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Chellevold worked intensively on batting technique when she got to Arizona. A 
left-handed thrower who used to bat right-handed, Chellevold was moved to the 
left side of the plate by Candrea and was taught different ways to produce 
infield hits. 
</P>
<P>
 She came of age in the 1992 World Series, where she was four for four against 
Kansas and got three hits against Fernandez in the championship game, won by 
UCLA, 1-0. After a 1993 off-season of training in the weight room, Chellevold 
has added more speed and power to her game. She has nine doubles, four triples, 
four home runs and ranks fourth on the team with 47 runs batted in. She has 
stolen 31 bases in 39 attempts and strikes out only once every 15.2 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Chellevold has taken leadoff hitting at Arizona to a new level, already 
surpassing Vivian Holm, previously the best leadoff hitter Candrea had coached. 
Holm, a tall and swift left-handed hitter, totaled 241 career hits from 
1987-90. Chellevold, with another year of eligibility, has 252. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's remarkable is teams are much better at defending the slap now," 
Candrea said. "But I think Amy has some of the best offensive potential I've 
seen. She's got a lot going for her."

TRACHSEL RIDES CONSISTENCY TO MAJORS; BASEBALL: FORMER TROY HIGH AND LONG BEACH 
STATE RIGHT-HANDER, 23, HAS BEEN A PLEASANT SURPRISE FOR CUBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cub pitcher Steve Trachsel had read about the Billy Goat Tavern curse at 
Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 And he had heard the curses from the outfield bleachers, where everybody with 
a cup of Old Style and an unemployment check had an opinion on the Cubs' 
club-record 12-game home losing streak through April and early May. 
</P>
<P>
 So carrying the burden of ending the streak, Trachsel stepped into the Wrigley 
bullpen May 4 only to have his warm-up rudely interrupted by . . . former Cub 
great Ernie Banks towing a goat? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the geniuses in the Cubs' promotions department decided the best way to 
end a losing streak was to lift the hex put on the team in 1945 by Billy Goat 
Tavern owner Sam Sianis. 
</P>
<P>
 Legend has it that Sianis brought a goat to a World Series game and put the 
hex on Wrigley Field when both were denied entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 So in a pregame ceremony, Banks led the goat around the field to lift the 
curse. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Banks guided the goat and a parade of photographers and writers 
between Trachsel and his catcher. Trachsel was thinking chin music. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind, I just wanted to grab the ball and drill whoever 
walked through there," said Trachsel, a former Troy High and Long Beach State 
standout. "But what can you do? I just went out and pitched my game." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was enough to pick up a 5-2 victory over Cincinnati to end the streak 
and send Banks and the goat packing. Trachsel pitched seven innings, struck out 
two and walked three, and afterward, he ripped one goat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember reading about the hex and all," he said, "but I didn't want it to 
detract from getting mentally prepared. I had heard the hex had been lifted 
three different times, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same thing happened to me at spring training with an elephant (scheduled 
to throw out the first pitch). Who needs that garbage?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three weeks later, Trachsel sat in the visitors' dugout at Dodger 
Stadium and laughed about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't lied about my feelings on it," he said. "I didn't appreciate it. I 
don't mind the goat being on the field, but when they brought it through the 
bullpen when I'm trying to pitch, it (ticked) me off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, the fans and some of the players loved it. But I was there to prepare 
for the game, to do my job. There wouldn't have been a problem if they had gone 
15 feet around the mound and tried not to interrupt me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cub pitching coach Moe Drabowsky said, "That's about the most upset I've seen 
Steve all year." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the thing that impressed me about him was how he refocused and still got 
the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel, a right-hander, has been a pleasant surprise in a roller-coaster Cub 
season that has included the 12-game home losing streak and a winning streak 
that ended at eight games Wednesday night at the hands of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered Wednesday's start against the Dodgers as the only Cubs' starter 
above .500 at 4-3. He leads the team in strikeouts (52 in 62.2 innings) and his 
4.31 earned-run average is nearly a run less than the staff average. 
</P>
<P>
 He ended a three-game Cub losing streak in his first start of the season, 
striking out eight in 7 1/3 innings of a 4-0 victory at Montreal. Afterward, 
Trachsel wanted to call his wife, Marilyn, to tell her about his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I didn't even know our new number yet," he said. "I had to call my 
parents out here and get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he pitched only the 11th complete game at Mile High stadium, giving up 
seven hits and striking out five in a 12-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 By early May, Chicago writers already were referring to Trachsel as a 
potential 20-game winner on a team that could lose 110 games. 
</P>
<P>
 And legendary Cub announcer Harry Caray was drawing comparisons between 
Trachsel's rookie season and that of former Cub Greg Maddux, a Cy Young award 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Composure-wise, he reminds me a lot of Maddux," Caray said. "Greg was younger 
than Steve when he came to the Cubs, but he's the same type of guy. Steve's a 
little bigger and throws the ball a little harder. But he's only a rookie and I 
think he can refine some of his pitching. All rookies need to." 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel calls the comparison "an incredible compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're comparable control-wise, but poise-wise I'm still a rookie and 
I have a way to go," he said. "But it's going to be a long time until I'm ready 
to fill the empty shoes he left here." 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel struggled somewhat when the Cubs called him up briefly late last 
season. He allowed four hits in seven innings in his major league debut, a loss 
to the Florida Marlins. He finished 0-2 with a 4.58 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three major league games he pitched, half of the hits he gave up were 
for extra-bases and right-handed hitters averaged .303 against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers like that usually buy you a bus ride back to Des Moines, but when new 
Cub manager Tom Trebelhorn took over, he penciled in Trachsel as the Cubs' 
fourth starter for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Youth and consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel is only 23, and was 31-13 in 2 1/2 years in the minor leagues. Last 
year, his first and only triple-A season, he finished 13-6 for the Iowa Cubs 
and was second in the American Assn. in strikeouts with 135. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming into this year, my only goal was to make the team," Trachsel said. "I 
didn't want to go back to the minors, and I did everything I could to let them 
know I was working hard. I came into mini-camp and worked hard in spring 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 After throwing five no-hit innings in spring training against Oakland, he 
solidified his spot on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trachsel was our most impressive pitcher this spring," Trebelhorn said. "This 
is a young guy we were counting on to be our fourth starter, and he has 
exceeded our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Drabowsky rates Trachsel above average on three pitches -- the fastball, curve 
and split-finger fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has pretty good command of all three," Drabowsky said, "and when you can 
throw the fastball across the plate when you're behind on the count, like he 
can, you have a very good chance to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll get better as he gets a little more accustomed to the hitters and 
comfortable with pitching technique and style. He needs to work on situational 
pitching and learning the strengths and weaknesses of the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel agreed that it has been a tough period of adjustment. But a plane 
ride to Los Angeles beats a bus ride to Omaha, and he knows the only way to 
stay in the majors is to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the minors, you can go out and pitch well, lose, 3-0, and everybody's 
happy," he said. "But here, you lose, 3-2, and it doesn't cut it. You have to 
win here. That's the bottom line."

ROUNDUP; ARIZONA'S EVANS FIRES 3-HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Evans tossed a three-hitter to pace Arizona to an 8-0 victory Thursday 
against Illinois-Chicago in a first-round game of the Women's College World 
Series in front of 1,596 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Arizona (61-3) will face Fresno State (49-14), a 1-0 winner over 
UCLA, today at 4 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans (17-0), a freshman right-hander whose 12 perfect games while at Hoover 
High set a Southern Section record, walked one and struck out six in a game 
called after five innings because of a mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans got the start over senior ace Susie Parra (30-1), who pitched all 39 
innings for the Wildcats in last year's national championship tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told (Wednesday) that I was going to start," Evans said. "I definitely 
had butterflies today and yesterday, but today was just like any other game. My 
nerves were gone after I stepped on to the rubber, but the butterflies were 
still there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Dalton, a sophomore from Glendale High, hit a two-run single to key a 
four-run second inning for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 Leah O'Brien hit a two-run home run in the fourth for a 6-0 lead and it was 
only an inning later when the Wildcats pushed across two more runs to end it in 
the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State 1, UCLA 0 -- Despite a 14-strikeout performance by Bruin ace 
DeeDee Weiman, Fresno State rallied with two out in the seventh to score an 
earned run and held on to beat UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the only loss in 12 tournament championship appearances for UCLA, winner 
of seven NCAA titles. 
</P>
<P>
 With bases loaded and two out in the seventh, UCLA's Jenny Brewster struck out 
looking on a full-count, inside curveball to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling she was gonna come inside," Brewster said. "You gotta swing 
and hit the ball in order to score and I didn't do that. It was too close to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (41-13) will face Illinois-Chicago (56-18-1) at 10 a.m. PDT Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 2, Oklahoma State 0 -- The Utes (51-11) scored two unearned runs in the 
eighth inning on two hits and two errors and held on to beat Oklahoma State 
(43-11). 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's Ali Andrus (32-6) threw a one-hitter, struck out seven, and faced just 
one over the minimum in eight innings.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; BRENTWOOD OUSTS BURBANK IN TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Second-seeded Burbank High was stymied Thursday in its attempt to repeat as 
the Southern Section Division III boys' tennis champion, dropping a semifinal 
match on the road to third-seeded Brentwood, 12-9. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs (20-3) won only one set in singles play, a 6-2 victory by Vazghen 
Zaghiyian over Kevin Pivnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Coach Clyde Richards said the turning point came when the No. 1 
doubles team of Phil Cano and Brad Warner -- who are competing in today's 
individual quarterfinals -- lost, 6-4, to Brentwood's No. 1 team of Scott 
Kaufman and Tyler Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
 This marked Burbank's seventh consecutive year of reaching at least the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood (17-3) will face Pasadena Poly in the team finals Wednesday. 
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica 2, Newbury Park 0 -- Pinch-runner Melissa Bunim scored on a wild

fourth-seeded Pacifica (21-5-1) advanced to play Marina in the Division I 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 9, Hesperia 2 -- The host Cowboys won a Division II quarterfinal. 
Canyon (19-5-1) will face Bishop Amat in the semifinals on Tuesday at a site to 
be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 South Hills 6, Quartz Hill 5 -- The Rebels (18-8) led, 3-2, and were tied, 
5-5, but could not overcome seven walks in a Division III quarterfinal. Cindy 
Sims had three hits, including a triple, and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete 10, Rancho Verde 0 -- Jamie Johnson recorded her 11th shutout -- a 
two-hitter striking out 10 and walking two -- as host Paraclete (23-5) advanced 
to the Division V semifinals. The senior helped her own cause with a three-run 
double in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Gayre and Kristal Nessa contributed identical three-for-three, one-RBI 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads 1, Oak Park 0 -- Jessica Schulman took a no-hitter into the seventh 
inning, but finished with a one-hitter, leading the host Roadrunners (23-6) in 
a Division V quarterfinal game. Schulman struck out nine and walked one. 
Crossroads scored its only run on throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Lucy's 8, Alemany 5 -- The Indians (22-3) gave up four runs in the bottom 
of the sixth and lost a Division III quarterfinal game at St. Lucy's. Tammy

CHARLES TRANSFERS TO NEVADA LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deriek Charles, a former standout running back at Hart High, has transferred 
from Washington State to Nevada Las Vegas, he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A redshirt freshman last season, Charles said he decided to change schools 
because Cougar coaches converted him to cornerback. NCAA rules mandate that 
Charles sit out the 1994 season. He will have three seasons of eligibility 
remaining beginning in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' 1992 Valley back of the year, Charles rushed for 1,133 yards and 15 
touchdowns, and caught 44 passes for 757 yards and eight touchdowns. He led 
Hart to an 11-1 record and the Foothill League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians were ranked No. 1 in The Times' regional poll for much of that 
season.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK; HORNADAY LOOKS TO END DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Hornaday Jr. has never won a NASCAR Winston West stock car main event, but 
he figures that Saturday night's $39,542 Valencia Dodge 200 at Saugus Speedway 
might be his best chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus is his home track. The one-third mile bullring requires special 
driving, and Hornaday, a second-generation driver from Palmdale, has been 
successful there in everything he has driven. He won seven races in 1987, 
taking the track's modified stock car championship, and won three Southwest 
Tour main events at Saugus en route to championships in 1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornaday, 35, drives a Chevrolet Lumina for Wayne and Connie Spears, whose 
Spears Motor Sports team is based in Agua Dulce. Their cars have won two series 
championships, 14 races and nearly $400,000 since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornaday's crew chief, Bill Sedgwick, drove for Spears Motor Sports when he 
won Winston West championships in 1990 and '91. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps most significant, Hornaday's father, Ron Sr., was the Winston West 
series champion in 1963 and '64, when it was known as the Pacific Coast Late 
Model series. Hornaday's wife, Lindy, is the daughter of Bill Foster, another 
Saugus champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saugus is the smallest track on the circuit," Hornaday Jr. said. "It's the 
kind of a track where experience is important, so that should give me an edge 
there. Having Bill (Sedgwick) in my pits is a real big plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saugus is so small that you have to drive by Braille. You're so close to the 
car in front of you that you can't see what's going on. Bill has driven there 
so much, and is so familiar with my driving style, that he knows instinctively 
what I need to do. He talks me through every lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lets me know if there's oil on the track, or if there's an accident, he 
lets me know a half a lap ahead if I should go high or low." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornaday Sr., retired and living at Lake Isabella, smiled as he listened to 
his son discuss radio communication with his crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my day, all we had were pit boards and hand signals," the senior Hornaday 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of things have changed. It used to be if you won the pole, the whole 
field was inverted and you had to fight your way up through the pack, which was 
usually 24 cars. I seem to remember I was always starting dead last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always figured if you can get your car to win the race at Saugus, you can 
win at any track." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Hornaday's hope is to win a Winston West race, and a championship, 
then take the team south to compete in Winston Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race I'm really looking forward to is the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis 
on Aug. 6," he said. "All the West Coast drivers have been invited." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornaday's best Winston West finishes have been two second places, including 
last year at Tucson Raceway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spears' cars come to the racetrack ready to win, so the pressure is 
definitely on me to produce," he said. "You don't see a lot of mechanical 
problems and things falling off his cars. He has a good team, a good car and a 
full-time crew, so that pretty much leaves it up to me to keep the car up 
front." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's biggest problem might be in deciding which make of tires, Goodyear 
or Hoosier, to put on the Lumina. Hornaday won the 1992 Southwest Tour title on 
Goodyears and the '93 title on Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll test them both before the race Saturday, and Wayne (Spears) and Bill 
will make the call," Hornaday said. "Whatever they decide, I'll drive as hard 
as I can and hope it's good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 If Hornaday had a fault during his development era, it was 
over-aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad ran my team until this year, and the only time he scolded me was when he 
felt I was over-driving the car, when I tried to put the car where it shouldn't 
be," he said. "Dan Press (a former Saugus champion) was with me in 1991 and '92 
and he did a lot to calm me down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I always had the talent to go fast from the start, but Dan molded me 
into a more complete driver. In essence, he told me to let the car have its 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 His father believes the job is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would put Ron in a class with Dale Earnhardt as far as their racing 
personality is concerned," Hornaday Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current racing era has seen father vs. son competition among the Pettys, 
Allisons, Andrettis and Unsers, but the Hornadays have never raced one another, 
except for an exhibition of past Saugus champions in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad retired from full-time racing in 1975, but I remember when I was a kid I 
saw every race I could," Hornaday said. "Dad would go early to races and on 
Friday, right after school, my mom and my sister and I would drive to the race 
and then we'd all drive home together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought that was neat, especially when I was in grade school and the 
next day all the kids would see my dad's name in the paper and ask me all about 
the race." 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-lap (66.6-mile), race will start at 7 p.m.

VENTURA'S JAY IS BETTER IN THE LONG RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ramsey Jay of Ventura High has qualified for today's Southern Section Masters 
Meet at Cerritos College in the 200 and 400 meters, but the Cougar junior is 
the first to admit that the 400 is his race. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my training is geared to the 400, not the 200," Jay said. "I'm a 400 man 
first and foremost. I come back in the 200 with whatever I have left after the 
400." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay ran a personal best of 48.05 seconds in the 400 to win the Division II 
title in last week's Southern Section championships at Long Beach Veterans 
Stadium before clocking another personal best of 21.63 for third in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Those times make Jay the fifth-fastest entry in each event in the Masters 
Meet, in which the top five advance to next week's state championships. But 
don't expect Jay to qualify as easily as possible in the 400 so he can conserve 
energy for the 200, which is 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not his style. Also, he probably can't afford that luxury. "I think the 
400 is a strong enough field that you could have five or six guys break 48 
seconds," he said. "I'm going to run the 400 all out and then I'll come back 
for the 200 with whatever is left." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay improved by sixth-tenths of a second in the 200 and by nearly a second in 
the 400 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal at the beginning of the year was to make it to the state meet and to 
run 47.90 in the 400 and 21.60 in the 200," Jay said. "So I'm almost there." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other athletes from the region are entered in two events. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo (high jump, long jump), Jason Medearis of Hart 
(110 high hurdles, 300 intermediates), and Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill (long 
jump, triple jump) are the others in the boys' meet. Dolores Tuimoloau of 
Channel Islands (shotput, discus), Kim Mortensen of Thousand Oaks (1,600, 
3,200), Michelle Perry of Quartz Hill (100, 200) and Liz Giltner of Chaminade 
(100 high hurdles, high jump) are double entries in the girls' meet.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; FINDING A PLACE FOR THE 
PAROLE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks residents have won their battle to have the San Fernando Valley 
parole office, which monitors more than 4,000 parolees, moved out of their 
neighborhood to North Hollywood. Residents, along with local politicians, 
objected to having the office at 5121 Van Nuys Blvd., where it has operated for 
a month, because it is across the street from the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks 
Recreation Center. This violates state Corrections Department guidelines for 
placement of parole offices. However, the new North Hollywood location on 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard near Vanowen Street is less than a quarter-mile from 
the North Hollywood Park and Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What should be the criteria for determining the location of a parole office? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it must be located away from parks and other recreational facilities. 
Parole offices should be away from residential neighborhoods in an area where 
it will not cause problems. It should be located in a commercial or industrial 
area where the parolees will not be congregating around residential 
neighborhoods. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, the department made a big mistake in trying to centralize all the 
activity in one location. It should be decentralized rather than all in one 
major office. From the Ventura County line to Pasadena, 4,000 parolees are 
processed through that office." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be the proximity to sensitive uses, sensitive uses being defined as 
churches, schools, playgrounds, parks and residential areas. It is totally 
inappropriate where it is right now in Sherman Oaks, near where the children 
and old folks are. . . . It should be brought back to the City Council in some 
sort of motion where the state must relinquish their right to put a parole 
center anywhere they want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Marino, field parole administrator at the San Fernando Valley Parole 
Office: 
</P>
<P>
 "Very basically, the parole office should be in the community we service but 
that's becoming harder and harder. At this moment, we're surrounded by 1,500 
parolees, 1,100 of them in Van Nuys alone. . . . One of our primary 
considerations in choosing a location is that it's near a main thoroughfare so 
the parolees don't have to traipse through residential areas and just get right 
off a bus and into the parole office.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same issue with automobiles. . . . This park (the Van Nuys/Sherman 
Oaks Recreation Center), prior to our arrival, has had nothing but problems. 
There are gangs and there was a shooting a month ago. The park was represented 
as a wonderful place. A park ranger told me that there's been a lot of youth 
gang activity there for a long time, but those facts were never brought to the 
floor. . . . The park was represented as a wonderful place." 
</P>
<P>
 Katharine MacDonald, spokeswoman for Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, who fought to have the parole office in Sherman Oaks moved: 
</P>
<P>
 "The councilman particularly objects to the parole center in that (area). The 
park has a very active senior center with between 250 and 300 senior citizens, 
Little League teams and soccer games. . . . The ideal location would be a 
commercial, rather than a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another major objection was that there was no notification when the 
department decided to place the parole office in Sherman Oaks. You have to have 
community input from the homeowners and the elected officials."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: MCKEON, BERMAN HAVE DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF RELIGIOUS 
LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RELIGIOUS ISSUE: Rep. Howard P.(Buck) McKeon(R-Santa Clarita) is opposing 
proposed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines that he says "go 
far beyond existing law and may result in a workplace in which religious 
expression and freedom are suppressed." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, a devout Mormon, has reacted to a proposal intended to help employers 
avoid harassment based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin or 
disability. The guidelines are based on a standard used for sexual harassment 
that prohibits actions that create a "hostile environment" in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter to Acting EEOC Chairman Tony E. Gallegos initiated by McKeon and 
signed by more than 40 colleagues said that "the limits of 'intimidation' have 
not been well-defined in terms of religious belief. The extent to which an 
employer may make his or her religious beliefs or affiliation known to 
employees of differing beliefs" is left unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said the standard of what might make an individual uncomfortable, 
interfere with work performance or damage employment opportunities in this 
context "is quite subjective and leaves the employer responsible for 
unintentional as well as intentional activity." The standard is whether a 
"reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would find the conduct 
intimidating, hostile or abusive." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who was alerted to the issue by the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of the 
Traditional Values Coalition, said this might apply to "an employee who wears a 
Star of David or who keeps a Bible" in his desk -- and would prompt firms to 
create "religion-free zones." Hence, he introduced a resolution to put the 
House on record opposing the inclusion of religion in the final guidelines. He 
said that he had 90 sponsors at a Capitol news conference on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 EEOC spokesman Michael Widomski flatly disputed McKeon's interpretation that 
the wearing of religious items or keeping religious texts at work would be 
taboo. "These guidelines deal with severe or pervasive behavior that creates a 
hostile work environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) initially signed McKeon's letter to 
Gallegos but later said this was an act of "carelessness" and withdrew his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not want to do anything to restrict an employer or a supervisor's 
free exercise of religion or his or her right to affirm religious beliefs, even 
in the workplace," said Berman, who has been active on free speech issues as 
well as concerns of the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, federal law and California law properly prohibit an 
employer from discriminating against an employee because of that employee's 
religious affiliation," Berman said. "And disparaging comments that would 
reasonably be viewed as intimidating employees and making them feel that they 
are not held in good standing or will be passed over for a promotion violate 
the laws against discrimination. I view the EEOC guidelines as an effort to 
protect both sides of the balance." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 TALL TALES: G. C. (Brodie) Broderson was an unusually colorful candidate when 
he ran for Congress as the Republican nominee against Berman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson, a sometimes actor and middle-aged member of the Guardian Angels -- 
a generally youthful volunteer safety-patrol organization -- actually got out 
of the race 33 days before the election to protest his lack of financial 
support from fellow Republicans. He then got back in two weeks later and went 
on to win less than 30% of the vote -- far below the party registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson, 64, a grandfather of 12 who resides in Mission Hills, was active in 
Ross Perot's presidential campaign in 1992 and heads the 26th Congressional 
District chapter of United We Stand, America, the organization started by 
Perot. And Broderson is now running for Congress against Berman again -- this 
time in the June 7 primary as a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the way, at last," said Broderson, who was previously a Democrat before 
he got upset with former President Jimmy Carter and switched parties. "I feel 
so much better." 
</P>
<P>
 He hosts a cable television show called "I.R.S.," for Incumbent Removal 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson, whose middle name is Clemens, claims he is a distant relative of 
Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name, Mark Twain. The two men bear at 
least a passing resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both are Democrats, and both like to tell tall tales, both have the same 
respect for politicians," Broderson said in a campaign mailing. "None." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson, who is preparing a one-man show on Twain for schools, quotes the 
19th-Century humorist regarding a late politician: "I did not attend his 
funeral. But I wrote a nice letter saying I approved of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman, who welcomed Broderson's return to the race in 1988, is approaching 
the self-styled "arch-Guardian Angel's" latest comeback with equal equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I've persuaded him of the Democratic Party and now I have to work 
a little bit harder to persuade him of the merits of my own candidacy," Berman 
said. "He's come to my party. Now I just have to get him to come to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OUTSIDE INCOME: McKeon and his wife, Patricia, were in Denver at a Western 
wear trade convention when the Jan. 17 earthquake rocked his district. Congress 
was on its mid-winter recess; McKeon and his brothers own a chain of Western 
clothing stores, Howard & Phil's Western Wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Democrat James Gilmartin, a Santa Clarita attorney who ran against McKeon 
in 1992 and is seeking his party's nomination to so do again, is making an 
issue of McKeon's continued involvement with his family business. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we can't find out is when he is working for Howard & Phil's and when he 
is working for the government," Gilmartin said. "We've only had one crisis 
since he's been working here. And he was in Denver doing business." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, McKeon's income from the business exceeded the limit on House members 
that were imposed in 1990, when they raised their salary and adopted new ethics 
requirements. Outside income is limited to 15% of the current $133,600 House 
salary, or $20,040. McKeon said he received about $148,000 from Howard & Phil's 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon was legally able to do so because an Ethics Committee rule states that 
the cap does not apply to family controlled businesses for "amounts received in 
connection with protecting or managing one's investment as long as the personal 
services rendered do not in themselves generate a significant amount of 
income." 
</P>
<P>
 After his election in 1992, McKeon requested and received an opinion from the 
Ethics Committee that his income would be covered by this rule. He declined 
this week to make his letter requesting the opinion or the opinion itself 
available. The committee will not do so, or discuss a lawmaker's circumstances, 
without the individual's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon resigned as a corporate officer and corporate director as required by 
House rules. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who owns a condominium in Beaver Creek, Colo., says he returned to his 
district by 10 a.m. on the day of the quake. He says he and his wife traveled 
to Denver on their own time and expense. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, he said that he has spent so little time on business for Howard & 
Phil's that "I cannot tell you for sure right now how many stores we have. The 
last several stores we've opened, I haven't seen." An aide said McKeon owns 20% 
of the fast-growing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Gilmartin's assertions, McKeon said: "It's kind of a nuisance 
campaign anyway. The only way he can get any press is by attacking me."

FATHERING CARTOON LEGENDS; FAMED ANIMATOR JOE BARBERA HAS WRITTEN HIS MEMOIRS 
TO COINCIDE WITH THE OPENING OF THE FILM VERSION OF HANNA-BARBERA'S 'THE 
FLINTSTONES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nuns at Holy Innocents School in Brooklyn knew talent when they saw it. 
</P>
<P>
 They took one look at how well little Joe Barbera drew and made the 
first-grader the unofficial school artist. While his peers mastered addition 
and learned how to read, Joe spent every day at the blackboard drawing pictures 
of Jesus entering Jerusalem and other pious scenes. When his mother discovered 
that Joe wasn't learning anything except how to wield a mean piece of chalk, 
she pulled him out of Holy Innocents and sent him off to public school. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbera, one of the most successful animators of all time, tells the story of 
his unorthodox artistic beginnings in his new book, "My Life in 'toons." From 
Turner Publishing, the memoir has been felicitously timed to coincide with the 
release of "The Flintstones," the live-action comedy featuring Fred, Wilma and 
the other wacky residents of Bedrock that opens nationwide today. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bill Hanna, his partner of almost 60 years, Barbera is, of course, the 
father of "The Flintstones," as well as the sire, for better or worse, of an 
entire industry -- TV animation. 
</P>
<P>
 A man envied by his peers for his ability to produce one comic idea after 
another, to sketch them and, above all, to sell them, Barbera is still hard at 
work at 83. Indeed, Barbera could be a Gray Panther poster boy: He is 
thoughtful, engaging, enormously energetic and still, as a writer for the 
Saturday Evening Post once put it, "darkly handsome in the Valentino manner." 
Sitting in his Hanna-Barbera office, just across the Hollywood Freeway from 
Universal Studios, he seems to take genuine pleasure in all his creations, from 
the new book to the dozens of characters he has conceived since he and Hanna 
all but invented Saturday morning cartoons in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have such a nice bunch of friends," Barbera said, gesturing toward the 
stuffed Yogi Bears, Huckleberry Hounds, Muttleys and Dick Dastardlys that fill 
every corner of the room. And he hasn't stopped dreaming up new pals, he makes 
clear. "I have three I have to work on tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Barbera who was responsible for selling each of Hanna-Barbera's shows 
-- as many as a dozen in a single year. His pitches are the stuff of legend. 
Barbera would produce sketches of characters faster than his assistants could 
pin them up, and he would act out the stories as well. Barbera put on a show 
and, even now, when he talks about such favorite creations as the rakish 
mountain lion Snagglepuss, he becomes Snagglepuss, doing a dead-on Bert Lahr 
imitation as he drawls the character's trademark "Exit, stage left." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barbera has spent a lifetime in one of the toughest industries in the world 
and yet his autobiographical account is remarkably upbeat, even sunny. Barbera 
chides Gene Kelly for failing to give Hanna and Barbera the credit they 
deserved for turning Jerry, the cartoon mouse, into a worthy dance partner for 
Kelly in "Anchors Aweigh." But there is virtually no vitriol in Barbera's book 
even when he writes about the dapper father who abandoned him and his siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbera begins his book with an account of his frenzied efforts to sell "The 
Flintstones" to network and sponsors (ABC ultimately took the gamble, and one 
of the original sponsors, Miles Laboratories, still makes Flintstones 
children's vitamins). Today, an entire generation knows the lyrics of "The 
Flintstones" theme; it is as much a part of American cultural history as the 
Slinky. But in 1960, the project was anything but a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A major stumbling block was that "The Flintstones" was something completely 
new -- an animated situation comedy in prime time. As to why the idea not only 
sold, but keeps on selling, Barbera theorizes that Fred is a kind of neolithic 
Everyman whose domestic and job problems everyone can identify with. Value was 
added to the series, Barbera says, by clever touches such as a guest appearance 
by Stony Curtis (whose voice is that of Tony Curtis) and assorted Stone Age 
"modern" inventions, including the Flintstones' vacuum cleaner -- a little 
woolly mammoth that sucks up dirt with its trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Norman M. Klein, an expert on animation who teaches at CalArts, 
Barbera is unique among the great animators. During two decades at MGM, Hanna 
and Barbera made seven Oscar-winning cartoons featuring Tom and Jerry, 
"indelible characters that only he could do" (the stories were largely 
Barbera's). In Klein's view, those cartoons combine the best of the elegant 
Disney full-animation style with the manic energy and wit of the best Warner 
Bros. cartoons. Barbera's most successful Tom and Jerrys are superb examples of 
the classic chase or baseboard cartoon -- so-called "because everything happens 
at the level of the baseboard along the bottom of the wall," explained Klein, 
author of "Seven Minutes: The Life and Death of the American Animated Cartoon." 
</P>
<P>
 But when MGM suddenly closed its animation studio, Barbera wasted no time in 
reinventing himself as the creator of the Saturday morning and later prime-time 
cartoon. "He's almost single-handedly responsible for that, for good or ill," 
Klein said. Successful as both an artist and a businessman, "he's really two 
people," said Klein, who thinks that Barbera has been unfairly neglected by 
historians of animation. 
</P>
<P>
 But some animation aficionados despise Hanna-Barbera. They blame the partners 
for killing the full-animation cartoon. To make cartoons on minuscule TV 
budgets, Hanna-Barbera resorted to something called "limited animation," using 
every cost-cutting trick imaginable to produce cartoons that purists denounce 
as flat, jerky and wooden. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbera is unrepentant. By the mid-1950s, full-animation cartoons had simply 
become too expensive to produce, he says. "We went into limited animation 
because there was no money, absolutely no money. You couldn't do cartoons the 
way they were being done. You couldn't afford to." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1957, it cost $30,000 to $40,000 to make a Tom and Jerry cartoon, Barbera 
points out. Six-minute Disney cartoons cost as much as $120,000. As a result, 
the major studios eliminated their animation departments during the 1950s, in 
no small part because they discovered that they could make 90% of their 
revenues from cartoons by showing old ones instead of shelling out for new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna-Barbera didn't kill the business, Barbera maintains. It was already 
dead. "We had to survive," he said, and so, thanks to what he calls "Yankee 
ingenuity," he and Hanna developed limited animation. "And because of what we 
were doing, the entire business came back to work again," Barbera recalled 
proudly. Today, he points out, there are more animated features being made than 
ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbera's office is filled with treasures, including Hanna-Barbera's eight 
Emmys and a photo of Barbera with the Pope during a meeting he describes as 
"electric time." Among the best-loved objects are the 20-odd volumes of "The 
Book of Knowledge" that his mother bought for him (on time, as poor mothers 
did) as a boy. Knowledge was a thing of real value in his childhood home, and 
his mother kept the books under lock and key. When he requested a particular 
volume, his mother would make a brown-paper cover for it before she solemnly 
passed it over to him. 
</P>
<P>
 When she died, Barbera recalls, he found the books among her things and 
discovered that she had secreted the money he had sent her over the years 
between the pages. "I can assure you any knowledge I have comes from these 
books," he said, reaching for one of the aging volumes. "Every once in a while, 
I take one down and flip it to see if there's any money in there!" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the naysayers, Barbera's cartoon friends have proved to be almost as 
hardy as he is, and he obviously revels in their continued survival. Muttley 
and Dick Dastardly are currently the hottest thing in Japan, he reports. "Ted 
Turner didn't pay $320 million for these characters to have them shunted 
aside," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbera's longtime Sherman Oaks home was damaged beyond repair in the 
Northridge quake, although he and his wife, Sheila, were unhurt (they're now 
living in Laurel Canyon). That was the year's nadir. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Flintstones" movie promises to be a high point. Barbera makes a cameo 
appearance, in animal-skin tux and bare feet, as a big shot making a splashy 
entrance at Bedrock's ritziest nightclub, Cavern on the Green, in a scene shot 
at Vasquez Rocks in Agua Dulce. John Goodman is terrific as Fred, Barbera says. 
And, as for the screaming matches between Goodman and Elizabeth Taylor, as 
Fred's mother-in-law: "All I could think of was 'Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf?' " 'The Flintstones' Mini-Quiz 
</P>
<P>
 1. "The Flintstones" was the third name on the drawing board for TV's first 
prime-time animated series. What did Hanna-Barbera originally want to call the 
show? 
</P>
<P>
 2. Whence the semi-immortal phrase "Yabba-dabba-doo"? 
</P>
<P>
 3. Hanna-Barbera had planned for Fred and Wilma's first "chip off the old 
rock" to be a baby boy, Fred Jr. Why, then, Pebbles? 
</P>
<P>
 4. Who was the voice of Barney Rubble? Mini-Quiz Answers 
</P>
<P>
 1. Hanna-Barbera planned to call the pioneering series "The Flagstones" -- 
until they received a letter from the creator of "Hi and Lois" advising them 
that the name was unacceptably close to that of the comic strip couple, the 
Flagstons. Fred and Wilma were briefly surnamed the Gladstones before they were 
finally dubbed the Flintstones. 
</P>
<P>
 2. It happened, Joe Barbera recalls, in the recording studio. Fred's original 
line was "Yahoo!" But actor Alan Reed, who provided Fred's voice, turned to 
Barbera and asked, "Can I say 'Yabba-dabba-doo' here?" 
</P>
<P>
 3. An executive in the studio's marketing department called Barbera and told 
him that it was too bad that the Flintstones were having a boy. Had it been a 
girl, the Ideal Toy company would love to do a Flintstones' baby doll. Visions 
of dollar signs danced in Barbera's head and he turned Fred Jr. into Pebbles on 
the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Mel Blanc, who was also the voice of the Flintstones' pet dinosaur, Dino.

GETTING KIDS INTO THE ACT; A CHILDREN'S PROJECT HAS ENCOURAGED 30 STUDENTS TO 
CREATE AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN VERSION OF 'AESOP'S FABLES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times.

 The evil cat is causing trouble. 
</P>

 "We can throw his yarn ball on the freeway," suggests mouse Nicolette 
Anderson.

<P>
 "We can cook him in the microwave," says mouse Jackie Gonzalez, to which mouse 
Rosita Henriquez responds, "We can call 911." 
</P>
<P>
 These may sound like a television gag-writer's overflow, but the lines are 
part of the script of an inventive children's project, headed by Alicia 
Wollerton, and put together by members of The Road Theatre Company. It opens 
tomorrow at Road Theatre, and plays one performance June 4 at North Hollywood's 
Group Repertory Theatre during the NoHo Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The script is for a staging of "Aesop's Fables" and was written by students of 
Hazeltine Elementary School, along with a couple of students from Kester Avenue 
Magnet and Trinity Christian School. The students, ages 7 to 13, have created 
the characters and staging. 
</P>
<P>
 Wollerton, actress and former artistic director of Road Theatre, is also a 
full-time teacher at Burbank's Providencia Elementary School. At one time, 
Wollerton said one acting job she would never take was in a children's theater. 
But she did accept a touring job with actor Timothy Busfield's Fantasy Theatre 
in Sacramento, which caused a big turnaround in her thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was actually the most gratifying theater I've ever done," Wollerton says. 
"I came back to L.A. and said, 'I've got to be involved with kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She has appeared in the long-running "Tamara," and at Grove Shakespeare 
Festival and Shakespeare L.A. "But I kept going back to kids," she says. 
"Suddenly I wanted to do kids instead of acting." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the present project came to Wollerton last year to involve 
youngsters in all aspects of theater. She was particularly interested in 
getting to this age range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something that is really needed out there," Wollerton explains, "is strong 
after-school programs, places where kids can go and get what they do in school 
reinforced. But not in a way that's school. A lot of the parents work. They 
don't have time to be there to supervise what's going on during those hours 
between 3 and 6." 
</P>
<P>
 What has been going on between 3 and 6 at the Road has been an eye-opener for 
the students and for the many Road Theatre members who have given their time to 
help shape the project. Students who were too shy to speak at the beginning 
wound up making suggestions and helping with plot development. Those who are 
more outgoing have found a way to use their creative energy. 
</P>
<P>
 After 500 applications were distributed at Hazeltine Elementary, the project 
wound up with about 30 students. Nineteen students will participate in the 
public performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The project began, Wollerton explains, "with improvisation games, theater 
games. Every day we read one of Aesop's fables at the end, and we'd talk about 
it. Then we started deciding which fables we liked the most. We'd talk about 
what makes the story interesting, what the conflicts of the fable are. The 
students would talk about what characters they needed in order to tell the 
story. Some of the fables evolved into more personal experiences. They had 
lessons they had experienced in their own lives. I wanted the students to be 
guiding what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
 The students shaped their script through improvisation, at the same time 
learning about theatrical conventions, staging and blocking and the discipline 
required. She says the final contributions between students and company members 
were probably 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
 Wollerton remembers reading Aesop's fables when she was 6. "The ideas in those 
fables had such an impact on who I think I am as a person, how I live my life, 
what my values are, how I want to treat people." 
</P>
<P>
 Lessons that students learn from the stories may be equal to lessons they've 
been learning from the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the fun, Wollerton says, there are other reasons for the students' 
involvement. "Feeling a part of -- I guess it's that sense of community you get 
from doing theater. From an academic standpoint, it helps these kids in terms 
of language acquisition -- things like reading and talking about values. And 
there are social skills, the interaction, they need for their lives ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Rome, who with Taylor Gilbert was co-founder of The Road Theatre, is one 
of the members who has given time to the students. She says, "In the very 
beginning, I saw their reticence and their fear and inhibitions. Now they 
really know how to focus, and start creating from a place of relaxation rather 
than all that chaos with each of them coming from a different energy space out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day," Rome continues, "I wanted to get the fear of the theater gods 
into them, and make them realize that we're going to do this in front of 
people. I said, 'What are some of the things that are going to be needed from 
you guys to be able to do this?' They answered, 'Cooperation, discipline, 
focus, attention.' It's been amazing to me. They're exhausting, but they're 
really inspiring." WHERE AND WHEN

MAKING A LIVING CLOWNING AROUND; HUSHY THE CLOWN WILL OPEN A ONE-MAN SHOW 
GEARED TOWARD YOUNG CHILDREN AT THE WEST END PLAYHOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 "I'm born as an artist," declares Hushy the Clown. His tone is both proud and 
a little wistful. "I can't do any other thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for all concerned, Hushy (pronounced Hooshy ) adores being a 
clown. "I just love this work," he says in a lilting European accent. "I love 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Hushy opens a six-week run of his one-man show at the West End 
Playhouse, a performance, he says, that is geared toward children ages 3 and 
older. "I work with props, I do slapstick, I bring kids up to be involved with 
the act," he says. "I do clown magic for them, I dance, I make animal balloons. 
It's just one hour, 'cause little kids get tired after that." 
</P>
<P>
 West End Playhouse artistic director Edmund Gaynes was introduced to Hushy 
about a year and a half ago. "He impressed me as somebody who was really 
serious about what he did, and did it in the old-fashioned tradition of the 
European circus," says Gaynes, who's producing the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of the last children's show I produced, Gideon Potter's 'The 
Wonder Faire' -- which was a big hit and ran here for three years -- in that it 
was original, different from the usual children's theater you always see: 
'Cinderella,' 'Alice in Wonderland.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hushy's reviews bear out the praise. "A sensitive, surprisingly accomplished 
performer," says the San Francisco Chronicle. "An impeccably trained, spirited 
mime," says the New York Times. And from the London Daily Telegraph: "An 
understanding of human emotion possessed only by the great." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently equally happy performing for children's birthday parties as doing a 
sophisticated evening of pantomime for adults, Hushy (born Hushy Boroumand) 
relies on both his formal training and years of on-the-street experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Iran, he grew up in Germany. "My father was very strict, made me be an 
engineer," he recalls. "But after finishing technical school, I never worked in 
that field." Instead, Hushy enrolled at the Berlin Mime Academy for three 
years, then spent another year studying mime with Etienne Decroux (Marcel 
Marceau's teacher) in Paris, before emigrating to the United States at age 23. 
</P>
<P>
 His first impression of Los Angeles was not altogether positive. "It was too 
big for me," he says with a slight shudder. Settling in the Bay Area, Hushy 
taught mime for four years at UC Berkeley. "But I didn't want to make a career 
of that," he says. Instead, in 1975, he became one of 5,660 who applied for a 
position with the Ringling Bros. Circus -- and was one of the 60 who were 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked with them a year, and really learned what clowning was about," he 
says. "But that's a hard life, always traveling -- trains, tents." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two decades, Hushy, 44, has not exactly settled down. He's been 
back and forth to Germany (where much of his family still lives) several times; 
his last sojourn there was for five years, during which time he toured all over 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now married and living in Hollywood, Hushy admits that making a living as a 
clown may not be the cushiest career choice. "It's very hard here," he says. 
"This city is for TV and movies. I will get it together, but it's difficult. 
I'm not going to give up. I'm very positive, you know." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER REVIEW; ONE-ACTS PLAY OFF GOOD WRITING; ALTHOUGH QUALITY VARIES, THE 10 
PLAYLETS IN 'TURNING POINT' AT THEATRE EAST ARE STRONG ON PERFORMANCE AND 
DIRECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A scene does not a play make. Even if it has a strong punch line. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the only problem that hangs over this evening of 10 playlets under the 
umbrella title of "Turning Point," at Theatre East. There's an awful lot of 
good writing here and indications that longer works might evolve out of these 
tidbits. 
</P>
<P>
 But as short stories are more difficult than novels to write, the one-act play 
demands a fine technical hand to bring it up to the level of its longer 
brethren. A bit of television influence also takes the edge off a couple of 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances and direction throughout are exemplary, a case of a fine 
purse holding small change. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the plays are little more than extended jokes. The two least 
interesting, "The Telephone" by John Touchstone, and Jim Inman's "Two Ole 
Codgers Sittin' on a Bench, in a County Seat, Town Square," get their "Beverly 
Hillbillies" chuckles, but little else. 
</P>
<P>
 William Borden's "The Ledge" is also funny, if two people getting ready to 
jump can be, and under Ray Young's direction, Adrienne Hampton and Michael 
Hernandez make it even funnier. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Meyer's "Karl and Mary Anderson Are Afraid" is a disturbing picture of 
wealthy white bigots destroyed by their own fear, which doesn't quite survive 
its pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hindi Brooks' "The Present" gives a too-pat happy ending to a marriage that 
has obviously been a disaster for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The very funny and campy "Vendetta," by Jacob Edelman, shows that even if you 
can't think up an ending for your play, it can be worked into the evening 
somehow. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy Crane's "Bad Talking Boys" is a rap poem, not a play. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest of the offerings, both in writing and execution, should be 
considered first drafts for further exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cole Dinelli's "The Donut Shop," about two losers deep in chronic 
boredom and paranoia, leads the curious mind to ponder where they came from and 
where they might be going. Under Dinelli's tight direction, Dominic Oliver and 
David Mingrino offer insightful and interesting performances that give the 
scene body and shape. 
</P>
<P>
 In "My Father, My Dad," directed by Ryan MacDonald, playwright Bruce Kirby has 
successful actress Nan McNamara playing cat-and-mouse in her dressing room with 
her out-of-work father, played by actor Kirby. It's a strong idea that looks 
like the first five minutes of a full-length play. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Woodhall's direction and intense performances by John Hugo and Karen 
Davenport give a sharp edge to Allison Gregory's "Breathing Room," about a 
separated couple who meet on a doorstep, an uneasy twosome with an obsessive 
fetish for strangulation. 
</P>
<P>
 It would require a great deal more exposition to explain their fascination for 
each other and why the audience might possibly be interested in whether or not 
they self-destruct, but the exploration might be worth it. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "Turning Point." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Theatre East, 12655 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 When: 8 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays, 7 p.m. Sundays. Ends June 5.

FROM THE EYES OF ARTISTS; 'SEARCHING FOR EDEN' EXHIBIT AT MYTHOS SHOWS WORKS 
THAT OTHER GALLERIES REFUSE TO DISPLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glen Doll feels that art has taken a very cynical turn in the last five to 10 
years. Not fond of that trend, he decided to do something to help reverse it. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, Doll, a painter and photographer, has been producing videos 
and slide presentations for corporations -- "so I'd have a little 
walking-around money," he said in his Burbank studio. Recently, he converted 
the building into an art gallery called Mythos and opened the gallery with the 
exhibit "Searching for Eden." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go into artists' studios and see incredibly exciting work that galleries 
wouldn't show," he said. He wanted to open a gallery "that started from the 
artist's standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamenting the aloofness with which some Westside gallery owners and employees 
treat people who venture into their galleries, he said he believes the 
community around him "would like art if it were presented in a halfway friendly 
manner. The public is pretty thoroughly estranged from art. I'll do whatever I 
can to make the space accessible, to slightly reinvent what a gallery is about. 
It's the only one in Burbank, so we can do things a little differently." 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is an educational experience too," said artist Lucinda Luvaas, who 
curated the gallery's inaugural exhibit with Doll. "There's something intimate 
and warm about this space. Glen loves art, cares about these things, is 
nurturing to other artists -- he is an artist. Artists want to take back 
something they've lost from the (gallery/museum) power groups that have sapped 
their energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Doll and Luvaas selected 40 works by 25 artists for the "Searching for Eden" 
show. "I wanted a theme that I thought might attract artists with whom I have 
something in common," Doll said. "I think we're awfully far outside the garden. 
The word that started grabbing my fancy is disintegration. It applies to 
everything I run into. The spiritual side is poorly integrated into our lives. 
A search is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "These are hard times in which to believe in anything idyllic, but that may be 
all the more reason to search for it. All of a sudden, I've started painting 
with tropical colors. I've started to become more hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
 In her work, Luvaas also presents an optimistic viewpoint, depicting men and 
women, children, animals and birds enjoying their time on Earth and with each 
other. Yet many of the works in this show demonstrate that the search for Eden 
is fraught with dark, debilitating passageways. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no paradise in Bianca Kovar's oil-on-canvas "The Oil Refinery-Ring 
Around a Toxin." Before a burning landscape, three headless men stand holding 
poles in the air, white gloves on their tips. As Kovar sees it, Eden is 
certainly not here on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Merry Moor Winnet's black-and-white photograph "Shangri-La" conveys a more 
hopeful perspective. A lush, unusual tree stands at the center of this softly 
focused picture, beckoning to us. Above the tree, a somewhat ominous bird-like 
creature hurtles toward it, perhaps suggesting this paradise holds some 
foreboding characters and places. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Yelchin has chosen some novel means of transportation for his vibrant 
pictorial journeymen. One picture is called "Goat Rider," and the other, 
"Chicken Rider." In both, a Don Quixote-like adventurer is riding tall in the 
saddle, so to speak, as if in a parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the painting "Fantasies," Linda Wood Feldman has captured the warmth and 
sensuality of Eden for lovers who are embraced by a colorful, expressionistic 
landscape. All the Angst that Eden may entail is absent in Allison Kendis' 
"Sublime." Her amused feminine figure with bright red lips sits on the ground 
with a red snake dangling about a leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Doll said that when he goes looking at art, he wants to be "struck by 
something. That's magic, and wonderful." At his gallery, he hopes to "strike 
people at a gut level." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "Searching for Eden." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Mythos Gallery, 1009 W. Olive Ave., Burbank.

 Hours: Noon to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday, and by appointment. Ends 
June 11.

COVER STORY; A WALK ON THE MILD SIDE; CITYWALK'S CRITICS SAY IT'S A PLACEBO. 
BUT TELL THAT TO THE THRONGS IT'S ATTRACTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If they had built CityWalk to look like Rome, or a corny version of the Champs 
Elysees, it might never have caused such a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But this elaborate strip of shops and restaurants atop Universal City evokes a 
locale much closer to home. With its jumbled neon and audacious storefronts, 
with a giant video screen looming over an artificial beach, CityWalk offers a 
version of the very city in which it resides. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is what started the fire, all the hype and criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 A few enthusiastic comments from within the MCA Development Co. -- colored by 
the city's growing concerns over crime and decay -- gave birth to an image of 
CityWalk as an abracadabra solution to Los Angeles' woes. "Idealized reality," 
MCA President Lawrence Spungin called his tightly planned and controlled 
complex that sought to act like a new brand of town square. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Boulevard with a child-proof cap. A sanitized Venice Beach for a 
populace grown weary of looking over its shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics howled. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that a thoroughly contrived "boulevard" seemed Orwellian. CityWalk 
faced graver charges. It smacked of an elitist enclave, with its private guards 
shuttling panhandlers and suspected gang members off the premises, the critics 
said. It offered a tempting placebo at a time when people should be working to 
revive the real city. 
</P>
<P>
 These perceptions ignited such ire that Kevin Starr, a USC professor and local 
historian, was moved to announce: "This sounds like the end of L.A. history." 
</P>
<P>
 A year has passed since CityWalk's cacophonous debut, and still the debate 
smolders, if less publicly. So excuse the complex's chief project designer, 
Richard Orne, if he sounds a touch wary when recalling the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion of CityWalk being a new Los Angeles was an unfortunate bent," said 
Orne, an associate at the Jerde Partnership, the private firm that served as 
principal architect. "But there has also been a fearful overreaction -- 'Oh my 
God, this is "1984," and private corporations are going to build fantasy 
versions of cities and manipulate the population.' 
</P>
<P>
 "CityWalk has become," he says, "a lightning rod for a lot of emotional 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps there are no longer real occasions for social congregation in the 
square. The larger transactions of business occur at a distance by 
'communication,' not face to face. Politics is by press, radio, and ballot. 
Social pleasure is housed in theaters and dance halls. If this is so, it is a 
grievous and irreparable loss. There is no substitute for the spontaneous 
social conflux whose atoms unite, precisely, as citizens of the city."  
</P>
<P>
 -- from Communitas, by Percival and Paul Goodman. If nothing else, CityWalk 
has proved successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of people have come here after taking the Universal Studios Tour or 
seeing a film at the adjacent multiscreen cinema. An estimated 2 million more, 
many of them Los Angeles residents, have come specifically to see the complex. 
That is twice the number that MCA had hoped for. Executives announce this as if 
reducing all the criticism to so much theoretical hand-wringing. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekend nights, their promenade boasts a carnival atmosphere, bristling 
with couples and clusters of teen-agers who hurry to dinner or merely stroll 
from shop to shop. The ethnically and geographically diverse crowd has 
dispelled predictions that CityWalk would attract only tourists and white 
suburbanites. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good place to hang out and not spend too much money," said Jansen 
Granflor, an 18-year-old from Riverside who brought a date on a Saturday night. 
"There's a lot to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 An immense, midnight-blue King Kong dangles over the entry. Rows of neon 
signs, placed there by the Museum of Neon Art, dance above the throng. Street 
musicians provide a soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 This sensory texture represents the most obvious distinction between CityWalk 
and other commercial plazas such as Old Town in Pasadena and downtown's Olvera 
Street. The Jerde Partnership sought to distill Los Angeles and its 
architectural array, from California Mission to ZigZag Moderne, in a way that 
would seem instantly familiar if not specifically recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Suisman, an architect whose firm, Public Works Design, is consulting on 
the RTD's proposed Electric Trolley Bus Project, said, "When you see people 
walking around, there is not that look of the dazed, manipulated consumer." An 
early critic of the project, he has been partially swayed by recent visits. 
"People seem to be relaxed and enjoying the place for what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The central courtyard serves as an unexpected example. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA initially fretted over a fountain in that courtyard. Because it was 
designed like the fountain outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, with 
ground-level jets that spurt water at irregular intervals, the management 
worried that visitors might wander through and get soaked. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, crowds now gather around, cheering as more adventurous souls take 
turns sprinting across, dodging the jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Such unintended use is a hallmark of successful public spaces, designers say. 
</P>
<P>
 James Nelson grins widely. As MCA's planning director, he is nothing if not 
exuberant about CityWalk and the ways -- both planned and unplanned -- in which 
it has developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happens in real life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But something seems odd on a blustery Wednesday afternoon as visitors skitter 
under dark clouds. It takes a moment to realize what is amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 It is music. Stereo speakers, mounted above the normal line of sight, 
broadcast at a volume that creeps gently into the awareness. They are 
broadcasting television theme songs, which is not the sort of thing you would 
hear strolling through Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 So it becomes apparent that MCA has gone to exhaustive lengths to create its 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The street musicians who will arrive later are being paid a per diem . Many of 
the stores were brought in not for their merchandise but for their 
entertainment value. Store windows pop and jitter with colorful gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to be able to go in and grab things and see things and watch 
things move," said Tom Gilmore, the general manager at CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, urban designers say substance has been sacrificed. The 
bookstore is not as encompassing as those on the Third Street Promenade. The 
boutiques aren't as funky as those that line Melrose Avenue. There's not 
Hollywood Boulevard's array of immigrant businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 CityWalk offers restaurants and toy stores, a sports memorabilia shop and 
numerous merchants who peddle various forms of trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, perhaps, less to this place than meets the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the great public spaces around the world, there is a range of 
activity," Suisman said. "People doing work, people running into friends, 
people reading or sleeping. Private spaces can be experientially impoverished." 
</P>
<P>
 This criticism, however, is purely aesthetic. What truly concerns designers is 
that CityWalk could alter public perception of our common areas. Again, it is a 
matter of the unique design. CityWalk is crafted to look like a Los Angeles 
street, but that is not how it operates. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the visitors are ethnically diverse, they tend to be clean and 
well-dressed. This place displays a predominantly middle-class image. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to censor out the bad realities of our city," said Mike Davis, an 
urban theorist who has written extensively about class separation in Los 
Angeles. "They have censored out people, the rank-and-file and the homeless, by 
giving subtle signals that they aren't wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The signals begin with a $6 parking fee, Davis said. And the giant King Kong 
that visitors pass under communicates expected behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has to pass through a gate," Suisman explained, offering an analysis 
that Orne himself supports. "At a very subtle level, that puts you in a more 
passive role." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so subtle is a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department substation located 
beside the courtyard. By including this facility in its design, MCA ensured a 
police presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the corporation feared that gang members had begun to congregate 
along the promenade at night. A strict code of conduct was enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors were forbidden to assemble in large groups. Abusive language and 
"unnecessary staring" were outlawed. Anyone wearing a baseball cap backward was 
told to turn it around or leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The perceived gang problem quickly dissipated. Panhandlers have been similarly 
warded off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not making a demographic selection," Spungin, MCA's president, said. 
"We are making sure that people who come here behave in a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
 These are fighting words for a man like Davis, a radical populist who became a 
Marxist in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fundamental confusion between safety and people who simply make us 
uncomfortable because they are poor or they are young minorities," Davis 
argued. "Old-fashioned American ideals of democracy are being sacrificed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as the city grows ever more fearful, MCA has gambled that people will 
sacrifice a little personal freedom for the opportunity to feel safe. So far, 
it seems, MCA has guessed right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a place where you can be comfortable without having to look over your 
back," said D'Marc Lee, 23, who visits regularly from downtown. "You know there 
isn't going to be any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 And at a seafood restaurant on the promenade, longtime restaurateur Bob Morris 
comments that he has never needed so many highchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families feel comfortable coming here," Morris said. "I don't mean to sound 
elitist, but I was raised in Los Angeles when it was nice, and we had places 
that were like CityWalk is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Suisman finds nothing wrong with people wanting to feel safe or with CityWalk 
providing such security. The problem arises if, bewitched by this experience, 
the public begins seeking extensive controls on truly public spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's scary when it becomes the daily norm," the architect said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if mass perceptions never shift, Davis sees a more immediate threat to 
the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "These unreal simulations have become fashionable," he said. "It's a radical 
abandonment of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 His argument goes like this: Tourists often seek out public spaces as a way of 
sampling the local culture. The same can be said for residents wanting to 
participate in the life of their city. By providing a safe and fanciful version 
of Los Angeles, CityWalk may be drawing people away from places like Hollywood 
Boulevard and Olvera Street, which desperately need the attention and the 
consumer dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that sense," Davis said, "CityWalk is probably the most insidious kind of 
theme park." 
</P>
<P>
 This view emanated from all points last summer. But time has swayed some 
critics, including Starr, the USC professor who uttered particularly dire 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned that the imagined L.A. could be taken as the real thing," he 
said. "The fact is, Venice boardwalk still gets crowded. The real L.A. is such 
a compelling presence that it won't be swamped." 
</P>
<P>
 And the professor admits to liking CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an urban resort," he said, "it's very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the crowds who've flocked to CityWalk since its opening (last) May the 
answer is clear: They love it. And the reasons why they love it reveal some 
crucial truths about the nature of urban life in the late 20th Century. These 
truths will confound the idealists who cry out for less-contrived urban 
gathering places. They will, however, confirm the instincts of those who 
believe that people will take to a new kind of city place that entertains them 
and respects their need to feel safe. CityWalk succeeds brilliantly as a public 
place that most Angelenos will enjoy."  
</P>
<P>
 -- from Leon Whiteson's October, 1993, critique in The Times. CityWalk arrived 
amid floods and riots, fires and earthquakes, events of nearly biblical 
proportion. It was inevitable that some would hail this complex as visionary 
while others would reject it as a sign that the apocalypse was upon us. 
</P>
<P>
 After wrestling with his own conflicting opinions, John Kaliski, a former 
principal architect for the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, finds 
himself leaning toward a less ponderous view. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the hype and criticism fall by the wayside, Kaliski said, if you 
reduce CityWalk to its most basic form. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the devil that some people claim it to be," he said. "And I don't 
care what Jim Nelson says, as long as he admits it isn't a solution or a 
substitute. It's a sophisticated marketing formula." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, CityWalk is a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "And for a shopping mall," Kaliski said, "it's pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Good enough, at the very least, to join such venerable attractions as the 
Watts Towers and the Griffith Park Observatory on Los Angeles magazine's recent 
list of "300 Reasons Not to Pack Up and Leave L.A." And good enough to get some 
urban designers wondering if the rest of the city might learn a thing or two 
from the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In his critique, Whiteson points out that CityWalk can trace its lineage to 
Paris' Palais Royal and London's Burlington Arcade, both of which were 
privately owned public spaces. He suggests that modern suburban malls might rip 
off their roofs and transform their "desolate central circulation spine" into 
livelier, urbanized scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Suisman concurred: "The retailers at CityWalk have been really inventive with 
their storefronts and signage. Imagine bringing that to Wilshire or Hollywood 
boulevards." 
</P>
<P>
 Designers also wonder if the dividing line between public and private spaces 
may continue to blur. If so, and if CityWalk provides any sort of indicator, 
the merger will not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the people who live down the hill in Studio City. While MCA talks 
excitedly about expansion -- they'll add country-music and blues clubs to the 
promenade this summer and a Hard Rock Cafe as part of a larger, future addition 
-- these residents find themselves watching closely. They are tempted to mimic 
some aspects of CityWalk along their own stretch of Ventura Boulevard but, at 
the same time, they worry about being too manipulative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just sad people can't find that kind of experience on the outside," 
mused Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents Assn. "Is that what 
Los Angeles is going to become?" WHERE AND WHEN

PLAYING IN A DIFFERENT SCENE; ART GRAHAM, WHO HAS BEEN FRONTING TRIOS FOR 30 
YEARS, PERFORMS SUNDAY AT THE EQUESTRIAN CENTER IN BURBANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Art Graham has known good times -- and really good times. 
</P>
<P>
 Like from the mid-'60s to the early '80s. "There was a period of about 15 
years where I was working six nights a week," says Graham, who has been 
fronting piano trios for 30 years with consistent regularity. "We spent 10 to 
11 years at Sneaky Pete's, which was next to the Whiskey-A-Go-Go, where Duke's 
Cafe is now. Johnny Carson came in, Ed McMahon, John Wayne." Other rooms where 
Graham performed included P.J.'s, at Crescent Heights and Santa Monica 
boulevards, and Sonny's on La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even a few years ago, I was doing six nights down at the beach. I didn't even 
have to come into town," he says, referring to steady engagements at Sausalito 
South and Annabelle's, both defunct clubs in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are different on the club scene now, Graham says. "I think it's the 
people at the helm," he begins. "Mostly they're young, and they're called Food 
and Beverage Directors, and I don't know if it's because they're young, or just 
fickle, but they can't seem to stand the same thing two nights in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, who plays Sunday at the Equestrian Center in Burbank, sees this line 
of thinking as pure nonsense. "Before, you built up a place by staying in one 
location," he says. "That's how business mushrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist says he's in his 60s. "But I don't know that age has anything to 
do with it, as long as you have energy and know what you're doing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, who lives in Hollywood, says that these days he makes his living 
playing a few steady jobs, such as Barnaby's in Manhattan Beach, where he 
appears Saturdays; private parties, and occasional engagements at such clubs as 
Chadney's and the Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham says he feels people like him because he never plays down to the crowd, 
"or over their heads." And because he caters to terpsichoreans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, America's dancing, whether we like it or not, and there are a lot of 
people who go out looking for places to dance," he says. "More people I know 
like to dance than to listen. The last time we played Chadney's," which doesn't 
have a dance floor, "people were dancing back by the waitress station, and that 
drove the waitresses crazy," he adds in a wheezy laugh. There will be a dance 
floor set up in front of the band at the Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham offers a wide repertoire, from traditional Argentine tangos and 
Brazilian sambas to Ellingtonia such as "Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me" and 
slow pop tunes such as "Through the Eyes of Love." "I like to shift gears, so 
that the musicians don't get bored and don't have to play the same thing all 
night," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a nice foot-tapping groove is definitely part of an Art Graham show, 
and he points to Gene Harris, former leader of the Three Sounds and currently 
one of the most popular of jazz musicians, as a chief inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was working at the Sands in Las Vegas in 1965, we'd get off at 3:15 
a.m. and go over and catch Gene at Reuben's," Graham recalls. "I'd sit right 
behind him, and I learned a lot from that cat. He puts it in the pocket -- not 
a lot of notes, not a lot of frills, just hard swinging." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Duke, who has booked Graham for both Chadney's and the Equestrian 
Center, says the pianist reminds him not of Harris, but of another favorite, 
Erroll Garner. "Art makes the room swing," Duke says. "He's very listenable." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham grew up in Bridgeport, Conn., studied piano as a youth and soon was 
working in Manhattan with Lester Lanin, one of the city's top society 
bandleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was good basic training," he says. "You learned all the tunes, and it 
was all dance music. Because of that, if somebody calls a tune, there are very 
few we can't cover," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham moved to Los Angeles in 1959 and soon established himself in Southern 
California nightspots. He has recorded a pair of albums and twice appeared on 
"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson." 
</P>
<P>
 Life without music would be a mistake, Graham says. "The day I don't feel that 
way, I'll quit." WHERE AND WHEN

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: PINING FOR SOME ANTIQUE ACTION?; LOTS OF FINE OLD 
FURNISHINGS AND SOME GOOD CONVERSATION CAN BE FOUND AT THIS MELROSE SHOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 20 years, brothers Terry and Danny Farrell cruised the countryside of 
Ireland in search of trea sures for their antique-ex port business. They were 
looking for pine furniture, which they sold to dealers, many of them from the 
United States.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Terry and his wife, Heather, opened an antique shop in Los Angeles, 
while Danny continued sleuthing in Ireland. This arrangement eliminates the 
dealer, so their customers are dealing as directly as possible when buying 
antiques, which certainly helps keep prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that a piece is pine, the brothers use the "key test," which means 
simply scratching the underside to check the wood. After Danny Farrell 
purchases a piece, it is stripped in Ireland, then shipped to Los Angeles, 
where it must sit for a couple of months to allow the wood to adjust from the 
damp climate of Ireland to the dry California air. When the wood dries and any 
shrinkage has occurred, it is finished and placed in Farrell's Melrose 
establishment, the Irish Pine Furniture Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, every piece has a story, and Terry Farrell is a consummate 
raconteur. While I was scrutinizing the wood carvings on a huge 11-drawer 
bookcase, he told me it was made in the mid-1800s and had come from a linen 
mill that was being torn down in Ballymena, in Northern Ireland. Pieces this 
dazzling generally are $12,000 to $14,000, but he quoted "$8,000, and that's 
negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
 Another indication of the good prices here is evident in a piece Farrell sold 
on consignment in a store up the street. Farrell's asking price for the large 
armoire had been $3,500. The consignment store slapped a $12,000 tag on it -- 
and sold it for $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the most interesting pieces are impossible to comparison-shop. What 
was once a grain bin on a farm, and would probably be used as that again, was 
$775.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a little easier to spot a bargain in an interesting cupboard. This one 
was about 5 1/2 feet tall with chevron-patterned doors of pine inlays, four 
shelves and two doors, for $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 When a 19th-Century cathedral was being torn down in County Armagh to make way 
for a pub, Danny Farrell purchased 40 of the original pine pews, which are nine 
feet long, and some are selling for $725.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a pleasant shopping experience for good deals and "good crack" -- the 
Irish way of saying "stimulating conversation."

DINNER COURSES; NOW PARENTS CAN GO OUT FOR A NIGHT ON THE TOWN GUILT-FREE. A 
NUMBER OF CLASSES GIVE ADULTS TIME ALONE WHILE THEIR CHILDREN LEARN TO COOK AND 
SCULPT. 
</P>

<P>
 For parents who sometimes feel a bit guilty going out to dinner and leaving 
the kids home with a baby-sitter, there's a new option: Send the children to a 
two-hour class. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of courses are designed to allow parents a couple of 
hours out while their children learn new skills and have some fun. The courses 
cost as much or more than hiring a baby-sitter. But parents who have sent their 
children to the dinner-hour classes say the workshops offer something valuable 
and constructive, and provide the child an interesting night out. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a month for more than a year, Carolyn Namer has been dropping off her two 
children at Let's Get Cookin', a Westlake Village cooking shop that has classes 
for children as well as adults. Namer and her husband and friends eat out while 
their children are tutored in the culinary arts. Because it's a cooking class, 
there is an extra bonus -- the children eat dinner while they are there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids love it. They are accomplishing something, and we feel guilt-free 
leaving them," Namer said. "They come home all excited about what they have 
done. It really makes them feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Namer's children -- Nicole, 7, and Jonathan, 6 -- recently took the store's 
"Jurassic Park Breakfast" single-session course for $25. They made dinosaur-egg 
omelets, pterodactyl cinnamon twists and triceratops cookies for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Vaccarelli, the store owner, says the response to her Friday night 
classes has been excellent, far better than for Saturday courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Between sports activities, birthday parties and family events, there is a lot 
of competition for Saturday time, she says, adding that many parents really 
appreciate the chance to dine out by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everywoman's Village in Van Nuys is also scheduling classes to provide parents 
some evening time away from the kids. "The concept is to have classes that are 
child-oriented and offered at a time when parents can eat out or shop and know 
their children are in good hands," said Dan Sonenberg, spokesman for the 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The Village offers such weeknight courses as "Paper Sculpting" (four two-hour 
sessions for $61) and "Secrets of the Great Masters" (four two-hour sessions, 
also $61.) 
</P>
<P>
 Two-hour classes set for Christmas week cover such topics as "Boxmaking" and 
"Understanding Animation." They are designed to provide parents with time for 
last-minute shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for busy families, Sonenberg says, is to try to find activities 
that provide something special and valuable for children, but at a time that is 
also convenient for parents. WHERE TO GO 
</P>
<P>
 What: Courses for children during the dinner hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Let's Get Cookin', 4643 Lakeview Canyon Road, Westlake Village. 
Classes for 6- to 9-year-olds. 
</P>

AT THE ROCK, 'IT'S FUN TO JUST KICK BACK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every night of the week, The Rock has something for everyone -- dancing, 
drinking and more. Open from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., the Canoga Park club has no 
cover -- except Thursdays after 9 p.m., when $2 gets you in for "Thirsty 
Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: The word is big. Packed with pool tables, pinball machines, 
dartboards and big-screen televisions, there's plenty to keep club-goers 
occupied. The place doesn't draw a lot of dancers, but there's room when the 
band is right. If you're thirsty, there's beer -- 200 varieties, imported and 
domestic, with several dozen on tap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting there," said Rat Salad bassist Bruce Robinson between sets. 
"It's raw, and it has a lot of potential." 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Dress is definitely casual among the 21- to 35-year-old crowd the 
club pulls in -- jeans, boots, T-shirts, leather and hair of all lengths. Wear 
a tie and you're overdressed. People come to drink, shoot pool, rock or relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty mellow crowd," said employee Donat Kazarinoff, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Live bands deliver a steady stream of loud rock 'n' roll every 
night. On a recent Friday, Rat Salad kept the low-key crowd entertained with 
several sets of classic rock staples such as "Highway to Hell," "All Right Now" 
and "China Grove." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our drink-and-be-merry night," said Robinson, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: "It's kinda nice to come to a place with your shirt unbuttoned," 
said 25-year-old Richard A. Haering. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby Hardt, 22, agreed. "It's fun to just kick back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At other clubs," added her friend, 22-year-old Sherri Robinson, "you either 
have to dance or get trampled on." 
</P>
<P>
 "The drinks are good," said first-time visitor Robert Tice, 24, an 
international business major at Pierce College. "Better than Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: "It would be nice to have some jazz," Haering suggested, "but this 
crowd wouldn't call for that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman said she'd like to see "more longhairs." She smiled. "I love 
longhairs." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "I killed a man for snoring once," deadpanned one guy to his buddy. 
"Don't touch my beer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave me alone," griped another guy at the bar. "Let me watch hockey. Let me 
live vicariously through the TV."

BRUTE OF A BUILDING; THE NORTHRIDGE MEDICAL ARTS FACILITY IS AN EXAMPLE OF 
ONCE-POPULAR BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN VAUGHN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Susan Vaughn writes regularly about 
architecture for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Goliath among Lilliputians. A departure from a world-famous architect's 
metier. The Northridge Medical Arts Building is a study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Set among the fast-food eateries, hardware shops and pet-grooming palaces of 
Reseda Boulevard, it squats like a hulking Titan. Crude concrete is its skin. 
Its form is heavy and immutable, like an Old Kingdom Egyptian pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dion Neutra, son of world-renowned architect Richard Neutra, co-designed the 
Northridge Medical Arts Building in 1963. In prior years, the Neutras gained 
international reputations for creating innovative, lighter-than-air "built 
environments," such as the Mariners Medical Building in Newport Beach, an oasis 
of light and glass. Certainly, the ponderous Northridge Medical Arts Building 
departs radically from that style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building evolved into its present form," says Dion Neutra, who now 
devotes his architectural practice to restoring Neutra-designed buildings. "We 
had hoped to create a concept that would complement the construction" of nearby 
Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original design was very open, with lots of glass, allowing outside light 
and air to flow into the building. There was even an inner courtyard planned. 
But because of space and expense considerations, we had to alter the design 
quite a bit," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With architect Paffard Clay, Neutra refashioned the Northridge Medical Arts 
Building, completed in 1964, into its present form. 
</P>
<P>
 A mammoth breton brut (bare concrete) slab rests upon an impossibly slender 
base at the building's entrance. This giant piece of crude sculpture -- solid, 
intractable, intimidating -- merrily flaunts the virtues of concrete. Exterior 
stairs flow toward a cavernous entrance. Surrounding foliage is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrow glass panels separated by bare wood posts comprise the building's 
first-floor facade. Its upper two stories are dominated by grids of windows, 
partially obscured by repeating bris-soleils, fixed louvers that block direct 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 As daylight shifts in the sky, the building's deep balconies become gashed 
with shadows that slink across its concrete landscape. Inside, ultra-wide 
corridors and high ceilings carry military rows of fluorescent light squares. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Medical Arts Building's facade bears close resemblance to two of Le 
Corbusier's great creations, the Unite d'Habitation in Marseilles, France 
(1952), and the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University 
(1963). 
</P>
<P>
 Together, these three buildings reflect a style of architecture called 
Brutalism that was popular in the 1950s and '60s. Brutalist buildings are 
heavy, monumental and defiantly unbeautiful. Their concrete surfaces are 
intentionally left exposed. Their ambience is austere. 
</P>
<P>
 Brutalism evolved as a revolt by certain European architects against a more 
widely accepted elegant design of the 1940s called Corporate International 
Style, which glorified "glass box" construction in a style that emphasized 
lightness, anonymity and rectilinear precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Brutalist advocates shunned it, however, maintaining that the International 
Style was an elitist fashioning that ignored the cold, harsh realities of 
post-World War II working-class life. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the '60s, Brutalism also fell out of favor, as other architects 
embraced new classically influenced styles to convey messages of optimism, 
humor and hope. WHERE TO GO  
</P>

NEW SPIN ON AN OLD GAME; DISC GOLF ATTRACTS A PASSIONATE FOLLOWING TO THE 
WOODED COURSE AT VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK IN SYLMAR. IT'S A CONTEST OF SKILLS AND 
USE OF THE COURSE IS FREE.

<P>
 You can make a hole in one with one hand tied behind your back. The soda cans 
you carry along are heavier than your golf bag. And best of all, there are no 
expensive caddies, country club fees or dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the working-class golf game: disc golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked away in a maze of trees between suburban back yards and park picnic 
tables, the disc golf course at Veterans Memorial Park in Sylmar lures a golf 
lover cut from a less aristocratic cloth, but whose passion for the game is 
second to none. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's so great about the sport," said Amy Rosenthal, 27, of Tujunga. 
"It's more for the common person. You don't have to pay to play. And people can 
come out with their families." 
</P>
<P>
 At first glace, the game seems like an easy version of traditional golf: 
T-shirt-clad participants walk around the course throwing their plastic 
Frisbee-like discs at 18 "holes" -- metal baskets mounted on poles about five 
feet high. The fewer attempts it takes to get a disc into the basket, the 
better your score. 
</P>
<P>
 But fanatics such as Rosenthal, who gather regularly at the San Fernando 
Valley's only such public course, say disc golf is as much a contest of skills 
as golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Players fire off behind-the-back shots and count on memory when hurling discs 
at baskets obscured by trees. Basket markers are confusing, even to the 
veteran, and a novice can easily find himself shooting from the first hole to 
the 18th hole, skipping 2 through 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The playing field looks like a miniature obstacle course. A golf cart would 
wear its brakes out quickly on the sloping terrain, run aground in the bushes 
or slam into the many trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of hazards in this game," said Eric Garber, 29, of 
Chatsworth. "The discs can get stuck in a tree or over a fence where there's a 
big dog, and you're not going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 But ardent players such as Garber realize that avoiding these obstacles is as 
much a skill as hitting baskets. And some hazards can actually be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tree can be your friend," said Rosenthal, who has been playing since 
1986. "If your disc is going the wrong way and you hit a tree, it can put you 
back in the right direction or off a tree and in a basket." 
</P>
<P>
 With such obstacles, nailing a hole in one is clearly the ultimate test of 
skill -- enough to draw a group of about 30 "disc jockeys" once a month to the 
Sylmar course. The group even gathered in the driving rain on a recent 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play, rain or shine," said Garber, shrugging off the cold. "We've played 
in worse. We've played in hailstorms." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying their discs in pouches, the sneaker-clad group divides into small 
cliques and begins to hurl discs from the "tee off" -- cement slabs pointing 
vaguely at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Like golf, there is silence at tee off, and players can choose from more than 
one disc -- all of which are lighter and faster than the average beach Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep 12 in my bag," said Rosenthal. "Like in ball golf, where you have 
irons and woods, we have different Frisbees that do different things. You have 
ones that are your drivers, you have ones that you would use for a chip shot 
and you have cutters." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike golf, players use three-inch-diameter plastic markers, rather than 
wooden tees, to define where shots land. Each "hole" is par 3 and less than 60 
yards from tee off, making each game a brisk competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Headlund, 33, of Sylmar said the game is faster than golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I do for exercise," said the 33-year-old project analyst, hiking 
over a bed of pine needles up to the ninth hole. 
</P>
<P>
 But competition is the name of the game for most players. Many play in local 
tournaments, such as the annual Sylmar Doubles Championships, sanctioned by the 
Professional Disc Golf Assn. in Indianapolis. Players are not considered 
professionals until they begin playing tournaments for money, a privilege 
gained after winning enough amateur tournaments. Some even have their own 
trading cards touting their prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 This competition can be intense between the sexes as well. Rosenthal was once 
ranked second in the world among women by the Disc Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best feeling I get is knowing I throw as far as the men," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular Saturday, the 18-hole game was over in 1 1/2 hours and 
players were back in the parking lot. No one nailed a hole in one, but no one 
was surprised, either. Such a feat is a rare honor. But when it does happen, it 
is the fellow players who are treated like royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get an ace, it's mandatory that the guy run down and buy a case of 
beer and say thank you," said one player. 
</P>
<P>
 Disc golfers know their beer runs may not be as high-class as toasting a hole 
in one in the country club bar at the other golf course. But neither do they 
worry that ball golfers look down upon them, or their sport, from their 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Rosenthal points out, their love of golf will put them all in the 
same boat in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be doing the sport until I can't walk," said Rosenthal. "I could see 
myself at 80 out on the course, walking very slowly through each of the 18 
holes." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE REBIRTH OF IL MITO; THE POPULAR ITALIAN SPOT MAKES ITS 
POST-QUAKE DEBUT -- AND IS AS INVENTIVE AND DELICIOUS AS BEFORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After a brief closure caused by the earthquake, one of the San Fernando 
Valley's smartest Italian restaurants announced that it had been reborn. I 
can't say I see much difference between the old Il Mito and its reincarnation, 
beyond a few menu additions such as duck with blueberry sauce and an equally 
colorful beet risotto, but I am grateful that these people have had sense 
enough to maintain, for the most part, the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Day One, Il Mito has been as finished and inventive as any Italian 
restaurant on this side of the hill. Chef-owner Michael Fekr is a protege of 
Antonio Tommasi, the one-man Italian restaurant conglomerate associated with 
Locanda Veneta, Ca' Brea and Il Moro, as well as the new Ca' Del Sole in North 
Hollywood. He has clearly been a good student, and by now Fekr has had four 
years to hone his cooking style and train a staff, the best two reasons this 
place runs so smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 His tasteful, well-balanced menu attracts a fiercely loyal clientele, mostly 
big-shot producers, screenwriters and ambitious assistants from the nearby 
studio complexes. Come any weekday and you are likely to find yourself 
sandwiched in among them, for Il Mito is relentlessly popular at lunch. One 
Tuesday, two competitively dressed women to my immediate right were discussing 
a script about racism in college basketball. On a Thursday, I got to hear the 
actor John Ritter, maybe three feet behind me, jawing about his newest 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 It is axiomatic, in this town, that one has to have one's act together to hold 
on to industry clientele. And snappy decor doesn't hurt. Il Mito's two dining 
rooms are spare and elegant; one is an open, well-lighted bar decorated with 
gaudy Art Nouveau paintings, the other a more sequestered room adjacent to the 
restaurant's partially open kitchen. Gorgeous, translucent ochre lanterns are 
suspended above the tables in this second room, and they give off an almost 
mystical glow in the evening. In contrast, eating in the bar, especially during 
lunch, feels casual and overtly hip, making it the perfect place to consummate 
one of those legendary deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fekr has a wonderful eye for color; he uses olive oil, garlic, basil, 
radicchio and sun-dried tomatoes to achieve artistic effect in many dishes. The 
complimentary tomato and garlic appetizer, a dipping sauce for the excellent 
house bread, comes topped with a sprinkle of fresh green herbs and a float of 
clean-tasting olive oil, a mini- oeuvre in an earthenware saucer. Then there's 
bruschetta al pomodoro e melanzane , grilled bread with diced eggplant, Roma 
tomatoes, basil and Parmesan cheese. You get four delicious mounds that look 
like multicolored New Age sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another very popular dish at lunch is zuppa della riccessa , a fine 
Tuscan-style lentil soup with a smoky aftertaste. I do not understand Fekr's 
minestrone di verdure , though -- a brownish cabbage soup that tastes like a 
refugee dish from an Eastern European restaurant. The best of the salads is 
probably insalata due colori , a clever Caesar of colorful radicchio and 
romaine tossed with a dressing pungent with anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fekr makes excellent stuffed pastas. Tortelloni are plump little purses 
stuffed with ricotta, in a rich mushroom sauce. The ravioli ripieni is the best 
dish in the restaurant: wonderfully light dough, a subtly flavored minced 
shrimp filling and a rich saffron cream sauce on top. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are in a radical mood, try risotto con capesante (with scallops), the 
twist being that pureed beets tint this risotto a pale rose red. But pass on 
penne al terremoto (Italian for earthquake -- ironically, it was on Fekr's menu 
before January's semi-Big One). The short tube pasta comes in a spicy, 
tomato-based sauce with crushed olives and garlic that suffers, as it has from 
the beginning -- from the bitterness of burnt garlic.  
</P>
<P>
 The main dishes ( secondi ) have more moxie than the roast meats found in 90% 
of our Italian restaurants. Unfortunately, they don't all work. Pollo libertino 
is boneless free-range chicken crisped on the grill in a whole-seed mustard 
sauce, and it is simply too salty. Lombata di vitello con aglio e rosmarino is 
better, a thick veal chop blanketed in a brown garlic and rosemary sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I liked anatra al mirtillo , although no one else at my table did. It's one of 
Fekr's more daring items: oven-roasted Muscovy duck, cooked to order, with a 
blueberry sauce, of all things, that gives the natural essences of the meat a 
nice added dimension. And costolette d'agnello alle arachidi (rack of lamb, 
four double chops) comes topped with a peanut sauce that may have been inspired 
by Talesai, the Thai restaurant across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Peanuts in an Italian dish, hmmmm. No, I just don't think it works. Maybe we 
need to think back to that status quo concept, just a bit. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 Location: Il Mito, 11801 Ventura Blvd., Studio City.

 SKATE HAVEN: In almost any sports store in the county, the busiest section 
will be where they sell in-line skates -- Rollerblades to most people. Now the 
sport has its own convention -- the World Inline Skating Expo -- Saturday 
through Monday at UC Irvine. . . . Organizers say the best in the world on 
these blades -- including members of the Anaheim Bullfrogs roller hockey team 
-- will demonstrate their talents. . . . . "But bring your own skates too," 
says spokeswoman Dee Bowers. "There will plenty of public skating time." 
</P>
<P>
 TOURNEY TIME: Orange County continues to dominate in community college 
baseball. Cypress and Rancho Santiago -- along with two Northern California 
schools -- advance to the state tournament Saturday at Cerritos College. . . . 
Defending state champ Rancho Santiago plays Hayward's Chabot, followed by 
Cypress, which won the state title in 1991, against Susanville's Lassen. The 
double-elimination tournament continues Sunday, with the title game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 BOB'S LITTLE BOY: Dante Lara's mother says it's not the claim to fame she 
necessarily wanted for her almost-3-year-old son. But when she dressed him up 
last Halloween as a look-alike of Bob's Big Boy -- from the restaurant chain -- 
friends said he was perfect. . . . Which led to Brandee Lara, a high school 
teacher from Rancho Santa Margarita, taking Dante to Detroit this week as a 
finalist in a Bob's Big Boy look-alike competition. Says Lara: "He didn't win, 
but he loved it, and everyone thought he was adorable." 
</P>
<P>
 BABS BLUES: It's not just ticket-holders upset about Barbra Streisand's throat 
problems. Don Myers, manager of The Catch restaurant across from Anaheim 
Stadium, had planned a whole Streisand look-alike and Streisand karaoke 
songfest tonight. It would have been for more than just laughs -- contest 
winners were to receive free tickets to hear Streisand at the Pond. Says Myers: 
"Obviously, we have to call it off if she doesn't sing."

ELECTIONS / LOCAL RACES; WHITE LEADS CANDIDATES IN CASH WITH $63,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ventura County Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White has raised and spent 
more money than any other local candidate this spring in her combative race 
with defense lawyer James M. Farley for a vacant seat on the Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 White, whose campaign is buttressed by the contributions and endorsement of 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, had raised nearly $63,000 by May 21, while 
Farley had raised about $29,000, according to financial statements filed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect some of the biggest expenses are yet to come," said White, who has 
already spent nearly $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley, who was favored in a recent county Bar Assn. poll and had more 
attorney contributions than White, responded: "We're doing it without money." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most local races on the June 7 primary ballot have been squeezed by 
the tight pocketbooks of contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 The three best-funded candidates hoping to replace retiring Supervisor Maria 
VanderKolk in the 2nd District have loaned themselves thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo has raised the most, about $47,500, but 
$26,000 of it is loans from himself. Of lawyer Trudi K. Loh's $35,000 war 
chest, $10,000 is her own money. And retired businessman H. Jere Robings' 
$26,000 was spiked by $15,200 in loans to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer has raised nearly $15,000 but only $2,000 
is a loan. A fifth candidate, Carter J. Ward, had only $4,300 in contributions, 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not a good time to raise money because people are having 
difficulties with the economy," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2nd District candidates, Robings was apparently in the worst financial 
shape. He had spent more than he received in donations and had $19,500 in 
unpaid debt. Schillo had more than $29,000 in unpaid debt but nearly all of 
that was covered by his loan to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4th Supervisorial District, Simi Valley Councilwoman Barbara Williamson 
was the only candidate to come close to the fund-raising of four years ago, 
when Vicky Howard was elected in a torturous race with Bill Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson raised about $36,000, but has already spent about $42,000. A second 
Simi Valley councilwoman, Judy Mikels, who is backed by incumbent Howard, has 
raised $20,000. Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery raised $14,000 but had 
spent more than $18,000. James L. Meredith did not file a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor unions and real estate developers were prominent among contributors in 
both supervisorial races. 
</P>
<P>
 The county firefighters' union gave $1,800 each to Loh and Williamson. The 
county deputy sheriff's association gave $1,800 each to Williamson and 
Schaefer, and a statewide law enforcement group gave $1,800 each to the same 
two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 A regional food and commercial workers union also gave Schaefer and Williamson 
$1,000 each. Two carpenters unions contributed $750 to Williamson, who raised 
$7,150 from unions in all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the union contributions are concerned, I don't think I have any 
more than I do private contributions, but the amounts might be more," 
Williamson said. "We're talking firefighters and we're talking sheriffs. I'm 
proud of those contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williamson and Mikels had several contributions from developers, 
Montgomery probably received the most in the 4th District -- at least $5,500 
from real estate interests for the latest seven-week reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 The H. F. Ahmanson Co., whose controversial 3,050-home Simi Hills project was 
approved in 1992 but has not yet been built, contributed $300 each to 
Williamson and Mikels. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 2nd District candidates, Schaefer's $5,350 in union contributions 
was the most. Robings, a longtime taxpayer advocate, was backed with $500 from 
the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. Loh, whose husband is a physician, received 
strong support from the medical profession. And Schillo, a financial 
consultant, got large contributions from business, including $500 each from 
John Broome of Oxnard and Leavens Ranches of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's race between White and Farley was saturated with attorney 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 28 lawyers and six judges gave to White, while 49 attorneys and one 
judge supported Farley. Nearly all of those contributions were relatively small 
-- between $100 and $200 -- although attorney Peter Goldenring of Ventura gave 
Farley $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Farley's largest contributions came from labor unions, which gave a 
total of $1,750. White got nearly as much from firefighter and peace officer 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 White also received a $2,500 loan from Bradbury's campaign fund and the 
district attorney's wife, Heidi, donated a $150 watercolor to White's auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) also donated $1,000 from his congressional 
campaign to White. 
</P>
<P>
 But White's biggest individual contribution was $1,500 from Buena High School 
teacher Phyllis Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's my sister," White said. Her daughter also gave $800 and her brother 
$250. "It helps to have a big family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other local contests on the primary ballot is the competitive -- and 
costly -- race for county superintendent of schools, where two candidates have 
spent nearly $60,000 for an office that is rarely contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed incumbent Charles Weis, who is serving out the term of retired James 
F. Cowan, reported contributions of $19,453 and expenditures of $18,747. He 
loaned himself $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Flynn, the principal of the Ventura County Juvenile Court schools, has 
accumulated $31,458 but spent $40,042. He reported outstanding debts of 
$35,240. He has contributed $1,000 to his own campaign and loaned himself 
another $24,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of five candidates for county auditor-controller filed the required 
paperwork by the Thursday deadline: current Auditor Thomas O. Mahon and 
challengers Clifford L. Wigen and William Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon, the 71-year-old appointee, leads his competitors with contributions of 
$29,730, including a personal loan of $5,000. The auditor-controller has spent 
almost $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Several top county officials are supporting Mahon, including Bradbury, who 
gave $150; Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who contributed $100; County Counsel James 
McBride, who donated $200; and hospital administrator Pierre Durand, who gave 
$200. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigen reported contributions of $25,175, all but $100 of which he loaned to 
his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker had raised $6,171, but spent $15,569. He loaned himself more than 
$6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for county clerk-recorder, one candidate is challenging incumbent 
Richard D. Dean, who raised $14,347 and had expenses of nearly $11,000 and an 
outstanding debt of $8,259. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contributors to Dean's campaign included his top assistant, Janet Bagby, who 
donated $650; California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren, who gave $100, and 
Bradbury, who contributed $150. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean's challenger, east county businessman Daniel J. Schmidt, reported about 
$10,600 in both contributions and expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt financed the bulk of his campaign himself with an $8,400 loan, 
according to his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting county Assessor Glenn E. Gray reported contributions of $14,828 -- 
including a loan to himself of almost $6,000 -- and expenditures of $12,659. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's rival, Ventura Councilman Jack Tingstrom, lagged slightly with 
contributions of $9,842 and expenses of just over $10,000.

FILLMORE TO GET SHERIFF'S SUBSTATION; LAW ENFORCEMENT: DEPUTIES HOPE PRESENCE 
WILL HELP CURB GANG ACTIVITIES.

 Ventura County sheriff's deputies are converting a former laundry room into a 
new storefront station in Fillmore to fight what they say is a growing gang 
problem in the small, agricultural town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a sleepy town, but it's quite active," said Deputy Max Pina, 
who is heading the project. "In the last few years the gang problem has been 
escalating." 
</P>
<P>
 The station, located at 647 Lemon Way, is "in the heart of gangland" and is 
expected to open in about two months, Pina said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Fillmore's first storefront, and deputies hope their constant 
presence will help curb some gang activities in the city's toughest 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore has a population of about 12,900, with about 100 known gang members, 
most of whom live or hang out in the Lemon Way area, Pina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three deputies will be assigned to patrols in the area and work out of the 
station, which is the former laundry room of the Lemon Way Condominium Owners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have mixed reactions to the idea of more deputies in their 
neighborhood. Some welcome the extra protection, while others question whether 
a storefront is necessary, saying that gang members have maintained a low 
profile lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members and taggers have already demonstrated what they think of the new 
substation. The structure is already decorated with graffiti that appeared 
after the announcement was made. The taggers were even bold enough to sign 
their nicknames on the door of the station. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Pina helped five prisoners erect a six-foot-high chain-link 
fence to keep intruders out. Pina said he gets a few inmates on weekdays from 
the county's Honor Farm in Ojai, but most of the work on the station will be 
done by volunteers from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The condominium association is leasing the site to the city of Fillmore for 
$100 a month. The deputies' salaries will come from a three-year, $329,867 
federal grant to fight gang-related crime. The city of Fillmore has put 
together matching funds to pay for other costs related to the substation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of three years, the city of Fillmore must decide whether to keep 
the substation, Fillmore officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Converting the laundry room into a storefront will involve adding new 
carpeting, a bathroom, new plumbing and wiring, Pina said. The 
8,000-square-foot structure will also be used as a community meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
 A local contractor has already offered to do a lot of the work, Pina said, and 
residents can help by painting and landscaping the station. It is essential 
that residents get involved in the project so they feel a sense of ownership, 
Pina said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the principles behind a storefront is taking the police out into the 
community and developing a positive relationship," Pina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pina said he wants to start Scout troops for boys and girls, as well as help 
teen-agers look for jobs so they stay out of trouble. He also plans to work 
with the city's code enforcement officers to assist residents in fixing up 
their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Aguilar, 22, who lives next to the substation site, said he can't wait 
for the deputies to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need it," said Aguilar, who has been awakened by gunfire and fights 
several times. "We need to check the cars every two hours because the gangs 
break the windows and take the stereos." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moses Curiel, 18, a Fillmore native, said his family hears gang members use 
their back yard and fences to hide from deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hop over the fence to get away from the cops. It really scares my 
family," Curiel said. "Fillmore used to be a pretty cool place to be at, but 
it's gotten worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Martinez, 18, said her mother used to have her sleep on the floor some 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was afraid the shots would come into the house," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosa's brother, Alfonso Martinez, said the storefront may not be needed 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good, but a little too late," said Martinez, a former gang member. "They 
should have done this four years ago, when it was really bad. Now they don't 
hang out as much as they used to, and both gangs in town are talking to each 
other again." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Hua, a store clerk at the nearby Handi Market, said she doubts the idea 
will work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's really necessary," Hua said. "When they come, usually the 
gang members are already gone." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pina predicted that residents would be grateful for the deputies' presence 
in two months, when they move into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait until summer," Pina said. "They drink more, and their tempers are 
shorter. It will be busy then."

BUSINESSES START WORK ON OWN CLEAN-AIR PLAN; ENVIRONMENT: BOOSTERS CONTEND THEY 
CAN REDUCE POLLUTION WITHOUT HARMING INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Under federal orders to reduce smog from Ventura County skies, business 
boosters have launched an effort to draft a more industry-friendly strategy 
that still satisfies clean-air standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work must be largely completed by mid-July, when the federal government 
holds a public hearing to discuss its own smog-busting plan for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,600-page federal plan, unveiled in late March, has drawn sharp criticism 
from all segments of Ventura County's business community, including farmers, 
shippers and factory owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal government's proposal, for instance, any interstate truck 
not meeting California emission standards would be allowed to stop only once in 
Ventura County. That restriction could devastate local agriculture, farmers 
said, because produce trucks need to stop at several fields and packing houses 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Another provision targeted for revision calls for each stationary source of 
air pollution -- from a smoke-spurting factory to a deep-fat fryer -- to slash 
emissions by 5% a year starting in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ventura County's existing laws have already reduced some emissions from 
industrial plants, some air quality experts doubt that the 5% target could ever 
be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have the best technology available, the only way to meet those caps is 
to cut back on production," said William Mount, deputy director of the Air 
Pollution Control District. "That's certainly onerous." 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists warn that strict standards are essential to clean up 
Ventura County's air. And they say the federal plan was written in the first 
place because local regulations failed to wipe out enough smog. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to tighten the screws on everybody," said Greg Helms, a spokesman 
for the Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara. "This region has the 
seventh-worst air quality in the country -- we've got to get going here." 
</P>
<P>
 The business community contends it can clean the air without harming industry, 
by crafting broad-based measures targeted at typical residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Most remaining air pollution comes from automobiles and other vehicles. And a 
half-cent sales tax, for instance, could fund mass transit programs to get 
people out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who stick with their automobiles might have to pay a fee of up to $10 
during each registration renewal, with the proceeds buying environment-friendly 
natural gas buses. 
</P>
<P>
 And all car owners might have to submit to a smog inspection that used 
extra-sensitive detectors to nab every last exhaust-belching vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there are less Draconian ways (than those proposed by the federal 
government) to meet the air quality standards," said Marc Charney, president of 
the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least," Charney said, "we think we can find them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Helm warned that businesses could shove too much of the responsibility 
into residents' hands. "We definitely see that the burden of improving air 
quality has to be borne by society at large," he said. "However, there's a risk 
that the oil industry will point a finger at auto drivers and say they're the 
main cause." 
</P>
<P>
 To help business come up with a plan acceptable to environmentalists, the 
economic development association and the Council on Economic Vitality have 
hired two consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope their alternative plan will protect the deep-water Port of Hueneme 
from proposed fees on smoke-belching ships. They also hope to please farmers by 
knocking out a federal proposal to limit commonly used pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 To cover a projected $150,000 in consulting fees, economic development 
association and Council on Economic Vitality officials have asked for donations 
from cities, business leaders and the county's Clean Air Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Ventura and Thousand Oaks have pledged money, the Oxnard City Council 
is scheduled to vote on the issue next week, and the business community has 
chipped in about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an attempt to evade the (federal) standards, but an attempt to 
find a more acceptable way to meet them," said Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar, who voted to spend $8,000 of city funds on the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafting a new plan that will earn local and federal approval "calls for being 
very creative," said consultant Janet Dillon, an Oxnard-based environmental 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "All groups (must) look at their own emissions and make sacrifices," Dillon 
added, "so we can clean the air while keeping our economic vitality."

SUBSCRIBERS WANT CABLE TO GET WITH THE PROGRAMS; WESTERN VENTURA: ITS PACKAGE 
HAS LACKED KEY NETWORK AFFILIATES, BUT THE COMPANY HAS BROUGHT BACK KABC AND IS 
NEGOTIATING WITH KTTV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If Jann Parker misses National Football League action this fall because his 
cable company can't make a deal with Fox television, there's going to be 
trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be very aggravated," said Parker, 61, a reluctant customer of 
Ventura's Avenue TV Cable. "I don't know exactly what I will do."  
</P>
<P>
 Like 10,000 residents of western Ventura, Parker has no choice when it comes 
to television. He either pays Avenue TV Cable each month for a service package 
that excludes the Fox Network's KTTV and the Los Angeles CBS affiliate, or his 
programs come in so fuzzy he can barely tell one network from another. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's sorry state of affairs began abruptly last Oct. 7 when Avenue TV 
Cable, unable to settle on mutually agreeable contracts, parted ways with Fox 
(KTTV Channel 11), KCBS Channel 2 and KABC Channel 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue Cable officials now say they are deep in negotiations with KTTV 
executives and expect to have the network back in the fold in time for the NFL 
season kickoff. KCBS may take a while longer to reacquire, they say.  
</P>
<P>
 KABC, meanwhile, returned to the local airwaves Wednesday after a 7 1/2-month 
hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I can watch Oprah now!" said a delighted Melissa Franklin, 38, upon 
learning of the change Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Ventura residents still could see many of their favorite CBS and ABC 
shows the past few months on the Santa Maria and Santa Barbara affiliates to 
which Avenue Cable subscribes. But until Wednesday, fans of "Wheel of Fortune," 
"Jeopardy!" and "Oprah Winfrey" -- shown locally on KABC alone -- had to make 
do without. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Western Ventura residents, however, say this is a minor annoyance compared to 
the major inconvenience of missing an entire network, night after aggravating 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could change, I would," said retired salesman Bill Nuno, 68. "There are 
so many programs I've missed that were on TV. It's really a pain in the neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Avenue TV Cable customers, Nuno has considered installing an antenna 
(terrible reception, since his house backs up to a mountain) or blowing a wad 
of cash on a satellite dish (really out of sight financially when he includes 
the cost of a descrambling box). 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment -- again, like many of his neighbors -- Nuno figures he will 
just fume. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue Cable executives say they lost about 45 customers last fall in the 
first wave of fury over losing the three stations. Since then, less than half a 
dozen residents have canceled their subscriptions, said Pamela Drake, the 
company's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she added, the irate calls keep coming from viewers addicted to such 
shows as "The Simpsons," Fox's hit prime-time soap opera "Melrose Place," and 
most especially from football fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports lovers should be somewhat placated by the deal Avenue Cable made to 
reacquire KABC: In addition to purchasing the Los Angeles ABC affiliate, it 
agreed to add ESPN II to its roster of channels available at added cost. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new station, which will be available sometime in September, carries hockey 
as well as college games, surfing and other sporting events that ESPN does not 
have time to show, Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue Cable will also keep TNT, the Family Channel and superstation TBS, 
channels added last fall to soothe customers for their losses, Drake said. TBS 
has moved to Channel 14 since KABC was restored to Channel 7 this week, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake said Avenue TV Cable does not plan to raise its rates -- basic service 
is now $16 per month -- once all three channels are restored. But customers say 
they are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet you they'll come up with some dumb excuse and make the consumer pay for 
it," Nuno said, planning on a higher bill this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 All Jann Parker knows is that somehow the NFL had better be playing in his 
living room come September, or there will be no peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife's even madder than I am," he said with a laugh. "When football is on, 
nobody calls and nobody disturbs her. If they don't have Fox, hey, I might have 
to leave my home!"

ELECTIONS / STATE SENATE; GOP CANDIDATES IN 18TH DISTRICT ARE POLES APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in next month's primary election will have little trouble 
distinguishing between the two Republican state Senate candidates battling it 
out in the district that covers western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Steve MacElvaine and Steve Decker are fiscally conservative businessmen 
who propose to slash government regulations to revitalize the California 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's pretty much where the similarities end. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine, a former San Luis Obispo supervisor, favors abortion rights and 
gun control. Decker, who runs a family owned New Jersey car dealership from his 
Santa Barbara home, is anti-abortion and supports efforts to repeal the federal 
ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 They differ on other issues as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, MacElvaine advocates placing a moratorium on the sale of 
offshore oil leases, adding that dozens of undeveloped leases now exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's plenty of opportunity for the oil companies to develop what they 
got," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Decker, on the other hand, backs additional offshore development, saying that 
Santa Barbara County receives millions of dollars in benefits from offshore oil 
drilling as well as hundreds of high-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep the door open," he said. "I never again want to see our 
country have to spend tens of billions of dollars to send troops over to the 
Middle East to protect our oil reserves over there when we have tons of 
reserves here at home." 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates will square off in the June 7 primary. Each is hoping to 
win the Republican nomination for the seat held by state Sen. Gary Hart 
(D-Santa Barbara), who is retiring. Hart's 18th District includes Ventura, 
Ojai, Santa Paula and all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The question voters will have to decide is who is the most qualified to 
compete against better-known Democrat Jack O'Connell in November. O'Connell, a 
12-year veteran of the state Assembly, has already raised more than $316,000 in 
contributions and is unopposed in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th District post has long been coveted by Republicans. Hart has held the 
seat since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican leaders say 1990 reapportionment, which shoved the district 
into conservative San Luis Obispo County, has increased the party's chances of 
grabbing the seat away from Democrats this year. The redistricting narrowed the 
voter-registration gap, leaving it 43% Democrat and 41% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a targeted race," said Bob Larkin, chairman of Ventura 
County's Republican Central Committee. "This is one of the better voter 
registrations we have in the state. I think we have a 50-50 chance of taking 
this seat." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although MacElvaine has more government experience and has been a tireless 
campaigner, Larkin said Decker has strong name recognition in Santa Barbara 
because of his activism there on water issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think both are qualified to run against O'Connell," Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine, 49, said his extensive business and government experience sets him 
apart from his opponent. The developer and operator of a mobile-home park, 
MacElvaine was elected to the San Luis Obispo Board of Supervisors in 1978 and 
served one term. In 1983, then Gov. George Deukmejian appointed him to the 
California Coastal Commission where he remained until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate said his experience in both instances taught him how to work 
with others and how to govern with an even hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was on the board in San Luis Obispo, I was the swing vote," MacElvaine 
said. "On the conservative side, I was a strong supporter of law enforcement 
and firefighters. On the liberal side, I strongly supported libraries and the 
county hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his stand on new offshore oil development, he said he agrees with 
Decker on supporting Mobil Oil's controversial "slant-drilling" proposal. The 
company wants to develop onshore oil rigs that would use special drills to tap 
into oil deposits offshore without exposing oil-carrying pipes to water. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the ability to drill down 5,000 feet, make an angle turn and then 
extract oil from underneath the ocean floor," MacElvaine said. "This could 
generate as much as $800 million in revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While he acknowledges that illegal immigration is a growing problem, 
MacElvaine said he is hesitant to support the proposed "Save Our State" 
initiative that would ban illegal immigrants from hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure it will stand up in court," he said. "We're under federal 
mandates to provide medical and educational benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 But MacElvaine said he backs Gov. Pete Wilson's lawsuit against the federal 
government demanding that it reimburse California for the cost of imprisoning 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, MacElvaine said he favors using military bases as boot camps 
for nonviolent criminals as an alternative to building costly state prisons. On 
education, he said he strongly opposes the new California Learning Assessment 
System (CLAS) test. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's crazy to be testing the psychology of a child when you should be 
teaching the basics," said MacElvaine, who has a degree in farm management from 
Cal Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate raised $38,316 in campaign contributions, including a $15,000 
personal loan, according to reports filed in March. He has also secured 
endorsements from former Rep. Bob Lagomarsino (R-Santa Barbara), the Santa 
Barbara Lincoln Club, Ventura City Council members Rosa Lee Measures and Jack 
Tingstrom as well as a host of other officials in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Decker is painting himself as an outsider in the race, emphasizing 
his role as a businessman and community activist. In 1991, he ran 
unsuccessfully for the proposed Montecito City Council and last year pulled out 
of a congressional race, citing personal and business reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Decker is best known for leading a successful campaign to tie Santa 
Barbara County into the State Water Project. Voters in 1991 approved a measure 
to import Northern California water into the drought-plagued region for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker said conservative Republican leaders persuaded him to jump into the 
state Senate race because of his community activism. In addition to reducing 
government regulations on business, he said his priority will be to find ways 
for government to work more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To help cut down on construction and operating costs, for instance, Decker has 
proposed privatizing the state's prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prison system in Texas is significantly privatized," he said. "As a 
result, they can build two prisons for every one we build." 
</P>
<P>
 He said prisons could also be turned into manufacturing centers, where 
prisoners could learn a skill and also earn money that could be used to pay 
debts, outstanding child support and victim restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of room for innovation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker said he has not read all of the details of the proposed statewide 
initiative that would ban benefits to illegal immigrants, so he has not taken a 
formal position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "But generally speaking if it goes toward eliminating the abuse of our social 
services I would go along with it," he said. "We cannot be a free lunch to the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Decker has raised $19,249 in campaign contributions, according to his most 
recent finance report. He has also been endorsed by a number of conservative 
groups, including the California Republican Assembly, the California Pro-Life 
Council, California College Republicans and the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker has criticized MacElvaine as a "career politician" who represents the 
status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. MacElvaine talks a lot about his ability to work with others," Decker 
said. "Well, I don't want to go along to get along. If I go up to Sacramento, I 
want to shake things up." 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine said his experience as a San Luis Obispo County supervisor and with 
the California Coastal Commission taught him how government works, which he 
said is an advantage. He said it also "taught me to be realistic," and to know 
when to compromise to get things accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, MacElvaine has criticized Decker for not having paid state 
income taxes since moving to Santa Barbara in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand how you can be in that position and understand the real 
problems facing this state," MacElvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker, who is also a licensed realtor, faulted government regulations and a 
bad economy on his inability to develop a 17-acre parcel he owns in Montecito. 
As a result, he has not generated enough income to pay state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've paid more than $100,000 in property taxes," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SEWER PROJECT WORK TO HALT FOR WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A weeklong sewer project that shut down two blocks of Ojai Avenue, snarling 
traffic and driving away customers of downtown merchants, will be suspended for 
the Memorial Day weekend, officials with the city and sanitary district said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Avenue should reopen to traffic from Ventura to Montgomery streets by 
late today or tonight, said W. S. Moore, Ojai's director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace a 230-foot section of a 67-year-old sewer line that runs through 
the intersection of Ojai Avenue and Signal Street, the project's contractor had 
to close a portion of both streets and detour traffic around the heart of 
Ojai's commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on Signal Street probably won't be completed until Wednesday, but 
to accommodate Memorial Day traffic the contractor plans to open the road for 
the weekend, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most significant excavation in terms of traffic disruption," said 
Eric Oltmann, general manager of the Ojai Valley Sanitary District. "It really 
has clogged the town very badly." 
</P>
<P>
 The sewer excavation is part of the Ojai Valley Sanitation District's 
$6.5-million sewer replacement project that started in August and is expected 
to be completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure and excavation of Ojai Avenue and Signal Street have virtually 
halted business for some downtown merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just terrible," said Bette Ober, owner of Pink Moment Sweets. "I keep 
thinking the sewers will be worth it, but I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the first day of the street closures, Ober had only four customers in 
her Signal Street chocolate shop. "I might as well have closed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the colored balloons she put in front of her store to attract people 
walking past the barricaded street were not enough to lure shoppers past the 
tractors and heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gem Quest has a 20% off construction sale sign in the window," Ober said of 
the neighboring jewelry store. "But who can see it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meg Easling, owner of Gem Quest, said business is so slow she started joking 
about ways to attract customers. "We were going to start a rumor that there was 
a gem find in the middle of the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Easling said her sales have dropped 50% during the week's sewer construction. 
"But our sewer was bad," she acknowledged. "It needed to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben's restaurant manager, Chris Patino, said the tiny restaurant has also 
been adversely affected during the road closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been loosing $200 a day," Patino said. "I haven't made a complaint, but 
they should have been working at night (instead of) the daytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman Construction received only four complaints this week, said Maurya Foy, 
project coordinator for the contractor. All were from business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's been real cooperative," she said. "(But) I'm sure they would 
rather we're not out there working." TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY WANTS TO KEEP OLD BUILDING'S GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though there are plans to tear down the historic Peirano building, 
Ventura does not need to return the $100,000 grant it received to preserve the 
old grocery, Ventura's mayor wrote in a May 23 letter to the state Office of 
Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "No person or group holds the exclusive high moral ground on this issue," 
Mayor Tom Buford wrote."Given the role your office plays in such matters, I 
believe a more responsible approach would be to investigate all views before 
coming to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials demanded their money back in a letter they sent to Ventura 
earlier this month, writing that "this office cannot support a proposal that 
calls for demolition of a significant historic resource such as the Peirano 
Market."  
</P>
<P>
 The state agency gave the city the grant seven years ago to help it buy and 
preserve Nick Peirano's aging Italian market on Main Street downtown. Built in 
1877, the neighborhood landmark still sports murals on its west wall, 
advertising Borax laundry detergent and Ghirardelli chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted in March to sell the building to Ventura Realty for 
$75,000 to $100,000, relieving the city of a site that would cost about 
$430,000 to restore to current seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Realty -- which is still in negotiations with the city -- plans to 
keep the front and the west side of the city's oldest brick building, while 
knocking down the rest to expose a Spanish laundry underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to state officials, Buford wrote that they had misjudged the 
situation by assuming that the grocery held more historical import than the 
lavanderia. He also added that they overlooked a 1991 law which gives Ventura 
the discretion on how to apply the state grant. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials were not available for comment Thursday. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An openly gay civilian employee at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, 
who alleged had been subjected to harassment because of his sexuality, settled 
his discrimination complaint against the Navy on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Swann, 36, accepted the terms of an undisclosed cash settlement of 
his federal complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charging 
that the Navy had violated the federal Rehabilitation Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say that I am pleased with this settlement and that I believe this deal 
has made me whole again," said Swann, a Port Hueneme resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the settlement, negotiated by the American Civil Liberties Union, 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-year base employee and a decorated former Marine Corps sergeant, Swann 
voluntarily left his position last June as a program analyst in the Strike 
Systems Department after being allegedly harassed over his sexual orientation 
and because of his support for lifting the Navy's ban against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, Swann agreed to be relocated from the Strike 
Systems Department to the base comptroller's office where he will work as a 
management analyst. Swann, who returned to the base in February, retained his 
civil service rank, where he earns between $35,300 to $47,200 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy spokesman Alan Alpers said base officials were pleased to have settled 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy that we were able to reach a mutual settlement that is apparently 
beneficial to both parties," Alpers said. "We're happy to have Mr. Swann at 
work and happy he's agreed to settle the case." J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 45-DAY BAN OKD ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to prevent a possible influx of adult businesses, the Camarillo City 
Council has unanimously approved a 45-day moratorium on processing permits for 
such enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty.Robert Flandrick said the moratorium will give Camarillo's legal 
staff time to update a city ordinance so that it is in compliance with recent 
federal court decisions dealing with the authority of cities to regulate 
adult-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue surfaced in Camarillo recently after several individuals asked city 
staff about zoning regulations for establishing adult bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Flandrick warned the council that the 45-day moratorium may not provide 
adequate time to study the complicated issue and said the city may need to 
extend the ban for as much as a year or more when it expires in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's current ordinance permits the news-rack sale of adult-oriented 
publications and the operation of adult-oriented businesses if they have a 
valid city-issued conditional-use permit and are located at least 500 feet away 
from residential zones or businesses that hold alcoholic beverage licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also requires that adult business be located 1,000 feet away 
from any church, school or other previously established adult-oriented business 
in the city. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MISSING HOSPITAL PATIENT IS FOUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He was scratched up and hungry, but Camarillo State Hospital patient Scott 
Tipton was otherwise unharmed after spending four days wandering in the farm 
fields of Camarillo, hospital officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipton, who is deaf and has a limited ability to communicate, left the 
hospital grounds Sunday night and was apparently lost in the hills and farm 
fields until he pounded on the door of a house three miles from the hospital, 
according to a Ventura County Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowner called the Sheriff's Department about 1:30 p.m. Thursday and the 
responding deputies recognized Tipton from photos that were distributed by the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very fortunate to have found him," said Myron Dimmett, a hospital 
spokesman. "He appears to be OK. When we found him he indicated that he was 
very hungry and wanted some candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Dimmett said he did not know where Tipton had been during the days he was 
missing, but he assumed that he had been wandering in the rugged area between 
the hospital and Pancho Road, where he was found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just glad he's back safely," Dimmett said. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; ATTORNEY SAYS SUIT WAS FILED TOO LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawsuit against the developer of a housing subdivision built atop an 
abandoned oil waste dump was filed too late for a homeowner to receive damages 
for loss of property value, the developer's attorney argued in court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Christopher P. Bisgaard, who represents Oxnard Shores Co., asked a 
Ventura County Superior Court judge to dismiss a suit filed by Steven 
Blanchard, a homewoner at the Oxnard Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blanchard's lawyer told the judge his client is entitled to damages. 
Attorney Lawrence M. Schulner also asked the judge to reverse part of a jury's 
February verdict and allow two other homeowners to seek damages in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in February found that the developer was negligent for selling property 
atop the former waste dump, but it ruled that the negligence did not damage the 
property values of four of five homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard was the lone homewoner awarded damages, which are to be determined 
by a separate jury if Judge Melinda Johnson does not dismiss his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she would issue a written ruling early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, the biggest civil matter in county history, was filed in 1987 by 175 
residents of the 100-home development. All but the remaining five defendants -- 
representing three families -- accepted an undisclosed out-of-court settlement 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisgaard said any claims against the developer over the waste dump should have 
been filed within 10 years after the subdivision was constructed. The 1987 suit 
came 21 years after the fact, Bisgaard said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its decision, the jury found no willful misconduct or fraudulent 
concealment on the part of the developer, necessary conditions for the statute 
of limitations to be lifted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard said he does not expect a favorable ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always the appeals courts, and I feel that that is where we're 
headed," he said. "What's happening here is not right. Somebody did something 
wrong and, instead of giving us restitution, they are spending millions of 
dollars trying to fight us." DWAYNE BRAY

GRANT TO HELP FIRMS IN QUAKE RECOVERY

<P>
 Ventura County businesses will get a $760,000 boost from the U.S. government 
to help recover from the Jan. 17 earthquake and plan for future economic 
development, U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Thousand Oaks) announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Commerce has agreed to grant the money to Ventura 
County to help stabilize and strengthen businesses that were shaken by the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the grant is to help Ventura County in its efforts to get 
individuals who lost their jobs back to work, assist businesses in getting back 
into operation and retain businesses that are experiencing negative economic 
problems" due to the quake, Beilenson said in a prepared statement.  
</P>
<P>
 The money will pay to hire earthquake recovery coordinators to help businesses 
that lost income due to the earthquake. It also will be used to draft a plan 
for economic recovery and future development, said Susan Little, a spokeswoman 
for Beilenson's office. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; METHAMPHETAMINE SUSPECTS ARRESTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Narcotics detectives have arrested another suspected methamphetamine dealer in 
a fast-growing chain of cases in Thousand Oaks involving street sales of a drug 
known as "speed." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all we're hearing about, methamphetamine in T.O.," said Sgt. Gary 
Pentis of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. "It's been just kind of an 
explosion of information for us concerning people dealing it and using it." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on tips from neighbors and suspected dealers already under arrest, 
detectives began watching the house of Geoff Wilson, 34, in the 1000 block of 
Whitecliff Street in Thousand Oaks, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 9 p.m. Wednesday, detectives saw Wilson conducting what they believed 
was a drug deal in the carport of the Pavillion Apartments, Pentis said. When 
they moved in, Wilson ran through the complex, jumping over several walls with 
detectives on his heels. At one point, he threw a bag of methamphetamine into 
the bushes, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives caught Wilson and searched his home, finding 44 bags of 
methamphetamine weighing from a 16th to an 8th of an ounce and worth $7,000 
total, he said. They also seized $1,000 in cash, a set of scales and packaging 
materials and written records of drug deals, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives also arrested Malcolm Boots, 36, of Thousand Oaks on suspicion of 
possessing methamphetamine after he apparently bought some of the drug from 
Wilson, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the phone rang during the search, a detective answered posing as a dealer 
and invited the caller to come over to pick up some of the drug, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Tracy, 37, of Thousand Oaks was arrested on suspicion of being under 
the influence of methamphetamine when she showed up at the door with dilated 
pupils, an accelerated pulse rate and other signs of drug use, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were booked into the East Valley jail. Boots was released, and Tracy 
was being held Thursday in lieu of $5,000 bond. No information was available on 
Wilson's bail status. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; '3 STRIKES' DEFENDANT PLEADS NOT GUILTY

<P>
 A three-time convicted robber facing trial as Ventura County's first defendant 
under the new "three strikes" law pleaded not guilty Thursday to 10 felony 
counts of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. set a July 11 trial for Henry 
Diaz, 40, of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diaz's lawyer said he will file motions asking that his client not be 
charged under the law because it violates his constitutional rights. Campbell 
said he will hear those arguments on June 24. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the three strikes law, Diaz faces a mandatory sentence of 
25 years to life in prison. The statute prescribes such a sentence for anyone 
with two prior serious or felony convictions who commits a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Simi Valley SWAT team and narcotics detectives raided Diaz's 
home March 22 and found the suspect in bed with a 13-year-old girl. Diaz has 
admitted to having a sexual relationship with the girl, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother told authorities she was suspicious of her daughter's 
relationship with Diaz, but that the girl denied sexual involvement with him. 
She has since told police that she did have a relationship with Diaz, according 
to court testimony. DWAYNE BRAY

<P>
 Sage Ranch Park, Simi Valley's first overnight campground, will open its 
rustic campsites for the first time Saturday, just in time for the three-day 
Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have campers for each night," said Rorie Skei, an official with the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, which is operating the new 
park."It's a primitive campground, but it's a lovely setting." 
</P>
<P>
 The 625-acre park is on the eastern edge of the Ventura County line, near 
Woolsey and Black Canyon roads. It offers 10 campsites with picnic tables and 
no-flush toilets, as well as a four-mile trail open to hikers, mountain bikers 
and equestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 The park was officially opened last Saturday, but campsite reservations were 
not available until this weekend, Skei said.

 "There are some magnificent views of the Simi Valley area," said Don E. Hunt, 
assistant general manager of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 On a clear day, hikers and campers can see the Channel Islands and the San 
Fernando Valley from the park's hill-top venue. "You've got almost a 360-degree 
view up there," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, once a cattle and citrus ranch, offers a variety of animal and plant 
life, as well as unique geological features that make if different from other 
parks in Ventura County, Hunt said.

CALTRANS UNVEILS PLAN TO EXTEND SIMI FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans has unveiled a plan to extend the Simi Valley Freeway through 
Moorpark, splitting a planned housing development in half and cutting off an 
older neighborhood from the rest of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The highway extension, which would separate north Moorpark from the city's 
south side, may not be built for another 20 years. However, California 
Department of Transportation engineers said they have already mapped out the 
plan to identify where the road could be located. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we won't do anything for 20 years," said Sohan Basra, the Caltrans 
transportation engineer working on the project. "But we have to protect our 
right of way before we are able to move ahead on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, unveiled Wednesday at the Moorpark City Council meeting, calls for 
extending the Simi Valley Freeway west from the recently completed connector 
with the Moorpark Freeway. The extension would run in a straight line through 
Moorpark, north of Casey Road, and turn south slightly after Gabbert Road and 
link up with Los Angeles Avenue near Butter Creek Road on the west end of the 
city.  
</P>
<P>
 The highway will divide a proposed 640-unit housing development being planned 
by the Levy Co. for 240 acres north of Poindexter Avenue. The proposed route 
would also go through a residential neighborhood along Walnut Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's this going to do to property values?" asked Bob Crockford, who lives 
on Walnut Canyon Road north of the area where the highway would cross. "If it 
was my house down there I would be worried. These things have a way of being 
set in concrete early on, so people better do something now if they don't like 
what they see." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents living on the north side of town want Caltrans to consider 
moving the road farther north and avoid cutting through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be looking at other options," said James Hartley, who also lives 
in north Moorpark near Gabbert Road. "It's like they simply drew a straight 
line and they then locked into the idea of splitting the community in half." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more dramatic design features of the proposed highway is a giant 
cloverleaf interchange between the Moorpark Freeway and the Simi Valley Freeway 
extension.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing that concerns me a lot about this plan," said Moorpark City 
Councilman John Wozniak. "You'd be able to see that cloverleaf from all over 
the city." Wozniak said he would like Caltrans to provide a range of 
alternative designs to connect the freeways. He is also asking local residents 
to look at Caltrans' design maps and make their concerns known to the City 
Council as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it's early in the process," Wozniak said. "This might be 30 years 
down the line. I don't even know why they're spending money on this right now. 
There are plenty of other projects in the county that would seem much more 
urgent, but if they're asking for comments now we better put our two cents in 
or risk not getting a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, said the planned highway extension is not on the list of the top 15 
highway projects planned through the year 2023.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Caltrans has not done cost estimates on the project or traffic 
demand surveys to determine if the extension is even needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely don't have the money right now," Basra said. "And we don't know 
if the traffic demands for the area will justify building the highway. That's 
what we will determine over the next couple of years." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Maps of Caltrans' proposed extension of the Simi Valley Freeway are on display 
in the City Council chambers at Moorpark City Hall, 799 Moorpark Ave. For more 
information, call 529-6864.

ARTS PLAZA PARTS WAYS WITH THEATER COMPANY; THOUSAND OAKS: A PASADENA GROUP WAS 
TO HAVE PUT ON SIX MUSICALS. AN ARIZONA ORGANIZATION IS RECOMMENDED AS A 
SUBSTITUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks theater commissioners have scrapped plans to bring a series of 
offbeat musicals to the Civic Arts Plaza because the group scheduled to present 
the shows appears on the verge of financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corporation of America, based in Pasadena, had been set to bring six 
modern musicals to the 1,800-seat auditorium -- shows like a boogie-woogie 
version of the opera "The Mikado" or a song-and-dance take on James Michener's 
novel "Sayonara." 
</P>
<P>
 But, citing financial disarray, TCA last week abruptly canceled a play series 
in Santa Barbara and pulled out of contracts with theaters in Fresno and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to entrust a key bloc of programming to the company, Thousand Oaks' 
theater commissioners on Wednesday agreed to halt negotiations with TCA and 
seek alternative programming to fill the 12 weeks designated for splashy 
musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, they backed out of several contracts (in Santa Barbara and 
elsewhere) and when we asked them about our schedule, they said they couldn't 
give us an answer for 60 days," said Commissioner Harry Selvin, explaining his 
recommendation to drop TCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was time to move on," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Selvin has recommended Theater League, based in Phoenix, Ariz., as the new 
company to anchor the Civic Arts Plaza's inaugural season. The group takes 
mainstream musicals on national tours, including frequent stops in the Pasadena 
Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Thousand Oaks season, Theater League will propose one-week runs of 
"The Sound of Music" with Marie Osmond and "Hello, Dolly" with Carol Channing, 
with both shows coming to the Civic Arts Plaza during national tours. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will also develop a version of "42nd Street" specifically for 
Thousand Oaks, associate producer Joan Simmons said, and may come up with a 
fourth show as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Theater League plans just four weeks of programming, Thousand Oaks 
commissioners must scramble to fill the many dates that had been reserved for 
TCA's musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rush, but we do have ample time to fill the void," Selvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a veteran of the entertainment industry, Thousand Oaks theater director Tom 
Mitze said he had come to expect -- although not welcome -- the constant 
scramble to book shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing you can always say about programming is that it's subject to 
change," Mitze said. "Once we start our season, the audience will tell us what 
they want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Theater League was the commission's second choice for presenting 
musicals in the Civic Arts Plaza, officials from both the city and the group 
said they're looking forward to next season, which starts with the grand 
opening in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and I both know that we can't always be the first choice," Simmons said. 
"Thank goodness there's such a thing as a second choice. I worked as a casting 
director for many years, and I know that sometimes, the second choice is the 
best choice."

WHERE NO PUN IS LEFT UNSTONED; MOVIE REVIEW: 'THE FLINTSTONES' SUCCEEDS AT 
BEING CARTOONISH. BUT DO THREE DOZEN WRITERS MAKE FOR A GOOD SCRIPT? DON'T TAKE 
IT FOR GRANITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Welcome to Bedrock, a town proud of being "First With Fire." The locals eat at 
Roc Donald's ("Over 18 Dozen Sold"), watch George Lucas' "Tar Wars" at the 
drive-in, get their gas at the Chevrock station and their information via the 
Cave News Network. 
</P>
<P>
 You were expecting maybe "Middlemarch"? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else people say about "The Flintstones," no one will claim that a 
chance to make a truly great motion picture was frittered away here. A 
live-action cartoon in every sense of the word, this re-creation of the 
long-running television series about suburban life in 2,000,000 B.C. has been 
carefully designed to be as bright and insubstantial as a child's toy balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 Like "The Addams Family" before it, this is one of those clever, lively and 
ultimately wearying pieces of showy Hollywood machinery where a glut of 
creativity has gone into the visuals with only scraps left over for the plot 
and the dialogue. But then, given its source material, what more could anyone 
have expected? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, someone must have at least hoped for more, because press reports 
indicate that somewhere between 32 and 35 writers ("almost as many people as 
signed the Declaration of Independence," mocked Daily Variety) had a hand in 
the script. It was finally credited to Tom S. Parker & Jim Jennewein and Steven 
E. de Souza, but any piece of writing where the most notable words are 
"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!" is not going to be up for any Writers Guild awards any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 That, as anyone who watched the 1960s TV series remembers, is the war cry of 
Fred Flintstone (John Goodman), devoted family man, operator of a Bronto-crane 
at the Slate & Company quarry and mainstay of the Water Buffalos bowling team. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Fred (who both here and in the cartoon strongly resembles Jackie 
Gleason in "The Honeymooners") likes to say, "In my cave, I reign supreme," 
really his wife, Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins), calls the shots. And best friends 
and neighbors Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) and Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) also 
have sizable places in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing the film that bears his family name has done is to whimsically 
imagine and create a world where everything, up to and apparently including 
Fred's head, is made from stone. Production designer William Sandell, "Jurassic 
Park" special-effects supervisor Michael Lantieri and the entire production 
team have done splendid work in this area, turning Bedrock into a shiny place 
that always diverts the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fun are a host of animatronic beasties designed by Jim Henson's Creature 
Shop to do everyday tasks, like a lobster lawn mower, a woolly mammoth shower 
and something called a pigasaurus that replaces the TV series' vulture as a 
heavy-breathing garbage disposal unit. 
</P>
<P>
 If these devices are unexpected, "The Flintstones" plot devices are less so. 
The main idea, identical to the one that powers "The Hudsucker Proxy," has 
Slate & Co. evil-doers Cliff Vandercave and Sharon Stone (Kyle MacLachlan and 
Halle Berry) searching for "an ignorant stooge" to help them fleece the firm. 
Fred is obviously their man. But his bogus elevation to vice president turns 
him into a dreadful snob and causes a rift between the Flintstones and the 
Rubbles. From such acorns do $45-million films grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Though "The Flintstones" won't disappoint those who've been looking forward to 
seeing the venerable cartoon made human, its pleasures are not substantial or 
lasting enough to convince those who lean toward thinking it all sounds rather 
feeble. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of Brian Levant, whose most notable previous credit was 
"Beethoven," the acting in the movie, from star Goodman to Elizabeth Taylor's 
well-publicized cameo, is, not surprisingly, cartoonish, with svelte and sexy 
villains Berry and MacLachlan registering best, as villains often do in 
animation. 
</P>
<P>
 And even the gaudy and amusing production design, winning though it is, can 
hold one fascinated for only so long. Even at a lean 92 minutes, "The 
Flintstones" eventually makes you want to change the channel and see what else 
is on. 
</P>

 Barker Denies Allegations: Game show host Bob Barker, 70, on Thursday denied 
allegations that he sexually harassed a model from "The Price Is Right," but 
acknowledged he did have intermittent consensual sex with her after his wife 
died. Barker called the conference as a pre-emptive strike to what he said is a 
threatened lawsuit by Dian Parkinson, who has reportedly claimed he coerced her 
into having sex, and requested an $8-million settlement. Game show producer 
Jonathan Goodson said he also is to be named in the threatened suit. Goodson 
called the move "an $8-million shakedown" and said he has "complete confidence 
in (Barker's) character, judgment and truthfulness."

 'Cop' Starts Big Weekend: Eddie Murphy's "Beverly Hills Cop III," which had a

unspectacular box-office business. Hollywood sources on Thursday could not 
predict what the film's $1.84-million gross (from 2,475 prints) would bode for 
the important upcoming Memorial Day holiday weekend, since the opening was 
neither spectacular nor disappointing. "Cop's" expected competition over the 
usually big holiday moviegoing weekend: "The Flintstones," which opens today, 
and last weekend's opener, "Maverick," which on Wednesday did $1.4 million in 
ticket sales, second only to "Cop." . . . Meanwhile, Murphy fans will want to

MOVIE REVIEW ; 'IMPROPER CONDUCT' DEFTLY SPINS PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER

 "Improper Conduct" is a nifty modest-budget psychological thriller pegged to 
the timely issue of sexual harassment. It is the 15th film by the enterprising 
Dr. Jag Mundhra who once operated Culver City's venerable, long-gone Meralta 
Theater as a much-missed showcase for Indian cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 "Improper Conduct" is the first of Mundhra's films to be released 
theatrically, his previous efforts having been contracted to go straight to 
video. This movie is the confident work of an efficient filmmaker who knows the 
ropes.

newly hired by an L.A. advertising agency, where owner Stuart Whitman has just 
appointed son-in-law John Laughlin as head of marketing. Laughlin immediately 
starts hitting upon Welch with increasing persistence and menacing crudeness, 
refusing to take no for an answer. Welch's visiting sister, Lee Anne Beaman, a 
feminist law student, persuades her to hire Beaman's lawyer friend Steven Bauer 
to file suit against Laughlin. Bauer feels sure that his brisk assistant Nia 
Peeples won't have any trouble lining up other women Laughlin has pestered; 
besides, Welch has one witness, the office's mail-room worker (Everette Lamar), 
a gutsy young gay man. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to this point "Improper Conduct" plays like a crisp, decently made TV 
movie, whereupon it veers unexpectedly and effectively in an entirely different 
direction. Having pointed up the pitfalls of women trying to fight back against 
sexual harassment, Mundhra and writer Carl Austin deftly move the film from 
courtroom drama to erotic suspense. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically adroit, "Improper Conduct" is notable for its array of 
well-defined, well-acted roles.  
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It contains considerable 
above-the-waist female nudity, some sex scenes, coarse language, some violence.

MOVIE REVIEW ; BETH B.'S 'SMALL BODIES' A CAPTIVATING, COMPLEX WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Two Small Bodies," a thoroughly captivating film adaptation of Neal Bell's 
play, seemingly is simplicity itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A trench-coated police detective (Fred Ward) comes to a suburban house to 
interrogate a single mother (Suzy Amis) on the disappearance of her two young 
children. Very early on it's clear that Ward's Lt. Brann believes that Amis' 
Eileen Maloney, estranged from her husband, has murdered her kids -- and that 
Brann, who speaks only with love of his own two children, will quickly become 
obsessed with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two Small Bodies" allows its stars to shine in far-ranging, deeply probing 
characterizations of the kind that actors all too rarely get to play on the 
screen, even those as talented as Ward and Amis. 
</P>
<P>
 Brann and Maloney's ensuing battle of wits yields an amazing thicket of 
thoughts, emotions and evolving perceptions, and they have been elucidated with 
an unsettling thoroughness by the veteran independent filmmaker known as Beth 
B. Indeed, Beth B., who collaborated on the screenplay with Bell as well as 
directed the film, is ideal for this assignment. Such earlier films as "Vortex" 
(1983) and "Black Box" (1978), made with her husband, Scott B., have been 
concerned with the abuse of power, both political and sexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Worn and pale when we first meet her, Eileen, a strip joint hostess, reminds 
us of Meryl Streep's mother of a missing child in Fred Schepisi's "A Cry in the 
Dark" in that she seems simply weary rather than heartbroken or distraught, 
which is how mothers are supposed to act in such circumstances. (It is 
possible, after all, for a mother to be a grudging, reluctant parent without 
being a child killer.) 
</P>
<P>
 Right off her aura of cool resignation throws Brann, a sexy ultra-macho type 
with a traditional view of women's roles as a wife and mother. His relationship 
with Eileen teeters like a seesaw, as the impact of his menace wavers as Eileen 
appears to gather strength, acquiring an increasingly blunt, hard edge, seeming 
to agree with much of what he has to say about her. 
</P>
<P>
 Through this endless parrying much emerges. First, we find ourselves not quite 
so quick to believe that Eileen may in fact be guilty of infanticide, and then 
we start wondering about Lt. Brann. How do we know he really is a cop? Could he 
be the killer of the children himself? -- if they are in fact dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspense, in turn, triggers paradox: Could a man as sexually dominant as 
Brann, a man who sees himself as a good guy, be finding himself tantalized by 
the prospect of yielding to what he sees as the embodiment of evil? And then 
there is the role of illusion, seemingly so much more crucial to men than to 
women, who constantly find themselves in situations where they feel that they 
must pretend to be other than what they are to men, many of whom even today 
still see women as either madonnas or whores. Illusion, in fact, battles with 
truth throughout "Two Small Bodies," which is so compelling that it never once 
seems a filmed play. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It contains blunt language, as well 
as complex and menacing adult themes.

MUSIC REVIEW; ROMEROS RETURN TO AMBASSADOR WITH SPANISH-FLAVORED PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Romeros these days remarkably encompass three generations of guitarists -- 
father Celedonio, sons Pepe and Celin, and grandson Celino. The popular 
quartet's ninth visit to Ambassador Auditorium brought out a large and happy 
following Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concert got off to a slow start and, though always competent and 
pleasing, turned out to be only intermittently engaging thereafter. This was 
partly due to the program, which, to these ears, spoke a little too insistently 
in a Spanish accent. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the departure of Angel in 1990, and the substitution of Celino in his 
place, has left Pepe as the only true virtuoso in the group, or at least he was 
the only one on this occasion to regularly display the instrumental charisma we 
associate with that term. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet began with three inconsequential dances from 
Praetorius"'Terpischore," and Pepe and Celino continued with Sor's 
"L'encouragement," a by-the-book set of variations on a tune of organ-grinder 
inanity. Celino followed with Tarrega's "Capricho arabe," and poor intonation 
and memory lapses brought this down. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained, then, for Pepe to get things going, and this he did with 
Tarrega's "Gran jota." 
</P>
<P>
 Quartet performances of Boccherini's "Introduction and Fandango" and Turina's 
"La oracion del torero" proved tepid and tentative, but Falla's "Miller's 
Dance" and "Ritual Fire Dance" showed both more poise and vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 On his own, Celin revealed a soft touch and musical sensitivity in Albeniz's 
"Rumores de la Caleta" and two preludes by Villa-Lobos. Eighty-one-year-old 
Celedonio gave jaunty, fluent readings of two of his own preludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuneful selections from Jeronimo Jimenez's zarzuela "La boda de Luis Alonso," 
Celedonio's "Malaguenas" and an incandescent flamenco improvisation wound 
things up buoyantly and forcefully. TIMOTHY MANGAN

ART REVIEWS; LUKAS' ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO PLAYHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The experience of art is profoundly hierarchical, with the object helpless 
before the gaze of the viewer and the viewer subject to the whims of the 
artist. But Emil Lukas foils such logic. In new work at Thomas Solomon's 
Garage, he continues to insist upon alternative scenarios, reversible relations 
and perpetually unfinished narratives. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no single way to read his art. Everything is multiple, like a hall of 
mirrors wherein a single form endlessly reverberates. Paintings are lined up in 
a row, then flipped around to reveal what's usually hidden to view. Or they're 
neatly stacked only to be unstacked, thereby eluding all structures, formulas 
and premeditated effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas' imagery is perhaps too amorphous to merit the term. His surfaces are 
blistered with paint, smeared with maggots, bisected by fine wires, smothered 
by filmy sheets of plastic and dappled with trout eggs, as golden as the sun. 
That they allude to cycles of decay and regeneration tallies with the artist's 
broader philosophy. Here, nothing is static and no truth fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas, however, gets sidetracked in the show's title piece. "When Limbs Rub" 
sprawls elegantly across the floor -- in large pieces of scarred and blackened 
wood scraped raw where they are joined to one another. That the formal 
structure is no longer in flux is disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is staid, the central metaphor forced. Lukas is more successful 
when he allows the viewer to coax forth the metaphors -- or not. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thomas Solomon's Garage, 928 N. Fairfax Ave., (213) 654-4731, through 
Saturday. An Academic Exercise: Fran Murphy's audacity is remarkable. At Sherry 
Frumkin Gallery, the Seattle-based artist takes on the intertwined histories of 
photography and painting, the battle of the sexes and comparative religion, 
sometimes in a single image. That the work should fail is perhaps inevitable, 
considering the morass of aesthetic, philosophical and psycho-sexual conundrums 
Murphy has invented for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 What's lamentable is that the failure itself isn't more interesting. The 
artist begins with scratched, bent, stained and otherwise manipulated 
photographic negatives. These are blown up and mounted on panel, the surfaces 
covered with up to two dozen layers of glaze. Color is trapped between the 
layers, creating an effect somewhere between painting and photography. 
</P>
<P>
 This experiment mimics those common in photographic practice of the 1970s. 
Yet, even the first time around such innovations made for rather banal images. 
</P>
<P>
 For subject matter, Murphy goes back further, to the sentimental, allegorical 
and more than occasionally gratuitous themes favored in the mid-19th-Century 
Pictorealists. Murphy offers "Earth Conceiving the Vault of Heaven," a topless 
woman with stars spilling onto her luxuriant locks; "Andromeda Re-Enacting the 
Origin of the Milky Way," a nude woman with shackled arms, a blacked-out face 
and breasts gushing dark milk; and the "Anatomy of Creation," a huge cruciform 
panel, wherein an image of Pygmalion fashioning the nude Galatea is sandwiched 
between God creating Adam. 
</P>
<P>
 The brushy edges of the prints, the aggressively aged surfaces and the cast of 
characters are surprisingly familiar. Murphy's project is rather close to that 
of well-known photographer Joel-Peter Witkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Witkin fearlessly transcends the border of taste, commanding attention 
on that count alone, Murphy is altogether sincere. Sidestepping camp, 
grotesquerie or even a modicum of self-consciousness, he indulges in an 
academic exercise. 
</P>
<P>

FAMILY; MANHATTAN TRANSFER ADDS LIFE TO 'TUBA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chances are that if you went to school before the arts were hacked out of the 
budget, you whiled away an easy hour in grade school being introduced to 
orchestral music through a scratchy vinyl recording of "Tubby the Tuba." 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the endearing, "fat little tuba" who conquers self-doubt when he 
learns that the orchestra needs his "oom-pah, oom-pah"? 
</P>
<P>
 Performed the world over since 1942, Tubby has been narrated by big names from 
Danny Kaye to Carol Channing. In its latest incarnation, one of the world's 
great jazz quartets turns a children's classic into rediscovered treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Manhattan Transfer Meets Tubby the Tuba," a recent release from Summit 
Records, includes all four of the Tubby stories, written by Paul Tripp and 
composed by George Kleinsinger from 1942 on. The sequels to the original found 
Tubby running away to the circus, joining a marching band and jamming with a 
jazz band -- the only time you'll hear the Transfer's signature harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, however. There's plenty to like on this sweet album, from the 
expressiveness of the Naples Philharmonic Orchestra and tuba soloist Tommy 
Johnson, to the comic characterizations and vocal solos by Transfer members -- 
catch Alan Paul's deep-voiced Bullfrog. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, the material isn't compromised with contemporary attitude or updated 
references. Instead, listeners are treated, as intended, to the sweep, drive 
and bounce of the orchestra and gentle stories with messages for both heart and 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Manhattan Transfer Meets Tubby the Tuba," Summit Records. Available at 
major record retail stores, or call Summit Records at (602) 838-3461. CD: 
$11.99; cassette: $9.44. Concert Mountain: Big deal roller-coaster thrills and 
rowdy rap and rock concerts have given Six Flags Magic Mountain a reputation 
for being more teen-oriented than tot-friendly, but this summer families are 
obviously the focus as the park introduces its new "Kids Concert Series" in 
June, featuring some of the hottest names to entertain the crayon crowd: 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; AN INVASION OF WWII VIDEOS ON TAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look for the interest in old World War II movies to skyrocket in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration is the celebration of the 50th anniversary of D-day, the 
Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Home-video retailers will be 
showcasing classic war movies to capitalize both on the media attention and the 
Father's Day's gift potential. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape that's getting the most attention is FoxVideo's "The Longest Day," 
which just came out for the first time in a colorized version -- priced at $25 
and featuring some Movietone newsreel footage of the invasion. This 1962 movie, 
probably the most elaborate war epic ever filmed, actually works better in 
color -- adding grandeur that's missing from the black-and-white version. It 
includes nearly every male star of that era -- from John Wayne and Robert 
Mitchum to Sal Mineo. 
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo also repackaged two other movies. One is another first-rate but less 
heralded film about the Normandy invasion, "D-Day The Sixth of June," made in 
1956 and starring Robert Taylor. Priced at $15, it also includes newsreel 
footage. The other is 1970's "Patton," featuring George C. Scott's 
Oscar-winning performance in the title role, at $30. 
</P>
<P>
 The hidden gem in this repackaged collection is "Twelve O'Clock High," about 
American pilots in England during World War II. War-movie buffs love this 1949 
film, which has been hard to find in recent years. It stars Gregory Peck. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Tapes 
</P>
<P>
 As you might expect, there are some Jackie Onassis videos on the way. Turner 
Home Entertainment, which markets CNN footage, is first out of the box with a 
video homage to the late First Lady -- "Jackie: A Life of Dignity" (Turner, 
$20). You can order by mail, (800) 799-7676, or wait until it shows up in 
stores in about a month. Turner is an old hand at rush-releasing tapes. A few 
weeks ago, it marketed "Richard Nixon: A Retrospective" just after he died, for 
$20, but through mail order only -- that same 800 number. 
</P>
<P>
 Onassis' death spurred New Horizons Video to change the release date of "A 
Woman Named Jackie," the 1992 ABC miniseries starring Roma Downey in the title 
role. Originally scheduled for July 20, it's now coming out June 15. 
Surprisingly, this three-tape set isn't bargain-priced for the sales market but 
will be available as a rental only.  
</P>
<P>
 ABC Video, which rushed out a tape about Nixon, has no plans to do the same 
with Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 Father's Day Tapes 
</P>
<P>
 Sports videos on the market for Father's Day: A hot one for golfing dads is 
Monarch's "Highlights of the 1994 Masters," due June 8 at $13, including 
exclusive footage and interviews. . . . Though he's no longer with the team, 
Dallas Cowboys' fans will appreciate the glowing portrait of the notorious 
ex-coach in "The Jimmy Johnson Story," focusing on his five years with Super 
Bowl champs. Out on June 7, $20 from PolyGram. . . . For the tennis fan who's 
also into sports-blooper bits, "Tennis' Greatest Volleys and Follies" features 
some good John McEnroe footage. For $20 from LIVE. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Moore narrates the excellent biography "Audrey Hepburn Remembered," 
originally aired last fall on PBS. For $20 from MPI, (800) 323-0442, it came 
out Wednesday. . . . Fascinating four-volume set, "Lost Civilizations," from 
National Geographic for $70. Included are tapes about Egypt and Italy's Mt. 
Vesuvius, but the best of the lot is "Lost Kingdoms of the Maya." . . . Great 
swing drummer Gene Krupa is profiled in "Jazz Legend Gene Krupa," narrated by 
Steve Allen. Includes some interesting old clips of Krupa in action. For $40 
from DCI, (800) 628-1528. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New 
</P>
<P>
 "The Piano" (LIVE). In one of last year's most acclaimed movies, a Scottish 
mute (Holly Hunter) journeys to New Zealand in the 1800s with her young 
daughter (Anna Paquin) to marry a kindly man (Sam Neill). She loves playing the 
piano and creates a strange romantic triangle when she teaches a lustful 
peasant (Harvey Keitel) how to play. Tense, slowly paced, well-acted drama, 
directed by Jane Campion. Hunter and Paquin won well-deserved Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudy" (Columbia TriStar). Sean Astin plays a scrappy young man who's not 
really Notre Dame football material but is determined to make the team anyway.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'MENACE' ON LASER DISC: TRUE GRIT AND URBAN GORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watching and listening to filmmakers Allen and Albert Hughes talk about their 
debut 1993 feature film, "Menace II Society," on a new Criterion laser disc 
($100) takes commitment and a strong stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is the raw film itself, seen for the first time in an unrated 
director's cut. From the unsparing, "Sunset Blvd."-style opening to the literal 
closing shot of "Menace II Society," there is little question of the film's 
resolution: violent death amid grinding hopelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the special supplementary material on this jam-packed laser disc 
in which each identical twin is given his own analog soundtrack. To hear what 
they have to say about the making of "Menace," you have to watch the film play 
out twice to give each brother a chance to explain, scene by grueling scene, 
how their bold vision was put on film. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt that we're in the presence of two young, uncompromising 
filmmakers with much potential. The Hughes brothers were 20 when they 
co-directed "Menace II Society," a film whose story they say they had thought 
about since they were 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Criterion laser edition leaves almost nothing out: In addition to the 
unrated film featuring material deleted from the theatrical release and the two 
audio commentaries, the package includes the original theatrical trailer; two 
deleted scenes dropped in the final cut; two music videos directed by the 
Hughes brothers; excerpts from Albert Hughes' Los Angeles City College student 
film, "The Drive By," and the short, "Menace to Society"; a video interview 
with the Hugheses; storyboards and storyboard-to-film comparison of key action 
sequences, and other production notes and documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 In this home theater version, "Menace" unwinds with all the graphic violence 
that the MPAA insisted be removed to avoid an NC-17 rating. Even more than in 
the movie theater, the assault on the senses in the comfort of your living room 
amplifies the harsh realities of this corner of urban life: young men living a 
nasty, short and brutish "gangsta" existence seemingly handed down from 
generation to generation, with little done to break the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the raw language and bullets tearing apart bodies may be too much; 
for others, it may simply underscore the film's point, in Allen's words: "The 
whole idea of the movie was to make people understand; we wanted people to know 
what they're thinking." And, he cautions, "People shouldn't read too deep into 
this movie. We just wanted to make a movie that had some kind of morality." 
</P>
<P>
 Albert says that black audiences often had less trouble dealing with the 
violent subject matter than white audiences: "They know it's just a film," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 ("Menace II Society," without supplementary material and deleted scenes, is 
also available in a letterboxed, single-disc CLV edition from Image 
Entertainment at $35.) 
</P>
<P>
 Grotesque Carnage 
</P>
<P>
 "Man Bites Dog," the 1992 French film by Remy Belvaux, Andre Bonzel and Benoit 
Poelvoorde, offers even more grotesque carnage than "Menace" in a 
director-approved Criterion edition ($50) that includes disgusting scenes 
excised by censors. An interview with the filmmakers at the end of the single 
disc makes the point that "it's not a film about violence, it's a film about 
filmmaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in black-and-white with a hand-held camera as a document of the life and 
mind of a sociopathic killer, it's been hailed as a sendup of reality-based 
docudrama films. Liner notes by Holly Willis also argue that assailing the film 
for its brutality "completely misses the film's point." That may be so, but it 
is hard to find much redemption in this unrelenting series of murders and 
graphic rape, and even harder to watch for its full 92 minutes. There is little 
humanity involved here. In fact, "Man Bites Dog" makes "Menace II Society" look 
tame by comparison.

RESTAURANTS; PEDALS: FEAST FOR THE EYES AND PALATE; SEATED AT THIS BEACHSIDE 
RESTAURANT, ONE IS LIKELY TO BE THE ENVY OF PASSERSBY. IT HAS AN APPEALING 
MENU, BUT SERVICE IS HIT AND MISS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Having brunch on the terrace of Pedals, the casual seaside cafe in Shutters 
Hotel, one is often the subject of envy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe sits right beside the Santa Monica Strand, and not infrequently, a 
bicyclist or pedestrian peers in, face transfixed with longing, as if wishing 
he or she too were sitting among burgeoning pink geraniums under umbrellas and 
eating a salad of butter lettuce and fresh rock shrimp or a big plate of raisin 
French toast with hot berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Such longing is absolutely appropriate. In a beach town whose major seaside 
restaurants are located on traffic-clogged thoroughfares, Pedals comes as a 
pleasant surprise. Casual, moderately priced, with a smart, appealing 
California-style menu, Pedals is like a more refined Crocodile Cafe -- the 
prices aren't that much higher, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the pleasure of visiting here is first walking through the hotel's 
lovely art-filled lobby, stopping for a drink on the outdoor deck or pausing to 
giggle at William Wegman photographs of Weimaraner Fay Ray riding a bike and 
surfing on an ironing board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pedals is at beach level, or actually slightly below: sunken to where one's 
eyes are approximately at pedal level of passing cyclists. The dining room is 
bright, gleaming and noisy with a large open kitchen. Pretty wooden tables are 
paired with lavish postmodern wooden cafe chairs. Chandeliers hang like big 
face-down suns with wrought-iron rays. Wall sconces are smaller spiky suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows are wood-sashed and wide; on a warm day, they slide sideways to admit 
the ocean breeze. Although a window seat is preferable, from almost every 
table, one sees strand, sand, well-lit palm trees, bike path, surf and, 
depending on the hour, blue sky, sunset or starry night.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem -- and of course, there is one -- lies in the service, which can 
be very good on some occasions and downright terrible on others. Entrees either 
arrive right on top of our appetizers or an exceedingly long time after we 
finish them. Waiters are sweet, inexperienced and easily overwhelmed. Once, 
during a rush, I waited more than a half-hour to order dessert. Until the staff 
is stronger, I'd avoid Pedals at peak dining hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingredients are fresh and generally well-handled. The pan-fried crab cake, 
made with lumps of Dungeness crab, is absolutely delicious. And it should be: A 
single not-large patty is $8. A peppery mesclun mix is dressed with a white- 
miso dressing; the Caesar, made with crisp inner leaves of romaine, has 
unusually good croutons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soups aren't as successful: Chilled potato-and-garlic soup has a bouillon 
cube-like saltiness, and chicken soup with udon noodles, despite wonderful fat, 
slippery noodles, is lukewarm, lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedal's new chef is Nicholas Coe, formerly of the Brentwood branch of 
Mezzaluna, which leads me to believe that there's hope for the pizza. Unlike 
Mezzaluna's great pies, Pedal's pizzas so far wear way too much cheese on a 
dull crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the pastas, Singapore-style pan-fried noodles, is spicy -- good but tricked 
up with too many slivered vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 A rotisserie half-chicken, golden brown, plump and juicy, comes with mashed 
potatoes laced with pureed roast garlic and terrific grilled asparagus. Perfect 
French fries and a green salad accompany a cloud-light piece of Chilean sea 
bass, but the plate is so hot it wilts the salad. Marinated sirloin steak is a 
bit overcooked -- still, it comes with great, garlicky Argentine chimichurri 
sauce and a side of black beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are straightforward, large and delicious, and should be enjoyed with 
the excellent house coffee or one of a wide selection of good teas. The dessert 
called fruit band is puff pastry, pastry cream and fresh berries; cheesecake a 
pure white wedge of richness in a pool of warm berries. Ben and Jerry ice 
creams come with an optional waffle cone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pedals, 1 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica, (310) 458-0030. Breakfast, lunch and 
dinner seven days. Sunday brunch. Full bar. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner 
for two, food only, $26-$60.

THEATER REVIEW ; TOOTHLESS 'HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES' LACKS BARK AND BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 It takes a pretty sharp production to make strong drama out of one of Tim 
Kelly's simplistic adaptations of public domain classics, and this Cypress 
Civic Theatre production of his "The Hound of the Baskervilles" doesn't come 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Craig Harreld has designed an English country sitting room that looks 
more like the servants' quarters, and though his staging moves swiftly and 
changes of mood and tempo are on the button, his actors are not up to breathing 
life into Kelly's condensation of the famous mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a tendency to over-dodder, Dale Denton's Dr. Watson hasn't the 
quality of opaque reasoning that endears Watson to Sherlock Holmes, and of 
which Holmes is fond of making fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Tom Royer's Holmes the man to continually astound Watson. Royer plays 
at being Holmes, rather than being him, his enigmatic aura represented by 
turning away from the other characters and staring blankly into space. Royer 
has none of Holmes' sly humor, nor his blase ennui. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Denton and Royer, along with the entire cast, are far from sounding in 
any way British. Their accents are pasted-on affairs, which listening very 
closely to the video of any British film might have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Bosley's Lady Agatha, Watson's old crony who summons Holmes to the 
moor, screeches a bit, and her acting ranges from a grotesque frown to a silly 
forced grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Mondragon's Sir Henry is so effete his disparaging comments on 
Jack Stapleton's chasing butterflies sounds as though he doth protest too much, 
and his family retainers, the Barrymores (Rita Strong, Lee Parry) look as 
though they walked into the wrong play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Linehan's perky Kathy Stapleton is near the mark, but she loses that 
advantage in her last scene, with acting that would have been too much for 
early silent films. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Kari McCarthy as the mysterious Laura Lyons, and assistant director Steve 
Gomer, subbing for another actor as Stapleton, seem to have any idea what the 
moors, Baskerville Hall and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are all about. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; CHILD SAFETY TIPS OFFERED ON 'SPLIT SECOND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, it's Friday, it's a holiday weekend, and the last thing you want to do is 
lounge in front of the tube watching an hour of first aid and safety tips. Do 
yourself and your family a favor, though: If you don't want to watch "In a 
Split Second," NBC's child-safety special tonight, tape it for later. 
</P>
<P>
 This hour of basic first aid and accident prevention information, hosted by 
"L.A. Law's" Corbin Bernsen and his wife, Amanda Pays, is not sexy, exciting or 
controversial. It's a potential lifesaver. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of children are killed and millions are injured in accidents each 
year, many in ways that could have been prevented had parents and others known 
how to head off dangers and what to do in an emergency. The show uses 
dramatizations -- a fall down a hillside, choking at a fast-food place, a run 
through a plate glass door -- to show viewers the steps to take to deal with 
injuries and then how to prevent their happening in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know that only four iron pills can be lethal to a toddler if taken all 
at once? That whacking a choking victim on the back is the wrong thing to do? 
That the full effects of an electric shock may not show up for two days? That 
butter should not be rubbed on a burn? 
</P>
<P>
 Experts from more than 20 organizations -- among them the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, the American Red Cross, the Council on Family Health and the 
National Safety Council -- were consulted for this valuable public service. 
</P>
<P>
 * "In a Split Second" airs at 8 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

CRITICAL CONDITION; QUAKE DAMAGE HAS FORCED CLINIC TO OPERATE OUT OF TRAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the staff of the Mid-Valley Comprehensive Health Center, trailers never 
looked more stately and hospitable than when a caravan of them rolled into the 
facility's Van Nuys parking lot last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The county-run facility had been operating out of tents beside its building on 
7515 Van Nuys Blvd. -- belatedly condemned two months after the Northridge 
earthquake -- when the mobile units arrived, bringing a sturdy roof and running 
water, if nothing more, to a makeshift operation. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, however, with no immediate plans for relocating to a permanent 
building, the trailers are finally being seen for what they are: a 
6,000-square-foot campsite trying to take the place of a 50,000-square-foot 
medical building. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually steady stream of low-income clients -- the clinic recorded 93,000 
visits last year -- now feels like a torrent. Some workers are increasingly 
stressed about their working conditions. The center's medical files, extricated 
from the shuttered building, are lying unused in a storage trailer because 
there is not enough space to review them, according to associate administrator 
Ernest P. Espinoza. Staff members just start anew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any of our public nursing records or nursing manuals," said 
Bernie Nelson, the director of nursing for the facility, regarded as the hub of 
the 10 county health centers in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
"We're working with (records) we've created since the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are having difficulty finding a reasonably priced building in 
the Van Nuys area large enough to house the medical center. According to county 
sources, the old building is unlikely to ever be used again. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, which was a major medical command post after the quake, was 
examined and deemed safe shortly after the temblor. But a fourth inspection in 
March revealed that four of its support beams were cracked and the building was 
ordered closed, displacing the 140 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which sees 4,500 to 6,000 patients a month, mostly for 
tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases and prenatal care, has been forced 
to relocate many of its services because there is not enough space or equipment 
to help everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no room for a dentist's chair in the trailers, so the dentist and 
the dental-care program were transferred to Olive View Medical Center in 
Sylmar. Mid-Valley used to perform about 400 X-rays a week, but since there is 
no X-ray machine in the trailers tuberculosis patients, for example, now have 
to go to the North Hollywood Health Center. And anyone who needs treatment for 
a sexually transmitted disease now has to travel to the Canoga Park Health 
Center, where some nurses and doctors have been transferred. Screening for the 
AIDS virus is still done at Mid-Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the services deemed too important to relocate have been cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 The prenatal care and the family planning units, which had their own spacious 
accommodations in the old building, now share cramped space in the middle of 
the main trailer, each using it on alternate days. Much of their medical 
equipment is kept in storage boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to get things, it's a lot of digging and looking around, which 
causes delays," said Secorro Salanga, 38, a nurse in the prenatal clinic. "But 
I feel we're still able to provide good service to our patients." 
</P>
<P>
 Salanga said the pressure of seeing about 80 patients a day in such a small 
area is creating friction among workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, we get on each other's nerves," Salanga said. "We rub elbow to 
elbow." 
</P>
<P>
 Privacy has also become a serious problem at the center, which provides 
one-on-one counseling to hundreds of patients. The counseling is now taking 
place in one of two remaining tents outside of the trailers. The other tent is 
being used to question patients about their medical history before providing 
them with treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the chaotic conditions, many of the center's patients interviewed 
Thursday said they were satisfied with the level of services being provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took two hours to get in on Tuesday," said Teressa Garrett, an unemployed 
mother of seven who was bringing in four of her children for tuberculosis 
testing after having them vaccinated at the center Tuesday. "We'll see today. 
But in any health center, you wait a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Here at least you get helped," said Garrett, who lives on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynor Medina of North Hills comes into the center every day to receive 
injections for his chronic tuberculosis, as he is required to do by the county. 
When he was diagnosed at the center last year, nurses at the center discovered 
golf-ball-sized lesions in Medina's lungs. On Wednesday, his birthday, nurses 
bought him deodorant and after-shave as a present, much to his surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country has the finest medicine, and people don't appreciate it," said 
the Guatemalan immigrant. "This building is more secure anyway. Things would 
fall on the floor everywhere during an aftershock in the other building."

WRITING CONTEST LAUDS LEGACY OF CESAR CHAVEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began as a simple question about Latinos by the daughter of Los Angeles 
School Board member Victoria Castro: "Why don't we have leaders like Martin 
Luther King?" 
</P>
<P>
 The end result was 450 entries from students throughout the Los Angeles 
Unified School District for the first Cesar Chavez Essay/Poetry Contest. The 
winners -- including Leslie Rivera, a senior at Francis Polytechnic High School 
in Sun Valley who won first place in a Spanish-language category -- were 
honored at the Mexican Cultural Institute at Olvera Street in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest called upon students to write on the theme "Cesar Chavez: The 
Benefits of His Work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cesar Chavez was not only a leader among Mexican Americans, but a world 
leader," Castro said at the ceremony, where winners were given cash awards of 
$150, $125 and $100 for first, second and third place. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest was sponsored by the school district's Mexican American Education 
Commission, the Assn. of Mexican American Educators, USC Civic and Community 
Relations and Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, as well as the Mexican 
Cultural Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to have this new generation be a part of the fight for which 
Cesar Chavez fought," said Carlos Felix Corona, deputy consul general of Mexico 
in Los Angeles. "It's important to have a contest like this to honor a man like 
Cesar Chavez." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera wrote a poem that said, in an English translation: "Your goodness was 
such, that no one could repay you, even with all the gold in the world. . . . I 
would like to have just a small portion of your strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not enough just to grow up, but to do something for someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera, who plans to attend Mission College this fall with the hope of 
eventually becoming a teacher or a journalist, said writing the poem was not 
difficult. "If you put all your feelings into it, then it's not hard," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera came to the United States from El Salvador with her family in 1984. 
Even though she is not Mexican, she had no problem relating to Chavez. "I'm not 
from Mexico, but we're all Latinos, we're all the same," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third-place winner in the middle school English-language category was 
Sepulveda Middle School ninth-grader Andrea Alicia Alarcon, daughter of Los 
Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here today not as a politician, but as a father," Alarcon said. "I am 
very proud. My daughter honors me with her writing." 
</P>
<P>
 The students were not the only ones to have learned something by participating 
in the contest. Manuel Ponce, director of the district's Mexican American 
Education Commission, said he had not known much about Chavez prior to the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 But after reading all 450 entries as one of seven judges, he said: "I now live 
the man, I sleep the man. . . . I feel I now know him man to man." 
</P>
<P>
 Other San Fernando Valley winners were Blanca Estela Ortiz, a 12th-grader at 
Polytechnic High who placed third in the Spanish-language category, and Lisa 
Calderon, a 10th-grader at San Fernando High School who won third place in the 
English category.

HOLIDAY WEEKEND EXODUS MAY PROVE TRYING; TRANSPORTATION: IN ADDITION TO THE 
USUAL AIRPORT THRONGS, MOTORISTS ARE EXPECTED TO CROWD ONTO QUAKE-DAMAGED 
FREEWAYS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you thought it was tough to get out of town early on past Memorial Day 
weekends, try doing it on quake-damaged freeways. Or don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic officials warned motorists Thursday that the usual holiday rush will 
be even more trying this year as drivers are expected to leave the city via 
several key freeways that have not yet been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best advice I can give to people is to allow extra time to go to and from 
places because there will almost certainly be delays," Caltrans spokesman Russ 
Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local airports, campgrounds, golf courses and fishing holes are also expected 
to be swamped beginning today as thousands get a jump on the weekend by leaving 
work or school early for the traditional start of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather, for the most part, is expected to cooperate. There will be night 
and morning low clouds and patchy fog before the sun breaks through in the 
afternoon, said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides 
forecasts for The Times. Highs will be in the 60s at the beaches to the mid-70s 
in the valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 While the holiday has traditionally been a time when people pack their cars 
and hit the open road, traffic officials said they will be monitoring roadways 
more closely this year, as the holiday weekend is expected to give the local 
freeway system its first big test of holiday-driving madness since the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials are particularly worried about the interchange of the 
Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways, the site of an overpass collapse 
caused by the quake. The Golden State Freeway now has two lanes available for 
traffic and one designated for slow-moving trucks. Before the quake, it had 
three lanes for traffic and one set aside for slower vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said other bottlenecks could occur on a section of the Golden State 
Freeway on the Grapevine near Lebec, where crews are widening the roadway. 
Also, Sierra Highway, which was also damaged in the quake, still has only one 
northbound lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Work also continues on the Simi Valley Freeway, which now has three lanes 
running in both directions -- the same number as before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Things could be a lot worse, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering everything that's happened, we're in pretty good shape, but 
because this is the first big getaway weekend, we're going to be keeping an eye 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport is also expecting heavy weekend traffic, particularly today 
and Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to be very, very busy," airport spokesman Victor Gill said. 
"Everybody will be doing the Friday fade. It will start out slow, but by noon 
will be hectic and won't stop until 7 or 8 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid hassles, Gill advised travelers to purchase tickets over the phone 
and to park in the airport's garage for arriving flights instead of waiting in 
cars in front of terminals. He also said parking will probably be at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've placed more signs up to try to get the traffic flowing better, but the 
best idea might be to have someone drop you off at the airport because parking 
is going to be really tough," Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those not venturing too far afield, the sixth annual Canoga Park Memorial 
Day Parade will begin at 11 a.m. Monday at Sherman Way and Owensmouth Avenue. 
Last year, 35,000 people showed up for the parade, which will proceed east on 
Sherman Way, south on De Soto Avenue, west on Vanowen Street and end at Vanowen 
Street and Owensmouth Avenue. This year's highlights include 1880s gunslingers, 
a dune buggy contest, Peruvian horses and John Wayne and Wyatt Earp 
look-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will offer traditional fare as well, including drill teams, 
marching bands and politicians ranging from Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura 
Chick to state Controller Gray Davis to Rep. Anthony Bielenson (D-Woodland 
Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 More solemn ceremonies honoring veterans will be held in Glendale and North 
Hollywood on Monday. In North Hollywood, an hourlong ceremony and parade will 
take place at 10 a.m. at Valhalla Memorial Park, 10621 Victory Blvd. In 
Glendale, a wreath will be placed at the city's war memorial during a morning 
remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 At Castaic Lake, park officials expect 15,000 people and 700 boats to descend 
on the man-made lake over the weekend, which along with Independence Day is the 
area's busiest period of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened up 40 campsites this year, and I don't expect them to last very 
long at all," said Brian Roney, a regional park superintendent. "I advise 
people to call ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Even golf courses will be no refuge from crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday is going to be one of the worst days of the year," said Tim Stains, a 
manager at Hansen Dam Golf Course in Pacoima, where hundreds are expected to 
jam the greens over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the West Valley California Highway Patrol station, which patrols 
from Universal City to the Ventura County line, plans no checkpoints over the 
weekend, a CHP spokesman said officers will nonetheless be on the lookout for 
drunk drivers -- a traditional Memorial Day weekend problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather's hot, there's probably going to be a lot more drinking going 
on," CHP Sgt. Kent Kilgore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilgore said canyon roads used by Valley residents as shortcuts to the beach 
will be crowded, and possibly dangerous, if the weather heats up and people 
flock to beaches. Those streets include Topanga Canyon Boulevard, Kanan Dume 
Road and Malibu Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should watch their speed and expect delays if they're going that way," 
Kilgore said. "There's a lot of sharp turns and it could be very dangerous for 
people not used to taking them."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; HIGH SCHOOL BRIDE BATTLES ARCHDIOCESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Catholic high school junior from Van Nuys has promised administrators a 
fight after she was kicked out of school for getting married. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany High School officials informed Jennifer Tellez Espinoza earlier this 
month in a letter that she could finish this school year, but not return next 
fall because "it is the policy of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles that married 
students may not attend a Catholic high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, 17, who in April married a former altar boy and graduate of the 
school, finds it odd that unmarried student mothers can attend the Mission 
Hills school and married women cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to have premarital sex to have the baby," the soft-spoken Espinoza 
said. "All I did was get married." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outraged," said her husband, Caesar, 24. "This not the Dark Ages 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
Archdiocese, which oversees 60 area Catholic schools, Espinoza was forced out 
for two reasons. First, simply getting married while in high school is 
discouraged by the church and may result in expulsion. Second, Espinoza was 
married in a civil, not Catholic, ceremony, and so she must be expelled.  
</P>
<P>
 "She is not married in the eyes of the church," Coiro said. "The school felt 
that this contradiction in values was something that could not be allowed to 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
 When Espinoza decided to get married in April, she and her husband sought 
several priests to perform the ceremony, but they all refused, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'Will you marry a girl under 18?' " Espinoza recalled. "They said 
'No, we won't.' We wanted very much to have the ceremony performed by a 
priest." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Catch-22," said attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing Espinoza. 
"She wanted to be a good Catholic, and they left her no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy of the archdiocese is to discourage weddings of those under 19, 
Coiro said, and so it is not uncommon for priests to decline to perform 
marriages for young lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statistical evidence suggests that teen-age marriages don't last," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the issue of unwed mothers being allowed in area Catholic high schools 
while legally married women are not, Coiro said, "It's not the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marriage is an ongoing situation. . . . The act of sexual intercourse is 
over and done (with unwed mothers)." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added, a young Catholic girl who gets pregnant and does not have an 
abortion is "making a very strong pro-life statement." 
</P>
<P>
 No one is forced to be a Catholic, Coiro said, and choosing to attend a 
church-affiliated school means agreeing to abide by the rules of the religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are living in defiance of the church, yet expect the church to provide 
them an education." 
</P>
<P>
 Coiro said the no-marriage policy is not a school rule, but a regulation of 
the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza said she was unaware of the policy when she enrolled in the school 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disturbing to me that she should have to choose between her husband and 
her education," attorney Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and the Espinozas said they would "consider all their options" in having 
Espinoza reinstated at the school. ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; MCA TELLS NEIGHBORS AREA PLAN IS COMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The company that owns Universal Studios will begin putting together a 
blueprint for future development in Universal City in a couple of months, 
according to members of MCA Inc.'s Citizens Advisory Group. 
</P>
<P>
 At the group's meeting on Tuesday night, company representatives gave members 
an overview of how the long-awaited Community Plan -- the premier planning 
document for Universal City -- will be developed during the coming months, 
according to Todd Ellison, a member of the panel and of the Hollywood Knolls 
Community Club.  
</P>
<P>
 No actual specifics of what Universal plans to construct were provided. The 
plan will outline how MCA intends to use its land in the future and will 
address traffic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citizens Advisory Group was formed by MCA to provide a communication link 
with its neighbors. Its members include representatives of area homeowners 
groups, including the Studio City, Toluca Lake and Cahuenga Pass associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in this pass, there's never been any kind of organized planning," said 
Dan Riffe, a member of the committee and of the Hollywood Knolls homeowners 
association. "We're happy that they've begun the process." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA representative Christine Hanson said the purpose of the meeting was to 
inform committee members of the process by which the plan will be created, and 
that the company will make information about the plan available to the public 
at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA officials also talked about, but did not define, the timeline for putting 
together the plan, Riffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A planning process like this typically takes a year, year and a half, two 
years," he estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Riffe, company representatives said the process will include 
various local, state and federal agencies including Caltrans and the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 The main concern of community members, Ellison and Riffe said, is traffic in 
the Cahuenga Pass. The entertainment giant recognizes that it contributes to 
traffic in the area, and the plan should provide ways to relieve congestion, 
Riffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of traffic here every day, " Riffe said. "(MCA) is a huge 
landowner. It has a great potential effect on how things go here." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; GRADUATION INCLUDES TRANSFER STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Pierce College graduates walked onto the stage to accept handshakes and 
congratulations Thursday night, transfer students were among them for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the students, who opt not to take an associate of arts degree but 
instead transfer to another college or university to seek a higher degree, make 
up nearly half of Pierce's population, they had never been invited to the 
graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a high transfer rate here at Pierce. They have accomplished 
something," said Judith Ponsor, student body adviser at the college. Ponsor 
explained that to participate in the ceremony, the students had to show 
acceptance at a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's certainly an educational milestone for them. It's sort of important 
that we celebrate with them," Ponsor said. "The person who decides 'I'm going 
to plug along and try to get in another institution of higher education,' 
that's marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 students graduated this semester from the two-year college, with 
about 400 expected to participate in the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponsor set up about 3,500 seats for the event, because Pierce does not dole 
out tickets to graduation. "We try to make sure everyone is invited to 
celebrate in this activity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the audience? The family and friends of Kissandra Cohen, one of 
those transfer students. Cohen has been accepted to Cornell, Smith and UC 
Berkeley -- at age 15. REBECCA BRYANT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; RESIDENTS OPPOSE PROPOSED UTILITY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A standing-room-only crowd of Agoura Hills residents voiced strong opposition 
this week to a proposed utility tax being considered by their City Council to 
plug a budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing Wednesday night gave residents a second and final chance to 
air their views on the matter before the council on June 8 votes whether to 
establish a 5% tax on the use of water, electricity, gas and telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tax is bad for business and it's bad for the citizens," said Gary 
Mueller, an unsuccessful candidate for City Council last year. "We've made too 
many mistakes in the city and spent money on things we shouldn't have. We need 
to cut back within the city from the top down." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is poor management," said Harold Halsey, who owns several 
commercial buildings in Agoura Hills. "The city can't seem to resolve anything 
without ending up in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, several who accused the City Council of overspending, including 
Halsey, have lawsuits pending against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike neighboring Calabasas, Westlake Village and Los Angeles, the city of 
Agoura Hills has so far resisted placing fees on utilities to raise money for 
sheriff's, public works and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Fran Pavley said the city may have to consider the tax this year, 
as Agoura Hills faces a nearly $1-million budget shortfall due to increasing 
costs and a shrinking share of state revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is opposed to the utility tax," Pavley said. "The council will be 
continuing to look at additional cuts, but when do you start making a negative 
impact on the quality of life? You can only defer street maintenance for so 
long before you have very expensive repairs on your hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has scheduled a budget workshop for June 1, one week before 
considering the tax proposal. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; JAZZY MEMORIAL FOR JOE PASS, GUITAR GIANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 friends, family and jazz heavy-hitters remembered legendary 
guitarist Joe Pass on Thursday as a warm, fun-loving man whose virtuosic 
technique will be copied by generations of jazz musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether "singing in Italian restaurants or telling bad jokes," eulogized his 
son, Joe Jr., Pass felt at home on stage, where, as a guitarist, "he sent forth 
a flurry of emotion. He played from his heart and nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarists Al Viola, Lee Ritenour, Phil Upchurch and others lined up at St. 
Mel's Catholic Church in Woodland Hills to pay final respects to Pass, a 
creative soloist and accompanist to such greats as Frank Sinatra, Ella 
Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering was a chance for old friends and stage partners to meet, many 
often reaching across pews to shake hands or squeeze each other's shoulders 
during the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the service, guitarist Joe Pisano and accordion player Tommy Gumina 
stood around reliving performances and studio sessions with Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd start to play a tune," Pisano said, "and then he'd stop everything and 
say, 'No, I hate this one,' and everybody would crack up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Joe," said Gumina, "'I don't think there'll be another one like him." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to be playing his licks long after we're gone," Pisano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass died of cancer Monday at 65, after a career in which he recorded about 20 
albums of his own and played on about 50 others. He gained international 
acclaim for his 1973 album "Virtuoso," which included his interpretations of 
the standards "Stella by Starlight" and "Cherokee." 
</P>
<P>
 After spending his teen-age years working in New York jazz clubs with bands 
headed by notables Tony Pastor and Charlie Barnet, Pass suffered from, and 
finally kicked, a drug habit. He worked with jazz legends Count Basie, Duke 
Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
 Services for Pass, who lived in Woodland Hills for the past several years, 
included classical guitar performances along with the traditional "Ave Maria."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: UP WITH PEOPLE GETS ITS MESSAGE ACROSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Up With People, the international student performing group, continues its 
World in Motion Tour in the San Fernando Valley this week, with performances 
scheduled today at Oxnard Elementary School in North Hollywood and at Pacoima 
Elementary School in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the group toured Haddon Avenue School in Pacoima and Lassen 
Elementary School in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haddon students were thrilled with the visit, said Sonia Ugarte, the 
school's Chapter One coordinator, on Thursday. Chapter One is a federal program 
that subsidizes special reading, math and language instruction for economically 
disadvantaged children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love it," Ugarte said. "One of the groups didn't even want to go out to 
recess. They wanted to stay with the (student performers) who were talking to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The group gave two performances, visited fourth- through sixth-grade 
classrooms and had lunch with students. The group talked about self-esteem, 
about having a purpose in life, about avoiding gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be good for them," Ugarte said. "It's not just coming and doing a 
performance and leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 The visit was especially helpful for students at Haddon, where 98% of the 
students are Latino, Ugarte said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we live in an area that is a little more segregated, they don't know 
people who speak a different language or know people who look different from 
them," she said. "All their roles models are here. They don't see the other 
opportunities they can have in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Up With People performers -- 145 students, age 17 to 25, from 22 
countries -- gave students a larger view. "They can view the world in a 
different way," Ugarte said. "They can see the other kind of languages and 
other cultures that compose our world." 
</P>
<P>
 Up With People also expands the horizons of its performers. In the learning 
program, participants are instructed in intercultural education, performing 
arts, community service and career skills development. 
</P>
<P>
 Up With People was incorporated in 1968. The group grew out of a summer chorus 
started in Tucson, Ariz., by a naval officer and congressional aide interested 
in multiculturalism and international education. 
</P>
<P>
 By traveling for a year to about 85 cities in several countries and living 
with host families, the students learn about different cultures and personal 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 For every two-hour public performance the students give, they participate in 
two public service activities, whether in hospitals, high schools, senior 
centers or prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the Broomfield, Colo.-based group is that students will end their 
year's work more mature, more self-confident and more likely to become leaders 
in their communities and countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Up With People continues its performances next week at elementary schools in 
Los Angeles and Palos Verdes. REBECCA BRYANT

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 13 FACE CHARGES AS UNLICENSED BUILDERS

<P>
 After being arrested in a sting operation in which state officials posed as 
homeowners with quake-damaged homes, 13 people were charged Thursday with 
operating as unlicensed contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Using two homes in Reseda and Van Nuys as bait, investigators with the state 
Contractors' State License Board contacted the builders, all of whom advertised 
in newspapers or on cards posted in building supply stores. 
</P>
<P>
 After the builders gave estimates to conduct repairs, arrests were made in 
March and April, according to Deputy City Atty. Don Cocek, who is prosecuting

DEFENDANT IN ASSISTED-SUICIDE TRIAL KNEW OF VICTIM'S PAST; CRIME: ALEX COVENTRY 
WAS AWARE LEONARD MEDINA HAD TRIED TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE BEFORE, PROSECUTOR 
SAYS.

<P>
 A Tujunga man on trial for allegedly assisting in his roommate's suicide knew 
the man had previously attempted to take his life before he handed him a 
shotgun and told him, "Just do it," a prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense lawyer, meanwhile, said the dead man may not have believed the gun 
was loaded before he turned it on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys Superior Court jury Thursday began hearing evidence in the rare 
assisted-suicide trial of Alex Coventry, 44, who was charged under an obscure 
1873 law that says "every person who deliberately aids or advises or encourages 
another to commit suicide is guilty of a felony." If convicted, he faces up to 
three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Medina, 42, who had been drinking for several hours, shot himself in 
the chest July 2, 1993, after Coventry handed him the gun in the bedroom of the 
Tujunga apartment he shared with Coventry and his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew R. Flier said outside court Thursday that not only 
did Coventry encourage Medina to end his life, he knew that Medina was drunk 
and that he had previously attempted suicide on an unspecified date. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coventry's attorney, Kenneth Lezin, told the jury in his opening statement 
that his client, who also had been drinking that night, did not intend that 
Medina would end his life. Lezin explained Coventry's statement to Medina by 
arguing that Coventry is an alcoholic and the condition made him prone to 
exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster his claim, Lezin read excerpts from a tape-recorded interview with 
police in which Coventry said: "I couldn't believe Leonard did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lezin continued, quoting Coventry: "I think he did it accidentally, too. He 
might not have known that it was loaded. He might have thought I was just 
kidding him." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda McDowell, Coventry's longtime girlfriend and Flier's star witness, 
testified that she and her roommates were all having financial problems and 
were facing eviction from their apartment, which prosecutors believe caused 
Medina to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell said she spent much of the day drinking with Medina, whom she 
described as a very good friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry, who was employed only sporadically, had gone to work in McDowell's 
place helping an elderly woman because she was having a pay dispute with her 
employer, McDowell testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of McDowell's salary problem, she said, the three did not have enough 
money to pay the rent on their Greeley Street apartment, and they were going to 
be evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was always a problem with money," she testified. "Leonard didn't make 
that much." 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell will continue her testimony Friday.

ACTRESS ENTERS PLEA IN ROBBERY CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress Victoria Sellers, daughter of the late actor Peter Sellers and a 
confidante of accused madam Heidi Fleiss, has pleaded not guilty to charges of 
receiving property allegedly stolen during an armed robbery spree, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court late Wednesday, Sellers, 29, denied the 
single felony count and was released on her own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers was linked to stolen jewelry that police found when they searched the 
Northridge home Sellers shares with talent director Don Gibble, 24. Gibble was 
also charged with receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Oscar Andres Lopez, 18, and John Anthony Zapata, 20, charging 
them in the armed robberies and with attempted murder. Lopez and Zapata were at 
the house, police said, at the time of the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was recently also charged with murder in the 1992 stabbing of a Taft 
High School student. That case is being tried in Juvenile Court because at the 
time of the stabbing, he was a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers is scheduled to appear in court again June 10 for a preliminary 
hearing, but prosecutors said this proceeding will probably be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers was cited last August when Beverly Hills police stopped a car in which 
she was a passenger and found about an ounce of marijuana in her purse.

ASSAULT CHARGES AGAINST JUDGE ARE REDUCED; CRIME: STANLEY SAMUEL FEINSTEIN, 61, 
IS ACCUSED OF IMPRISONING A FEMALE ATTORNEY IN HIS OFFICE AND SEXUALLY 
MOLESTING HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge accused of slamming a female attorney against a wall and sexually 
molesting her in his Van Nuys chambers was ordered Thursday to stand trial on 
less serious charges than those of which he was originally accused. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Municipal Court Judge Mary E. Waters to reduce felony charges 
against Judge Stanley Samuel Feinstein, 61, came as a blow to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel his conduct rose to the level of a felony violation," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Carol Straughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who is a worker's compensation judge, had faced one felony count of 
false imprisonment and one felony count of sexual battery for allegedly 
fondling a 40-year-old attorney during a March 28 visit to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a preliminary hearing, Judge Waters sided with defense attorneys who 
argued that Feinstein's alleged conduct did not warrant felony charges. The 
judge subsequently ordered Feinstein to stand trial on misdemeanor charges of 
unlawful touching and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Philip D. Israels, an attorney representing Feinstein, 
maintained his client's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the real question is what was the real motive of the district 
attorney's office to file two felony counts with such flimsy evidence," Israels 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the female attorney who was the lone witness to testify during 
Thursday's preliminary hearing in downtown Los Angeles, the incident began 
after Feinstein invited her to his office at the State Office Building in the 
Van Nuys Government Center so that he could give her the next date of a lecture 
series they had both previously attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman testified that as she was about to leave, Feinstein told her to 
close the door because he had something else to tell her. She did and then he 
attacked her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came over and pushed his body up against mine," she said visibly shaken. 
"It was like he slammed me up against the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that she unsuccessfully tried to push him away with the palms of 
her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "His left hand was inside my shirt and on my breast," she said. "I couldn't 
get out of there. His body was pushing me up against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lifted his right hand up my skirt and inside my panty hose and his finger 
was on my vagina," she said. "I told him I gotta go. I gotta go." 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that at that point, she was able to struggle free, grab her 
briefcase and ran out of the office. She said that during the assault Feinstein 
was also trying to kiss her and stick his tongue in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, the woman said that on the day of the alleged attack 
she had taken three different prescription drugs. The woman also testified she 
had met Feinstein on three previous occasions, including a November, 1993, 
incident when Feinstein complained he had a sore neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman -- who was accompanied by her supervisor at the time of that 
incident -- said she reached over and touched Feinstein's neck to try to 
determine where the pain was, unaware until after the incident that Feinstein 
was a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she had also met him at a February hearing she had before him 
and then again at a lecture series. 
</P>
<P>
 Later on the same day of the alleged attack, she said Feinstein approached her 
in the cafeteria and offered her some macaroon cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I hope I haven't upset you," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 She testified that she screamed back, "You freaked me out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Following the woman's testimony, Israels cited a case law to Waters that in 
order for Feinstein to be charged with a felony he would have had to exert more 
force to restrain the female attorney than he used when he allegedly pushed her 
against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Israels pointed to the lawyer's own account of the incident when she testified 
that Feinstein used only his body to restrain her and that he never slapped, 
hit, scratched or tied her up. 
</P>
<P>
 Straughn disagreed, saying that Feinstein had committed sexual battery by 
pushing the female attorney up against the wall and fondling her breast and 
touching her vagina. 
</P>
<P>
 Israels also said several factors implied "some sort of consensual behavior" 
between Feinstein and the woman. He pointed out that she testified the doors to 
Feinstein's office were unlocked, that she never told him "no" during the 
alleged attack and that afterward he told her to come back to his office later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Waters sided with Israels and reduced the felony charge to a 
misdemeanor count of unlawful touching. 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing to reduce a false imprisonment count to a misdemeanor, Waters 
noted that Feinstein appeared to have used no violence, menace, fraud or deceit 
during the alleged encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters arraigned Feinstein on Thursday on the misdemeanor counts to which he 
pleaded not guilty. The next hearing on the case will be June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Feinstein faces a maximum of a year in jail for each of the 
misdemeanor counts, compared to a maximum four years in prison he would have 
faced on the sexual battery charge and three years on the charge of false 
imprisonment by violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Straughn said her office will now determine whether to appeal Waters' 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials fired Feinstein from his job last month after he refused to 
cooperate with an internal investigation into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Israels described the firing as a miscarriage of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Feinstein should still be on the bench today and he's not because the 
investigation was totally shoddy," Israels said.

13 MORE ARRESTED IN QUAKE REPAIR SCAM; CRIME: STATE INVESTIGATORS POSING AS 
RESEDA AND VAN NUYS RESIDENTS SOLICIT BIDS FROM THE UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS. 
</P>

<P>
 Another round of arrests has been made in the continuing investigation of men 
passing themselves off as licensed contractors to cash in on construction 
repair projects caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, the Los Angeles 
city attorney's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 arrests announced Thursday were the result of sting operations in the 
San Fernando Valley in which investigators posed as homeowners, authorities 
said. This brings to 26 the number arrested in the alleged scams. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the individuals arrested in the latest sting operation is believed to 
have come all the way from Ontario, Canada, to profit from construction work, 
said Don Cocek, the deputy city attorney prosecuting the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 State Contractor's Licensing Board investigators identified the alleged con 
men through newspaper advertisements, notices posted at local building supply 
and hardware stores and flyers distributed around the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sting operation, about 10 state investigators were stationed at houses 
in Reseda and Van Nuys. They solicited bids on repair and improvement projects 
in March and April, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sting operation and investigative team was formed to stop the kind of 
widespread fraud that plagued Florida homeowners in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Andrew more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocek and other city officials warned that such scam operations have become 
prevalent the last two months as residents begin to receive insurance 
settlements and federal financial assistance to repair damaged homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants are scheduled for arraignment June 28 in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged in the most recent sting were: William Donohue, 48, of Canoga Park; 
Manouchehr F. Manizani, 54, of Canoga Park; Jose Moreno, 47, of Canoga Park; 
George Lynn Gonzalez, 49, of Shadow Hills; Michael D. Knight, 39, of North 
Hollywood; Phillips Martin, 47, of Van Nuys; William Henry Parlee, 58, of North 
Hills; Victor Risiglione, 48, of Chatsworth; John Dale Eyler, 35, of Eagle 
Rock; Michael Benmoshe, 39, of Reseda; Jesse Vicente Lopez, 20, of North 
Hollywood; Tony Simaan Idilbi, 29, of West Hills, and Salvador Muro Lozano, 55, 
of Reseda.

2 TEEN-AGERS HURT AS JOY RIDE ENDS IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wild joy ride by three teen-age girls who apparently stole a 1992 Honda 
Civic ended Thursday night when the car slammed into a utility pole in a quiet 
residential neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the teen-agers, who were not identified, were pinned in the front seat 
of the vehicle and had to be pried out by firefighters at the scene of the 
crash in the 17200 block of Louise Street, said Brian Humphrey of the Los 
Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 They were taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where one was treated 
for a bump on the head. The other had a possible broken leg, Los Angeles Police 
Officer Gail Muzzey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ages of the girls were not immediately known, but Muzzey said one of the 
teen-agers told her that she was 16 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, a third passenger riding in the back seat of the 
vehicle limped away immediately after the accident, Muzzey said, and was still 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses also told police that before the crash, the car was fishtailing, 
swinging from side to side as it sped down the street, Muzzey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was taken from a parking lot in Los Angeles between 2:30 and 3 
p.m. Thursday, Muzzey said. The accident took place shortly after 7 p.m., she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the teen-agers may be affiliated with a gang. A slide hammer, an 
instrument often used to remove a car's ignition, was found inside a backpack 
on the floor in the rear of the vehicle, police said.

CEREMONY RECOGNIZES COMMUNITY PROTECTORS; AWARDS: CIVIC LEADERS AND FAMILY 
MEMBERS CELEBRATE THE BRAVERY OF PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO WENT BEYOND THE CALL OF 
DUTY. 
</P>

<P>
 Fourteen firefighters, paramedics and law enforcement officers were presented 
Los Angeles Community Protector awards Thursday at the Universal Sheraton for 
their willingness to go beyond the call of duty for their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 community representatives, civic leaders and members of the award 
recipients' families attended the $35-a-plate ceremony hosted by weatherman 
Christopher Nance of KNBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people don't realize that these men and women devote their time doing 
things in the community after they leave their jobs," said Los Angeles City 
Councilman Hal Bernson, who created the awards 10 years ago with Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich, who was also in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of the 1994 awards are: Steven D. Hofbauer and Stephen J. Ruda of 
the Los Angeles City Fire Department, Jose Isaac Gonzales and James Hellmold of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Carlos Perez and Rudy Mariscal of 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Lise Ovesen and L. Dale Turner of the 
Los Angeles Police Department, William L. Glass and Michael H. Werner of the 
California Highway Patrol, Darryl Forbes of the Burbank Fire Department, Rod 
Brooks of the Glendale Police Department, Scott Jaeggi of the Downey Fire 
Department and David W. Smith of the Torrance Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams, there to present two awards, said the concept 
of the award is to say "thank you" to those who put in those extra hours to 
make a difference. "It shows the hard work and dedication these people have," 
Williams said. "It typifies what 100 officers do every day." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is overwhelming," said Hofbauer, a 14-year veteran of the LAFD, after the 
ceremony. "Especially when you look at the caliber of people I was with." 
</P>
<P>
 Hofbauer was singled out for developing a quicker way to distribute toys for 
the LAFD's "Toys for Needy Children" program. Hofbauer, who is stationed in 
Reseda, also helped activate the program after the Jan. 17 earthquake so 
children living in shelters and tent cities could have something to occupy 
their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is kind of bittersweet for me," said L. Dale Turner, a 22-year LAPD 
veteran currently stationed at North Hollywood. "I have just been promoted to 
sergeant and will no longer be on motor (detail)." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who wore a chest of medals from the LAPD's highest honor -- a Medal of 
Valor -- to those from his stint in Vietnam as a marine, created a traffic desk 
at his station so residents could voice their complaints. In addition, he 
provided the community with a 24-hour voice mail and made himself available 
around the clock to address their traffic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, a nine-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department now stationed in 
East Los Angeles, was recognized for his devotion to a terminally ill 
9-year-old cancer patient, among other accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales came upon the boy while handling calls in the area and made 
arrangements for a special bed to be given to the boy, got him front row 
tickets to a Lakers' game and ultimately stayed by the boy's side as he passed 
away last February.

DRAWING OF HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A composite drawing was released by police Thursday of a man sought in a 
hit-and-run accident that killed a 7-year-old boy who had bolted across the 
street toward an ice-cream truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also revealed another gruesome detail of the Sunday morning accident in 
the 9000 block of Tobias Avenue that killed Skyy Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he (the driver) hit the boy, he turned around, looked at the body, 
laughed, and sped away," said Detective John Miller of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead 
at 4:15 p.m. Neighbors said Skyy and his 3-year-old sister, who was also in the 
street but not injured, had moved to the crowded neighborhood one day before 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is described as a male Latino, with shoulder- or collar-length 
hair and a mustache. He is believed to be about 26, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle is described as a 1981 black Volkswagen Rabbit, possibly with a 
lowered body and equipped with small wheels, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the driver was either living or spending a lot of time in the 
neighborhood, and was seen driving in the vicinity about 15 minutes before the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was killed just five days after a 48-year-old woman and her 
12-year-old daughter were struck and killed at a Pacoima intersection where 
residents two years earlier had asked city officials to install a traffic 
signal.

VALLEY MAN SENTENCED TO NEARLY 5 YEARS FOR BEATING EX-GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what may be the longest sentence handed down in Los Angeles in a 
misdemeanor domestic violence case, a North Hollywood man was sentenced 
Thursday to nearly five years in jail for beating his ex-girlfriend for 45 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash gave the unusually long sentence 
of 4 years and 11 months to Jose M. Martinez, who was convicted May 4 of four 
misdemeanor counts: spousal battery, false imprisonment, making threats to kill 
and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash said Martinez's testimony that he never assaulted his 26-year-old friend 
was "completely unbelievable," according to Deputy City Atty. Jeff Harkavy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was lying through his teeth," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, 25, had known the victim for about seven years, and the couple had a 
child who was 3 1/2 years old at the time of the Dec. 23 incident, Harkavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman testified during Martinez's trial that the relationship ended about 
two years ago when Martinez was sent to state prison following a drug-selling 
conviction. Martinez was released six weeks before the attack, the woman said, 
and he occasionally slept on her couch. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault began after Martinez was awakened by a knock on a neighbor's door 
and became enraged because he thought it was the woman's boyfriend, the 
prosecutor said. The knocking was actually coming from a neighbor's door. 
</P>
<P>
 After obtaining a butter knife from the kitchen, Martinez stuck the knife into 
a pillow on the bed, narrowly missing the woman's head, Harkavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez then dragged her off the bed, pinned her to the floor and struck her 
about 30 times during a 45-minute attack, according to the testimony at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she was also choked three times and was barely able to remain 
conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was able to escape after convincing Martinez to stop the attack 
because the couple's son was sleeping in the apartment, according to her 
testimony. She called 911 from a nearby pay phone and returned to the 
apartment, where she received a phone call from Martinez, who said, "I'm going 
to come back and finish you off," Harkavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police arrived and captured Martinez after a half-mile foot chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was convicted just over three years ago of attacking the same woman. 
He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, authorities said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTELOPE VALLEY TO GET 2ND CONTINUATION 
SCHOOL; EDUCATION: CURRENT CAMPUS IN LANCASTER LACKS SPACE. OFFICIALS SAY NEW 
SITE WILL HELP REVERSE SLIGHT INCREASE IN DROPOUT RATE.

<P>
 A second continuation school is being established in the Antelope Valley in 
hopes of keeping more high school students from dropping out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Antelope Valley Union High School District on Wednesday 
unanimously approved the establishment in the fall of South Valley Continuation 
School, which will cost $220,000 to staff and furnish in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time coming," said board member Bill Olenick. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as the 1970s the high school district had two continuation 
schools, one in Lancaster and another in Palmdale. But when Desert Winds High 
School opened in 1975, it became the district's lone school for problem 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed for 225 students, that Lancaster school now serves as many as 700 
students between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very common for at-risk students to be turned down in their request to 
attend Desert Winds because of a lack of available space," Ray Monti, assistant 
superintendent of educational services, said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Board president Billy Pricer said he believes that the opening of South Valley 
will have a substantial impact on reducing the district's dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I predict our dropout rate will go down considerably," he said. "I predict 
we'll graduate another 100 kids." 
</P>
<P>
 A report released by the state Department of Education Wednesday showed that 
11.9% of the district's Class of 1993 dropped out since they entered the 10th 
grade. The number is up slightly from the 11.1% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials blamed the increase on the district's financial crisis, saying tight 
budgets prevented the establishment of any additional outreach programs to keep 
students in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the district's dropout rate has significantly improved since the 
state began tracking the figures in 1986. At that time, 68.4% of the students 
who had been enrolled in the district since 10th grade were not expected to 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the district's Class of 1988, 34.8% dropped out between the 10th grade 
and graduation day, according to the Department of Education. That number fell 
to 15.9% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, the high school district has seen its dropout rate plummet 82.6%, 
according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
 South Valley Continuation School will help reduce the dropout rate even more, 
Pricer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's been a proven fact for years that if you have a more structured 
program for the kids that are problems or have problems learning, its a little 
easier for them to progress," Pricer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the space problem at Desert Winds, Pricer said many problem 
students are assigned to independent study, an approach that is not really 
effective at keeping at-risk youth in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some students assigned to Desert Winds never make it because they live so 
far away, he said. The district does not provide bus service to the school so 
it's "easy for kids and parents to use that as an excuse for the kids not to 
go," Pricer said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Valley will be located at 40th Street East and Avenue P-8 in space 
leased from the Los Angeles Department of Airports. The site was previously 
used by the Palmdale School District for a temporary school, so it will require 
only minimal changes to ready it for opening in the fall, said Supt. Robert 
Girolamo. 
</P>
<P>
 The district expects the school to open with an enrollment of 120 to 150 
students and reach a maximum of 200 during the 1994-95 school year.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMAN'S DEATH DECLARED HOMICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After declaring that the death of a 33-year-old woman from a mysterious 
explosion here last week was a homicide and not an accident, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies Thursday asked for the public's help in solving the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Standish of Pearblossom died, and her 4-year-old son, Michael Hepburn, 
was seriously injured May 20, when something exploded as they looked for 
collectibles and recyclables in the desert near 106th Street East and Avenue V. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators "have determined that it was a homicide and not an accident," 
Sgt. Ron Spear said. But investigators did not say how they had reached that 
conclusion, Spear said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY OFFICIALS, EDUCATORS JOIN THE FIGHT ON 
RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated by a recent flurry of racially motivated incidents on school 
campuses here, educators and city officials have joined forces to explore 
several methods to fight the hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone in this valley is going to die from racism," warned Gary Mast, a 
teacher at Canyon High School, the site of two brawls earlier this month 
between students and alleged white supremacists. "We need to admit we have a 
problem and address it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mast, an instructor at the Canyon Country school for 21 years, teaches the 
school's "World of Difference" program, which promotes cultural understanding.  
</P>
<P>
 He was among a group of eight teachers and students who earlier this week 
presented the City Council with a petition signed by more than 200 students and 
a billboard-sized poster, both denouncing racism. Done in multiple colors and 
dotted with peace symbols, the poster was filled will eloquent pleas for 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad truth will come after the violence," one student wrote. "When we look 
at the cuts and wounds, we will realize that we are all the same color on the 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't it be boring if everyone was the same?" another wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Clyde Smyth called for the creation of a citizens task force and 
proposed setting aside $25,000 in general fund money to tackle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racism is an insidious, overwhelmingly horrible issue that faces this 
country, community by community," Smyth said. "We have to take a stand and make 
sure we let them know it's not acceptable in the Santa Clarita Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to discuss the issue, and possible creation of the 
task force, at its June 14 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent fights are the latest in a string of racially motivated incidents 
that have plagued Santa Clarita in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate literature has appeared intermittently, beginning in December with a few 
leaflets tucked in grocery store products, and ballooning in March when more 
than 1,000 flyers were stuffed in student lockers at Placerita Junior High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the March incident was the largest single distribution of 
hate literature in northern Los Angeles County in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers told the council this week that other Santa Clarita schools have been 
littered with flyers as well, but without word leaking out to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have responded to the incidents by hosting additional 
discussions about cultural diversity and tolerance.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HOUSE APPROVES FUNDS FOR SEVERAL HIGHWAY 
PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Magic Mountain Parkway in the Santa Clarita Valley will be widened and work 
will continue on the relocation of California 138 in Palmdale with funds 
approved for the projects by the U.S. House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The House on Wednesday also approved the inclusion of the Golden State, San 
Diego, Antelope Valley and Simi Valley freeways; and state highways 126 and 138 
in the proposed national highway system. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Azarloza, spokesman for Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa 
Clarita), said Senate approval of the highway system and allocation of funds is 
still needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The national highway system plan, which must be enacted by Congress by Sept. 
30, 1995, provides a blueprint for the nation's transportation priorities, 
Azarloza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate will probably approve the plan early next year, he said, adding 
that there would be no problem in securing the funding or retaining the 
freeways in McKeon's district in the national highway system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very good about it," he said. "This is not pork tacked onto a bill. 
This has gone through an open review process." 
</P>
<P>
 With Senate approval, $1 million will be allocated to aid in the relocation of 
California 138 off Palmdale Boulevard to Avenue P-8. The funds would be used 
for property acquisition on Avenue P-8 between the Antelope Valley Freeway and 
50th Street East and follows the allocation in 1991 of $3 million for the same 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, California 126 between McBean Parkway and the Golden State 
Freeway would be widened. That project will receive $4 million in federal 
funds.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PRESIDENT OF VALENCIA NATIONAL BANK IS ASKED 
FOR RESIGNATION; FINANCE: ROBERT MANLEY SAYS HE IS BEING FORCED OUT BECAUSE HE 
HAS TAKEN A HARD LINE ON COLLECTING ON LOANS OWED BY BOARD MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move, the president of the Santa Clarita Valley's only local 
bank since its founding seven years ago has been asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Manley, one of the founders of Valencia National Bank, was unanimously 
asked to step down Tuesday by the institution's board of directors, who cited 
concerns about his management abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Manley attributed his ouster to "a fairly hard course" he had taken 
over the collection of loans by the bank to past and present board members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling the people who sign my paycheck they've got to belly up to the 
bar and pay the piper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said the loans have nothing to do with their request for 
Manley's resignation. The board first considered asking Manley to resign more 
than two years ago, said Louis Garasi, chairman of the bank's board.  
</P>
<P>
 Garasi said Manley has done nothing illegal or immoral, but that the bank's 
earnings have declined during the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have confidence in Mr. Manley to manage the bank in the future," 
Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Manley chooses not to resign, "he will be terminated," Garasi said. He 
declined to say what deadline the board has set for a reply to its request. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley said he has not decided if he will resign, stating he plans to talk 
with an attorney first and is also leaving town for a week-and-a-half vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank remains in sound financial shape, despite the recent losses, 
according to both Manley and Garasi. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank employees said they had no knowledge of the board's intentions until 
after Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a complete surprise to me," said James Perkins, the bank's senior vice 
president and chief financial officer. "I attend the board meetings, but I am 
excused from the (closed session) personnel matters discussed by the board." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank opened in October, 1987, earning a net income of $500,965 in 1989 and 
$511,982 in 1990, Perkins said. Net income dropped to $379,122 in 1991, 
$310,458 in 1992 and $29,454 in 1993 -- a sharp drop that Perkins attributed to 
the recession and the cost of opening two new branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley said the outstanding loans and legal costs of trying to collect them 
totaled "several hundred thousand dollars," which is why the bank's earnings 
dropped so dramatically in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had it not been for that, it would have been a pretty decent year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the loans, the bank would have posted lower earnings in 1993, 
Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bank can lend money to its board members as long as preferential treatment 
is not given, Manley said. He said some board members were having problems 
paying back their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took considerable effort on my part to force the directors to step up and 
pay attention to this serious problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the loans have been paid back, but others remain outstanding, Manley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to discuss details of the loans in question, but said they played 
a role in the resignation of four board members who stepped down within a month 
of each other last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said former board member Kathy Wiener resigned last June because of 
problems with her loan. She and her husband, Harold, were also facing 
allegations of embezzling $2.8 million from trust accounts at their company, 
Country Oaks Escrow Inc., which the state seized last June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members who resigned included Glen Rollins, Kent Fortin and Tony 
Matthess. Attempts to reach them Thursday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Garasi acknowledged the resignations were "due to various concerns about the 
loans," but declined further comment about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Current board members have "hardly any loans whatsoever at the bank," Garasi 
said. Besides Garasi, board members include Gene Burke, Walt Fischer, Robert 
Nehabit, Chuck Albrecq and Joseph McKeon, brother of Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon 
(R-Santa Clarita).

THE TIMES POLL; BROWN LEADS DEMOCRATS AS TROUBLES PLAGUE WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the primary election for governor less than two weeks off, Kathleen Brown 
is maintaining a comfortable lead over her Democratic rivals, according to the 
Los Angeles Times Poll, while Republican Gov. Pete Wilson continues to wallow 
in troubled political waters. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Brown held a 17-point lead over her nearest contender, 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, among the 662 registered Democrats 
interviewed. That gap -- just about the same as it was in late March -- 
narrowed to 12 points when limited to those Democrats who said they were likely 
to vote in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll indicated that many Democrats were not unalterably committed to their 
candidate at this point and might reconsider their choice. But those who 
favored Garamendi appeared just as likely as Brown supporters to change their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 The third Democratic candidate, state Sen. Tom Hayden, trailed at 10%, but 
there were hints that Hayden may have gotten a boost from his performance in 
the three Democratic gubernatorial debates held Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday 
-- while the poll was under way. The poll was conducted Saturday through 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In incomplete samples during the final two days of polling, his numbers rose 
to the mid-teens. His standing now could be higher than the poll numbers 
suggest, Times Poll Director John Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, there appeared to be no dramatic reshuffling of the race as a 
result of the debates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 April and May -- the period since the previous Times poll -- are generally the 
months in which people begin to tune in to a primary election campaign in 
California; candidates launch advertising drives and they begin campaigning 
more vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 All those things occurred in the governor's contest this spring, but seemed to 
have little impact on the balance of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that appeared to cause a significant shift in support for 
candidates was heavy television advertising by two wealthy Republicans who had 
been virtually unknown statewide. Senate candidate Michael Huffington and 
gubernatorial hopeful Ron Unz boosted their standings significantly by pouring 
millions of dollars into television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that a boost in optimism about the California economy in the 
early months of 1994 has leveled off, as did Wilson's job approval rating. From 
a low point of 28% in the autumn of 1992, following that summer's protracted 
budget stalemate, Wilson's job rating made a slow climb back to 39% in March. 
It is now at 38%, basically unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, more than half the Californians polled believed that the state was 
mired in a serious recession. The number dropped significantly in March to 35%. 
This week the figure remained virtually unchanged at 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one in four thought that things in California generally were going in the 
right direction. Nearly two-thirds said they thought that California was on the 
wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just terrible news for an incumbent," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Wilson does not seem to face a serious threat to winning the 
Republican nomination for a second term over his surprise Republican 
challenger, Unz, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Unz got the support of 29% of 
542 registered Republicans to Wilson's 52%. Among likely voters, the spread was 
57% for Wilson and 31% for Unz. The relatively large Unz vote shows that 
disaffection with Wilson extends to the Republican core. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz was not included in the late March poll because he did not formally 
announce for governor until after that survey was taken. The Unz campaign said 
that its own polls gave him about 10% of the GOP support at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor trailed Democrats Brown and Garamendi by double digits in 
hypothetical matchups in a November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said: "The governor faces the daunting political challenge of seeking 
reelection in a time of continuing pessimism and at time when improvements in 
the consumer outlook appear to have stalled." 
</P>
<P>
 In California's U.S. Senate race, first-term Rep. Huffington of Santa Barbara 
moved ahead of former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer for the Republican nomination 
after spending at least $4 million of his own money on television advertising, 
most of it attacking the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
Huffington's support more than doubled during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all registered Republicans, Huffington led Dannemeyer 27% to 18%, with a 
third candidate, Kate Squires, getting 10%. Huffington's lead over Dannemeyer 
was larger, 35% to 21%, among most likely voters, but a third of the 
Republicans still had not decided how they would vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's ad campaign also appeared to have had an effect on Feinstein, who 
has no major opposition in the Democratic primary and did not run any 
television ads. Although she scored some significant and highly publicized 
Senate victories in Washington during the period, her approval rating among all 
1,984 adults polled dropped from 52% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein led Huffington 52% to 38% and Dannemeyer 53% to 35% in a 
hypothetical matchup among all 1,471 registered voters.  
</P>
<P>
 The poll found four overriding issues for the California electorate: crime, 
the economy, education and illegal immigration. In the race for governor, 
Wilson outscores his opponents for his positions on two issues he has 
emphasized for nearly a year, crime and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who says the California economy is coming back, and Brown, who has 
criticized the governor for his management of the state during the recession, 
are roughly equal in getting support for their stands on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The one area in which Brown has a substantial edge is in education, which 
Brennan said has the potential of being "the sleeper issue" in California this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for governor, the poll results generally indicate that Garamendi 
has slightly broader appeal throughout the electorate than Brown. Garamendi has 
greater appeal among Republicans and outscores Wilson in a hypothetical matchup 
by 14 points. Brown edges Wilson by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi gets favorable ratings from a remarkable number of Republicans, 41% 
to 19%. But Brown enjoys greater popularity among Democrats, who will be 
choosing the party nominee June 7. Brown is viewed favorably by 66% of 
Democrats polled and unfavorably by only 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among the group (of Democrats) that likes both Brown and Garamendi, she 
continues to run ahead comfortably," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi does somewhat better against Brown among Democrats who are mostly 
likely to vote largely because he enjoys greater popularity among older people, 
who tend to be the most faithful voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is particularly strong with voters who consider themselves liberal, 
scores well in the major urban centers of Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay 
Area and with minority voters. Among various Democratic groups, Garamendi 
outscores Brown only among the relatively small segment of conservative 
Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Family background and her record in office figure strongly in determining why 
voters like or dislike Brown. Fifteen percent of those who like her do so 
because of her family ties. Her father and brother were governors of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen percent like Brown because of her record. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who dislike Brown, 26% said it was because of her family 
background. Among Democrats who said they do not like Brown, 14% said the 
reason was her position on the death penalty. Brown personally opposes the 
death penalty although she insists that she would enforce the state's capital 
punishment law just as vigorously as Garamendi or Wilson, both strong 
supporters of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Among voters who like Garamendi, 42% said it was because of his record as the 
state's first elected insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Among voters who did not like Garamendi, 44% said it was his record as 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's favorable ratings have dropped slightly since March. Forty-three 
percent say they like the governor and 52% said they do not. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to volunteer reasons for liking Wilson, the most-frequently 
mentioned were because he is trying to do a good job (19%), his stands on 
illegal immigration (19%), and because of a feeling he gets things done (10%).  
</P>
<P>
 Those who do not like Wilson say he is ineffective (14%), a weak leader (10%), 
cite the recession (12%), or cite his cuts in public education budgets (13%). 
How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,984 California adults, by telephone, from May 21 
through 25. The sample includes 1,471 registered voters, 662 of whom are 
Democrats and 542 Republicans. Of those groups, 326 are likely Democratic 
voters and 268 likely Republican voters. Telephone numbers were chosen from a 
list of all exchanges in the state. Random-digit dialing techniques were used 
so that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was 
conducted in English and Spanish. The sample is weighted slightly to conform 
with census figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling 
error for the total adult and registered voter samples is plus or minus 3 
percentage points. For all registered Democrats and Republicans it is 4 and 5 
points, respectively; for likely Democratic and Republicans voters it is 6 and 
7 points, respectively. For certain other subgroups the error margin will vary. 
Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as question wording and 
the order in which questions are presented. THE TIMES POLL

STATE COURT SAYS ABORTION CLINICS CAN LIMIT PICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, ruling for the first time in an abortion protest 
case, held Thursday that demonstrators can be barred from a public sidewalk in 
front of an abortion clinic to protect patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-1 decision helps assure California's abortion clinics of legal 
protection if pickets threaten patients' emotional health, a protection that 
could be extended to targets of other kinds of political demonstrations as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotionally jarring confrontations with anti-abortion pickets or sidewalk 
'counselors' may pose serious health risks," Justice Armand Arabian wrote for 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second setback for abortion protesters Thursday. President Clinton 
signed legislation making it a federal crime to block the entrance to an 
abortion clinic or attack those entering it. Two anti-abortion groups 
immediately filed a lawsuit to nullify the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The California ruling marked the first time the state's high court has decided 
an abortion case since conservatives gained a majority in 1987. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has a similar case pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the state court's only woman and one of its more 
liberal members, dissented, contending that the buffer zone approved by the 
court was broader than that endorsed by appellate courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In grappling with the case, the state high court called the collision between 
competing constitutional interests "the most difficult and divisive subject of 
our day" and acknowledged that its ruling would be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court majority also called its decision "manifestly reasonable and 
conducive to the fostering of greater harmony in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came in the approval of an injunction that forced antiabortion 
pickets to remain across a busy, four-lane avenue from a Planned Parenthood 
clinic in Vallejo, a Solano County city east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickets had tried to dissuade women entering the clinic from having 
abortions. They gave them anti-abortion literature, shoving it into car windows 
as patients drove in, and on at least two occasions tossed them plastic 
replicas of fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state's responsibility for the health and safety of women seeking medical 
services, including abortions, extends beyond the operating room," Arabian 
wrote. "Physical or emotional intimidation of patients outside the doctor's 
office may significantly affect their course of treatment once they are 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case involved abortion, the decision has ramifications for other 
demonstrations that limit the "rights of private citizens to conduct their 
lawful business without pain or hindrance," wrote Justice Marvin Baxter, in a 
separate concurring opinion joined by Justice Ronald George. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said the kinds of confrontational actions taken by the abortion 
picketers "crossed the line from protected expression to unprotected 
interference with the lawful activities of other citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Streett, an attorney for Solano Citizens for Life, which appealed the 
case to the high court, noted that the ruling could also limit the ability of 
unions to picket. 
</P>
<P>
 In the abortion context, he said, the decision will "make it very easy" for 
clinics to get injunctions to stop any protests on their sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically all they have to allege is, 'Our patients are upset by this, they 
don't like it, they are crying, we feel they are traumatized,' " Streett said. 
"That is not going to be much of a standard at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for Planned Parenthood said courts still will have freedom to 
shape injunctions according to the facts of the case, including the 
configuration of the clinic and its proximity to protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling simply "means that patients at medical clinics have the right 
to be free of abuse, harassment and assault," said Planned Parenthood attorney 
Stephen Kostka. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Williams, former director of Solano Citizens for Life, complained 
that the court's decision will make it "extremely difficult" for anti-abortion 
groups to give abortion patients "one last chance to change their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickets have been congregating weekly across the street from the Planned 
Parenthood clinic since a Solano County Superior Court issued the permanent 
injunction in August, 1991, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the protesters cannot be heard by patients through the din of traffic, she 
said, and their numbers have dropped because "people are very discouraged by 
the lack of effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion-rights advocates have been buoyed by recent victories. In January, 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that abortion clinics can sue 
protesters for damage under a federal racketeering law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems to be part of a big wall that is coming down," said Anna Runkle, 
spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, Shasta-Diablo, which runs the Vallejo 
clinic. "It seems to be a landslide. The public and the law are finally saying 
enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 In her dissent, Kennard said the injunction banishing the protesters to the 
opposite side of the street violated their 1st Amendment rights to express 
their views. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other appellate courts cited by the majority approved of buffer 
zones, Kennard said, they also allowed a limited number of protesters within 
them or drew them narrowly enough to permit protesters to communicate with 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 By forcing the pickets to remain across the street, their message may even be 
"grossly misinterpreted" by passersby, she said. Also located across the street 
from the clinic is the office of Birthright of Vallejo/Benecia. 
</P>
<P>
 Passersby may assume that "the protest is against that organization, which 
opposes abortions, rather than against the medical clinic, which provides 
them," Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California 
said the organization could not comment on the ruling because of an undisclosed 
conflict of interest. The ACLU took no position in the case.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON CAVES IN ON TRADE VS. HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's abandonment of the idea of linking trade with China to 
human rights improvements represents a stunning reversal of the policies he 
espoused during both his 1992 presidential campaign and his first year in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as the last few weeks, in fact, Clinton Administration officials 
were insisting that, without some further and meaningful steps in human rights 
by the Beijing regime, there was no way the President could renew China's 
most-favored-nation trade privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Clinton simply caved in. And, in the process, the debacle gave 
China a chance to demonstrate the limits of U.S. power and the hollowness of 
U.S. fantasies of omnipotence. The United States found that it could not force 
China to change its human rights policies, at least not without imposing costs 
that U.S. businesses were unwilling to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great society, so large and with such built-in habits, does not change 
overnight," Clinton acknowledged Thursday, using words very similar to those 
used over the last year by the many critics of his policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of some China scholars and experts, Clinton's blending of threat 
and retreat left the United States in a worse position than if he had never 
threatened at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For the message to the world, to China's Asian neighbors and to the Chinese 
people themselves, is that Beijing can defy the United States virtually at 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is being handled in a way that is eroding our credibility with the 
Chinese," Kenneth Lieberthal, a University of Michigan China specialist, 
observed recently. "The Chinese can see that, with this Administration, when 
it's time to decide whether to hold 'em or fold 'em, it will fold. This 
Administration will take a fig leaf and give away the store." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is left hoping now that what it calls "a new policy" toward 
China will produce more results than the old one. 
</P>
<P>
 That new policy is based on what Administration officials Thursday vaguely 
called a "strategic relationship" with China -- a phrase that sounds somewhat 
like the words former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger once employed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, the Administration has made a series of concessions to 
China in hopes of winning its cooperation for some changes in its human rights 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Seattle. On the eve of that 
meeting, the Administration cleared the way for the sale of a Cray 
supercomputer to China. The Administration approved the sale of several 
U.S.-made satellites to China. And it ended a ban on high-level military 
contacts that had been imposed by the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They decided to give everything away," one U.S. official observed. "Somehow, 
there is still this view that if we just give them enough, they will do what we 
want. It just doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the last year, while making these concessions, the Administration 
held up on the one thing it believed, rightly, was the thing China wanted and 
needed most: most-favored-nation trade status, which allows tens of billions of 
dollars in Chinese exports to be sold in this country with low duties. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, China called Clinton's bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) was right when he called the 
threat to withdraw trade benefits "the economic equivalent of a nuclear bomb" 
-- that is, a weapon too powerful to use. 
</P>
<P>
 What did the United States get in exchange for its threat to withdraw 
most-favored-nation status? What human rights progress has there been? 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably little. Over the last year, there have been no new Tian An Men 
Squares. China did not open fire on civilians on the streets of Beijing. 
Chinese authorities have also taken the first steps toward allowing the 
International Committee of the Red Cross into China's prisons. And they 
released three prominent dissidents from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no one could have envisioned a year ago just how many steps China would 
take to show its disregard for the Clinton Administration and its policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Chinese security officials rounded up a series of prominent 
dissidents while Secretary of State Warren Christopher was in Beijing. In 
April, they locked up Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent advocate of 
democracy, who had been freed last September after more than 14 years in jail. 
Wei is still in detention. 
</P>
<P>
 China has refused to make even some of those human rights concessions that the 
Clinton Administration considered relatively easy to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, U.S. officials believed that China was ready to stop its 
jamming of the Voice of America and other foreign broadcasts. That action might 
come at the time of Christopher's mission in March, they believed. 
</P>
<P>
 But China has not even done that yet. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials, including veterans of the Bush Administration, question the 
entire style and underpinnings of Clinton's approach. They argue that it was 
counterproductive to confront China head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you put your fist in the face of the Chinese and tell them they have to 
do something, they tend to go rigid," said Douglas Paal, who served as director 
of Asian affairs for the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration misjudged a year ago how far China would be willing 
to go. Administration officials sincerely believed that the conditions they 
were imposing on China would be relatively easy to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chinese regime -- facing both the threat of new social unrest inside 
China and a looming struggle to see who will succeed the ailing Deng Xiaoping 
as China's paramount leader -- was unwilling to do even the things the 
Administration considered modest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration misread the strength of sentiment in the U.S. business 
community, which did not like the idea of tying renewal of the trade benefits 
to human rights in the first place and which grew increasingly threatened and 
nervous at the prospect of a cutoff in trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself bears the ultimate responsibility for being either unwilling 
or unable to impose discipline on top Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, at the time Clinton first announced his executive order on China's 
trade benefits, he told the nation: "Starting today, the United States will 
speak with one voice on China policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the behavior of his Administration over the last year has made that claim 
seem ironic and empty. 
</P>
<P>
 As Christopher was in Beijing pushing Chinese leaders for human rights 
concessions, top policy-makers in economic agencies such as the Commerce 
Department were undercutting the State Department by calling for an extension 
of China's most-favored-nation status and a break in the linkage between trade 
and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 When Christopher returned from the trip, Clinton remained largely silent. He 
made no statement supporting Christopher's effort to enforce the policy of 
pressing hard for human rights improvements -- the policy the President himself 
had adopted a year ago. But Clinton did not disavow the Christopher approach 
and support the economic team, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you have constructive engagement and be giving everything away and 
also be threatening to take away China's MFN benefits?" one U.S. official 
asked. "Talk about mixed signals." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of the blame for the U.S. retreat should be placed on Clinton. It 
must also be shared with Congress, an institution that Clinton Administration 
officials also misjudged. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a period of three years, from 1990 to 1992, Congress repeatedly passed 
laws tying renewal of China's trade benefits to improvements in human rights. 
It was what is known as a "free vote." Each time, President Bush vetoed the 
legislation, just as Congress knew he would. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for the first time, Congress has been forced to deal with the 
real-life consequences of its legislation. China failed to make significant 
human rights improvements, and that meant that the cutoff in trade benefits 
that Congress originally threatened might actually be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 In droves, Congress members retreated. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that members of Congress were willing to vote for a linkage 
between human rights and trade with China only at a time when they knew their 
legislation would be vetoed. Under the circumstances, it seems fair to conclude 
that many congressional Democrats were not serious about linking trade and 
human rights but rather were using China as a partisan issue against Bush.

FOREST CLOSURES TO MAKE FOR UNHAPPY CAMPERS; RECREATION: BUDGET CUTS HAVE SHUT 
PARTS OF ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST. SOME MAY BE TURNED AWAY THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visitors in search of serenity in the Angeles National Forest over Memorial 
Day weekend will instead be confronted by the closure of some of the most 
popular camping and picnic areas because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mt. Baldy Ranger District near Azusa, which annually attracts more 
visitors than Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks combined, 90% of the 
camping spots have been closed. Gates have been locked at Crystal Lake 
campground with its rock-work amphitheater and at the Switzer picnic area with 
its nearby 50-foot waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in areas of the forest's five districts where overnight campsites will be 
available, it will sometimes be necessary to hike for miles to reach them and 
visitors may face overflowing trash cans or dirty restrooms because of road 
closures and reduced maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest officials already are fielding angry calls from unhappy campers. And 
they are bracing for more this weekend, the traditional kickoff of the summer 
camping season, when some people will probably have to be turned away at 
entrances to the 694,000-acre forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine a station wagon loaded down with camping equipment and tents and ice 
chests, and kids are singing songs, going to the mountains . . . and then 
finding there's no place to go," said Tom Spencer, the Mt. Baldy district's 
recreation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 This fiscal year's $20-million budget is down 20% from last year, Forest 
Supervisor Michael J. Rogers said. Twenty-five of 150 temporary workers and 16 
of the 320 full-time employees have been laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just tightened up and done things with volunteers and (campground) 
concessionaires to try to keep things together, but we're at the point now 
where we're running out of miracles to pull out of the hat," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 National forests nationwide are facing similar cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget for the Forest Service is down only 3% this year from fiscal 1993. 
But inflation, combined with that reduction, has taken its toll, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The squeeze means that available campgrounds will fill faster than ever in a 
forest that draws more than 32 million visitors each year, the second most 
frequently visited national forest in the country.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expect everything to be booked up, whatever's not closed," said forest 
spokeswoman Dianne Cahir. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Mt. Baldy district have fielded more than 300 phone calls 
this week from people complaining, Spencer said. Besides Crystal Lake 
campground, Mt. Baldy officials have closed Manker campground, Glacier picnic 
area and Little Dalton picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Saugus district, 40 of 117 camping spots are unavailable because Lower 
Shake, Prospect and Zuni campgrounds have been closed. Altogether, 38% of the 
forest's 1,400 camping spots will be unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Arroyo Seco Ranger District above Arcadia, West Fork and Valley Forge 
campgrounds are closed to vehicle traffic but open to walk-ins. Locked gates 
mean that visitors have to walk three miles from parking lots to Valley Forge 
campground and five miles to West Fork campground. Maintenance workers try to 
get to the sites for cleanup once a week if they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the pits, I tell you," said Don Wopschall, the Arroyo Seco district's 
recreation lands officer.  
</P>
<P>
 The Valyermo Ranger District in the Big Pines area is bracing for the overflow 
of campers who might have headed to Crystal Lake and other now-closed 
campgrounds, said Shawn Lawler, that district's interpretive manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting we'll probably be filled at least by tonight," she said. 
"Everyone that calls, we're telling them to come as soon as they can." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has not had to close any of its 13 campgrounds, she said. But 
people can expect reduced services. "That's the only way we can keep them 
open," she said. "That's a real different mode of operation than any of us are 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Some campers are scrambling to make other plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Explorer Scout Troop 964 from Redondo Beach camped at Crystal Lake last year 
and had planned a return visit, said troop leader Sam Rahman. About 30 
teen-agers learned such things as how to start a fire with rocks and twigs, and 
how to pitch a tent.  
</P>
<P>
 "They'll go sightseeing or exploring a lot more than they would just sitting 
around a city street," Rahman said. The troop had to camp this year in a park 
in Monrovia, he said. Officials at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Los Angeles 
are also looking for another campsite, said volunteer Al Estrella, who has 
arranged for group trips to Crystal Lake for four years.

 Kissing their parents goodby, hugging lunch boxes and notebooks, 300 Jewish 
children pour into the I.E. Lichtigfeld primary school each morning through an 
iron gate and electric doors with bomb-proof glass. Police patrol the streets 
around the school in the city's lush West End neighborhood while video cameras 
monitor its hallways.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside, a few boys don yarmulkes and sit down with girls in ponytails for 
reading, writing and arithmetic, Hebrew and Judaism. Throughout their lessons, 
the children address the particular dilemma of being German and Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 "In history classes, we speak of their families. They know their parents 
didn't have any aunts and uncles or grandparents," said Alexa Brum, director of 
Frankfurt's only Jewish school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also know that after a while they will have to go out to gymnasium 
(public high school)," she said. "We teach them that it is absolutely normal to 
be Jewish and that they should be proud -- proud people who eventually have to 
decide if they want to integrate into this society or go elsewhere. Someday, 
they must make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 To stay or leave, integrate or isolate. These are the questions that plagued 
the Holocaust survivors who settled in Germany after the Nazi extermination of 
6 million European Jews, and that once again weigh on their children and 
grandchildren who see a resurgence of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in Germany and is home 
to a quarter of the republic's 40,000 Jews. But even here, Jews say they 
increasingly feel unwelcome in their own country and, occasionally, threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Unified Germany is experiencing a growing sense of national pride that 
frightens many Jews for whom nationalism harkens back to the Third Reich. They 
see Europe's most powerful country increasingly anxious that it will be 
diminished by European unity. And they watch a small but emboldened radical 
right finding resonance among Germans who seek someone to blame for their 
severe economic problems -- including the highest unemployment since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 In this climate, postwar taboos against racism and anti-Semitism are breaking 
down: In the last two years, Turkish immigrants have been killed in arson 
attacks by rightists in Moelln and Solingen; scores of Germans watched and 
applauded as arsonists set fire to a home for foreign asylum-seekers in 
Rostock, and only two weeks ago, a mob of rightists and hooligans attacked 
black Africans and destroyed a restaurant owned by Turks in Magdeburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Once-anonymous hate mail has been sent to Jewish leaders with unabashed 
signatures. And neo-Nazis fire-bombed the synagogue in Luebeck on the eve of 
Passover -- the first such attack since the Nazis' Kristallnacht rampage 
against Jews in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 After the synagogue-burning, radical-rightist politician and former SS officer 
Franz Schoenhuber said Frankfurt's Jewish leaders are to blame for 
anti-Semitism in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rats have come out of the holes," Brum said. "There has always been 
anti-Semitism, but now they dare to say it out loud and dare to throw bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 After the fatal attack in Solingen, sixth-graders at Frankfurt's Jewish school 
bared their fears in essays about being German and Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nazis want to take power over Germany," wrote 12-year-old Michaela, a 
Frankfurt native. "They scribble on the walls 'Jewish Pigs' and similar things. 
Then I realize that I am in the wrong country. Germany belongs to the Germans, 
and Jews have nothing to do here." 
</P>
<P>
 About half a million Jews lived in Germany before the Nazis were voted into 
power in 1933. Nine years later, the 30,000-member Jewish community in 
Frankfurt was officially decreed to have been eradicated. It had been a vibrant 
community of well-to-do German Jews who contributed financially and culturally 
to the city -- bankers, industrialists and intellectuals from the so-called 
Frankfurt School of social scientists -- and of Polish immigrants who provided 
craftsmen and laborers. Liberal Frankfurt even had a Jewish mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jews were not just tolerated, they were accepted," said Jewish author 
Valentin Senger. "They were a part of Frankfurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a couple years, the Nazis turned the city against Jews, Gypsies and 
anyone who did not fit the Aryan ideal, and carted them off to concentration 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Senger's apparently was the only Jewish family to survive the Third Reich in 
Frankfurt, passing as non-Jews and working in the Resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, the British and Americans set up displaced persons camps in 
Germany for survivors of Hitler's concentration camps. One of them, Zeilsheim, 
provided the base for Frankfurt's postwar Jewish community, which today numbers 
about 6,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the settlers were merchants and craftsmen from small Jewish 
communities in Poland who never meant to remain in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 They had children and reluctantly put down roots, reopening the synagogue, a 
community center, a home for the elderly, a school for their children. But they 
were always "sitting on packed bags" because they wished to leave or believed 
that one day they might have to leave. They wanted nothing to do with Germans, 
whom they considered immoral. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the children of survivors were raised in a Jewish ghetto of postwar 
Germany with all its contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Their youth organizations encouraged them to move to Israel. Their parents 
would not let them date Gentiles. But they went to German high schools, spoke 
German, held German passports. They were citizens of Germany exempted from 
military service as the offspring of Nazi victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was schizophrenic," said David Lieberberg, managing director of the 
popular music department at Frankfurt's Old Opera House. "My parents were 
always proud when I'd come home from school with A's in German." But the minute 
his sister was caught with a German boyfriend, she was sent away to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 German friends at school knew little about Jews or the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "History lessons used to go through Germany, up to the Weimar Republic, then 
move over to Russia and come back to Germany after the war," said Lieberberg, 
46. "During religion lessons in school I had a free hour. Kids said, 'What are 
you? A Jew? What's that?' They hadn't heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Largely Protestant and Roman Catholic Germany is a country with strict norms 
governing appearance and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews generally have different biblical names and darker complexions. They 
celebrate different religious holidays. And because of this, German-born Jews 
are frequently asked where they come from. In adolescence, many children of 
survivors began to challenge their parents: Why did you come to Germany? Why 
did you stay? 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents didn't have answers. They had stayed because they had stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt Jews first emerged from isolation in the fall of 1985 in what became 
known internationally as the Fassbinder Affair. Reiner Werner Fassbinder's play 
"Garbage, the City and Death" was to be staged at a local theater, and 
Frankfurt's Jews were outraged by a work they judged to be anti-Semitic. On 
opening night, they occupied the stage and closed the play down. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the public controversy marked the coming of age of the German Jewish 
community. For others, it was another way of hiding, of quieting public 
discussion. In either case, it marked the emergence of Jewish leaders who 
believed that Jews were in Germany to stay and must interact with the community 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be a conscious, proud, independent Jewish life," said Michel 
Friedman, 38, a spokesman for the Frankfurt Jewish community. "But Jewish life 
also has to be part of the common society, and there has to be a dialogue 
between Jews and non-Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last couple of years, Jewish leaders have taken political discussions 
about Jewish issues into public forums. They opened Jewish cultural events to 
non-Jews and routinely speak out against abuses of all minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always fight for integration, not for assimilation," said Ignatz Bubis, 66, 
a leader of the Frankfurt Jewish community and head of Germany's Central 
Council of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Jews say they never suffered discrimination growing up in Germany. For 
decades after the war, anti-Semitism was taboo, buried or, in some cases, 
overcome. Many Jews felt anti-Semitism more strongly elsewhere, such as in 
Poland and France, while guilt-ridden Germans handled them with kid gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 To stay or leave, integrate or isolate. Younger Jews began to make peace with 
their German heritage and to accept that they belonged to two cultures. Their 
bags were unpacked -- they meant to stay in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up here, went to school here, read German books, German is my mother 
tongue," said Josse Reich, 31, the son of Holocaust survivors. "I make fun of 
the Germans. I imitate them very well because I am them." 
</P>
<P>
 "What else could I be?" added Marc Gruenbaum, 24. "To live with conflict is 
not normal. You can't always be thinking of leaving or you can't concentrate on 
your life. When I define myself as German, I can fight for the Germany I'd like 
to have." 
</P>
<P>
 And now is the time to fight, Gruenbaum said. Jews young and old see German 
society growing more conservative and rigid since the Berlin Wall was torn down 
and a daily reminder of Germany's dark history disappeared. Increasingly, 
Germans say they want to put the past behind them, and the political shift is 
encouraging radical rightists to act on their anti-foreigner, anti-Semitic 
sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Extreme-right political parties are scoring poorly in election polls, however, 
and are looking for new issues, Jewish leaders note. With the tightening of 
asylum laws last year, they appear to be turning their attention from 
immigrants to Jews.  
</P>
<P>
 Bubis' 30-year-old daughter, Naomi, says the radical right National Democratic 
Party sought permission to hold a rally outside the Jewish Community Center 
recently to protest excessive Jewish influence in German politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could never have happened before reunification. Before, they knew no one 
would support them. Now, they feel more sympathy (for their ideas) in the 
non-Jewish community," she said, adding that the permit was denied and the 
rally never took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of the Holocaust and current upsurge in anti-Semitism made it 
difficult for Frankfurt's Jewish community to recruit a rabbi for their 
orthodox synagogue. There is no German rabbinical school, and there are no 
German rabbis. Frankfurt's West End synagogue was without a rabbi for 2 1/2 
years before members persuaded Rabbi Menachem Halevi Klein to come from Israel 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am here only for religious reasons," he said. "There are hundreds of kids 
who know nothing about Judaism, and that is my project. There are many 
Russians, and someone has to tell them that they are Jewish. There is kosher 
food." 
</P>
<P>
 But he shook his head. "It is a very difficult feeling on this ground where so 
much Jewish blood was spilled. I don't feel afraid, but I don't feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Lichtigfeld school, children sing Jewish songs and celebrate their 
heritage unfazed by the tight security measures around them. 
</P>
<P>
 But director Brum notes that 400 Russian Jewish families that were supposed to 
emigrate to Frankfurt this year have not arrived. Many stayed in Russia or 
moved to Israel, fearing anti-Semitism in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Brum, meanwhile, bought a small summer house in France a couple of years ago 
that she says gives her family a sense of security -- a place to go "if 
something happens" in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 And many Jews born and raised in Frankfurt are beginning to ask themselves 
whether they should raise their children here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my children to live in fear," David Lieberberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am German. I feel very German," Josse Reich added. "But since having a 
daughter a year ago, I don't know if I really want to stay now."

CLINTON REVERSES HIS POLICY, RENEWS CHINA TRADE STATUS; COMMERCE: PRESIDENT 
'DE-LINKS' MOST-FAVORED-NATION PRIVILEGE FROM HUMAN RIGHTS. HE ADMITS FAILURE 
OF EARLIER COURSE AND SAYS BROADER STRATEGIC INTERESTS JUSTIFY SWITCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, abandoning a central foreign policy principle of his 
Administration, announced Thursday that he has decided to "de-link" China's 
privileged trading status from its human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that China "continues to commit very serious human rights 
abuses," Clinton said that he has come to believe that broader American 
strategic interests justify the policy reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking a defensive, almost apologetic posture at a late-afternoon White 
House briefing, Clinton acknowledged that his previous approach to U.S.-China 
relations had failed and said that he intends to set a new course. 
</P>
<P>
 "That linkage has been constructive during the past year, but I believe, based 
on our aggressive contacts with the Chinese in the past several months, that we 
have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy," Clinton said. ". . . We 
need to place our relationship into a larger and more productive framework." 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, Clinton said, he will renew China's most-favored-nation status, 
meaning that Beijing can ship its exports to the United States on the same 
tariff terms as most other American trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, China exported about $31 billion worth of goods to the United 
States, running a trade surplus of $23 billion. The United States exported $8 
billion in goods to China. 
</P>
<P>
 The only limit Clinton imposed on the China trade is a ban on U.S. sales of 
Chinese-made guns and ammunition, which amounted to about $100 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton dropped the idea of forming a human rights commission to monitor 
progress in China. The Chinese rejected such a body as an insult to their 
sovereignty, and human rights groups derided it as likely to be ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 The President announced his new China policy in the White House briefing room. 
Unlike previous major presidential announcements, he appeared alone, without 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher or senior White House aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton seemed prepared to take the inevitable criticism that his change in 
course generated. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, human rights organizations and 
Chinese dissident groups immediately expressed anger and dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 Human Rights Watch (Asia) called the Clinton announcement "one more 
capitulation on human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has left his Administration looking vacillating and hypocritical, 
while the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged as hard-nosed, 
uncompromising and victorious. We're deeply disappointed by this decision," 
said Sidney Jones, executive director of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, in a particularly scathing statement, said 
that Clinton's decision "sends a clear message to the world: 'No matter what 
America says about democracy and human rights, in the final analysis profits, 
not people, matter most.' . . . America should be standing with the Chinese 
people, not their oppressors," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), an important ally of the 
President's on health care and other major policy initiatives, also quickly 
criticized Clinton's new China policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree with the decision. . . . The experience of recent years has been 
that each concession to the Chinese Communist regime encourages its 
intransigence, and I believe this will be the unfortunate result of this 
decision," Mitchell said. "It will confirm for the Chinese Communist regime the 
success of its policy of repression on human rights and manipulation on trade. 
It is likely to produce a result that is the opposite of what the President 
intends." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell added that, when Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess, he 
will introduce legislation to reverse Clinton's decision. That legislation 
probably will be similar to bills sponsored by Mitchell and Rep. Nancy Pelosi 
(D-San Francisco) during the George Bush Administration, attaching conditions 
to future renewals of China's trade status. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush repeatedly vetoed such legislation, and in 1992 Clinton accused him of 
"coddling dictators" in China. During his presidential campaign, Clinton also 
specifically endorsed the idea of imposing human rights conditions on the 
renewal of China's trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), defended the decision on policy grounds. But he 
underscored that Clinton was adopting precisely the Bush Administration policy 
that he assailed as cynical during the 1992 campaign. Renewing 
most-favored-nation status for China "is a sound, if politically embarrassing, 
decision," McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he believes he reached the right decision and said he is prepared 
to defend it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it clear to you I do not do this with rose-colored glasses 
on," Clinton said. "I know there will be, no matter which approach we take . . 
. , continuing human rights problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's answer to his critics echoed the rhetoric of the Bush and Ronald 
Reagan administrations in addressing the question of doing business with 
undemocratic regimes, whether in China or South Africa or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush and Reagan argued that engagement rather than confrontation with these 
governments was the preferable course, because any ruling group would bristle 
at being subject to outside pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Clinton gave a lengthy defense of the Bush -- and now Clinton -- 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To those who argue that in view of China's human rights abuses we should 
revoke MFN status, let me ask you the same question that I have asked myself 
over and over these last few weeks as I have studied this issue and consulted 
people of both parties who have had experience with China over many decades. 
Will we do more to advance the cause of human rights if China is isolated or if 
our nations are engaged in a growing web of political and economic cooperation 
and contacts?" Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further explaining his new policy, Clinton noted that conditions in China and 
elsewhere in Asia have changed since he signed an executive order last year 
requiring "overall significant progress" on a number of human rights fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Christopher could not certify that China had met such conditions, 
but he said that he was dropping the trade-human rights link for several 
reasons, including severe political tensions between Beijing and the Chinese 
provinces, a desire on the part of China's aging leadership to "preserve order" 
and the fact that no government responds well to outside threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that North Korea's nuclear weapons program and belligerent 
attitude toward South Korea also justify American rapprochement with Beijing in 
the interests of larger Asian security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In briefings with reporters, Clinton's advisers sought to put the best face on 
his about-face. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Rubin, the head of Clinton's National Economic Council, insisted 
that the decision "was not made as a result of pressure" from the American 
business community. But he also predicted that the policy will open the way for 
greater trade between American companies and China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (China) will become an ever larger and more important trading 
partner," Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beijing, a Western diplomat said that Clinton's curb on sales of Chinese 
guns and ammunition may not hurt the Chinese small-arms industry much because 
"exports to the U.S. increased significantly last year when the Brady bill was 
under consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 "They (importers of Chinese arms) may have been stocking up in anticipation of 
this type of thing. They may have defended themselves by stocking up. The 
handwriting has been on the wall for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Clinton's action will alienate leaders of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army, the diplomat replied: "From the military point of view this is 
nowhere as bad as it could have been. It could have been much worse. It doesn't 
strike directly at the military and the important interests they represent. . . 
. This will be seen as light."

UNWILLING FIGHTER IN WAR ON SECONDHAND SMOKE; HEALTH: ROSITA GARCIA SAYS SHE 
GOT CANCER AS WAITRESS IN A BAR. BUT EX-EMPLOYER HAS FOUGHT OFF WORKERS' COMP 
CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosita Garcia never wanted to be a poster girl for the fight against tobacco. 
But here she is, living testimony in the debate over the dangers of secondhand 
smoke: the cocktail waitress who never touched a cigarette but got lung cancer 
after 11 years of serving drinks in the blue haze of a smoky airport bar. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not how she wants to be remembered. At 39, she is a very private 
woman, a former fitness buff (she quit exercising when the cancer was 
discovered) who hates to be thought of as being sick. She does not look sick; 
there is color in her cheeks, her dark eyes are bright, her waistline is full 
-- a sign that she is again eating well. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the evidence is there, if one looks close enough. She wears her 
reddish-brown hair in a pixie cut, not by design but by necessity -- it is just 
growing back after chemotherapy and radiation. With every few sentences, she 
lets out a sputtering cough. Lately, she says, her chest has been hurting. 
Sometimes, she must excuse herself to vomit. 
</P>
<P>
 The coldest proof of all sits in the medical file that Garcia keeps in the 
closet of her tiny government-subsidized apartment in Daly City, a 
working-class suburb just south of San Francisco. Although her disease, 
diagnosed nearly three years ago, is confined to a single lung and is not 
getting worse, neither is it getting better. Her tumors, reduced to scar tissue 
by radiation, may recur. Her oncologist says she is lucky to have survived. Her 
prognosis: Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia rarely looks in the file. She does not want to think about what it 
says. "I don't believe that," she says optimistically. "I think I'm getting 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's plight provides a snapshot of the human side of the emotional 
secondhand smoke debate. Last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
declared secondhand smoke a human carcinogen, saying that it causes 3,000 lung 
cancer deaths a year. Health advocacy groups put the annual total death toll at 
53,000 from secondhand smoke, including deaths from various forms of cancer as 
well as heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these figures and several hundred scientific studies documenting the 
ill effects of secondhand smoke, the tobacco industry counters with research 
showing that it is little more than a nuisance. As a consequence, Garcia and 
others who count themselves as its victims must battle not only disease, but 
also skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 For Garcia, the fight comes with a price tag: $26,889. That is the cost of her 
medical care. She is seeking this amount, plus her weekly wages, in a workers' 
compensation suit that is languishing in the bureaucracy while she lives on 
disability checks of $600 a month. Her former employer, Host Marriott, which 
operates the bars where Garcia worked for more than a decade, thus far has 
successfully fought the claim, saying Garcia did not get sick at work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Francisco airport, a handful of Garcia's former colleagues have 
waged a losing battle to clean the barroom air. Ironically, the airport has won 
plaudits for its aggressive anti-smoking policy; in 1991, it became the first 
airport in the nation to ban tobacco in all public places -- with one notable 
exception: bars. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two years there was nowhere else for smokers to go. Then in 1993, 
the airport began installing ventilated smoking rooms. Although airport 
officials could have banned tobacco in the bars, they left that decision to 
Host Marriott, which after a trial ban chose to permit it. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Economics. Bars lose money when patrons cannot smoke. Customers 
complained. Tips got so low that even the bartenders -- many of whom say the 
smoke makes them sick -- asked to have smoking back. 
</P>
<P>
 "No smoking did not go over well," said Nancy Wood, a Host Marriott official. 
"We had a very hard time explaining to our client base, which is largely 
international travelers, why they couldn't smoke in the bar." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a total fight in anger and futility," said Elizabeth Voigt, a friend 
of Garcia and former airport bartender. Voigt says she also is a victim of 
secondhand smoke, but unlike Garcia, she does not trace her illness solely to 
tobacco. Like many victims, she has an underlying medical disorder -- a heart 
condition -- that is exacerbated by secondhand smoke. She has developed a 
phrase for herself: "I am," she says, "a disabled American who cannot be around 
secondhand smoke."  
</P>
<P>
 Voigt is recovering from heart surgery at Stanford University Hospital. 
Although Host Marriott officials say they went to great lengths to accommodate 
her -- installing ventilation and a separate time clock in a smoke-free area -- 
Voigt complains that passengers and airline employees are protected while she 
and other bartenders are not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a human being?" she asks, her voice laced with sarcasm. "I don't 
have a heart? I don't have lungs?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle at the San Francisco airport typifies a nationwide wrestling 
match over the issue of secondhand smoke. While more workplaces are banning 
tobacco use, in restaurants, bars and other quarters, matters of health collide 
with matters of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Money often wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, what is sufficient proof for the medical Establishment may not be 
good enough in a courtroom, as Garcia's faltering workplace injury claim 
reveals. The case, which is hung up on a technicality, pits the word of a noted 
researcher -- who says Garcia's lung cancer was caused by secondhand smoke -- 
against the word of a Host Marriott doctor, who says it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, there have been dozens of lawsuits and workers' compensation cases 
filed by victims of secondhand smoke, including a recent $650-million wrongful 
death suit filed against tobacco manufacturers by the heirs of a Mississippi 
barber. Although no one is tracking the results, there have been some 
victories, particularly in California, which has long been considered a leader 
in the anti-smoking movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Schiller, a former Los Angeles teacher whose lungs were so damaged by 
secondhand smoke that she has difficulty talking, won $29,999 after a workers' 
compensation judge found that smoke from a teachers lounge had drifted into her 
classroom and left her disabled. She now coordinates a statewide network of 
secondhand smoke victims.

 Avatar Ubhi is a 58-year-old San Francisco Bay Area waiter who had a heart 
attack after years of working in a smoky restaurant. He won a $90,000 
settlement shortly after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released 
preliminary data deeming secondhand smoke a human carcinogen. He now owns a 
smoke-free restaurant in Sausalito. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every Schiller and Ubhi, anti-smoking advocates say, there is a Garcia 
-- a victim who fights and gets nowhere, or worse, one who is afraid to fight 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many, many more (victims)," said Juliette Linzer, project director 
at one of the Bay Area affiliates of the American Lung Assn. After learning of 
Garcia's case, Linzer won a $40,000 state grant last year to create a group 
called BREATH -- Bar and Restaurant Employees Against Tobacco Hazards. But the 
group, which hoped to change smoking policies, met with little success; 
bartenders and waiters are often afraid that if they speak out, they will be 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got a call from somebody at a casino in Nevada who told me that she's 
the only one who is willing to speak up and say anything, and she's scared for 
her job," Linzer said. "She told me that all of her co-workers face what she 
does -- they have trouble breathing, they have shortness of breath, sinus 
problems, headaches and dizziness, and on days when they don't work, they don't 
experience these symptoms."

 To Rosita Garcia, this is a familiar, painful tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father always warned her about cigarettes. She came to San Francisco from 
the Philippines to live with him when she was 16. He was a smoker, but never 
around his children. Although smoking never made him sick -- and there is no 
history of cancer in the Garcia family -- David Garcia begged his children not 
to pick up his unhealthful habit. Often, he would show them pictures of lungs 
blackened by years of smoke. Young Rosita got the message. 
</P>
<P>
 She left home at 18. After a series of jobs -- waitressing at Woolworth's, 
assembling yo-yos, working as a nurse's aide -- she was hired by Host Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 This was 1980, and nobody was thinking much about secondhand smoke. Garcia was 
24. She was jogging and doing aerobics. She thought she was in great health, 
despite the incessant headaches that came on at work. Anyway, the money was too 
good to leave -- about $100 a day including tips. Often, she would joke with 
her smoking customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably catch cancer," she would say. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign that something was wrong came in the summer of 1991. The 
airport had gone smoke-free a few months earlier. For the 31,000 workers and 
88,000 travelers who pass through each day -- the majority of them nonsmokers 
-- the policy made San Francisco International a much nicer place. For cocktail 
waitresses, the new rule created an ironic backlash; it made dirty air even 
dirtier by driving smokers into the bars. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, a hacking, dry cough kept her awake. The first attack came on the 
afternoon of Aug. 8, as she was working her regular 4 p.m. to midnight shift at 
the Hub Bar, one of the airport's busiest. "It felt like there was a bubble 
inside my right chest and it just burst." 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor said it was pneumonia. After two weeks of antibiotics and coughing 
up sputum streaked with blood, she went back to the hospital. As she was 
waiting for an X-ray, it happened again. Her chest hurt so much that she 
thought it was a heart attack. There were more tests -- X-rays, bronchoscopy 
(in which the doctors threaded a tube through her nose to examine her lungs), 
and then a biopsy. Chemotherapy and 37 consecutive days of radiation treatment 
lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 24, 1991, the doctor called. She talked medical talk: squamous cell 
carcinoma, a right hilar mass extending into the mediastinum. Garcia's head was 
swirling. "The only words I understood were: 'So we will call it cancer. You 
have cancer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a bare-walled government office in the San Francisco Civic Center, the 
details of Garcia's disease and treatment are revealed in a three-inch-thick 
sheaf of paperwork, Workers' Compensation Case SFU O360532. Here, dueling 
medical reports -- each buttressed by scientific research -- debate the cause 
of Garcia's lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of a nonsmoker getting lung cancer is 1 in 250, far lower than the 
1-in-8 risk for a smoker, according to Lawrence Garfinkel, a consultant to the 
American Cancer Society. And of all diseases that may be caused by secondhand 
smoke, the link to lung cancer is most firmly established. But, Garfinkel 
notes, "any one case is hard to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 The key question for Garcia, in the cumbersome language of state bureaucrats, 
is whether her disability is "the result of occupation, either as an industrial 
accident or as an occupational disease." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, said Dr. Christine Angeles, the Kaiser Permanente physician who first 
treated Garcia. Angeles based her conclusion on Garcia's account that she had 
been exposed to excessive secondhand smoke at work. 
</P>
<P>
 No, said Dr. Irene Danse, who was hired by Host Marriott lawyers to examine 
Garcia. Noting that Garcia is Filipino, Danse wrote in her report that Asian 
women, "for some reason that has not been defined," seem prone to lung cancer. 
Citing a study that found Garcia's workplace exposure to be equivalent to 
smoking one cigarette per day, Danse concluded: "I cannot link her lung cancer 
to her job." 
</P>
<P>
 To counter that assertion, Garcia's lawyer hired Stanton A. Glantz, professor 
of medicine at UC San Francisco and one of the nation's most respected 
researchers on the issue of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz reviewed Garcia's medical records. He found that she had only 
incidental exposure to secondhand smoke at home, that she had no exposure to 
other toxic agents -- such as asbestos or radon -- that might have caused her 
cancer. He dismissed the study Danse cited as flawed and said she had ignored 
"large and compelling scientific literature." Garcia's cancer, he concluded, 
was caused "in major part, by her exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at 
her place of employment." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a problem with Glantz's report. He is a Ph.D., not a medical 
doctor, and he never examined Garcia. So Host Marriott persuaded a workers' 
compensation judge to strike his testimony. The judge also ruled that it was 
too late for Garcia to be examined by a medical doctor. That was in March, 
1993, and the question of whether Glantz will be permitted to testify has 
lingered on appeal. Without Glantz, Garcia's lawyer says, he has no case.  
</P>
<P>
 Tom McBirnie, a staff attorney for the Workers' Compensation Board, suspects 
that Garcia's claim has been delayed in part because workers' compensation law 
is not equipped to deal with the emerging science of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we basically see," McBirnie said, "are bad backs and stress claims." 
</P>
<P>
 In his small, cluttered office at Moffitt Hospital, Glantz grows furious when 
he talks about the judge's ruling. Leaning back in his chair, he shakes his 
curly mop of gray hair, says he does not understand how any doctor can be 
allowed to examine Garcia and render an "expert opinion," while his words, 
based on a career of research, do not count. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous!" he thunders. "A cheap procedural trick." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not much has changed at the San Francisco airport since Garcia served her last 
drink nearly three years ago. The fight over secondhand smoke in the bars is 
pretty much over. One bar went smoke-free after airline employees complained, 
and the bartenders who work there say they are losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone is carrying on Garcia's legacy, it is Michelle Barron. She is the 
sole bartender in a tiny cocktail lounge, a peach-and-burgundy place where 
double screwdrivers can be had for a dollar extra, and she is surreptitiously 
waging her own war on smokers. Although smoking is permitted in her bar, she 
has plastered it with no smoking signs. Her bosses have made peace with her by 
looking the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Wednesday morning, a passenger in khakis and a golf cap came into 
her bar and ordered a gin and tonic. "There's no smoking anywhere around here, 
is there?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Barron said simply, and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there is smoking down the hall, in one of four new glass-enclosed 
smoking rooms that resemble smoky fishbowls. One airport official said he spent 
30 minutes inside one "and my throat was scratchy for the next three days." 
</P>
<P>
 The rooms are not a big hit with smokers. "This," said one, "is exactly like 
people felt when they were forced to sit in the back of the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the balance the San Francisco airport has struck -- a balance that 
tips largely in favor of nonsmokers, yet still fails to protect everyone. Other 
airports, including Memphis, Tenn., and Dallas-Ft. Worth, have gone completely 
smoke-free, and Los Angeles International Airport is planning to do the same. 
But from his corner office, with a sweeping view of the runways, the airport's 
general manager, a frenetic engineer named Louis Turpen, says more restrictions 
in San Francisco are not likely anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it perfect?" he asks. "No, it is not perfect. But I think we have done it 
as well as it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Garcia, she spends her days visiting with friends and family, reading 
her collection of medical texts and investigating various alternative remedies 
to improve her health. She has tried tree bark juice and herbal treatments, 
even capsules containing ground-up shark cartilage, which is being hawked by a 
doctor on the theory that "sharks don't get cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 She would like someday to return to work -- not as a cocktail waitress, but 
perhaps in health care. Her dream of becoming a nurse seems beyond reach -- she 
does not have the money for school -- but she has enrolled in an eight-month 
course to become a medical technician. She starts June 13, and is hoping that 
school will mark a new beginning.  
</P>
<P>
 She misses her aerobics, and being able to go out dancing and partying with 
friends, but she sounds upbeat. "I'm a very happy person, very happy," she 
says. "Right now, I live every day and I don't have to worry that I have to go 
to work and face the smoking world." Deadly Consequences 
</P>
<P>
 Epidemiologists -- people who study patterns of disease -- estimate that 
secondhand smoke claims 53,000 lives each year, including 3,000 from lung 
cancer and as many as 40,000 from heart disease. Here are the leading causes of 
death in the United States, using the most recently available statistics for 
each. 02,26,23 Cause (Year) Deaths (in thousands) Smoking (1993) 434 Alcohol

CLINTON AIDE RESIGNS OVER GOLF OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House administrative chief David Watkins, a longtime aide to President 
Clinton who hails from his hometown of Hope, Ark., resigned Thursday after 
officials learned that he had taken a military helicopter to play golf in rural 
Maryland earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, saying that he was "very upset" when he learned about Watkins' trip, 
revealed his aide's resignation during a press conference called to announce a 
decision on most-favored-nation trading status for China. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the round trip was estimated at $5,000. Clinton promised that the 
Treasury will be fully reimbursed, though it was unclear whether the money 
would come from Watkins or other private sources. "The taxpayers will be made 
whole," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins, the former head of an advertising agency in Little Rock, Ark., 
handled all the advertising for Clinton's initial gubernatorial campaigns in 
Arkansas and was involved in his presidential campaign as well. He also has 
been a co-investor with the Clintons, particularly in a highly lucrative 
cellular telephone franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 He now becomes the latest in a series of Arkansas friends of the Clintons 
whose actions have subjected the President to political embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins might have gone unscathed but for editors of the Frederick (Md.) 
News-Post, who heard Tuesday that a White House helicopter was at the nearby 
Holly Hills Country Club and sent a photographer in hopes of catching a glimpse 
of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the paper took -- and published in its Wednesday editions -- a 
photograph of Watkins and two other White House aides, dressed in golfing 
clothes and carrying their clubs, getting into the helicopter as a Marine in 
full dress uniform stands by, saluting. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the paper reported that officials of the country club had 
declined to identify the visitors. But, when the photograph was published, 
Republican officials quickly recognized Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two officials were Alphonso Maldon Jr., head of the White House 
military office, and Navy Cmdr. Richard Cellon, the commanding officer at Camp 
David, Md., the presidential retreat located near the country club. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, Maryland Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett, a Republican whose district 
includes the golf course, had zeroed in on the issue and congressional 
Republicans were in full cry, demanding hearings, an official investigation and 
a full accounting of all staff use of military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "The photo of two Marine guards saluting a golf bag as it was carried up the 
helicopter stairs is truly a picture that's worth a thousand words," Bartlett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf course is about an 80-minute drive northwest of Washington. Former 
President George Bush frequently played at the course when staying at Camp 
David. The helicopter came and went from the Pentagon, which is about a 
10-minute drive south of Watkins' residence in the Georgetown neighborhood of 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, officials reacted with anger and incredulity. Watkins' 
actions are painfully reminiscent of the misuse of official airplanes that led 
to the resignation of John H. Sununu as White House chief of staff in the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, mindful of the Sununu episode, had issued a directive to White House 
staff members early in his presidency intended to limit use of military 
transportation by senior government officials. As head of the White House 
administrative apparatus, the task of enforcing that directive fell to Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The outing is the only time that Watkins is known to have used military 
transportation for such purposes, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two other aides involved, Maldon has been reprimanded and reassigned 
for his role, said White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers. No action will be 
taken against Cellon because it has been determined that he had done nothing 
wrong, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the trip Wednesday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Arthur 
Jones told the Baltimore Sun that the three officials had flown to the course 
to make preparations for Clinton to visit it this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, Myers backed away from that account, saying that Jones had 
answered the question in "good faith" based on a written statement from a 
Watkins deputy, but that "I think we've gone beyond that now." 
</P>
<P>
 After Clinton's press conference Thursday, he met with Watkins for 30 minutes. 
White House officials said it was "not an easy meeting" for Clinton because of 
the time the two men have known each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marked the second time in a year in which Watkins' conduct has 
come under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he was reprimanded for his role in the firing of several employees 
of the White House travel office after an investigation by White House aide 
John Podesta found that Watkins had "demonstrated an insensitivity to the 
appearance of favoritism." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins had granted a contract to a company headed by a longtime acquaintance 
and former client, had placed an inexperienced former campaign aide in a role 
for which she was not qualified and had provided incomplete information to 
White House spokesmen. 
</P>

CHICAGO CANCELS THE STAMPS -- AND SOME OF THE LETTERS; POSTAL SERVICE: 
UNDELIVERED MAIL IS FOUND BURNING OR ROTTING. NEW MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING ARE 
ORDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mail here has lately seemed defiant of the laws that govern time and 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent bill payments disappear into the void while bank statements from 1988 
suddenly show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of undelivered letters have been discovered in the oddest 
spots: smoldering under a railroad viaduct, rotting in a field, in the back of 
a postal carrier's truck, stockpiled in a mailman's suburban condo. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times last week, people opened collection boxes around town only to be 
greeted by smoke streaming from the slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody doesn't want the mail to be delivered," said Mark Szumny, rolling 
his eyes heavenward for clues while his daughters, one 6 years old, one 5, 
jumped rope on the sidewalk on a waning afternoon. The girls at play reminded 
him of something. An old friend of his wife's sent cash when each was born. The 
money has yet to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the dawn of the U.S. postal system, tales of astounding mishaps and 
misroutings have become part of American folklore. But those were isolated 
instances. Not so here. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chicago may have slipped from Second City to third, it ranks highest 
on the Mail Misery index. A recent postal survey found customers more unhappy 
with service in this city than anywhere else in the nation. The satisfaction 
rating stands at 69%. The next-most troubled city, New York, scored 76%. Los 
Angeles, fourth from the bottom, received 81%. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven postal wizards from around the country were imported in March to 
figure out what's wrong here. Three top managers were transferred out this 
month. Next week, supervisors and window clerks are scheduled to take training 
courses, and in coming months each station is supposed to recruit a citizens 
advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service takes the uproar seriously, said Rufus F. Porter, interim 
postmaster for Chicago. About 1,500 early retirements in 1992 and this year's 
severe winter took their toll, but mostly, he said, "it's a matter of bad work 
habits on the part of our employees. It is embedded in the culture . . . and 
that was a direct result of management inattention." 
</P>
<P>
 The locals, some of whom have been complaining for nearly a decade, remain 
pessimistic. "The post office has not reached out to private consultants. It is 
still trying to use its own people," Chicago Alderwoman Mary Ann Smith said. 
"They've had shake-ups before but every time things -- as we say in this office 
-- returned to abnormal." 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, the Postal Service is blamed for something else, from the lack of an 
audience for the Bozo TV show -- hardly anyone got tickets -- to the decision 
of a mail-order cosmetics firm to move to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the sizable Polish community report with fury that their letters to 
the homeland are ransacked frequently for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive from the Chicago branch of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank showed up at 
a golf tournament a few weeks ago only to be told, to his embarrassment, that 
his registration fee was never paid. He had mailed a $230 check. He sent it to 
the right place, but it nonetheless later made its way back to him, with a 
notation inquiring: "Wrong address?" 
</P>
<P>
 Smith fumes. "We're not asking them to cure cancer," she said. "We're not 
asking them to build pyramids. We're asking them to move pieces of paper from 
one place to another." 
</P>
<P>
 The first report from the postal task force, released earlier this month, 
found the worst problems at five North Side, lakefront post offices where 40% 
of the mail faced delays. Service there is already improving, the 
trouble-shooters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those ZIP codes, however, are by no means the only ones that need help. 
</P>
<P>
 David J. Craven, a 35-year-old attorney in the downtown Loop, specializes in 
customs and international trade law, but he has also become a reluctant 
connoisseur of postal blunders. 
</P>
<P>
 On a conference table, he laid out a succession of envelopes mailed this month 
to his office from nearby skyscrapers. He called attention to the postmarks and 
the dates they were stamped "received." 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven days from 19 W. Jackson," he said. "Seven days from 225 W. Wacker. 
That's next door. Twelve days from 321 S. Plymouth Court." 
</P>
<P>
 He has noticed spotty deliveries since 1991, but by January and February, the 
quality of service had deteriorated dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 3, for the first time in its seven-year history, his office received 
no mail at all. Craven was waiting for a U.S. Customs opinion in a $5-million 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 He checked with another law firm on the 20th floor. Also no mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven telephoned the post office. When he got no satisfactory response, he 
took another tack. He wrote a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, the written complaint was returned to its sender. The address 
of the central post office-433 W. Van Buren -- was scratched out. The envelope 
was stamped "NO SUCH ADDRESS." 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally, hey . . . " Craven said, spreading his arms wide. "I understand 
occasionally. It's a hard job. I understand that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I deal with Customs. I have 7-, 14- and 21-day deadlines to reply to 
things. They usually use the date of the mailing." 
</P>
<P>
 He has upgraded his office fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
 To the northwest, in the leafy Belmont-Cragin section, the brick bungalows and 
two-flats are filled with working-class families trading postal horror tales, 
fueled by the knowledge that 40,000 pieces of their mail turned up last month 
at their carrier's house. Firefighters found it when they answered an emergency 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the route, Diane Gaertner had missed two of the paychecks that her 
employer, an air-conditioning and heating company, sent to her apartment. "It 
affects my life when I live from check to check and I've got a son to raise," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandmother's Social Security checks stopped coming too. "Grandma's in a 
nursing home," Gaertner said. "We would take care of it, but it meant calling 
them, calling the Social Security office, calling them back, them screaming at 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Nestor Lugardo's family had been wondering why none of their relatives in 
Puerto Rico had written to them in the two months since they moved here. 
</P>
<P>
 Peregrina Aguilar, 17, found out she had missed her April payment on her 
Prosser High School class ring; she didn't get the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 And one woman, whose husband is so chagrined she begged for anonymity, told of 
an $80 check he received two weeks ago, dated 1988. It was for snowplow 
services that winter. "I badgered that lady for months," the wife quotes him as 
telling her. "She always said the check was in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
 For once, it really was. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier, Robert Beverly, is suspected of having sifted through the mail 
for items he could sell or otherwise turn to profit, Porter said. He has been 
charged with felony theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly used his own car, an older Jaguar, on his route, which made hauling 
the stacks home that much easier. The Chicago district just doesn't have enough 
vehicles to supply one to every employee. 
</P>
<P>
 But his replacement, Eddie Ponce, had a regulation truck on a recent day. 
"They told me, 'Keep it clean,' " she said, when they assigned her to the 
route.

ELECTIONS / SENATE; AT $6.3 MILLION, HUFFINGTON SETS SPENDING MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Michael Huffington has set a new record for campaign spending, 
contributing $6.3 million of his personal fortune to his Republican bid for the 
U.S. Senate, according to finance records released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 National political observers said Thursday they believe that Huffington's 
tally is the most personal money ever spent by a candidate in a Senate primary. 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) already held the record for the most personal 
money ever spent on a House race when he financed almost all of the $5.4 
million bill in his 1992 House race. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not really a lot when you consider the size of the state of 
California," said Bob Schuman, Huffington's campaign manager. "(Sen.) Dianne 
Feinstein has spent over $30 million since 1990 and we will never, in the 
course of this campaign, match her spending." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign has maintained a low profile through the spring with no 
major Democratic challengers to draw her out before the June 7 primary. She has 
been diligent, however, in attending fund-raisers coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the time she took office and last week, Federal Election Commission 
records indicate that Feinstein raised about $5.5 million. The former San 
Francisco mayor added almost $1 million more to her coffers last Friday when 
President Clinton headlined a Beverly Hills fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have spent most of their money already. Feinstein reported 
that about $2.5 million remains in her campaign account; Huffington has about 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At this pace, the race could be headed for another record as the most 
expensive Senate contest in history, especially since the fall election is 
certain to be more of a pitched battle than either candidate has seen in the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials said that they expect to be outspent by 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's fortune, from the sale of his family's Texas oil-and-gas company, 
has helped him become the front-runner among the Republicans. The bulk of his 
spending has gone into statewide television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has outspent his nearest Republican rival, former Orange County 
Congressman William E. Dannemeyer, almost 20 to 1, according to the Thursday 
reports. Dannemeyer's campaign has cost about $350,000, including at least 
$55,000 from his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign released a new television commercial Thursday that 
attacks Feinstein's record on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad asserts that Feinstein voted to release 18 convicted killers while she 
served on a state parole board and that her support for the death penalty is a 
politically inspired flip-flop. 
</P>
<P>
 A problem for Huffington's campaign, however, is that Feinstein is in her 
third consecutive statewide campaign and many of the attacks have been tested 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed Sen. John Seymour, whom Feinstein defeated in 1992, also broadcast a 
television commercial about Feinstein's record on the five-member state women's 
parole board, where she served from 1960 to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 race for governor, Pete Wilson attacked Feinstein for her death 
penalty opinion. Feinstein acknowledges that she opposed the death penalty in 
the 1960s, but changed her mind before 1973 when she served on the San 
Francisco Board of Supervisors and cast a controversial vote in favor of a 
capital punishment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was over 20 years ago," said Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager. 
"To imply that it was for political advantage . . . I guess if you have a lot 
of money you don't care about lying."

STREISAND'S 4 CANCELED SHOWS NOW SET FOR JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thursday will now be opening night for Barbra Streisand's celebrated Anaheim 
Pond concert engagement, and four shows postponed this week have been 
rescheduled to July, the singer's manager announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The engagement will pick up as scheduled with the Thursday performance and one 
June 4 in Anaheim, and Streisand will return to the Pond after engagements in 
San Jose and New York next month to make up the missed performances, said Marty 
Erlichman, her manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel terrible that these postponements may cause severe scheduling problems 
for so many of my fans who have waited for so long for me to perform live," 
Streisand, who has suffered from viral tracheolaryngitis for nearly a week, 
said in a written statement released late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fans had flown to Southern California from across the country 
specifically for the Streisand concerts, which had been scheduled to begin last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Streisand had hoped to be well enough to begin the Anaheim shows 
tonight, Erlichman announced that the singer's doctors advised her to postpone 
tonight's show as well as scheduled appearances Sunday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the four postponed shows will be honored on July 18, 20, 22 and 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 If needed, refunds for the postponed shows will be made at points of purchase 
beginning Tuesday for full face value and Ticketmaster's service fee, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The change of dates means that Streisand's tour -- her first in nearly three 
decades and, she says, her last -- presumably will end at the Pond. The 
notoriously stage-shy performer had been scheduled to end the six-city tour at 
New York's Madison Square Garden in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation had been that any postponed shows would be made up between planned 
June 7 and 9 shows in San Jose and the start of Streisand's run at New York's 
Madison Square Garden beginning June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it became necessary to move four Anaheim shows, that became 
impossible because of Streisand's refusal to perform on consecutive nights and 
because of the time needed to take her elaborate stage sets across the country.

UNIVERSITY PAINTERS OBLITERATE CONTROVERSIAL MALCOLM X MURAL; PUBLIC ART: RIOT 
POLICE ACCOMPANY CLEANUP CREW OVERNIGHT. SCHOOL REJECTS STUDENTS' PROTESTS, 
SAYING THAT THE REMOVAL OF EMBLEMS OF BIGOTRY IS NOT AN INFRINGEMENT ON FREE 
SPEECH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the dead of night early Thursday, San Francisco State University painters 
escorted by riot police obliterated a controversial mural of Malcolm X because 
it contained symbols considered by university officials to be anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that it was not an infringement of free speech to remove emblems of 
bigotry on artwork the university itself had commissioned, President Robert A. 
Corrigan ordered the mural removed after student leaders failed to take action 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural, painted on a university building and unveiled last week, included 
Stars of David inset with dollar signs -- outraging Jewish students and 
highlighting ethnic divisions on the multicultural campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This university absolutely will not tolerate expressions of hate," Corrigan 
said. "Intolerance and prejudice are abhorrent to our deepest values as 
individuals and as a community." 
</P>
<P>
 Some African American students fought to keep the mural, twice rescuing it 
from campus paint crews before it was finally sanded off the wall of the 
student union. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the depiction of the assassinated leader, members of the Pan African 
Student Union said the symbols were not anti-Jewish, but a reflection of 
Malcolm's anti-Zionist views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intentions were not to hurt anyone," said Troy Nkrumah, a student from 
Inglewood who is coordinator of the Pan African Student Union. "All art is open 
to interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jewish students and community members disagreed. "This is a state-funded 
university and state funds should not be used to portray hateful images," said 
Eloise Magenheim, a recent graduate who stood with a protest sign near the site 
of the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 Removal of the mural raised the thorny question of whether racist or bigoted 
statements are protected under the 1st Amendment right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 But legal experts and scholars echoed the view of university officials that, 
in this case, the constitutional right to free expression did not apply because 
the mural was commissioned and paid for by the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a situation where university officials went into an artist's 
studio and painted over his work," said Albert Elsen, a professor of art law 
and art history at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Thomas Grey, a Stanford professor of constitutional law, likened it 
to "hiring someone to write a brochure about the university and then editing 
what was said." 
</P>
<P>
 "You might not like the fact that they edited your message, but they have the 
legal right to decide what picture of the university they want to project. 
There's no 1st Amendment issue there." 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU lawyers seconded that legal interpretation, but Northern California 
director Dorothy Ehrlich said she was disturbed by the university's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "This controversy has exposed a great deal of tension and intolerance on 
campus, and it seems to me that simply painting over the offending remarks in 
the dead of night is not good enough," Ehrlich said. "It seems the lesson given 
here (by the university) is that the way to avoid controversy is to not allow 
any provocative expression." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began a week ago Thursday when the mural by painter Senay 
Dennis was unveiled on what would have been Malcolm X's 69th birthday. The 
artwork, placed near a mural of Cesar Chavez on the wall of the student union, 
cost the university $1,500 -- but the final design had not been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominated by the face of Malcolm X, the 10-foot-tall mural included a yellow 
Star of David near the words "African blood," as well as the stars with dollar 
signs and skulls and crossbones along the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The first attack on the mural came the following day, when English professor 
Lois Lyles protested by trying to paint the words "Stop Fascism" in red next to 
the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she could finish, she was stopped by supporters of the mural, and, in 
the ensuing fracas, paint was splattered on Malcolm's face. The professor was 
arrested and charged with vandalism and battery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to write on that wall, 'Stop Fascism,' to protest the anti-Semitic 
content of the mural," explained Lyles, who is African American. "Anti-Semitism 
is an insult to the black political movement."  
</P>
<P>
 Lyles said the anti-Jewish expressions were only the latest example of tension 
between African American and Jewish students. She said anti-Semitic remarks are 
common on campus; some Jewish students have said they feel unwelcome at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Corrigan had hoped the Student Union Governing Board would take 
action to remove the offending symbols. But three times the panel was unable to 
muster a quorum amid charges that some members had been intimidated into not 
showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, Corrigan had had enough and ordered the mural removed. But by that 
time, members of the Pan African Student Union had taken up a vigil in front of 
the mural. Backers of the artwork had also tethered the doors of the student 
union from the outside so they could not be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, several dozen riot police broke through the glass 
door of the building from inside and cordoned off the mural so that university 
workers could paint over it. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the mural, who had remained through the night, washed off 
the first coat of paint with water and Malcolm's face reappeared. The painters 
came back and covered it a second time. On Wednesday afternoon, students 
scrubbed off the paint and restored the mural yet again. 
</P>
<P>
 The police and painters returned Thursday at 4 a.m. This time, they were armed 
with sanders, paint thinner and scrapers. They removed the mural and covered 
the space with a coat of gray paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day Thursday, students gathered at the site and debated the 
merits of the mural and its destruction. Soon, the gray space was covered with 
pictures and handwritten signs taped to the wall, including a photograph of the 
mural with the words "CENSORED by Administration" placed over Malcolm's lips.

WILSON BACKS IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE; REFERENDUM: THE MEASURE WOULD DENY PUBLIC 
EDUCATION AND SOME MEDICAL CARE TO ILLEGAL RESIDENTS. THE GOVERNOR SAYS HE 
WOULD WELCOME A CONSTITUTIONAL TEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson indicated his support Thursday for a proposed November ballot 
measure that would deny public education and non-emergency medical care to 
illegal immigrants in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said passage of the initiative would not result in children of illegal 
immigrants being kicked out of schools as predicted by some opponents. Instead, 
the governor told reporters that the measure would probably provoke a lawsuit 
to test the constitutionality of denying the use of state tax dollars to 
educate illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be delighted to see a test of that kind," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the petition drive, Save Our State, say they have collected enough 
signatures to qualify the initiative for the November ballot. While reserving 
the right to differ on specific provisions, Wilson said: "I think I'd probably 
vote 'yes' on it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative qualifies for the ballot, it is likely to play a significant 
role in the fall campaign for governor. The Democratic candidates oppose the 
measure and front-runner Kathleen Brown has described it as "mean-spirited and 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Thursday, Enrique M. Loaeza, Mexico's consul general in Los 
Angeles, disputed one of the petition drive's central assumptions: that 
immigrants enter the United States to benefit from social services -- a theme 
championed by Wilson. Rather, the Mexican official reiterated the opinion of 
many experts that jobs are the principal magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly reject the notion that Mexican immigrants are driven to come here 
to have children and to gain access to primary education, emergency health care 
and citizenship," Loaeza told the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission. "The 
demand for low-cost labor brings immigrant workers seeking better incomes for 
their families." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapping up his fourth lobbying trip to Washington in five months, Wilson 
departed Thursday without any encouraging signals that the federal government 
will meet his request to reimburse California $3.1 billion for immigrant 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson announced that he will return to Washington next month to testify 
before the Senate Appropriations Committee as part of his ongoing quest to get 
Congress to pay for health, education and incarceration costs associated with 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor is counting on Washington to fill a $3.1-billion hole 
in his proposed 1994-95 budget even though most federal lawmakers predict that 
there is little or no chance that Congress will approve even a fraction of that 
amount in time for state budget deliberations this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you make that statement and throw in the towel, you can be 
virtually assured that you will not get a damned thing," Wilson said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was buoyed by reports that a bipartisan group of 10 senators joined to 
press for increased immigrant funding and that Texas became the fifth state to 
announce plans to sue the federal government to recover immigration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a member of the Appropriations Committee, 
said the senators are pushing for $600 million to reimburse states for the cost 
of incarcerating illegal immigrants. California would receive about half that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 While Feinstein pledged in a meeting with Wilson to help California get its 
fair share of federal funds, she warned the governor that his demands were 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I had to be honest with the governor and tell him that securing $3 
billion this year would be highly unlikely," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some California Democrats and Clinton Administration officials contend that 
the governor's numbers are based on an inflated estimate of California's 
illegal immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is disingenuous for the governor to claim there is really a $3.1-billion 
budget gap he expects the federal government to fill when the true number is 
significantly less," said Tom Epstein, White House liaison for California 
affairs.

 Kathleen Brown's slogan "Enough Is Enough"--criticized here and there as lame

 Why not? Their constituents certainly do: Prayer is experiencing a revival at 
two city council meetings--in Stockton, and in the Stanislaus County town of 
Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton switched from spoken to silent prayer four years ago, but voted to go 
back to oral prayers after the city attorney said it would be legal if they 
kept it short and didn't proselytize for one faith or dump on others. The 
Newman City Council wanted spoken prayer but almost had to settle for 
silent--no pastor was available on council night. The new man of God in town,

 He lists the Mojave Desert, for starters--dry and barren, inhospitable to 
tropical bees, and already a natural barrier for a lot of other pests; a 
parasite, the varroa mite, that the bee never ran into in South or Central 
America; the competition from domestic bees, and something called the Egyptian 
bee--a regular desert rat of a bee.

 So maybe they aren't so tough.

wants the late Dan Hallissy--once his chief deputy--elected anyway, because he 
believes that Kramer is "completely unqualified to take this job." A Hallissy 
win in the June 7 primary would force a special election in March, and a whole 
new batch of people could run. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer considers himself eminently qualified and calls this posthumous

DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED PUPIL BARRED; COURTS: SCHOOL SAYS KINDERGARTNER POSES 
DANGER TO OTHERS. HIS FATHER COUNTERSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Superior Court judge temporarily ordered a developmentally disabled child 
out of kindergarten Thursday as parents of special needs students across Orange 
County reacted with outrage to an Ocean View Elementary School District lawsuit 
targeting the 6-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed hearing, Superior Court Judge Thomas Thrasher ruled that the boy 
could not attend classes at Circle View Elementary School in Huntington Beach 
for 10 days, the child's father said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district filed its unprecedented lawsuit Wednesday, accusing Jimmy Peters 
of biting teachers, throwing desks, hitting and spitting at other students -- 
behavior that prompted one teacher to take medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father, Jim Peters, filed a lawsuit against the district in federal 
court Thursday, alleging that his son has been denied a free and proper 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy can study," Peters said in an interview. "He can learn. But you just 
have to make some small adjustments in the class to allow that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed because it has turned into a political issue instead of what 
is supposed to be best for the child," said Peters, who volunteers and is 
occasionally paid for work as a legal advocate for parents with disabled 
children. Peters gave The Times permission to use his son's name.  
</P>
<P>
 The district's superintendent, Jim Tarwater, did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment Thursday. Circle View Principal Dan Moss declined to comment, 
saying that the issue is governed by privacy considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of children with learning disabilities such as attention deficit 
disorder, hyperactivity, dyslexia and Down's syndrome rallied to support Peters 
on Thursday, saying they were shocked that the school district would target the 
child in its landmark lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of cases show that students with special needs in regular 
classrooms are doing just fine," said Mary Stone, chairwoman of the Inclusion 
Network of Orange County. State law prohibits the removal of such students from 
regular classes without a court order or the parent's consent. Peters, who had 
refused to withdraw his child, said he would go back to Superior Court on 
Tuesday in an attempt to reverse the restraining order granted the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was established as a result of a landmark 1988 case in which the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that school administrators may not remove a student with 
special needs from a regular classroom without permission from a parent or 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters contends that Jimmy suffers from "developmental delays" and is 
"communicatively handicapped," disabilities that result in problems in playing 
with his peers. But, he asserted, the disabilities are not reason enough to 
exclude the boy from a mainstream classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say in their suit that they have tried to make adjustments 
for Jimmy. They have assigned a full-time aide to the boy and hired two experts 
from the Orange County Department of Education and Cal State Long Beach to act 
as consultants. Still, they say, problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
 But a parent of one of the boy's classmates said the boy's disruptions ruined 
her son's year in kindergarten. Although accounts differ over the number, 
parents of several children withdrew them from the class as a result of the 
disruptions, said the woman, who is also a volunteer teacher's aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Janet Edwards, described herself as a proponent of the "full 
inclusion" mandated by law. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are certain students who are being fully included in the classroom, 
who, to be honest, pose a danger," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said the problem with the law is that it is tailored "to protect the 
children with special needs, but there are no laws written to protect the 
'regular' students. And my experience in that classroom was, in a word, awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying she could not elaborate for fear of endangering the lawsuit, Edwards 
called the student's behavior "violent -- there's no other way to put it." 
Peters denied that charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Such conflict is often the result when the needs of special students are not 
handled properly, said Dana Powell, 36, who says she has had her own problems 
with the Ocean View district over the needs of her son, now a 13-year-old 
seventh-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often, the schools pit parents against parents and don't take 
responsibility for doing their job," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said a growing conflict stems from the fact that neither parents nor 
schools really understand the law, which mandates that school districts design 
plans to address special needs as soon as students exhibit difficult behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, students, their needs and the best approach are neglected in a 
swirl of bitterness and, sometimes, litigation. The parents of such children 
say the schools are often incapable of analyzing a student's glaring needs or 
deciding what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result," said Lorraine Behunin, the mother of 10 children, one of whom 
has special needs, "a lot of kids in the middle just fall through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle is not new. Peters said he has been fighting for educational 
equality ever since his son enrolled in Circle View. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be messy before it gets better," he said.

SCIENTIST DEFENDS TOBACCO RESEARCH GROUP; CONGRESS: CHAIRMAN OF INDUSTRY-FUNDED 
COUNCIL CLAIMS MANUFACTURERS HAD NO INFLUENCE ON SMOKING STUDIES. BUT DOCUMENTS 
SUGGEST OTHERWISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The head of the Council for Tobacco Research acknowledged Thursday that his 
organization acted as an industry "conduit," steering research grants to 
favored scientists in hopes of getting results that reflected positively on the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But he insisted that most of the researchers who did work for the council were 
"assured complete scientific freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James F. Glenn, chairman of the industry-funded council, which awards 
scientific grants to researchers studying the relationship between smoking and 
health, told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the 
environment that the work supported by his organization "is performed by 
independent scientists" and that the results are made available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The council "does not consider whether the research will be favorable or not 
favorable," he said. "We are scientists. . . . Industry exercises no control." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the 
subcommittee, however, Glenn admitted that the council had bypassed a 
scientific advisory board of outside experts to award "special project" grants 
requested by industry lawyers who wanted research that could bolster the 
industry's position in future litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn said, however, that the council did so because of its own expertise in 
administering grants. The existence of such "special projects" was reported in 
Thursday's Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn, who also serves as chief of staff at the University of Kentucky Medical 
College Hospital, said the council has awarded more than $220 million to 
finance more than 1,380 research projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman released a series of documents written in 1953 and 1954 by officials at 
the public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton indicating that the council was 
created solely to counter public concerns over early studies linking cigarettes 
to health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One Hill & Knowlton memo advised that "the underlying purpose of any activity 
at this stage should be reassurance of the public. . . . It is important that 
the public recognize the existence of weighty scientific views which hold there 
is no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the firm's major suggestions was the formation of a special research 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word 'research' should be included in the name of the committee to 
establish the fact that the group will carry on or sponsor fundamental 
scientific research," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it recommended that the group have a director who was "a medical 
research authority of unquestioned national repute" and an advisory board of 
"men whose integrity is beyond question." 
</P>
<P>
 The first public statement of the committee should be "designed to reassure 
the public that the industry's first and foremost interest is the public health 
(and) there is no proof of the claims which link smoking and lung cancer. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman said this "paints a disturbing picture of public relations masquerading 
as science." In response, Glenn asked Waxman:  
</P>
<P>
 "Are you impugning my integrity?" 
</P>
<P>
 In an exchange with Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), another Capitol Hill tobacco foe, 
Glenn said he believed that smoking is a "risk factor" for lung cancer, but 
refused to acknowledge there was a "causal" relationship between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I reject your premise that we are a biased organization, I reject the premise 
that smoking causes cancer and I reject the inference that our activities have 
been to obscure the truth," he said. "On the contrary, they've been dedicated 
to developing scientific truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has been able to demonstrate that smoking causes any disease," he 
added. He acknowledged that 80% of lung cancers occur among smokers but noted 
that many smokers do not develop lung cancer and 20% of lung cancers occur 
among nonsmokers. "Smoking is a risk factor. What we've got to find out is why 
the cell goes wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe smoking causes cancer?" Wyden asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No sir," Glenn replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe smoking is an addiction," Wyden asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No sir," Glenn replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in isolation," Wyden said, citing the numerous medical experts and 
public health organizations who disagree.

FLORIDA GOVERNOR SIGNS TOUGH NEW ANTI-TOBACCO LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Lawton Chiles signed a law Thursday touted as the nation's toughest 
anti-tobacco measure, giving Florida new legal tools to sue tobacco companies 
for the costs of caring for Medicaid patients stricken by smoking-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came just days after Mississippi sued 13 cigarette manufacturers 
seeking to make them reimburse taxpayers for the cost of smoking-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take the Marlboro man to court," Chiles said. "With this law, 
Florida sends a loud and clear message to the tobacco giants that they will be 
held accountable for sponsoring sickness and death." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker Merryman, a vice president of the Tobacco Institute, which represents 
the nation's cigarette makers, said he knew of no similar state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill cheats thousands of Florida businesses and legitimate products out 
of the right to evidentiary protection and defenses," the institute said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law is not repealed in next month's special legislative session, the 
tobacco industry will challenge its constitutionality, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which takes effect July 1, enables the state to file class-action 
lawsuits against tobacco companies, holding them individually and collectively 
liable for smoking-related health care costs paid by taxpayers. Officials say 
the state has spent $1.2 billion in Medicaid funds treating poor people with 
smoking-related diseases since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, individual plaintiffs suing tobacco companies have had to show 
a direct link between physical harm and the company's tobacco. Under the new 
law, the state would be able to use statistics about smoking to show the link. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taxpayer money we're going to try to get back," Chiles said. "It's being 
used to subsidize the profitability of some of the largest conglomerates in the 
country."

MILITARY; CONTROVERSIAL GENERAL FINALLY READY TO BOW OUT IN NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro tried to fire Gen. 
Humberto Ortega, the powerful army chief lashed out publicly at government 
officials for having "sold out" to pressure from Washington. He refused to 
budge. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, Ortega has finally agreed to step down, having successfully 
delayed his retirement date by more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ortega episode underscores the difficulties the Chamorro government has 
experienced as it struggles to bring the army, dominated by leftist 
Sandinistas, under civilian control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nicaragua will have for the first time in its history a national army, 
clearly subordinated to civilian power, committed to the constitution, that 
does not belong and is not subordinated to the interests of any political party 
or social class," Chamorro said in a ceremony last week to announce Ortega's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The years of armies that belong to parties, which made the birth of democracy 
so difficult in Nicaragua, are now behind us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to changing the army chief, the government has finally drafted a 
long-awaited military code that for the first time gives the president formal 
authority over the army commander. It also sets term limits for senior 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite Chamorro's stated intentions, Sandinista influence on the army 
will not end with Ortega's departure next year. His likely successor is Maj. 
Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, another veteran Sandinista. And the officer corps remains 
Sandinista. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamorro defeated former President Daniel Ortega, Humberto's brother, and the 
Sandinista Front in presidential elections in 1990. She named herself defense 
minister but stunned her followers by retaining Humberto Ortega as army chief, 
saying his presence was necessary to ensure the peaceful downsizing of 
Nicaragua's huge military apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials and Chamorro's conservative critics denounced that decision, 
arguing that continued Sandinista control of the army would forever limit the 
civilian president's ability to govern. Demanding Ortega's removal, the critics 
maintained that the army could not become a professional and nonpolitical force 
as long as he and other key Sandinistas remained in top positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandinista domination of security forces was one of the reasons the United 
States gave for withholding millions of dollars in aid last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamorro tried to dump Ortega in September, when she announced his retirement 
at an Army Day ceremony. Shocked and furious, Ortega stormed up to the 
president and said she had exceeded her authority. She could not remove him, he 
told her. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the two have negotiated what the Sandinista newspaper Barricada called 
"a dignified withdrawal." Ortega will formally step down Feb. 21, 1995, the 
100th anniversary of the birth of Augusto Cesar Sandino, the guerrilla who 
fought U.S. Marines occupying Nicaragua in the 1920s and 1930s and for whom the 
Sandinista National Liberation Front is named. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military has professed to be professional and nonpolitical, and at the 
same time we know that the whole corps of officers is Sandinista," a diplomat 
said. "It will be up to them to show they are professional and nonpolitical." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandinista People's Army swelled to become the largest army in Central 
America during the 1980s, as it battled U.S.-backed Contra rebels. It has been 
reduced dramatically, according to government figures, from more than 85,000 
troops to 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the army became Ortega's personal fiefdom, which he used after the 
war to get rich and operate above the law. In one particularly notorious case, 
Ortega and eight bodyguards have been accused of shooting and killing a 
16-year-old youth who tried to drive past Ortega's convoy on a city highway in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear what finally forced Ortega to accept retirement now. However, 
he has told Nicaraguan reporters that he is interested eventually in running 
for president.

POLITICS; QUEBEC ONCE AGAIN TOPS CANADA AGENDA; THE SEPARATISTS' EVANGELISM AND 
PROSPECTS AT POLLS HAVE REIGNITED THE ISSUE. THE ARGUMENT OVER SECESSION ISN'T 
WHETHER BUT HOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Canada is being dragged reluctantly into a new confrontation over the future 
of French-speaking Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks, political leaders and commentators across Canada have 
lobbed rhetorical grenades at each other over the revived prospect of Quebec 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Two factors have pushed Quebec back to the top of the national political 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 First is the pending provincial election there, which by law must take place 
by fall. Virtually every poll shows the separatist Parti Quebecois leading the 
governing Liberal Party. PQ leader Jacques Parizeau has promised to begin 
laying the groundwork for separation immediately upon his election and to hold 
a province-wide referendum on independence within 10 months of taking office. 
</P>
<P>
 Second is the peripatetic Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the 
PQ's separatist counterpart in the federal government in Ottawa. Bouchard has 
become an international evangelist for separatism. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bouchard was in Paris, seeking assurance of quick French 
recognition of an independent Quebec. He didn't get it, at least publicly, but 
he did get saturation coverage in the Canadian media. Earlier this month, he 
preached his separatist message in British Columbia and Alberta, the Canadian 
political equivalent of proselytizing for vegetarianism at a Texas cattlemen's 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the resulting argument has focused not on whether Quebec ought to be 
allowed to secede -- most Canadians agree that's for Quebecers to decide -- but 
what the terms of separation ought to be: What would the boundaries of the new 
country look like? Should the native peoples of Quebec be permitted to opt out 
of independence and keep their lands in Canada? What kind of economic 
relationship would Canada have with a sovereign Quebec? 
</P>
<P>
 The commentary suggests that this could be a very nasty divorce indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To hell with common sense, one-sided decency and compromise. You don't win a 
country that way and you shouldn't lose one either," stormed columnist Peter C. 
Newman in the national news weekly Maclean's. 
</P>
<P>
 In press interviews, British Columbia Premier Michael Harcourt predicted his 
province would be "the worst of enemies" with an independent Quebec. 
Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow accused separatist leaders of pulling a "con 
job" on Quebec voters by suggesting separation would be simple and painless. 
Ron Irwin, minister of Indian Affairs, declared the federal government would 
back native organizations that repudiated Quebec independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who like his predecessors for 25 of the last 26 
years is from Quebec, has sought to avoid the issue, saying he remains 
confident his fellow Quebecers ultimately will reject separation. That prompted 
Preston Manning of Alberta, leader of the opposition Reform Party, to accuse 
the government this week of "sleepwalking toward a . . . constitutional 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts are divided on how the latest arguments might affect the coming 
Quebec election. Quebec voters have a history of unpredictability. 
</P>
<P>
 While the PQ is ahead of the Liberals in current polls, the surveys show 
uncertainty about full separation. A poll over the weekend showed 52% opposed 
to independence. The Bid for Sovereignty 
</P>
<P>
 Here are key dates in recent battles over Quebec separation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 12-14, 1968: The Parti Quebecois, dedicated to sovereignty for the 
French-speaking province, is formed. Rene Levesque is named leader. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 15, 1976: PQ wins provincial election after promising a referendum on 
sovereignty. Levesque becomes premier. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 20, 1980: Quebecers defeat Levesque's proposal for sovereignty, 60% to 
40%.  
</P>
<P>
 * April 17, 1982: Queen Elizabeth II signs a proclamation giving Canada its 
own constitution, replacing British North America Act of 1867. The move is 
opposed by Levesque, who says it is unfair to Quebec. (Quebec is the only 
province to refuse to endorse the new constitution.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 3, 1985: Levesque retires. Pierre-Marc Johnson becomes Quebec premier 
and PQ leader. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 2, 1985: Robert Bourassa, leader of Quebec Liberal Party and a Canadian 
federalist, defeats Johnson and PQ in provincial elections. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 1, 1987: Levesque dies. Johnson resigns as PQ leader nine days later 
and is succeeded by Jacques Parizeau. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 22, 1990: Meech Lake agreement, envisioned by Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney as a solution to the Quebec conundrum, fails.  
</P>
<P>
 * June 15, 1991: Lucien Bouchard and other disaffected members of Parliament 
from Quebec form the Bloc Quebecois to represent the separatist cause in the 
Canadian national government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 26, 1992: Charlottetown accord, successor document to Meech Lake, is 
defeated decisively in a national referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 25, 1993: Liberal Party sweeps to victory in national election. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 11, 1994: Daniel Johnson, the new Liberal Party leader in Quebec and a 
Canadian federalist, becomes provincial premier, replacing Bourassa.

RUSSIA LIFTS VEIL ON ELITE SHOCK TROOPS; MILITARY: MEDIA GET TO SEE DREADED 
DZERZHINSKY DIVISION PUT ON A DEMONSTRATION AT ITS ONCE-SECRET BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They were once the toughest, deadliest, scariest troops to police the Soviet 
Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Bolshevik secret police, the 
Dzerzhinsky Division liquidated czarist sympathizers, worked out the formula 
for the Molotov cocktail and trained snipers to torment Hitler's armies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the KGB unit did the Kremlin's bidding in such hot spots as 
Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. Last October, when hard-liners 
seized the Russian Parliament building, Boris N. Yeltsin called in the 
Dzerzhinsky Division to storm the White House and save his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the gates of the elite division's base swung open to journalists, 
and even foreign reporters were invited in for what commanders said was the 
first-ever tour of this military holy site about 15 miles east of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bizarre marriage of Russian military propaganda and Western-style public 
relations, the once-terrifying special forces now seemed eager to show 
themselves to the media as a tough but politically correct unit of 
crime-fighters trained to battle terrorists, drug traffickers, hijackers and 
organized criminals. With convincing displays of smoke bombs and machine-gun 
fire, young commandos demonstrated their crime-busting prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 First came a display of bulletproof vests, helmets, rifles, pistols, 
grenade-launchers, stun bombs and tear gas canisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the television cameras rolled, sharpshooters in camouflage burst into 
a firing range. They pumped bullets straight into their target, a wooden 
terrorist who appeared to be commandeering a car, holding a gun to the driver's 
head. The shooters left holes in the terrorist, but the hostage escaped 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Beefy recruits showed how to intercept and liberate a "hijacked" bus by posing 
as road repair workers.  
</P>
<P>
 As if to demonstrate Russia's need for a squad of "untouchables" to deal with 
its skyrocketing crime, while the mock hijackings were being staged outside 
Moscow, a very real hijacking of schoolchildren had begun in southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Four gunmen seized a bus carrying about 30 people -- eight children, their 
parents and their schoolteachers -- near Mineralniye Vody, a resort city whose 
name means "mineral waters." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second hijacking involving schoolchildren in five months. Last 
December, a dozen children from Rostov-on-Don were seized but released in 
exchange for $10 million and a helicopter. No one was hurt in that incident, 
and the hijackers were eventually caught, but not all of the ransom money was 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Thursday that the new hijackers had also demanded $10 
million, as well as 100 vials of morphine, assorted weaponry and a helicopter 
in which to flee. The terrorists threatened to toss one child's severed head 
out of the bus each hour until their demands were met, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Thursday, the terrorists had released all the children and one adult 
in exchange for four submachine guns, a grenade launcher, a night-vision device 
and some flak jackets, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. About 13 adults were 
still being held.  
</P>
<P>
 Two groups of elite Interior Ministry troops -- possibly from the 
ex-Dzerzhinsky Division -- were on their way to the site, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its transformation, the commando unit has dropped the name 
Dzerzhinsky and is now simply known as the Special Forces Division. But the 
nickname has stuck, and despite financial hardship it remains one of the most 
prestigious postings in the Russian military.

AKIHITO TO BYPASS PEARL HARBOR, PAY RESPECTS AT 2 SITES OF U.S. DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko will not visit Pearl Harbor but will pay 
respects to U.S. war dead at two other sites during a 17-day tour of the United 
States beginning June 10, the Japanese government announced today.  
</P>
<P>
 The trip, which will include a two-day stopover in Los Angeles, will be only 
the second by an emperor to the United States -- and the first in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Ministry diplomats initially had urged the emperor to visit Pearl 
Harbor, but fears of repercussions at home from a visit to the memorial to the 
battleship Arizona -- which many Americans regard as the symbol of Japan's 
"sneak attack" on Dec. 7, 1941 -- finally killed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple will instead visit the Punch Bowl cemetery in Honolulu and 
Arlington National Cemetery in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the emperor visited the Arizona memorial, some (Japanese) would argue that 
the emperor was being used for political purposes," said a Foreign Ministry 
diplomat who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. visit by Akihito, 60, and Michiko, 59, underscores the changes that 
have slowly enveloped the imperial family since the end of the war. Until the 
late Emperor Hirohito made a trip to Europe as crown prince in 1921 and 
retraced his steps as emperor 50 years later, none of his 123 predecessors had 
ever left Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Akihito, tutored in English as a student, and Michiko, the first 
commoner ever to marry an emperor, traveled abroad frequently as crown prince 
and princess. 
</P>
<P>
 Akihito has visited the United States four times, including two stopovers. He 
visited Pearl Harbor on a trip in 1960, before the memorial to the battleship 
Arizona and its crew was built. 
</P>
<P>
 During the June trip, the imperial couple will visit 11 cities -- including 
Atlanta, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu -- before 
returning to Tokyo on June 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 days ago, Michiko delivered a public speech for the first time since 
she collapsed Oct. 20 and lost her voice. The Imperial Household Agency said 
she had recovered to the point where she has "almost no trouble" carrying on 
daily conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles area June 20-22, the imperial couple is scheduled to visit 
the Huntington Library and Art Collections, a Japan-America museum and a 
retirement home for Americans of Japanese origin, and meet former President 
Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy.

BRITAIN, IRELAND PRESS IRA TO END VIOLENCE IN ULSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Ministers John Major of Britain and Albert Reynolds of Ireland on 
Thursday intensified their pressure on the Irish Republican Army to give up its 
campaign of violence in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after a meeting Thursday night, 
they warned Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, that they will not "wait 
around" for the party to respond to their peace overtures. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders, who last December signed the Downing Street Declaration 
offering Sinn Fein a place at Northern Ireland peace talks if the IRA would 
stop its attacks, said they would continue negotiations with politicians in 
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great deal of progress has been made," Major said. "There's more to be 
done, but it is not awaiting an answer from Sinn Fein." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams raised peace hopes by declaring to 
the British Broadcasting Corp. that his group would make an official response 
to the Downing Street peace proposal -- but not until after European Parliament 
elections June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am quite convinced that what is going to come out of this peace process is 
a peace settlement," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Major dashed cold water on the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see nothing new in what he had to say this morning," the prime minister 
said. "What was quite striking was what he didn't say. He made no indication 
that he was going to give up violence."

MEXICO DENIES HARASSING ACCUSED ASSASSIN'S KIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican officials Thursday denied claims by the relatives of Mario Aburto 
Martinez, the man accused of killing presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, that they have been persecuted -- and authorities now say they are now 
seeking new evidence from the suspect's father. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from the attorney general's office contradicted the claims of six 
Aburto family members who asked for political asylum in the United States 
earlier this week.The six, alleging harassment in Tijuana, are seeking 
permission to stay in the United States temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Sanchez de Armas, spokesman for the special prosecutor 
in the sensitive assassination case, denied Thursday that Ruben Aburto, the 
suspect's father, has a warrant pending from a 1967 case that would prevent him 
from returning to Mexico to tell police what he knows and visit his imprisoned 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are seeking to interview the father and are even willing to go 
to Los Angeles, where the elder Aburto lives, said Sanchez, spokesman for 
Miguel Montes Garcia, the special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 The father has said publicly that, in the weeks before the shooting, his son 
met with as many as four members of the security and crowd-control entourage 
that accompanied Colosio on March 23, the day of the slaying. While the elder 
Aburto has provided no proof, the accusation hints at a government plot to kill 
Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's Los Angeles lawyer, Peter Schey, said the father has not told Mexican 
authorities about his son's meetings because the elder Aburto feared for the 
safety of relatives in Tijuana. But Schey explained that the father was now 
willing to give testimony if his safety is guaranteed.

<P>
 The International Whaling Commission voted overwhelmingly Thursday to make 
much of the Southern Hemisphere into a whale sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 The move bans whaling in about 8 million square miles around Antarctica and 
thus protects more than 90% of the world's whales, which feed in large numbers 
in those waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal passed by a 23-1 vote, with six abstentions. Japan cast the only 
opposing vote. Fellow whaling nation Norway was not present at the vote.

COLLAPSED CANADIAN CLIMBER RESCUED NEAR MT. EVEREST SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canadian climber who collapsed near the summit of Mt. Everest was carried 
off the mountain in a dramatic rescue effort Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 John McIsaac, 39, of Canmore, Alberta, was reported resting at the expedition 
base camp, suffering from pneumonia and pulmonary edema, a potentially fatal 
altitude sickness in which the lungs fill with fluid. He was being monitored by 
three doctors, who were to decide this morning whether to evacuate him to 
Nepal's capital, Katmandu. 
</P>
<P>
 McIsaac, seeking to become the first Canadian to ascend Everest without 
bottled oxygen, climbed to within 1,150 feet of the summit Wednesday when he 
was forced back by exhaustion. Within hours, he began showing signs of 
pulmonary edema. Unable to walk, McIsaac was carried down the world's highest 
mountain Thursday in a heavy vinyl Gamov bag, which acts as a portable 
compression chamber, according to Maggie Calloway, an expedition spokeswoman in 
Vancouver who spoke to the climbing party by cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 McIsaac was reportedly suffering from exhaustion and frostbitten fingers when 
he gave up his 16-hour assault on the summit. Earlier, another climber on the 
Canadian expedition, Denis Brown, also abandoned his summit attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadians were using the northern, or Tibetan, route up the 29,028-foot 
mountain, which straddles the border of Tibet and Nepal.

CLINTON SIGNS LAW BANNING ABORTION CLINIC BLOCKADES; LEGISLATION: THE STATUTE 
ALLOWS FOR STIFF PENALTIES FOR VIOLENT PROTESTERS. BUT OPPONENTS FILE SUIT, 
CLAIMING ABRIDGMENT OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton signed legislation Thursday that bars abortion clinic 
blockades and harassment -- a move that extended a recent string of victories 
for abortion-rights groups but brought a pair of immediate legal challenges 
from their foes. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton hailed the law as a blow against "extremism and vigilantism," two 
anti-abortion groups filed lawsuits that could lead to court clarification of 
the hotly disputed boundary between free speech and abortion-rights laws. The 
groups -- the American Center for Law and Justice and the American Life League 
-- sought injunctions to block the new statute, which they said will curtail 
their right to protest more than it will the rights of any other group. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they went to court, abortion foes acknowledged that the law, which 
becomes effective immediately, had dealt them a severe setback. While they 
vowed to continue protests, officials of some anti-abortion groups said they 
feared that the stiff sanctions -- which include fines of up to $250,000 and 
prison terms of six months to life -- could curtail their ability to find 
volunteers to help close down clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Some openly lamented the reversals suffered by a movement that dominated the 
abortion debate for much of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Clinton eroded in one year pro-life gains that took us 20 years of 
back-breaking work," said the Rev. Pat Mahoney, a national leader of Operation 
Rescue. "Clearly, this has been a horrible year for the pro-life movement." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the clinic-access law, the anti-abortion rights groups recently 
have been disappointed by an agreement allowing U.S. testing of RU-486, the 
so-called abortion pill, and by million-dollar judgments against protesters who 
damaged abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court also ruled this year that federal prosecutors may use the 
tough anti-racketeering statute in some circumstances against protesters who 
sought to close down clinics. And last year the Administration lifted an order 
prohibiting abortion counseling in federally funded clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by abortion-rights advocates at a White House ceremony, Clinton 
said: "We cannot -- we must not -- continue to allow the attacks, the incidents 
of arson, the campaigns of intimidation upon law-abiding citizens that have 
given rise to this law." 
</P>
<P>
 But he insisted that the bill "is not a strike against the First Amendment. 
Far from it. It ensures that all citizens have the opportunity to exercise all 
their constitutional rights, including their privacy rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Some advocates say more than 1,000 violent incidents have occurred at clinics 
since 1977, including 81 cases of arson, 36 bombings, 84 assaults, two 
kidnapings and the fatal shooting of Florida physician David Gunn. That killing 
helped galvanize sentiment against abortion clinic violence, changing the 
political balance in Congress sufficiently to deliver victory for a proposal 
that two years ago died in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill Clinton signed passed 241 to 174 in the House and by 69 to 30 in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decry violence all the time -- this was a move to stop it," said Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who helped Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) lead the 
effort for the bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The law imposes its penalties on anyone who uses force, threats or "physical 
obstruction" against any person using an abortion clinic or reproductive health 
service. But the bill also states that none of its provisions may interfere 
with free speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion foes argue that since the law imposes much harsher penalties than the 
one-night jail terms and $100 fines typical for protest sit-ins and blockades, 
it is effectively depriving them of a tactic that other protesters have long 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in America can protest except when we try to save babies," charged 
Randall Terry, the Operation Rescue founder who was arrested along with six 
others in front of the White House on Wednesday. "If Bill Clinton had signed a 
bill like this in the 1960s, there never would have been sit-ins at lunch 
counters in the South." 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion rights advocates said they expect attempts to block clinics will 
continue until the courts reach a decisive judgment on the statute, or at least 
until a series of high-profile cases demonstrate to anti-abortion activists 
that the penalties will be strongly enforced. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, who pushed 
the Administration to support a strong bill, is expected to oversee vigorous 
support of its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversial though it is, the clinic-access act only sets the stage for what 
may be an even more heated debate over whether abortion benefits should be 
included in the health benefits package that would be offered under the Clinton 
health reform plan. Several congressional committees are studying that 
explosive question.

 Black adults are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the prospects of black 
children, citing fears of violence, guns, drugs and gangs, a poll says.The 
poll, commissioned by the Children's Defense Fund and a new organization known 
as the Black Community Crusade for Children, found that more than three-fourths 
of respondents said they fear that their children or children they know will 
fall victim to violence. More than 70% of the respondents, many of them raised 
in an era of segregation, said they believe that it is harder for children 
today than it was for them. More than three-fourths of black children polled 
said school violence is a serious problem for them; 70% said the same of guns.

 The Senate has approved a bill to extend Social Security retirement and 
disability benefits to domestic workers. The Senate's decision addresses the 
"nanny tax" made famous by Zoe Baird, whose failure to pay Social Security 
taxes forced her to withdraw as President Clinton's nominee for attorney 
general. The bill would require employers to pay taxes on domestic employees 
who earn $630 annually, up from the current threshold of $50 a quarter or $200 
a year.

LAX BARS MAY GO SMOKE-FREE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although officials at San Francisco International Airport have declined to ban 
smoking in bars, their counterparts in Los Angeles are on the verge of doing 
just that -- a move that would make the bars at Los Angeles International 
Airport the first in the city to go smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Airport Commission voted unanimously May 3 to ask the City 
Council to eliminate smoking in all indoor areas of LAX, except one lounge for 
international travelers.The council is expected to adopt the proposed 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, LAX officials say, is the same as in San Francisco: An ordinance 
restricting smoking, adopted last year, has jammed the airport bars and lounges 
with smokers, who now have nowhere else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport spokeswoman Cora Fossett said: "It was causing a safety hazard, the 
crowding. Not to mention it was keeping nonsmokers who just wanted to get a 
drink from getting there." SHERYL STOLBERG

CANCER DRUG CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS IN WOMB, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 British scientists said today that a preliminary study showed that a 
controversial drug therapy used to prevent breast cancer in high-risk women can 
cause womb abnormalities associated with uterine cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The study on the effects of tamoxifen is likely to deepen concern over a 
bigger British trial, in which 15,000 healthy women will take the drug for 
several years.The study was published in the British medical journal Lancet. 
</P>
<P>
 "These findings confirm that tamoxifen can cause potentially malignant changes 
in the endometrium (womb lining) of postmenopausal women," the researchers said 
in their report, which called for close monitoring of women taking low-dose 
tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer from developing. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous studies have already pointed to a link between tamoxifen, which is 
commonly used to prolong life in women who with advanced breast cancer, and 
tumors in the womb. However, in many such cases doctors feel that the danger of 
a recurrence of breast cancer outweighs the risk of the drug damaging the womb.

MRS. CLINTON'S COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS CALLED LEGAL; INVESTMENTS: EXPERT, ASKED 
BY FAMILY TO REVIEW TRADING RECORDS, FINDS NO VIOLATIONS. ANALYSIS BACKS 
PREVIOUS WHITE HOUSE ASSERTIONS ON THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The White House released additional records Thursday related to First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's commodities trading activities in further efforts to 
show that she did nothing illegal or unethical in making her investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House also issued a brief analysis by a commodities expert who was 
asked by the Clintons to review her trading, in which he found that she 
"violated no rules in the course of her transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Melamed, former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the 
nation's largest commodities exchanges, noted in a statement that the new 
records released by Mrs. Clinton confirm his assessment that she broke no 
rules. The new data from the Chicago exchange "largely confirms and also 
complements" records from Mrs. Clinton's brokerage account released last month 
by the White House, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These records are being released today . . . to give as complete a picture as 
possible of Mrs. Clinton's trading," said Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Caputo said that the records were not released earlier because Mrs. Clinton 
had not known of their existence at the Chicago exchange. Caputo said the new 
records corroborate those released by Mrs. Clinton last month from her 
brokerage account at the commodities brokerage firm where she invested 
beginning in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the new records confirm, Melamed's review stated, that the 
First Lady did not violate the rules in her first, and perhaps most 
controversial commodities trade, in which she turned a $1,000 investment into 
$6,300 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Melamed said that the records provide more detailed information about Mrs. 
Clinton's first day of trading than was available from the earlier records. 
They show, he said, that Mrs. Clinton had risked her money in the transaction, 
demonstrating that it was a legitimate investment and not some form of 
favorable insider transaction arranged by her broker. 
</P>
<P>
 In that one trade, Mrs. Clinton sold 10 December live cattle contracts on Oct. 
11, 1978, at the price of $57.55 a pound, and offset this trade with a purchase 
of 10 December live cattle contracts the following day at a price of $56.10 a 
pound for a profit of $5,300, after commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted while Mrs. Clinton did not have enough margin, or reserves in her 
account to cover her exposure in the trade, that "does not represent a rule 
violation by the customer. Rather, it is an issue between the clearing firm and 
the exchange." His statement is consistent with previous White House assertions 
that, if there were any such rule violations, they were the fault of her 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Thursday, Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. met with 
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) to discuss the possible schedule of 
congressional hearings on the Whitewater controversy. After the meeting, Foley 
said that the House will not begin Whitewater hearings before late July. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into allegations that President Clinton may have benefited 
improperly from his association with James B. McDougal, owner of the failed 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and partner with the Clintons in an Ozark real 
estate development firm known as Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's statement came in the wake of increasing Republican demands that the 
Democratic congressional leadership not try to back out of its commitment to 
permit hearings. The Republicans want hearings scheduled as soon as possible 
and Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, a leading Republican Whitewater 
critic, introduced a resolution this week calling for the creation of a 
16-member Whitewater committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic leaders have said that they do not want to begin hearings until 
Fiske has completed the first phase of his investigation into the 
Washington-related elements of the controversy.

PLUTONIUM WASTE POSES DEADLY PROBLEM; COLD WAR: TONS OF RADIOACTIVE MATTER FROM 
WEAPONS PROGRAM MAY HAVE TO STAY IN TEMPORARY STORAGE FOR 20 YEARS, ENERGY 
DEPARTMENT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Energy Department has no permanent solution for disposing of 50 tons of 
radioactive plutonium waste from the Cold War weapons program, and it may have 
to continue using temporary storage facilities for as long as 20 years, 
department officials told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As an interim solution, the department is considering the possibility of 
storing some of the waste in abandoned military bases around the country, 
officials said in a report released earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The disposal issue is one of the thorniest facing the department. Plutonium 
poses "significant dangers to national and international security" because of 
the possibility that it could fall into the wrong hands and be fashioned into a 
nuclear bomb, Energy Undersecretary Charles Curtis said in testimony before the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 10 pounds of plutonium is needed to build a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated 100 tons of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States, 
only half will be retained by the federal government for use in nuclear 
weapons. No plans have yet been devised for disposing of the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), committee chairman, said that, although the 
problem is a serious one for both the United States and Russia -- which possess 
the bulk of the world's plutonium -- the pace of the search for a solution has 
been "torpid at best." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to solving the plutonium disposal problem, the Energy Department 
must decide what to do about the millions of pounds of radioactive waste from 
other sources that is being stored in 29 temporary sites around the nation. 
Many of the containers are rusting and threatening to release radioactivity. 
Inspection teams are attempting to assess the extent of the danger, a 
department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, most of the surplus plutonium is held at relatively few sites, 
the largest of which is the department's Pantex plant near Amarillo, Tex., 
which has the job of dismantling nuclear weapons. About 6,000 plutonium pits 
are contained in so-called igloos on Pantex land. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to store the waste at military installations appears to be the 
result of protests from Texas authorities over the storage at Pantex. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has promised Texas officials to limit the 
storage there, raising the problem of where to put the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to find a permanent storage site have run into a number of technical 
and environmental roadblocks. A federally appointed panel led by Stanford 
University Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky suggested that the plutonium could be used 
in commercial reactors to make electricity or be converted into glass logs in a 
process called vitrification. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnston raised concerns that the only U.S. reactors capable of using the 
plutonium are scheduled to be closed. It would take another decade to build a 
new reactor for the job, Panofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the plutonium, which remains radioactive for 20,000 years, must be 
buried. After exhaustive research, the federal government selected a site in 
Yucca Mountain, Nev., but years of additional study will be needed before any 
radioactive materials are entombed there.

STREISAND PUTS OFF 4 OUT OF 6 O.C. SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Barbra Streisand on Thursday postponed three more of her concerts at The Pond 
of Anaheim but said she will sing there Thursday and June 4 as scheduled. 
People with tickets for the four postponed shows will get to hear her in July. 
</P>
<P>
 As thousands of fans checked their calendars to see just when their tickets 
would be honored, the singer -- still suffering from viral tracheolaryngitis -- 
said she felt "terrible that these postponements may cause severe scheduling 
problems for so many who have waited for so long for me to perform live." 
</P>
<P>
 The new schedule would mean that her final concert of the tour -- which she 
has said will be her last ever -- will take place at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the postponed shows will be honored July 18, 20, 22 and 24 
respectively, after she has completed her announced itinerary with concerts in 
San Jose and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour, her first in nearly three decades, was to have stopped at The Pond 
on Wednesday for six shows, one every other night through June 4. Late Tuesday 
night, promoters revealed her illness, announced that the first show was off 
and left the fate of the other shows hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 After nerve-wracked fans jammed phone lines to The Pond all day Wednesday and 
Thursday, Streisand announced that shows tonight, Sunday and Tuesday also would 
be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was upsetting to some, but not all. Rachel Brooks, a theater manager 
from Illinois who had flown in for the concert, said Thursday that she was 
"very disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is having flown all the way out here. Part of it is not knowing if 
I can come back when her concert is rescheduled. It was a once-in-a-lifetime 
chance. I am not sure if I will have it again." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Tony Harrison, a plumber from Ojai, the postponement works out fine. 
Harrison said he has a ticket to see the Eagles at Irvine Meadows on Saturday. 
He had planned to spend the night in Orange County, then drive back to Ojai to 
pick up friends for Streisand's show in Anaheim on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, instead of having to spend six hours on the road, he won't have to come 
back to Orange County until July 22. "Plus," he said, "the weather will be 
nicer in July." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Streisand's manager, Marty Erlichman, the singer, who has had 
laryngitis for nearly a week, hoped to be well enough to begin the Anaheim 
shows tonight. But her doctors advised her to stay off the stage until 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation had been that any postponed shows would be made up after shows in 
San Jose on June 7 and 9 and before the June 20 start of Streisand's run at New 
York's Madison Square Garden. But when it became necessary to move four Anaheim 
shows, that plan became impossible because Streisand refuses to perform on 
consecutive nights, and because of the time needed to move her elaborate stage 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 If needed, refunds for the postponed shows will be made at point of purchase 
beginning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand has been resting at her Beverly Hills home. "She's under medication, 
and she has been ordered to maintain strict voice rest," one of her spokesmen 
said Wednesday. "That means no talking at all, and obviously no singing." 
</P>
<P>
 The first news of her illness came as a shock to ticket holders who woke up 
Wednesday morning fully expecting to hear Streisand that night, only to read 
newspaper announcements that the concert was in limbo.

O.C. JUDGE BARS DISABLED CHILD FROM KINDERGARTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY and JAIME ABDO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge temporarily ordered a developmentally disabled child 
out of kindergarten Thursday at the request of a school district that had filed 
an unprecedented lawsuit contending that the boy created extraordinary problems 
in his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View Elementary School District officials said they had filed the suit 
against 6-year-old Jimmy Peters as a last resort, but their action sparked 
outrage among parents of special-needs students across Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's suit accused Jimmy of biting teachers, throwing desks, and 
hitting and spitting at other students -- behavior that prompted one teacher to 
take immediate medical leave. A county attorney described the suit as the first 
of its kind in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father, Jim Peters, filed a lawsuit of his own against the district 
in federal court Thursday, alleging that his son has been denied a free and 
proper education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy can study," Peters said in an interview. "He can learn. But you just 
have to make some small adjustments in the class to allow that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed because it has turned into a political issue instead of what 
is supposed to be best for the child," said Peters, who volunteers and is 
occasionally paid for his work as a legal advocate for parents with disabled 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's superintendent, James R. Tarwater, did not return telephone 
calls seeking comment Thursday. Circle View Principal Dan Moss declined 
comment, saying the issue is governed by privacy considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed hearing on the school district's lawsuit, Superior Court Judge 
Thomas N. Thrasher ruled that the boy could not attend classes at Circle View 
Elementary School in Huntington Beach for 10 days to two weeks, Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of children with learning disabilities -- such as attention deficit 
disorder, hyperactivity, dyslexia and Down's syndrome -- rallied to support 
Peters on Thursday, saying they were shocked that the school district would 
target the child in its landmark lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of cases show that students with special needs in regular 
classrooms are doing just fine," said Mary Stone, chairwoman of the Inclusion 
Network of Orange County. State law prohibits the removal of such students from 
regular classes without a court order or the parent's consent. Peters, who had 
refused to withdraw his child, said he would go back to Superior Court on 
Tuesday in an attempt to reverse the restraining order granted the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was established as a result of a landmark 1988 case in which the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that school administrators may not remove a student with 
special needs from a regular classroom without permission from a parent or 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters contends that Jimmy suffers from "developmental delays" and is 
"communicatively handicapped," disabilities that result in problems in playing 
with his peers. But, he asserted, the disabilities are not reason enough to 
exclude him from a mainstream classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials claimed in their suit that they have tried to make 
adjustments for Jimmy. They have assigned a full-time aide to the boy and hired 
two experts from the Orange County Department of Education and Cal State Long 
Beach to act as consultants. Still, they claim, problems persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent of one of the boy's classmates said the boy's disruptions ruined her 
son's year in kindergarten. Though accounts differ over the number, parents of 
at least several children withdrew them from the class as a result of the 
disruptions, said the woman, who is also a volunteer teacher's aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide, Janet Edwards, described herself as a proponent of the "full 
inclusion" mandated by law. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are certain students who are being fully included in the classroom, 
who, to be honest, pose a danger," said Edwards, 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said the problem with the law is that it's tailored "to protect the 
children with special needs, but there are no laws written to protect the 
'regular' students. And my experience in that classroom was, in a word, awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying she could not elaborate for fear of endangering the lawsuit, Edwards 
called the student's behavior "violent -- there's no other way to put it." 
Peters denied that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Such conflict is often the result when the needs of special students are not 
handled properly, said Dana Powell, 36, who claims to have had her own problems 
with the Ocean View district over the needs of her son, now a 13-year-old 
seventh-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often, the schools pit parents against parents and don't take 
responsibility for doing their job," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inclusion Network's Stone said a growing conflict stems from the fact that 
neither parents nor schools really understand the law, which mandates that 
school districts design plans to address special needs as soon as students 
exhibit difficult behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, students, their needs and the most ideal approach are neglected in 
a swirl of bitterness, and sometimes litigation. The parents of such children 
say the schools are often incapable of analyzing a student's glaring needs, or 
deciding what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result," said Lorraine Behunin, the mother of 10 children, one of whom 
has special needs, "a lot of kids in the middle just fall through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Behunin, 46, says her problems with the Westminster School District became so 
acute that the battle escalated to an administrative hearing, which resulted in 
the district paying her son's tuition in an elite private school as well as her 
legal costs, which totaled "tens of thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the district could have settled the complaint or provided more 
intelligent on-site training for her 11-year-old son, who suffers from acute 
dyslexia and who, at taxpayers' expense, was transferred to the Prentice Day 
School in Tustin, which costs $9,900 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became a very adversarial situation," Behunin said, "and it never needed 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Behunin's situation, the Westminster School District on 
Thursday issued the following statement: 
</P>
<P>
 "In our view, (the district) does offer an appropriate educational program for 
this student. We have many qualified teachers who we strongly believe can work 
with him successfully." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters called the claims in the Ocean View district's lawsuit "out-and-out 
lies," contending that the incidents were exaggerated and that his son is not 
an aggressive child. He said teachers and administrators have come to view his 
son's behavior "under a microscope." 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture they paint isn't true," he said, adding, "for example, they say 
Jimmy was spitting. He has never spit. He doesn't even have his two front teeth 
allowing him to spit -- hasn't had them for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the kids who have the problem, it's the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have told him that the worst thing for Jimmy would be a special 
education class, because his condition will improve only if he is around people 
who speak correctly, Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put Jimmy in a class with kids who can't talk, how's he going to 
learn?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 This battle is not new. Peters said he has been fighting for educational 
equality ever since his son enrolled in Circle View. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be messy before it gets better," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Peters' suit claims that the school retaliated against Jimmy "for seeking his 
statutory and constitutional right for (free appropriate public education), by 
suspending him when his father successfully filed four . . . complaints (on 
behalf of other students) -- causing the district to be found out of compliance 
by the state Board of Education." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the problem lies in the fact that the principal objects to "full 
inclusion," which allows a disabled student to remain in a regular class while 
receiving the extra help he needs, Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers and parents were just educated about how to deal with a disabled 
child, maybe they wouldn't be so uncomfortable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also claims district officials failed to provide Jimmy with a proper 
education by refusing to refer him for testing of his ability to understand 
what he hears, despite repeated requests by his father, and by failing to 
comply with recommendations from Jimmy's behavioral specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ronald Wenkart, general counsel for the Orange County Department of 
Education, said the county's 27 school districts are increasingly concerned 
over the potential discipline problems that such children represent -- and the 
fact that state and federal laws leave educators in something of a bind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten to the point where if you want to expel a handicapped student 
whose conduct is not related to their handicap, a slightly disabled student who 
brings, let's say, a knife to school," that student is allowed to see a 
specialist one to two hours each day, Wenkart said. "That student is thus 
treated differently from regular students." 
</P>
<P>
 Behunin and Powell -- and thousands of others in their position -- believe 
that is only fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents of such children have a say in their child's education," Behunin 
said, "especially those not progressing in the proper manner. The school is 
charged with the responsibility to seek and serve and it ought to do it in the 
best way possible."

STATE COURT SAYS ABORTION CLINICS CAN LIMIT PICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, ruling for the first time in an abortion protest 
case, held Thursday that demonstrators can be barred from a public sidewalk in 
front of an abortion clinic to protect patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-1 decision helps assure California's abortion clinics of legal 
protection if pickets threaten patients' emotional health, a protection that 
could be extended to targets of other kinds of political demonstrations as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotionally jarring confrontations with anti-abortion pickets or sidewalk 
'counselors' may pose serious health risks," Justice Armand Arabian wrote for 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second setback for abortion protesters Thursday. President Clinton 
signed legislation making it a federal crime to block the entrance to an 
abortion clinic or attack those entering it. Two anti-abortion groups 
immediately filed a lawsuit to nullify the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The California ruling marked the first time the state's high court has decided 
an abortion case since conservatives gained a majority in 1987. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has a similar case pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the state court's only woman and one of its more 
liberal members, dissented, contending that the buffer zone approved by the 
court was broader than that endorsed by appellate courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In grappling with the case, the state high court called the collision between 
competing constitutional interests "the most difficult and divisive subject of 
our day" and acknowledged that its ruling would be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court majority also called its decision "manifestly reasonable and 
conducive to the fostering of greater harmony in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came in the approval of an injunction that forced antiabortion 
pickets to remain across a busy, four-lane avenue from a Planned Parenthood 
clinic in Vallejo, a Solano County city east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickets had tried to dissuade women entering the clinic from having 
abortions. They gave them anti-abortion literature, shoving it into car windows 
as patients drove in, and on at least two occasions tossed them plastic 
replicas of fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state's responsibility for the health and safety of women seeking medical 
services, including abortions, extends beyond the operating room," Arabian 
wrote. "Physical or emotional intimidation of patients outside the doctor's 
office may significantly affect their course of treatment once they are 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case involved abortion, the decision has ramifications for other 
demonstrations that limit the "rights of private citizens to conduct their 
lawful business without pain or hindrance," wrote Justice Marvin Baxter, in a 
separate concurring opinion joined by Justice Ronald George. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said the kinds of confrontational actions taken by the abortion 
picketers "crossed the line from protected expression to unprotected 
interference with the lawful activities of other citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Streett, an attorney for Solano Citizens for Life, which appealed the 
case to the high court, noted that the ruling could also limit the ability of 
unions to picket. 
</P>
<P>
 In the abortion context, he said, the decision will "make it very easy" for 
clinics to get injunctions to stop any protests on their sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically all they have to allege is, 'Our patients are upset by this, they 
don't like it, they are crying, we feel they are traumatized,' " Streett said. 
"That is not going to be much of a standard at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for Planned Parenthood said courts still will have freedom to 
shape injunctions according to the facts of the case, including the 
configuration of the clinic and its proximity to protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling simply "means that patients at medical clinics have the right 
to be free of abuse, harassment and assault," said Planned Parenthood attorney 
Stephen Kostka. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Williams, former director of Solano Citizens for Life, complained 
that the court's decision will make it "extremely difficult" for anti-abortion 
groups to give abortion patients "one last chance to change their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickets have been congregating weekly across the street from the Planned 
Parenthood clinic since a Solano County Superior Court issued the permanent 
injunction in August, 1991, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the protesters cannot be heard by patients through the din of traffic, she 
said, and their numbers have dropped because "people are very discouraged by 
the lack of effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Griffin, a former coordinator for the South Coast chapter of the 
National Organization for Women who has escorted women through demonstrations 
to clinics in Orange County, said she was delighted by the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
 "As someone who has helped people at family planning clinics, I have seen 
people be physically assaulted, and I'm delighted that the state has decided to 
take steps to ensure both their physical and emotional health at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosemarie Avila, an anti-abortion activist and trustee of the Santa Ana 
Unified School District, said, "I think it's a shame that they're doing this. 
The whole anti-abortion movement is based on nonviolence, that's really what 
they stand for -- first nonviolence in the womb and then nonviolence on the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion-rights advocates have been buoyed by recent victories. In January, 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that abortion clinics can sue protesters for 
damage under a federal racketeering law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems to be part of a big wall that is coming down," said Anna Runkle, 
spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, Shasta-Diablo, which runs the Vallejo 
clinic. "It seems to be a landslide. The public and the law are finally saying 
enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 In her dissent, Kennard said the injunction banishing the protesters to the 
opposite side of the street violated their First Amendment rights to express 
their views. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other appellate courts cited by the majority approved of buffer 
zones, Kennard said, they also allowed a limited number of protesters within 
them or drew them narrowly enough to permit protesters to communicate with 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 By forcing the pickets to remain across the street, their message may even be 
"grossly misinterpreted" by passersby, Kennard said. Also located across the 
street from the clinic is the office of Birthright of Vallejo/Benecia. 
</P>
<P>
 Passersby may assume that "the protest is against that organization, which 
opposes abortions, rather than against the medical clinic, which provides 
them," she said.

TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL; GOP SUPPORT FOR CHALLENGER UNZ SPELLS TROUBLE FOR 
WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign is running into trouble in 
Republican-rich Orange County, with one-third of GOP voters saying they intend 
to cast their ballot for his relatively unknown opponent in the June 7 primary 
and a fifth saying they will defect to the Democrats in November, according to 
a Times Orange County Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show of voter dissatisfaction with Wilson, only 38% of voters say he is 
doing an "excellent" or "good" job as governor, reflecting his flagging 
popularity among county voters. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the poll has good news for Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, whose Republican rivals are not generating the overwhelming 
excitement among local GOP voters necessary to carry the state in November. The 
GOP candidate usually needs more than a 2-to-1 margin in Orange County in the 
general election to offset the Democratic strongholds in Los Angeles and the 
San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's troubles appear significant, and are not limited to the primary. If 
the November election were held today, he would manage a 52%-to-35% margin in 
Orange County over Democrat Kathleen Brown -- and would do even worse against 
Democrat John Garamendi, according to the poll. Wilson's support in the Brown 
contest shows him merely running even with the party's registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three months ago at the state GOP convention, Wilson's political 
consultant, George Gorton, boasted that the governor's approval rating was 
higher among Orange County Republicans than it was statewide. The notion that 
party conservatives were dissatisfied with Wilson was "a myth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest Times Orange County Poll, conducted by Mark Baldassare and 
Associates, mirrors what other statewide surveys have shown in recent days -- 
Ron K. Unz, the wealthy and conservative 32-year-old computer entrepreneur who 
has reached into his deep pockets to fund his quixotic bid for the 
governorship, has cut into Wilson's support. The poll of 600 Orange County 
registered voters was conducted May 19 to 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Among likely Republican voters, Wilson holds a 54%-to-36% margin over Unz. A 
recent statewide Field Poll showed Wilson with 53% among likely GOP voters and 
Unz with 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rena Schlueter, a 29-year-old certified public accountant from Orange, is a 
Wilson defector. Despite knowing little about Unz, she said in an interview, 
she plans to vote for the GOP challenger in the primary and support the 
Democratic nominee in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson "has never done anything for me; I don't think he's done anything, 
period," said Schlueter, who voted for Wilson in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare sees problems for the governor. "Wilson is facing difficulty within 
his own party and has a very difficult road ahead of him in the November 
election because a number of Republicans seem willing to defect," Baldassare 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly does not help that he has an embarrassing situation with 
one-third of the Republicans here, in a Republican stronghold, supporting an 
unknown (Unz) against an incumbent," Baldassare added. 
</P>
<P>
 The only good news for Wilson in this poll, Baldassare said, is that Garamendi 
-- who has more appeal to Republican and centrist voters than Brown -- is not 
heavily favored by Democratic voters and is not expected to be the Democratic 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Brown holds a 20-point lead over Garamendi among likely 
Democratic voters -- 49% to 29% -- with liberal state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica) receiving 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 History has proven the importance of strong Orange County support for 
Republican candidates. In his first gubernatorial race in 1990, Wilson beat the 
Democratic nominee, Feinstein, by a 2-to-1 margin here. It carried him over the 
top in statewide returns and he won the election by three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Soifer, a 36-year-old municipal employee from Anaheim, was another 
Republican voter who said he would support Unz and the Democratic nominee in 
November as a protest against Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Soifer said he blames Wilson for signing off on state budgets that were 
balanced by passing along higher fees and and less revenue to city and county 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just very unhappy about the way Wilson has been running things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all voters are prepared to blame Wilson for the state's troubles. 
Jennifer Kennedy, a 32-year-old Yorba Linda resident, will vote for him in June 
though she rated his job performance as "fair." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really see California coming out of the recession like the rest of 
the country," Kennedy said. "I am probably more pessimistic than most because I 
am in the aerospace industry (which has suffered severe cutbacks due to 
military downsizing). I think a lot more needs to be done for the state in 
general." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Saari, 53, of Dana Point blames former Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian for leaving Wilson "with a hell of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson "got left with a trash bucket full of stuff and he can only do so much 
to try to improve things," Saari said in expressing his strong support for the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Saari, however, said he will vote for Feinstein's reelection to the U.S. 
Senate because he is not excited about the GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the three Republicans in the Senate race, former Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer leads Rep. Michael Huffington of Santa Barbara by only four 
percentage points among all Republicans, but when only likely Republican voters 
are considered, the picture reverses and Huffington leads Dannemeyer by seven 
points, according to the poll. The third candidate, Riverside County 
businesswoman Kate Squires, is a distant third in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Huffington or Dannemeyer would beat Feinstein if the election were 
held today, the margins are similar to the November, 1992, election, when 
then-Sen. John Seymour of Orange County, a Republican, beat Feinstein in local 
balloting but lost the statewide vote.

poorly. His Republican primary opponent, Ron K. Unz, is getting a third of the 
support. If the November election were held today, Wilson would beat Kathleen 
Brown in Orange County by 17 percentage points and John Garamendi by six 
percentage points.

 Though the normally obscure jobs have received unusual attention this year, 
many voters still are not sure whom to support in the races for county 
clerk-recorder and treasurer-tax collector, according to a Times Orange County 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of those surveyed said they did not know who would get their vote 
in the clerk-recorder contest, while 36% were undecided in the treasurer's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer Robert L. Citron, a 23-year incumbent, held a strong lead in his 
race, garnering the support of 41% of respondents to challenger John M.W. 
Moorlach's 22%. Among the most likely voters, Citron has a bigger lead over 
Moorlach -- 50% to 19%, with 30% undecided. Moorlach, a certified public 
accountant, has criticized the way Citron invested billions of dollars in 
county tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the newly combined job of clerk-recorder, Recorder Lee A. 
Branch and Clerk Gary L. Granville topped a field of four candidates. Branch 
held a six-percentage point lead over Granville even though he was censured by 
the Board of Supervisors in January and accused of mismanaging his department 
and sexually harassing two female employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates, which surveyed 600 
Orange County registered voters May 19-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Katz, co-director of the Times Orange County Poll, said the relative 
obscurity of their jobs might help Citron and Branch, who are facing unusually 
strong election challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think negative publicity for Citron and Branch probably hasn't hurt them as 
much as it would hurt a more visible public figure," Katz said. "People pay 
less attention to local races. These people are not in the public eye as much." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll results indicate that Citron has not been significantly hurt by 
questions about his investment strategy, which Moorlach claims is risky and 
unwise in a period of rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still has a good edge," Katz said. "I think it's a pretty safe lead for 
Citron." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron and other officials have defended the investment strategy, saying it 
has earned double the returns of comparable investment pools over the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said that the clerk-recorder race is "still up for grabs" because 49% of 
those polled were undecided. "It could go either way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch won the support of 21% of respondents, compared to 15% for Granville, 
8% for assistant recorder Ella M. Murphy and 6% for attorney Christopher J. 
Leanders. Among likely voters, Branch led Granville 24% to 16%, with 47% 
undecided, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 The race has centered on Branch's conduct, which Granville and Murphy attacked 
for lowering morale and productivity in the office. Branch has denied any 
wrongdoing and said the charges against him are overblown. The clerk-recorder 
is in charge of issuing marriage licenses and fictitious business names, as 
well as filing property records. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll respondent Jeanne O'Shea, a retired medical technician who lives in Costa 
Mesa, said she plans to vote against Branch because "he didn't seem to respond 
to complaints from people who worked under him." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with other poll respondents indicated that many voters are 
unfamiliar with the candidates and issues in both the clerk-recorder and 
treasurer races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that many people don't think about these local races well in 
advance," Katz said. "A lot of decisions might be made right in the voting 
booth." How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 Orange County registered voters was conducted May 
19-22 on weekday nights and weekend days, using a computer-generated random 
sample of listed and unlisted phone numbers. The margin of error for the total 
sample is plus or minus 4%. For subgroups, such as Democrats or Republicans, 
the margin of error would be larger. Times Orange County Poll 
</P>
<P>
 Where County Races Stand 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-one percent of voters say they would choose Robert L. Citron for Orange 
County treasurer-tax collector over John M.W. Moorlach, who has 22%. The race 
for clerk-recorder is a closer contest. 
</P>
<P>

3 O.C. PARKS INCLUDED IN HAZARD LIST; SAFETY: GROUP SAYS PLAYGROUNDS CAN BE 
DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN. STUDY CITES 46 FACILITIES IN STATE CONTAIN RISKS THAT 
SHOULD BE CORRECTED.

<P>
 California playgrounds can be hazardous to children, according to activists 
who claimed on Thursday that virtually all the playgrounds checked, including 
three in Orange County posed some kind of threat. 
</P>
<P>
 At a San Francisco news conference, the California Public Interest Research 
group said that a study revealed that 46 playgrounds around the state contained 
hazards that should be corrected. In Orange County, the group cited Allen Park 
in Fountain Valley and Orchard Park and Northwood Community Park in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said that the Orange County parks had inadequate surfacing and "fall 
zones" to prevent injury from playground equipment. In addition, the Irvine 
parks had playground equipment that allowed children's heads to be trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Fierro, Irvine's manager for community services who oversees park 
planning and maintenance, said the report came as a surprise and that the city 
had never been contacted by the research group.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've worked real hard to make sure our playgrounds are safe," Fierro said. 
"We've won numerous awards." The city also has "followed safety guidelines by 
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard Park was developed following all existing guidelines, Fierro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwood Community Park "was built much earlier in the city's history," she 
said, "at a time when we were permitting our architects to have a little more 
creative opportunities in the development of playground equipment. Now we 
purchase (equipment) out of catalogues." 
</P>
<P>
 At Northwood, known to children as 'Castle Park,' and other, older parks, "we 
have made modifications for safety," Fierro said. "We try to minimize the 
dangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura McGourty of the research group said, "Public playgrounds can be 
wonderful places for children to have fun and face new challenges, but far too 
many playgrounds contain hidden hazards that can injure and even kill."  
</P>
<P>
 The investigation hit on hazards that cause the most serious playground 
injuries: falls, impact with moving swings, and head entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
 Protective surfacing under and around all play equipment is the most critical 
factor, McGourty told reporters. All but two of the 46 playgrounds investigated 
lack adequate protective surfacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood chips, sand, any loose fill is good, providing it's between nine and 12 
inches deep, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rubber mats take impact well, McGourty said, adding that they have another 
plus. Broken glass, used syringes and other items that became buried in sand 
can be spotted on the mats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want parents to be paranoid about bringing their children to the 
playgrounds," said McGourty. "We just want people to know about it and, as 
well, the park personnel to know that these playgrounds do have hazards that 
can actually injure our children."

LECTURE BECOMES LESSON ON HURDLES TO OVERCOME

 A lecture at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church on Thursday was 
aimed at showing that Jews and blacks have in common a shared heritage of 
persecution: scholars presented newly uncovered evidence that it was during the 
German colonization of Africa that Nazis developed some of the racist ideology 
they later applied to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholars detailed for the mixed audience how the Nazis tortured and 
murdered African American prisoners of war because of their race, and how they 
sterilized young children of mixed African and German blood to maintain what 
they claimed was "racial purity." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the floor was opened to questions, and a 16-year-old African American 
girl clutching a notebook asked: "Why is there so much tension between blacks 
and Jews?" 
</P>
<P>
 After a painful silence, a white-haired African American woman told the girl 
she would get no answers at the forum because the Jews present were the source 
of the problem. She told the girl she should study the writings of Louis 
Farrakhan and Khallid Abdul Muhammad to get the real answers. 
</P>
<P>
 A Jewish member of the audience responded by criticizing Farrakhan for 
allegedly associating with white racists and having a "divide and conquer" 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, another member of the audience said the content of the lecture showed a 
reason for Jews and blacks to come together: "We survivors are like a family -- 
if we can demonstrate we suffered the same genocide, that should make us 
brothers!" 
</P>
<P>
 The moderator of the event, organized by the Martyrs Memorial and Museum of 
the Holocaust, tried to steer questions back to the official topic: how the 
newly uncovered history of black victimization by the Nazis might be introduced 
in secondary school classrooms. But he could not stop the subsequent 
free-for-all, as the Farrakhan believers and Jewish audience members followed 
the girl outside and alternately tugged at her arm, with many saying, "Don't 
listen to them! "  
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by her shouting elders, the girl had tears in her eyes but 
maintained her composure and continued to try to find an answer. "I heard," she 
said, "that blacks and Jews once worked together in the civil rights movement. 
What happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Rev. Leonard Jackson, associate minister of the predominantly 
black church, took her to a quiet room. He said the answer that he gave her was 
that blacks and Jews have been divided by people afraid of the power they would 
have if they were united. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at this as a blessing," Jackson said of the disagreement that 
erupted. "It should erase the doubt in everyone's mind that (education) is 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the lecture had been inspired by another fracas -- the controversy 
that erupted after some Oakland high school students were kicked out of a movie 
theater for laughing at scenes of the murder of Jews in the movie "Schindler's 
List." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Grobman, director of the Holocaust museum, who moderated Thursday's 
event, said that the Oakland students reacted that way because they were 
unfamiliar with history and did not understand that the events in the film 
really happened. He invited several of the students to visit the museum, and 
found that they were genuinely interested in understanding what had happened 
under the Nazis.  
</P>
<P>
 Sam Goetz, chairman of the museum and a survivor of the camp featured in the 
film, said the students became "very emotional" as they heard his story 
firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 Grobman and Goetz concluded that they had to find a way to teach the Holocaust 
that makes sense to diverse students. They looked for Holocaust stories that 
involved blacks, and discovered the work of Howard University-trained academics 
Susanne Riveles and Robert Kesting, who were the featured speakers Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Kesting, an archivist at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, 
said that in one case, 11 captured African American soldiers were humiliated by 
Nazi SS officers and forced to carry them on their backs before they were 
tortured, mutilated and executed. Other black soldiers were forced to dig their 
own graves before they were executed.  
</P>
<P>
 Although white soldiers were also mistreated by Germans, Kesting says blacks 
tended to be treated worse because of their race.  
</P>
<P>
 In a horrific example of Nazi eugenics -- the pseudo-science of genetically 
"improving" the human race -- hundreds of half-black, half-German children, 
ages 6 to 12, were sterilized under government dictates in the 1930s, Kesting 
said. Some may have been killed in Nazi "euthanasia" programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Labeled the "Rhineland bastards," the children were for the most part the 
offspring of German women who married African soldiers who were part of the 
French army occupying western Germany after World War I.  
</P>
<P>
 Riveles detailed how the racist attitudes of some Nazi officials were shaped 
by their experiences in German colonies in Africa, where they began to consider 
some races subhuman.  
</P>
<P>
 The stories of the shared history of suffering under the Nazis were deeply 
moving, said several members of the audience, which was largely made up of 
schoolteachers of various races. But the controversy surrounding the 
teen-ager's question clearly shook up many people. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookie Lommel, founder of a group called Operation Unity, which is aimed at 
improving black-Jewish relations, compared the tension between the African 
Americans and Jews to "sibling rivalry -- you do so many things together but 
you also fight." 
</P>
<P>
 She shook her head at the fracas caused by the girl's innocent question. "It 
shows what a hot button it is," she said.

SWEET SUCCESS AT 89; MASTER'S DEGREE CAPS A COLLEGE CAREER THAT STARTED IN THE 
1920S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 There hadn't been this much attention paid to Pearl Sweet for 70 years -- not 
since that fateful day in 1924 when she fell through the trapdoor next to the 
front cash register at the Wave Confectionary Shop and landed with a thud in 
the basement near the chocolate-dipping machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Here the 89-year-old was, decked out Thursday in a cap and gown, getting a 
master's degree in history from Cal State Long Beach as a busload of relatives 
from all over the United States looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to steam out my gown and hood in the bathroom, but it didn't work," 
apologized Sweet, who lives at Leisure World in Seal Beach. "So I'm afraid 
they're wrinkled. But so am I." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet's college career has had more than its share of wrinkles, too. 
</P>
<P>
 She started it in the early 1920s at the University of the Pacific in 
Stockton. But the 1924 tumble through the trapdoor cut it short. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall damaged her kidneys, knocked her gall bladder askew and caused other 
internal injuries that she says have dogged her ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the nicest stores in Stockton," she recalls. "They sold 
homemade candies they made in the basement. I slipped, grabbed a post and a 
metal chain and we all went to the basement concrete floor." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years after the accident, Sweet raised two sons and watched them pursue 
college educations. But it wasn't until 1976 that she decided to resume her own 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She finished her undergraduate work through a University of the Pacific 
extension program and immediately launched her master's degree studies at Cal 
State Long Beach when she learned that fees were waived for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 For her thesis, she decided to research the history of Methodist higher 
education in Northern California. She started writing it in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, she took courses from a dozen professors. Two of her graduate 
studies advisers died. Her last one, retired history professor Irv Ahlquist, 
spent a record 12 years on her thesis committee. He sat near the front at 
Thursday's commencement to watch her graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to see this day come. In many ways," Ahlquist said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Abrahamse, a former history department chairwoman who is Cal State Long 
Beach's acting vice president, praised Sweet's accomplishment: "She didn't do 
this for a career. She did it for intellectual satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 family members from as far as Florida came for the ceremony. 
Afterward, they tossed a combination celebration party and family reunion at 
Leisure World, where Sweet's three-room home and patio are filled with research 
materials for her 130-page thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if I die here nobody will have to worry about notifying my relatives. 
They're all here," Sweet joked to university administrator Shayne Schroeder as 
she waited for the ceremony to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sons Sanford, 64, and Van, 62, assisted their mother when it came time for her 
degree to be conferred by interim university President Karl Anatol. She beamed 
and waved to the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends and family are so relieved," she said. "Every year the alumni 
association kept sending me a letter welcoming me as a member, but my thesis 
wasn't finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is. And so is she. "I don't plan to go back to school again. Ever," she 
said. "This is enough."

EX-FARRAKHAN AIDE BRINGS HIS WAR OF WORDS TO L.A.; RACE: KHALLID ABDUL 
MUHAMMAD'S STATEMENTS ABOUT BLACKS, JEWS AND ARABS HAVE BEEN DENOUNCED 
NATIONWIDE AS VENOMOUS INCITEMENTS TO HATRED. HE CALLS HIMSELF A 'TRUTH 
TERRORIST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He says he's a teacher. He says he's at war. 
</P>
<P>
 But most black and white leaders tend to describe Khallid Abdul Muhammad with 
words like these: repugnant, vile, anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, the 43-year-old former senior aide to Louis Farrakhan, head of the 
Nation of Islam, became more controversial than his mentor for remarks at a 
Nov. 29 speech at Kean College in New Jersey. He said that Jews and Arabs were 
"the bloodsuckers of the black nation and the black community." He called Pope 
John Paul II a "cracker"; he suggested that Jewish people brought on the 
Holocaust themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has come to Los Angeles, where he grew up and where he will speak 
Saturday night -- his first address here since the speech that made him 
infamous. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, with his 9-year-old son, Farrakhan Khallid Muhammad, 
constantly at his side in a borrowed office in the Crenshaw district, Muhammad 
reflected on his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many. Not only was his speech denounced by the President, the 
Congressional Black Caucus, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and leading black and 
Jewish leaders, but Farrakhan himself was forced to reprimand Muhammad and 
suspend him from his duties as a top aide and spokesman. "He said my speech was 
vile in manner, repugnant, malicious, mean-spirited, and spoken in mockery of 
individuals and people and not in the spirit of Islam. I will never forget 
those words," Muhammad said. "I feel very hurt over those words, to be honest." 
</P>
<P>
 (Adding to the controversy, however, Farrakhan said he agreed with the basic 
truths of what Muhammad had said -- just not the way he said it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, who will speak Saturday night at the Vison Complex theater in the 
Crenshaw district and Sunday at UC Riverside, gives an average of five speeches 
a week, for what he says is an average honorarium of $10,000 a speech. And his 
usual topic is the "black holocaust," the sufferings of blacks for centuries, 
before, during and after the American slave trade. Where it gets incendiary is 
when he begins to compare it to the World War II Holocaust, saying that 
oppression of blacks has taken far more lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League is among his most vocal critics. "I don't see 
what's to be gained by relativizing human tragedy," said David Lehrer, regional 
director here of the Anti-Defamation League. "It's pernicious. . . . My hope is 
that Khallid Abdul Muhammad doesn't speak for many black people. He is a 
divisive separatist who spews forth venom in every direction. Good people in 
all communities have and will continue to reject the blandishments of this 
bigot." 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad does not disavow any of his Kean College remarks, and is likely to 
touch on the same themes here. In fact, like a politician on the campaign 
trail, he uses phrases again and again. "I'm a truth terrorist, I'm a knowledge 
gangster," he often says. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, he promises, "I will name the names of the Jews in all of 
the major networks who have great control and influence over all the negative 
images of blacks in movies and television and the media in general." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask him why he measures which is worse, black suffering or the Holocaust, and 
he replies without raising his voice, "That is such a ridiculous question to 
ask me. We never made it an issue. It's the so-called Jews who make it an 
issue. . . . The Jews believe they have a corner on suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 The venom and vitriol of most of his speeches tend to overshadow any lessons 
about black oppression that he has to offer. But he doesn't really care who is 
offended. White, Jewish, Catholic, Arab critics -- they're among the oppressors 
of blacks. Black critics are brainwashed or "house niggers." 
</P>
<P>
 All this is said calmly, quietly during the interview. In speeches, he is 
commanding, theatrical. But here, he rarely raises his voice. He is articulate, 
if sometimes given to making small speeches that quote a blur of sources from 
historical writings to the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrives with an entourage of security, but his son is his most ardent 
observer. Farrakhan listens raptly, scrutinizing his father and his father's 
interviewer. He stands when his father is ready to leave, gets papers for him 
from his bag when his father requests them. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, who is divorced from his son's mother, refers to her only as a 
member of the Nation of Islam, "a very brilliant African queen." 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad is reluctant to reveal many of the details of his life or boyhood in 
Los Angeles. He spent his childhood between Texas -- where he was born Harold 
Moore Vann -- and Los Angeles, where he still has close ties. He says he has a 
doctorate in sociology but he declines to name the university where he earned 
it, saying his Ph.D. from a white institution means little to him. (Other news 
accounts say he attended Dillard University in New Orleans, and put his age at 
48.) 
</P>
<P>
 He does say that he grew disenchanted with traditional academia and eventually 
took up the work of the Nation of Islam after meeting Farrakhan in New Orleans 
in 1967. In 1988, while living in Atlanta, Muhammad was convicted of using a 
false Social Security number on a home mortgage loan application, and served 
one year in prison. He now lives in New York and spends most of his time 
traveling and making speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 If they offend people, he says, so be it. "If you're at war, you're supposed 
to attack your enemies. It's arrogant to tell the aggrieved, to tell the 
victim, to tell the survivor of the African holocaust how to suffer or how to 
talk."

TICKET TRICKS; ILLEGAL SCALPERS SAY THEY'RE JUST MAKING A LIVING WHILE MAKING 
CUSTOMERS HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 No way he's selling crack cocaine -- not any more, says Cory Robinson. Yet 
here he is, in a ragtag cluster of men on a noisy Los Angeles street corner, 
watching the cars for action and worrying about another police bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not selling no drugs, we're not committing no robberies," Robinson says 
defiantly, a diamond stud in each ear, his eyes sharp under a low-slung cap. 
"We ain't doing no wrong. We're just giving the people what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 What they want, this night, is a ticket or two to the Dodgers game. Robinson 
is a scalper, a nomadic wheeler-dealer in the illegal ticket trade. At 21, he 
says, he has spent four years taking tax-free profits at sporting events all 
over the map. He's done hockey in Toronto, football in Oklahoma, and college 
basketball's Final Four in North Carolina. That blue cap he's wearing is a 
memento of the Super Bowl in Atlanta, where he picked up $1,000 for a day's 
work in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger Stadium is his favorite Los Angeles venue, as it is for more than 50 
independent, unlicensed entrepreneurs who unlawfully work the winding roads 
outside the ballpark, all but in the shadow of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's training academy. 
</P>
<P>
 The scalpers run a season-long cat-and-mouse game with LAPD vice officers, 
winning just often enough to survive -- though not in great numbers, or in 
lavish style. Most are poor street hustlers, moonlighting from blue-collar jobs 
or using scalping as a sole source of income. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys say if they wasn't dealing tickets, they'd be dealing hub 
caps," says Danny, 35, a veteran of 15 seasons who, like most scalpers, refuses 
to divulge his full name. Danny is the prototypical scalper: Wearing his 
Dodgers cap, he shows up three hours before game time, working the cars on 
strategic points along Stadium Way, Elysian Park Avenue and Academy Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every scalper carries the same hand-printed cardboard sign: "I need 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 The sign is a bit of a ruse. It advertises that the scalper is ready to deal 
without touting the unlawful side of his trade -- the fact that, when not 
buying tickets, he is busily hawking them for sometimes double or triple the 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets come from anywhere -- box offices, licensed brokers or, often, 
season-ticket holders who choose not to attend a given game. The brokers and 
season-seat holders know the scalpers are out there, ready to pay cash for good 
locations. They drive up and unload their unwanted tickets in hasty, 
through-the-car-window deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalpers then await their buyers, who are expected to see through the 
counter-logic of the "I need tickets" signs. "They will see you're dealing in 
tickets and they'll ask (if we also sell)," says Rick, 55, who dangles a 
cigarette from his fingers while advertising on steeply sloping Elysian Park 
Avenue, north of Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 On a good night, the scalpers at Dodger Stadium say, each can haul down $150, 
even $200. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are risks. They can be stuck with unwanted tickets, a chronic 
occupational hazard. LaMont, 24, who scored a $1,700 windfall at last year's 
USC-UCLA college football game, remembers getting burned not long ago at a 
hockey game in Anaheim: He invested heavily in tickets to the Mighty Ducks' 
final home game of the season, only to have the team fall out of the playoff 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost him $200. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom fell out," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the police, often in plain clothes, posing as buyers just 
as they would during a drug bust. The police confiscate their tickets and issue 
citations, scalpers say. Fines run about $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if police don't catch them in the act, passing patrol officers shoo them 
along. Scalping is neither a high-priority crime nor a significant problem, 
except at sold-out games or rock concerts, police say. But the practice of 
snapping up tickets and boosting prices cheats customers of a chance to buy 
those tickets at a fair value, said Detective Kurt Joachimstaler of the LAPD's 
administrative-vice gambling section. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state scalping laws, tickets cannot be resold, even at face value, on 
the premises of an arena. City ordinances also make it a misdemeanor to resell 
tickets off-site without a license, such as those held by ticket agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalpers resent the regulations and the busts. They say their main problem -- 
maybe their only real problem -- is the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rough, man . . . the cops harass us," complains Michael Williams, 22, 
who says he has been cited perhaps 10 times in five years. The cops got him 
just the other day, he adds. "They could be out there doing their jobs, chasing 
the big-time thieves and dope dealers. We're not bothering nobody. We're just 
doing our jobs, like they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling the shoulder of Stadium Way, Williams holds his sign in one hand and 
a brown bag in the other. A Budweiser cap pokes up like a budding flower. He 
talks of his trade as nothing short of a public service, saying fans rely on 
him. "They don't have to wait in line," he says. "Sold-out games, we give them 
the tickets they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams says he works nearly every Dodgers home game, spending $1.10 to take 
the bus downtown from South-Central Los Angeles. In between games, Williams 
runs a forklift at a warehouse, he says. He supports five children and 
step-children, plus a cat and a dog, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just enough to make ends meet," he says. "This is work. It's a 
grind." 
</P>
<P>
 LaMont is one of the lucky ones. He owns a car, an old beige Oldsmobile. 
Robinson used to have a car -- an '80 Buick Regal -- but it broke down at a 
Pink Floyd concert in Oakland. He sold it there for $900, enough for plane fare 
to Las Vegas to roll the dice, as it were, on the recent Julio Cesar Chavez 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he gets to Dodger Stadium by bus from Hawthorne, dreaming of the day when 
he will buy his own minivan. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, the Cubs are in town. Up on Academy Road, where LaMont is one 
of several scalpers working a busy stretch of asphalt, a deal is going down. 
Brian Schroeder of Farley, Iowa, has rolled into town in his "Cubs Mobile," a 
blue '71 Volkswagen convertible with "Cubs" and "Holy Cow!" splashed in red 
across its flank. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder has come a few thousand miles and wants a seat right behind the 
Cubs' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 One scalper has it -- a seat four rows back. The face value is $11, but the 
scalper wants $40. They haggle good-naturedly until Schroeder agrees to pay $30 
and pulls out his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said $35?" the scalper asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, $30." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is made and the scalper walks away, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder is grinning, too -- another satisfied customer. "He's laughing at me 
because no one's going to pay that for the Cubs' side (of the field)," he says 
of the scalper. "But I'm going to enjoy the game, right? That's baseball."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY, 
POLICE UNION AGREE TO AROUND-THE-CLOCK TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city agreed Thursday to begin immediate around-the-clock negotiations with 
the Police Protective League in hopes of bringing the divisive contract dispute 
to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 But the announcement, city officials said, did not signal any movement in the 
talks -- which resumed after police officers overwhelmingly rejected the deal 
the city negotiated with union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get this thing settled," said council President John Ferraro. "We 
certainly have a great appreciation for the Police Department. We want them to 
be content and happy, but they have to understand our limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers have demanded retroactive pay for the two years they have been 
seeking a contract. The city, which offered a 3% raise for each of the next two 
years, says it cannot afford retroactive pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will go to court this morning to block a planned sickout by officers. 
A union-sponsored boycott of overtime duty is under way. Some officers who have 
signed up for overtime in recent days have been subjected to harassment by 
their colleagues, sources said.

white supremacist groups in Southern California, was awarded a medal of valor 
Thursday for leading the successful investigation at the risk of his own life. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, 14 firefighters, paramedics and law enforcement officers were 
presented Los Angeles Community Protector awards at the Universal Sheraton for 
their willingness to go beyond the call of duty for their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Special Agent German showed tremendous tenacity, courage and calm under 
extreme pressure," the award to him stated. "His selfless dedication to his 
role and his sacrifice in the face of great danger resulted in the successful 
arrest and prosecution of many white supremacist individuals and the prevention 
of extremely serious and deadly hate crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 German was one of eight federal agents whose work was honored by the Los 
Angeles Chapter of the Federal Bar Assn. on Thursday at the Century Plaza 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of them -- Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents Conway LeBleu, 
Todd W. McKeehan, Robert J. Williams and Steven David Willis -- were honored 
posthumously. All four were killed during the Feb. 28, 1993, raid on the Branch 
Davidian compound in Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recipients included Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Paul H. 
Clayton, who infiltrated drug organizations in California and South America; 
and Immigration and Naturalization Service agents Aaron G. Wilson and Frank J. 
Cabibi, who arrested two armed suspects despite threats from a group of nearby 
gang members demanding that the men be released. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Community Protector awards ceremony, about 800 community 
representatives, civic leaders and family members of the recipients attended 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people don't realize that these men and women devote their time doing 
things in the community after they leave their jobs," said Los Angeles City 
Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of the 1994 awards are: Steven D. Hofbauer, a Los Angeles City 
Fire Department firefighter; Stephen J. Ruda, a Fire Department captain; Jose 
Isaac Gonzales, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy; James Hellmold, also a 
sheriff's deputy; Rudy Mariscal, a Los Angeles County Fire Department 
specialist; Carlos Perez, a county Fire Department firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Also honored were Lise Ovesen, an LAPD officer; L. Dale Turner, an LAPD 
officer; William L. Glass, a California Highway Patrol officer; Michael H. 
Werner, a CHP officer; Darryl Forbes, Burbank Fire Department fire marshal; Rod 
Brooks, a Glendale police officer; Scott Jaeggi, a Downey Fire Department 
paramedic, and Sgt. David W. Smith of the Torrance Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams said the aim of the awards is to 
thank those who put in those extra hours to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows the hard work and dedication these people have," Williams said. "It 
typifies what 100 officers do every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Isaac Gonzales, a nine-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department now 
stationed in East Los Angeles, was recognized for his devotion to a terminally 
ill 9-year-old cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales made arrangements for a special bed to be given to the boy, got him 
front-row tickets to a Lakers game and stayed by the boy's side when he died 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel guilty for getting the award," Gonzales said. "It was something that I 
did from my heart. You just don't expect all this." 
</P>
<P>
 Hofbauer called his award "overwhelming." The 14-year veteran of the city Fire 
Department was singled out for his work in developing a quicker way to 
distribute toys for the department's "Toys for Needy Children" program.

SWEEPS THROUGH VACANT APARTMENT BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire swept through the top floor of a vacant, four-story apartment building in 
Hollywood on Thursday afternoon, jamming homebound commuter traffic throughout 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 firefighters responded to the blaze that broke out about 5 p.m. in 
the building at 1720 N. Taft Avenue. The fire was controlled in about 40 
minutes and officials said that it had been set. They said the building was 
vacant because of damage suffered in the January earthquake. There were no 
reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, fire damaged part of another vacant apartment building about 
10 blocks away, at 5523 Lexington Avenue. Four firefighters received minor 
injuries battling that blaze. The causes of both fires were under 
investigation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CULVER CITY; FACTORY 
WHERE HUGHES BUILT SPRUCE GOOSE CLOSES DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 51-year-old factory where Howard Hughes built the giant Spruce Goose 
seaplane closed Thursday, a victim of aerospace work shifted to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp. had built helicopter parts in Building 15 since buying 
Hughes Aircraft Co.'s helicopter line in 1984.The work had been shifted 
gradually to McDonnell's main helicopter site in Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 50 workers remained for the last shift in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Building 15 was where Hughes built the HK-1 Hercules Flying Boat, the Spruce 
Goose. At 218 feet long and 79 feet high, it is among the largest planes ever 
built. Hughes piloted the Spruce Goose on its first and only flight over Los 
Angeles Harbor in 1947. The plane later was displayed in adjacent Long Beach, 
then was moved to Oregon last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen other structures are at the 260-acre site, a few still leased by 
Hughes Aircraft and McDonnell but most sit empty. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas will keep a few employees at the site until its lease runs 
out at the end of the year, said Ken Jensen, a spokesman for the helicopter 
operations in Mesa.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CARSON; 2 CARJACKING 
SUSPECTS LINKED TO EARLIER ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two carjacking suspects arrested after a high-speed chase in Carson have been 
linked to a similar vehicle robbery in Hollywood less than 24 hours earlier, 
sheriff's officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 William Brown, 20, and Tyril Sibley, 18, both of Los Angeles, were arrested 
after the driver of a new Pontiac Firebird was robbed of his vehicle at 
gunpoint Wednesday evening near the South Bay Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sheriff's deputy took a report from the victim, he spotted the Firebird 
pass by the mall, said Sheriff's Sgt. Brent Becker. Authorities chased the 
suspects for several miles on Wilmington Avenue until the Firebird crashed into 
a tree near Dominguez Street, Becker said. The deputies crashed into the back 
of the Firebird, but there were no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested, Sibley was wearing a bandage to cover a fresh gunshot 
wound to his neck, said Sheriff's Sgt. Jerry Kaono. He may have been shot 
during a carjacking in Hollywood, where the armed owner of a Mazda 626 was 
robbed by two men at gunpoint just outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim fired several shots as the two men fled, Los Angeles Detective 
Michael Thrasher said. The victim did not know if his shots struck any of the 
robbers, Thrasher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies also found credit cards that belonged to the victim in the 
Hollywood carjacking, Kaono said. The Mazda 626 was found in the lot of the 
South Bay Pavilion, he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; POLICE 
HEARTENED BY DONATIONS FROM PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers here may feel unappreciated, with the turmoil 
since the Rodney G. King beating and the fact that officers have not had a 
raise in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But somebody out there likes them -- such as the Japanese company that donated 
$20,000 to the department, or the folks who gave police $250 for a fax machine, 
or the bank that pitched in 13 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Los Angeles Police Department has become something of a 
charitable cause recently. Donations in the past five months have surpassed the 
total for all of 1993. The goods have included everything from a fancy light 
for photographing fingerprints at crime scenes to a 1972 motor home. 
</P>
<P>
 While not exactly a tidal wave of giving, the support has heartened the 
officers, who say people are finally starting to sympathize with their men and 
women in blue. "I think it's kind of an outpouring of support predicated on the 
fact that we have just been through some tumultuous experiences," said Al 
Beuerlein, who heads the LAPD's financial support bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in the west San Fernando Valley have been especially fortunate in the 
last year, receiving bicycles, cars and high-tech cameras. Great Western Bank 
donated 13 personal computers used by officers to write crime reports more 
quickly and with greater detail. 
</P>
<P>
 For officers who are still driving cars with more than 100,000 miles and doing 
much of their work with pencil and paper, no gift is insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can donate what you would consider to be a dinosaur and it's a Porsche to 
us," said West Valley Detective Dave Navarro. "You should see the faces light 
up when we see a computer."

RON HARRIS: ROLE MODELS KIDS CAN LIVE WITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We huddled together in Ms. Long's third-story classroom, 25 or so high school 
students and I, waiting to watch the videotape of a national television 
commercial in which a shaved-headed, black multimillionaire who plays 
basketball for a living tells America's children and their parents that he 
isn't the man that they should emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to hear what the kids thought about it. 
</P>
<P>
 I had already heard the "expert" opinion. For days, radio announcers, sports 
columnists and other adults had roundly denounced basketball player Charles 
Barkley because he said in the commercial that he wasn't a role model, just a 
guy who is extremely adept at putting a round ball through a metal hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 How dare he not want to be a role model, the commentators howled. 
</P>
<P>
 "These athletes have been so spoiled and so pampered that they don't realize 
that they owe something back to the community," said Fred Wallin, a radio 
sports talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletes should be role models," said Paula Boivin, a former radio talk show 
host and local sports columnist. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, they asked, shouldn't the nation's children look up to Charles Barkley 
or, as the Gatorade commercial says, "be like Mike," another shaved-headed 
black multimillionaire with the last name of Jordan, who now plays baseball for 
a living? 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's view the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The television flickered and suddenly the name BARKLEY appeared in large, 
luminous white letters against a black backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the screen was filled with the unsmiling face of one Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a role model," Barkley says to the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut away to a sweating Barkley, practicing alone in a basketball gym. Barkley 
rebounds, dribbles through his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not paid to be a role model," he continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley rebounds again. Rebound, sweat, dribble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm paid to wreak havoc on the basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
 Dribble, rebound, rebound, sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents should be role models." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebound, rebound, two-handed monster dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because I dunk a basketball doesn't mean I should raise your kids." 
</P>
<P>
 That was it, 30 seconds. Nike had also tagged on an in-office interview with 
its corporate president, wearing a pair of dopey dark sunglasses while 
explaining why the company had produced this "socially conscious" ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Except, like I said, a lot of people didn't think it was so socially 
conscious. They, like talk show hosts Boivin and Wallin and even Dodger Manager 
Tommy Lasorda, thought it was full of crap. So, I called Boivin and Wallin to 
find out which athletes were their role models, since they think athletes 
should be role models for everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, my role models were my parents," Boivin said. "I had favorite players 
on the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Bulls, but it was my parents . . . and 
there was a writing teacher in high school who I really looked up to." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallin, who played basketball in high school, modeled his game after Elgin 
Baylor. But his role models? "My parents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, that's the same thing the children in Ms. Long's class said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, a role model is the everyday people that I see; it's my grandmother, 
my pastor and the different men on my street," said Tyrell Byrd, 17. "They're 
the people you see working hard. When I have a problem, they're the people I 
talk to, who can steer me in which direction I should go. All I see of athletes 
is them on television. They're not really real to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "My role model is my mother," added Jose Meza, 16. "Charles Barkley can be a 
role model to the people around him, but he can't be your role model. That 
should be somebody you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students named their uncle, father, mother, neighbor, teachers, 
including Ms. Long. Not one named an athlete or an entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 That was nearly eight months ago. But almost every day since I have watched as 
people have shoved strangers in front of kids -- athletes, entertainers, 
professional types -- as though those people are going to have some major 
impact on their lives. And many of us have bought into that notion, going so 
far as to call ourselves role models to people we don't even know. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was growing up, I never met a newspaper reporter. I never knew a 
lawyer, an architect, a doctor, an engineer, a corporate executive, an 
accountant or a business owner. 
</P>
<P>
 But I knew Ms. Lachree, my mother's best friend, and Mr. Franklin, who lived 
across the street, and Mr. Robert, who coached our community baseball team, and 
Ms. Vann, my second-grade teacher, and my Aunt Erie, who sent my mother to 
college, and my parents. Because I knew them, I developed a crazy notion: I 
could be anything I wanted to be.

WINNERS OF CESAR CHAVEZ WRITING CONTEST HONORED; CULTURE: THE FIRST COMPETITION 
RECEIVES 450 SPANISH AND ENGLISH ENTRIES IN L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT. STUDENTS 
CELEBRATE A LATINO HERO'S LIFE AND INFLUENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It began as a simple question by the daughter of Los Angeles school board 
member Victoria Castro: "Why don't we (Latinos) have leaders like Martin Luther 
King?" 
</P>
<P>
 The end result was 450 entries from students throughout the Los Angeles 
Unified School District for the first Cesar Chavez Essay/Poetry Contest. On 
Thursday, the winners in three categories for Spanish-language and English 
entries were honored at the Mexican Cultural Institute, which helped sponsor 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cesar Chavez was not only a leader among Mexican Americans, but a world 
leader," Castro said at the ceremony on Olvera Street in Downtown Los Angeles. 
Winners were given cash awards of $150, $125 and $100 for first, second and 
third place. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest had students write on the theme "Cesar Chavez: The Benefits of His 
Work." 
</P>
<P>
 Entries were received from second-graders to high school seniors. In the 
elementary school English category, the winner was Rosario Luis, a 
fourth-grader from McKinley Avenue School in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Her essay compared her grandfather to Chavez, both with kind eyes, she said, 
both heroes to her. "I'm proud to be a Mexican American," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning first place in the high school Spanish language category was Leslie 
Rivera, a senior at Francis Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley. She wrote a 
poem, which in part said: "Your goodness was such, that no one could repay you, 
even with all the gold in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 A third-place winner in the middle school English category was Sepulveda 
Middle School ninth-grader Andrea Alicia Alarcon, daughter of Los Angeles 
Councilman Richard Alarcon. "I'm here today not as a politician, but as a 
father," Alarcon said. "I am very proud. My daughter honors me with her 
writing." 
</P>
<P>
 The students were not the only ones to have learned something. Manuel Ponce, 
director of the district's Mexican American Education Commission, said he had 
not known much about Chavez before the contest. But after reading all 450 
entries as one of seven judges, he said, "I now live the man, I sleep the man, 
I eat the man. I feel I now know him man to man."

LIGHTS! CAMERA! ACTION! ARREST! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of Los Angeles' most venerable institutions -- the Police Department and 
the movie industry -- squared off this week in what, by all accounts, was a 
battle of dueling spotlights. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the department's helicopters was on routine patrol over Hollywood on 
Wednesday night, checking out activities on the ground with its powerful 
Nightsun searchlight, when it passed over an unidentified film crew shooting a 
scene, said Sgt. Jim Heintzman of the LAPD's Air Support Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Tommy Tatreau, watch commander of the Hollywood Division, said he was told 
that the light from the helicopter and the sound of its rotor blades were 
interfering with the shoot and that Benjamin Giacometti, 28, a grip manning one 
of the film crew's spotlights, decided to respond in kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone on the ground began to follow the chopper with a very high-intensity 
light," Heintzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blinded for a good 50 seconds, couldn't see anything," LAPD pilot 
Frank King said. "We had to put down." 
</P>
<P>
 Heintzman said the two-man chopper crew directed Hollywood Division police to 
the film location in the 1500 block of Blue Jay Way, where Giacometti was 
placed under arrest. Booked on a misdemeanor count of interfering with a police 
officer, Giacometti was released on his own recognizance.

 Five people -- a couple and three children -- were found slain in a rural 
Mendocino County home, police said. Authorities have not yet determined if all 
five were members of the same family, said Willits police spokeswoman Barbara 
Hahn.But she said the victims were a man, a woman, two elementary school-age 
children and a baby. Hahn would not confirm that the deaths were a result of a 
murder-suicide. "But we are not actively seeking a suspect at large," she 
added. A gun was used in at least some of the killings, and a weapon was found 
in the home, she said. The bodies were discovered Thursday morning in a 
bungalow near the center of town after police received a call saying the 
residents had not been seen in two days and did not answer the door.

ASSEMBLY APPROVES BILL BANNING PRICE BIAS BY SEX; DISCRIMINATION: AFTER 
JOUSTING AND SOME JOKING, THE MEASURE IS SENT TO THE SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a debate that was both serious and humorous, the Assembly on Thursday 
passed legislation prohibiting merchants from charging more money for goods or 
services based solely on a person's sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, AB 2418 by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), was 
approved on a 44-31 vote and moves to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Speier said the new law is needed because research shows that women often are 
charged more than men for items such as dry-cleaning, laundry, haircuts, 
clothes and automobiles. "All this bill does is say if you provide the same 
service, that you charge the same price," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An opponent, Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico), who owns a video rental 
store, replied, "If you don't like the price, vote with your feet and go 
elsewhere. The fact is, the most democratic system is the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 But Assemblywoman Julie Bornstein (D-Palm Desert) disagreed, saying, "A 
biological difference does not justify a higher price. When the marketplace 
fails to act responsibly, government must intervene." The bill provides for 
civil lawsuits to recover damages from merchants who practice gender-based 
price discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Assembly Office of Research survey, California women on 
average pay $5 more for a haircut and $1.71 more to have a shirt laundered than 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Assembly floor, Speier used both white shirts and wigs as props to make 
her point, which amused some of her colleagues but not others. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the debate, Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run) asked 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), "How much do you pay for a 
haircut?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker, who is balding and has gray-flecked black hair on the sides, 
replied, "Whenever I am in a position to get a haircut, it is a celebration. 
Clearly, I pay more than it is worth." 
</P>
<P>
 This exchange prompted Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who used to 
own several cleaning businesses, to complain that the debate was "somewhat 
disgusting." Pringle said opinions were being offered by people "who don't own 
a business and probably never will" or realize that some jobs require 
specialized equipment and handling.

 The U.S. Border Patrol announced that agents seized 346 pounds of cocaine 
worth $11 million and arrested three suspected smugglers in a sparsely 
populated area 30 miles southeast of San Diego. The three were seen on foot 
hauling seven large duffel bags over the hills near Dulzura, five miles north 
of the Mexican border, Border Patrol officials said. After a brief chase, the 
three unarmed men, all Mexican nationals, were arrested.

 No criminal charges will be filed in connection with the death of a reserve 
police officer who was shot during a training exercise in Gilroy, Santa Clara 
County prosecutors said.Theodore Brassinga, 33, a Palo Alto reserve officer, 
died May 15 during a role-playing exercise designed to train police for the 
upcoming World Cup soccer tournament. "This was an accident," said Dave Davies, 
an assistant district attorney. "It shouldn't have happened, but the gross 
negligence required by law just isn't there." Investigators focused on why a 
loaded gun was used during the training session. Davies said Wednesday that 
officers followed standard weapons-checking procedures, but that a specially 
trained range master inadvertently failed to unload his gun.

GOLF ROUNDUP; THUNDERSTORMS PUT COLONIAL ON HOLD

<P>
 No one in the field of 110 players finished a round and 57 hadn't even started 
when a series of thunderstorms forced an overnight suspension of the first 
round of the Southwestern Bell Colonial at Fort Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension marked the second time in three weeks that violent spring 
weather had disrupted a PGA Tour event in North Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The GTE Byron Nelson Classic, some 30 miles away, was reduced to a 36-hole 
format two weeks ago at Irving. 
</P>
<P>
 Players marked their positions when play was abandoned at 4:10 p.m. (CDT) on 
the rain-soaked Colonial Country Club course and were scheduled to return this 
morning to complete the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57 golfers who didn't start Thursday will play 36 holes, weather 
permitting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those on the course, John Cook held the lead. He was at five-under-par with 
five holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the forecast, we were kind of prepared for it," he said. "We were 
running, trying to get in as many holes as we could before it was stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, "it's frustrating to have a good round going and not be able 
to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lehman, who scored a record-setting victory last week in the Memorial 
tournament in Dublin, Ohio, was four-under with three holes to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Price, Hale Irwin, David Frost, Bruce Lietzke and Ken Green were at 
three-under. Frost had seven holes to play, Lietzke six, Price and Irwin five 
and Green four. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Ramsbottom, who has not won on the LPGA tour in nearly a decade, eagled 
the eighth hole en route to an eight-under-par 64 and a one-stroke lead after 
the opening round of the Corning Classic at Corning, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsbottom took advantage of an early tee time. A thunderstorm forced 
suspension of play for nearly an hour, but it softened up the Corning Country 
Club course for those who teed off before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, winds started to swirl and the rain returned, causing the 
scores of most of the late starters to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Bradley and Amy Benz shared second at 65, and Beth Daniel was next at 67. 
Martha Nause, Alicia Dibos and Karen Noble were among a large group at 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsbottom's score was the best ever in an opening round of the Corning 
Classic, breaking the 65s shot by Kathy Young in 1987 and Colleen Walker in 
1992. She had a six-under 30 on the front nine, which she played as her back 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Davies was at 70.

EXTENSION OF CHINA'S TRADE STATUS IS GOOD NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA; ECONOMY: STATE 
IS ON THE FRONT LINES OF COMMERCE WITH THAT COUNTRY IN ENTERPRISES WORTH 
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

<P>
 California companies, selling everything from $10 Fred Flintstone dolls to 
$100-million jetliners, avoided a major setback Thursday as President Clinton 
renewed preferential trade status for China. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good news," said Robert Solomon, chairman of Dakin Inc., a Woodland 
Hills-based marketer of the Flintstone dolls and other toys, half of which are 
made in China. "I only see the potential there becoming greater." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schlansky, manager of commercial aircraft at Douglas Aircraft Co. in Long 
Beach, said, "Now business can get down to doing business and making long-range 
plans and commitments" in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The President extended "most favored nation" trading status to China while 
severing the link between China's trade benefits and human rights issues. His 
action removed the threat that China -- had it been denied the trade privileges 
-- would retaliate by imposing punitive tariffs and other costs on U.S. 
companies that sell to China or import Chinese-made goods. 
</P>
<P>
 California firms -- notably those involved in aerospace, agriculture, 
computers, electronics, apparel and chemicals -- are on the front lines of 
trade with China, which has a population of 1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A trade war would have been a major blow to the state's fledgling economic 
recovery, some executives said. Companies still willing to import goods from 
China would have been forced to pass along the higher tariffs to U.S. 
consumers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese retaliation would also have jeopardized at least $1.7 billion worth of 
California exports to China, representing 35,000 jobs, according to the 
Business Coalition for U.S.-China Trade, a group of about 400 California firms 
that urged Clinton to maintain China's trade status. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's decision "certainly will improve the commercial environment (in 
China) for California firms," said Richard Brecher, a director of the 
U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The action won't immediately translate into more jobs for Californians, but 
"as California businesses become more involved and understand the Chinese 
market, it's going to make a tremendous difference in terms of jobs here," said 
Winston Elton, a trade specialist in San Diego with the accounting firm KPMG 
Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,000 American companies overall urged Clinton to renew China's MFN 
status, which enables China to export goods to the United States at reduced 
tariffs. China sold $30 billion worth of goods to the United States last year, 
while U.S. exports to China totaled $8.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace firms, in particular, leaned on the President not to revoke China's 
trade benefits, saying in a letter to Clinton that such a move would be 
devastating to their already beleaguered industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest exporter, Seattle-based Boeing Co., which relies on 
dozens of California-based suppliers to provide parts for its airliners, was a 
major proponent of maintaining China's MFN status. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's decision came on the same day Boeing confirmed that it is talking 
with "a number of airlines in China," including Air China, about potential 
major sales of new aircraft. "Certainly the decision on MFN removes a major 
barrier," Boeing spokesman David Jensen said. But he said it would be premature 
to speculate on any orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence W. Clarkson, Boeing's vice president for planning and international 
development, hailed Clinton's decision, noting that China "is Boeing's 
fastest-growing market today" and that China already buys one of every seven 
jets built by the company. Boeing's big Southern California subcontractors 
include Northrop Grumman Corp. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 China is also important to Douglas Aircraft, the jetliner unit of St. 
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. Among other things, Douglas this year will 
begin exporting kits for the assembly of 40 passenger jets in Shanghai as part 
of a co-production program with Chinese companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The China market is extremely critical for Southern California (because) the 
commercial aircraft market has been in a deep downturn," said Douglas' 
Schlansky. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas and Boeing estimate China will need between $40 billion and $65 
billion worth of new airplanes over the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's move was also hailed by Hughes Aircraft Co. in Los Angeles, which 
Wednesday announced a joint venture with Chinese companies to invest $100 
million to $150 million over the next few years to manufacture and sell 
satellite receiving stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see China as a valuable market, particularly in the telecommunications 
realm," Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said, adding that the company expects 
China to spend about $1 billion on communications satellite systems alone over 
the next decade.

SANTA ANITA MAY GAMBLE ON DIVIDEND CUT; REAL ESTATE: MANAGEMENT WILL ASK 
DIRECTORS TO INVEST THE MONEY IN AN ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The management at Santa Anita Cos., struggling to boost its profits while 
horse racing continues to lose ground to other forms of gambling, said Thursday 
it will urge its board of directors to cut the dividend and reinvest the money 
in its real estate and racing business. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which owns the picturesque Santa Anita racetrack in Arcadia and 
stakes in several Southern California shopping centers, did not say how much it 
would like to see its $1.36 annual dividend reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Anita Chairman Stephen F. Keller hinted that the cut could be deep 
and noted that the company could slash its dividend by about 50% and still 
retain its tax-favored status as a real estate investment trust -- a status 
Keller said Santa Anita does not want to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not be a 50% cut, but it will be large enough to let us make a big 
reinvestment in our business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has roughly 23,000 shareholders, while institutions own about 14% 
of the shares. The large shareholders of record include BankAmerica, Wells 
Fargo, Mellon Bank and the California State Teachers Retirement Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The money Santa Anita would save by lowering its dividend -- which would be 
about $1.1 million a year for every dime the dividend is reduced -- would 
mostly be used to build entertainment facilities, retail shops and restaurants 
on about 80 acres of parking adjacent to the track, Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Keller said Santa Anita can afford to lose that parking space 
because more gamblers bet at off-site, satellite-wagering facilities instead of 
visiting the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita Race Track's cross-town competitor, Hollywood Park, began building 
a smaller entertainment complex and poker parlor adjacent to its racecourse in 
Inglewood last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hollywood Park's corporate owner, Keller hopes that an entertainment 
complex would provide his company with a steady source of new revenue and also 
bolster attendance at the racetrack itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance and wagering have been fairly flat at most thoroughbred racing 
facilities over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracks in California, which once held a virtual monopoly on gaming in the 
state, now find themselves competing with everything from state-sponsored keno 
games to huge poker parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts who follow the gaming industry say Santa Anita Cos.' problems were, 
until recently, compounded by an old-line group of managers and owners who 
underestimated the threat of new forms of gambling and were reluctant to 
venture into new lines of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller took the reins as chairman of Santa Anita last year following the death 
of Robert Strub, son of the track's founder, legendary racing mogul Charles 
Strub. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has been doing business the same way for 40 or 50 years," said 
Jon Fosheim, an analyst for Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach. "Any 
changes that Keller makes would be welcomed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with Santa Anita's board say some members are in favor of 
reducing the company's dividends, while others -- including some longtime 
owners who control large blocks of the company's stock and have earned millions 
through their dividend checks -- may be opposed to any reduction at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller's call to reduce the dividend was supported Thursday by well-known 
mutual fund manager Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors only recently began 
buying Santa Anita's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Gamco held 167,000 shares of Santa Anita stock -- or about 
2% of the total outstanding -- just two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a telephone interview Thursday, Gabelli said he has since raised his 
stake to about 5% and may buy more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't care less about the dividend," Gabelli said from his New York 
office. "The company needs to take the money and invest in its future, and that 
means building an entertainment facility that's going to produce cash flow 365 
days a year and bring more people out to the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on its land holdings alone, Gabelli said, Santa Anita's stock is worth 
about $25 a share. It rose 37.5 cents Thursday to close at $18.75, after 
trading as low as $17.50 early in the day.

THE DUKE OF AIRLINES; SOUTHWEST LANDS WITH A BANG AT JOHN WAYNE 
</P>

<P>
 If travel agents in Orange County wonder what the arrival of Southwest 
Airlines at John Wayne Airport will mean, they should talk to Jim M. Roberts in 
San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who owns Uniglobe Regency Travel in Rancho Cucamonga, has seen 
Southwest's low fares and frequent flights push down fares and drive out rivals 
since it began service at nearby Ontario International Airport in 1985. Even 
clients hooked on competitors' frequent-flier programs couldn't resist 
Southwest's prices and schedules. The Dallas-based airline now dominates 
Ontario, with 46% of the domestic passenger traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are really going to be shocked as to what their customers' 
response is going to be," said Roberts, referring to travel agents in Orange 
County. "It wouldn't surprise me to see Southwest make a significant dent in 
the passenger traffic of American and other carriers." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, airline service will never be the same at John Wayne, 
which on Thursday became the region's third suburban airport -- after Ontario 
and Burbank -- served by Southwest. The day was marked by festivities and 
opening ceremonies, with dignitaries snacking on a giant cake shaped like a 
cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendous spoonful of medicine for the tourism industry," said 
Orange County Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez at the opening ceremonies, which 
included John Wayne impersonators and a live radio broadcast next to Gate 1 in 
the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest also serves Los Angeles International Airport, but it has been at 
secondary, suburban airports where the carrier has had its largest impact. 
Passengers love the low fares and airport executives the additional revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the arrival of Southwest has also left travelers with less choice on many 
routes, and some airport officials fret about relying too much on a single 
carrier -- one of the few to expand and turn a profit in recent years -- for 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest, which now serves more than 50 cities nationwide, has grown at a 
wild pace by offering no-frills service, cost-efficient Boeing 737 planes and 
on-time scheduling. It makes money on low fares because its costs are the 
lowest of any major carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline's arrival is particularly welcome at John Wayne Airport, which has 
been dogged for years by a reputation of being a convenient but expensive 
alternative for air travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest is offering seven daily round-trip flights to Oakland and eight to 
San Jose for an unrestricted, one-way price of $69. Advance purchase discounts 
can cut that to as low as $49 one way. Until Southwest arrived, other carriers 
were charging up to twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest service "is a great idea, said Pat Davison, a library clerk in San 
Juan Capistrano who was going to Oakland on Thursday. "They have good prices 
and they get you there on time." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, Orange County passengers could see lower fares on other routes, 
as major airlines create low-cost subsidiaries to head off Southwest before 
they get undercut again, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of various restrictions, it might prove harder for Southwest and other 
discounters to expand service in Orange County. While Southwest can expand 
almost at will at Burbank and Ontario, the airline and other carriers at John 
Wayne are allocated a certain number of daily flights to meet restrictions on 
jet noise. 
</P>
<P>
 But already Southwest has sparked a fare war as other carriers plan to either 
match its $69 one-way fares or withdraw flights. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines, Southwest's prime competitor to San Jose, plans to cut its 
nine daily weekday flights to six starting June 17, and the service could 
eventually disappear altogether. Those flights will be replaced with 
destinations where Southwest doesn't fly from Orange County, such as Palm 
Springs and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Many airlines at Burbank and Ontario also matched Southwest fares at first, 
only to drop out on competing routes. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, USAir withdrew completely from Burbank in May, 1991, and Delta 
abandoned the airport last year. American dropped all six of its flights from 
Burbank to San Jose, United Airlines halted flights to Oakland, and America 
West reduced the number of shuttles to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's dramatic expansion at Burbank -- formally known as 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport -- has left airport officials concerned about 
being too dependent on the carrier. Robert Garcin, president of the Burbank 
Airport Authority, worries that the reliance on Southwest could backfire when 
it come time to issue revenue bonds to build a new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a bond buyer, I'd like to have more than one carrier," Garcin said. 
"We've put an awful lot of eggs in one basket, and it's a problem we'll have to 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it bothers me that Southwest dominates the airport," added Thomas Greer, 
executive director of Burbank Airport, which has seen passenger traffic soar 
60% since Southwest began service in 1989. "But it is Southwest. If we're going 
to have a dominant player, we're lucky we have the one that's making money." 
</P>
<P>
 As competing carriers drop out on Southwest's routes, passengers have been 
left with little, if any, choice of airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Southwest is creating room to raise fares if it chooses to do so, 
analysts say. In fact, transportation planners have urged the federal 
government to encourage the creation of new low-cost, low-fare airlines if only 
to keep Southwest prices in check. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ontario Airport, routes to the Bay Area and Sacramento are "virtually owned 
by Southwest because of the frequency of their flights," said Roberts, the 
Rancho Cucamonga travel agent. However, "they have not price-gouged. Their 
prices are still significantly less than when they entered the market." Losing 
Altitude 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airline's once-soaring stock has tumbled by one-third since February 
as investors have grown worried about rivals' plans to combat the low-fare 
carrier. Still, the Dallas-based airline says it expects to grow in 1994, as it 
has in the previous five years.

TOASTING THE REVOLUTION; TRADE: CALIFORNIA WINEMAKERS COURT RUSSIAN MARKET IN

 Will Chardonnay replace vodka as Russia's national drink? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. But a delegation of California winemakers that arrived in Moscow on 
Thursday hopes its handmade wines will find buyers among Russia's emerging 
middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Six small, family-owned wineries from the Napa and Sonoma valleys, including 
Pine Ridge, Laurel Glen and La Jota, will start peddling their wines in Moscow 
and St. Petersburg in mid-July. If sales to affluent Russians and foreigners 
are strong, other boutique California wineries are expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there's a demand for California wines," said Larry E. Smith, a 
member of the Family Winemakers of California delegation. "Our intention is to 
have a variety of Chardonnays, Cabernet Sauvignons, Zinfandels and Merlots 
included in this offering." 
</P>
<P>
 Wente Bros. already sells 300,000 bottles of its Livermore, Calif., wines in 
Russia each year. If economic growth continues, Russia's 148 million citizens 
could have the disposable income to buy millions more bottles each year. 
California growers want a leg up on their French competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people interested in American wine here," said Joel 
Peterson, president of Ravenswood Winery in Sonoma. "There's tremendous 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Wine history has come full circle: It was Russian immigrants to Northern 
California in the 1840s who planted the state's first vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 Some California and French wines are already available in Moscow's foreign-run 
supermarkets, which cater to foreigners and rich Russians. Although some fine 
French wines are available, most of the California wines are relatively 
low-cost bottles from larger vineyards such as Wente. 
</P>
<P>
 John Schwartz, Wente vice president for international affairs, said in a 
telephone interview that he is delighted that other California wineries will be 
offering their products for sale in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "California needs to get together to promote our image worldwide," he said. 
"We're starting to do that, and it's starting to pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 The six small vineyards will ship several hundred cases of wine to Russia, 
where it will be sold in hotels, restaurants and select supermarkets. A 
Moscow-based office will take orders and arrange deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the wine to be hawked by the smaller vineyards retails for $6 to $60 
a bottle in California, prices will be nearly twice as much in Russian shops. 
In addition to the cost of shipping, wine imported into Russia is currently 
subject to taxes totaling close to 100%, down from 187% earlier in the year, 
according to Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of any other country where we pay 100% duties," Schwartz said. 
"It's obscene." 
</P>
<P>
 All importers are subject to the same taxes, so the Californians' French 
competitors are at an equal disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we'd like the taxes lower, but those are the rules of the game," 
Smith said, shrugging. The winemakers say they have been toughened for the 
Russian market by selling wine in the United States, where each state has its 
own complex set of regulations for the import of alcoholic beverages from other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not strangers when it comes to strangeness of laws," said Peterson, 
whose family-run vineyards yield more than 700,000 bottles of wine a year. "At 
least in the United States, things don't change too fast. That's the part that 
gets a little more difficult in Russia."

 Chunnel Taps Shareholders, Predicting Losses: Operators of the Channel Tunnel 
said they will need another $2.26 billion to keep the undersea passage from 
England to France in business over the next few years. Eurotunnel, which opened 
the tunnel months late and billions of dollars over budget, is nearly broke and 
says it needs the cash to stay alive until it can break even.The company asked 
shareholders to put up an additional $1.22 billion and said bankers have agreed 
to kick in another $1.04 billion in available credit. Eurotunnel predicted a 
pretax loss of $573 million this year on revenue of $205.5 million. Revenue 
will rise in 1995, but so will losses, Eurotunnel said. The company predicted a 
pretax profit of $433.5 million in 1996.

 China Allows Foreign Investment in Airlines: The country has opened its 
airlines and airports to foreign investment in a bid to upgrade its badly 
strained air transport infrastructure, the China Daily reported today.Foreign 
carriers will now be allowed to invest in Chinese airlines or launch joint and 
cooperative projects, such as the setting up of new airlines, the newspaper 
said. However, under Civil Aviation Administration of China rules, foreign 
investment in a joint-venture airline will be limited to 35%, and foreign 
voting rights will be capped at 25%. This year, China vowed to overhaul its air 
transport industry, which has groaned under the weight of double-digit growth 
in demand.

 Wall Street slipped into pre-holiday mode on Thursday, as stock and bond 
markets barely budged in slow trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, commodity prices continued to decline, led by falling grain prices. 
Gold also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, most European stock markets stabilized after plunging Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. stock market, the Dow industrials inched down 1.84 points to 
3,753.46 as a surge in Boeing shares was offset by a plunge in Philip Morris 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market indexes also were mostly flat, though winners topped losers by 
12 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was 256 million shares, 
typically slow heading into a holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said some investors were reluctant to bet on stocks ahead of next 
week's heavy calendar of economic reports. If the reports are stronger than 
expected, bond yields could surge again, undercutting stocks' recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the economic reports due next week are April home sales and leading 
indicators, and May employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds also marked time Thursday as traders awaited today's Capitol Hill 
testimony by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond edged up to 7.35% from 7.34% on 
Wednesday, but shorter-term yields eased slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market paid little attention to another slide in key commodity 
prices, which ordinarily would be viewed as good news by inflation-wary 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell for a third 
straight day, losing 1.98 points to 229.61. 
</P>
<P>
 Grain prices led the decline, as rain fell in the dry Midwest. Coffee and 
cocoa, which have rocketed recently on supply worries, also continued to 
retreat as profit takers bailed out. 
</P>
<P>
 July coffee futures tumbled 9.95 cents to $1.18 a pound at the Coffee, Sugar 
and Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In metals trading, near-term gold futures fell $2.90 an ounce to $383.90 on 
the Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, concern about a potential rout in European stock markets abated, as 
the tone of most markets improved following Wednesday's plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 European stocks had been hammered on fears that interest rates may not fall 
further there, even though the economy is still struggling to emerge from 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interest rates could go up; that concern is with us for the moment," said 
Peter Furlong, head of equity trading at Daiwa Securities Ltd. in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, London's FTSE-100 stock index eased just 1.0 point to 3,019.70, after 
slumping 68.4 points Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris, Zurich and Stockholm shares managed small rebounds. But Frankfurt's DAX 
index lost 28.52 points to 2,130.25. 
</P>
<P>
 European bond markets were generally steady after Wednesday's selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris shares plunged 3 1/8 to 50 5/8 in heavy trading as investors 
expressed disappointment that the company's directors voted against splitting 
Morris's food and tobacco businesses. Trading in the stock had been suspended 
all day Wednesday, pending the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing soared 2 1/2 to 47 on a report in the Wall Street Journal that the 
company is near a deal with China for more than 50 commercial airliners, valued 
at more than $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 United Technologies rose 5/8 to 65 1/2 on speculation that its jet engine 
division may get some of the business from the possible Boeing-China deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks were strong. Upjohn surged 3 7/8 to 33 on a new round of rumors 
about a possible takeover deal. Other drug winners included Warner-Lambert, up 
1 1/2 to 72; Lilly, up 1 1/4 to 57 3/8, and Schering-Plough, up 1 1/8 to 66 
5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among tech issues, mainframe software firm Computer Associates rocketed 6 to 
43 1/8 after its quarterly earnings came in well ahead of Wall Street 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lotus Development lost 2 to 61 1/8. Some analysts were disappointed in the 
company's earnings predictions Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, two insurance firms rebounded. 20th Century rose 3/4 
to 15 7/8 and Mercury General jumped 1 5/8 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In other overseas markets, Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share average fell 167.83 points 
to close at 20,495.80. Mexico City's Bolsa index declined 16.71 points to 
2,455.45. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar rose, rebounding from an early drop as many 
traders concluded that the world's central banks would step in to rescue the 
dollar if it fell any further. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 1.648 German marks, up from 1.645 on 
Wednesday. It also fetched 104.65 Japanese yen, up from 104.35.

 Viacom Secures $6.8-Billion Credit Line: The entertainment company said it 
obtained the credit to refinance its acquisition of Paramount Communications 
Inc. The announcement after the stock market closed came as Viacom Inc.'s 
planned merger with Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. seemed increasingly 
unlikely. However, it was not clear whether there was any connection between 
the credit line and the uncertainty about the Blockbuster deal.Viacom said the 
loan will be used to refinance existing debts related to the $10-billion 
Paramount purchase, as well as to refinance existing debts at Paramount and its 
Viacom International Inc. subsidiary. Viacom said the loan includes a 
$2.5-billion, eight-year loan, a $1.8-billion, eight-year reducing revolving 
loan and a $2.5-billion, 2 1/2-year revolving loan.

U.S. SETTLES ANTITRUST SUIT WITH BRITISH GLASS COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to break "a licensing stranglehold" on glassmaking that keeps U.S. 
companies out of foreign markets, the Justice Department said Thursday that it 
has settled an antitrust suit against a British glass firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed under a U.S. policy designed to protect American exports 
from anti-competitive conduct by foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, who announced the suit and the settlement 
simultaneously, said the action "will open new markets abroad for American 
businesses exporting high-tech services." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Litan, deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust, said the 
settlement with Pilkington and its U.S. subsidiary could open the door to 
between $150 million and $1.25 billion in exports for American companies 
through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was the first brought under a 1992 policy that permits the Justice 
Department to take antitrust action against foreign businesses that harm U.S. 
export trade, without having to demonstrate harm to American consumers. When 
the policy was announced by the Bush Administration, it was widely believed 
that Japanese firms would be the immediate targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Litan said other cases are under investigation, but he declined to name either 
the companies or the countries involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilkington dominates the world's $15-billion-a-year float glass industry, 
which manufactures flat glass used in most cars and buildings. The complaint 
accused Pilkington of closing off foreign markets to U.S. companies and costing 
American jobs by strictly limiting the use of commercial flat glass technology, 
part of which it developed and patented more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pilkington's patents expired long ago, placing the technology in the 
public domain, the Justice Department complaint said the firm restrained 
competition by using licensing arrangements to prevent American glass producers 
from employing the technology outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Robin Nicholson, a Pilkington director, contended that the settlement -- 
in the form of a consent decree -- will have "no material economic impact on 
the company." 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview, he said the company, while denying unlawful conduct, had 
agreed to the decree for two primary reasons. First, the decree allows the firm 
to continue licensing technology it has developed since 1983. The second factor 
was "pure cost," Nicholson said, estimating that the company would not lose 
more than $1 million a year under the decree, while continued litigation would 
have cost "many millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 However, K. Craig Wildfang, special counsel to Anne K. Bingaman, assistant 
attorney general for antitrust, noted that the decree covers technology 
disclosed to U.S. licensees, the last of which occurred in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 It also frees up technology that licensees added themselves after 1982, he 
said.

U.S. FACILITIES SHAREHOLDERS VOTE TO SELL INSURER TO HIGH BIDDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shareholders of U.S. Facilities Corp. voted to sell the insurance holding 
company to the highest bidder, and they narrowly elected two directors 
nominated by the company's hostile pursuer, according to results released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 59% of the shares voted at Wednesday's annual meeting were cast in 
favor of the sale proposal sponsored by Fidelity National Financial Inc. in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory for Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest title insurer, should 
lead to negotiations soon on its hostile $79-million offer for Costa Mesa-based 
U.S. Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 With no other bidders in sight, Fidelity hopes to have the highest offer at 
$15 a share, though the price will depend on a detailed review of U.S. 
Facilities' financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 William P. Foley II, Fidelity's chairman, has said he wants U.S. Facilities to 
help steady earnings at his real-estate-related business, where income 
fluctuates with the market. Fidelity's aim is to diversify so it can level out 
its operational peaks and valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Facilities already has a committee of outside directors and an investment 
banker reviewing its options, but it had not given them authority to negotiate 
a sale. That authority is now expected to be given. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street responded favorably to the vote. The price of U.S. Facilities 
stock rose 56.25 cents to close at $14.125 a share Thursday on Nasdaq. 
Fidelity's stock, which has dropped a few dollars a share over the past month, 
closed at $16.625 a share, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. Facilities Chairman George Kadonada said the company may 
challenge the election of Fidelity's director-nominees, Newport Beach lawyer 
Andrew F. Puzder and Wall Street money manager Seymour Preston Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity's candidates edged management's slate by just 0.5% of the shares cast 
after independent vote tabulators threw out 80,386 shares that appeared to be 
for U.S. Facilities' slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading a prepared statement, a tense Kadonada said U.S. Facilities will 
investigate why the shares that could have provided the winning margin for the 
company were thrown out.

CALIFORNIA AGAIN LEADS IN LATINO BUSINESS TALLY; ECONOMY: SALES GROWTH AMONG 
THE TOP 500 SUCH FIRMS NATIONWIDE WAS TWICE THAT OF THE FORBES 500, SURVEY 
FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California continues to lead the nation in the number of Latino-owned 
businesses, according to an annual ranking by Hispanic Business magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, released Thursday, shows that the state was home last year to 121 
of the nation's top 500 Latino-owned businesses, as measured by annual sales. 
However, California's prolonged recession reduced the state's representation on 
the list from 130 in 1992. Still, the California companies had total revenue of 
$2 billion in 1993, a $50-million increase from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the magazine said, revenue at companies on its top 500 list totaled 
$11 billion, up nearly 9%, or $870 million, from 1992, more than twice the 
sales growth rate posted by the companies on Forbes magazine's list of the top 
500 in terms of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Acosta Soto, the magazine's research director, attributed the faster 
sales growth of Latino businesses to their increasing reliance on exports and 
international operations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Soto, export revenues accounted for nearly 19% of the sales 
growth of the top 500 companies in 1993. "It is clear that Hispanic-owned 
companies are exploiting the increasing opportunities in the international 
marketplace," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Ysidro's Cal-State Lumber Sales Inc., the state's largest Latino-owned 
business with 1993 revenue of $168 million, ranked No. 7 on the nationwide 
list. Infotec Development, a Santa Ana computer services and defense 
engineering firm, ranked No. 2 in the state and No. 11 nationwide. Llody A. 
Wise, an Oakland auto sales and service concern, ranked No. 3 in the state and 
No. 15 nationally. Telacu Industries, a Commerce financial services company, 
ranked No. 4 in the state and No. 21 nationwide. Rosendin Electric, a San Jose 
electrical contractor, ranked No. 5 in the state and No. 26 nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt on Broadway/Arapahoe, a Colorado automotive group, ranked as the nation's 
largest Latino-owned business with 1993 revenues of $529 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida had the second-highest number of companies on the list, and Texas was 
third.

 New Jobless Claims Dip Slightly: The number of Americans filing new claims for 
state unemployment benefits fell slightly last week for the second consecutive 
week, the Labor Department said.Claims fell to 366,000 in the week ended May 21 
from 367,000 the previous week, above Wall Street economists' forecasts of 
361,000. The department's closely watched four-week moving average, which is 
considered a more accurate indicator of jobless trends, posted a gain. The 
average climbed to 366,750 last week, up from a revised 359,250 in the week 
ended May 14. The department said the last time the average was that high was 
in the week ended Feb. 19, when it stood at 375,000.

 Mortgage Rates Ease: Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.53% this 
week, down from 8.56% last week, according to a national survey by the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. The average hit a 25-year low of 6.74% last October. 
Lenders were asking an average initial rate of 5.48% on one-year, 
adjustable-rate mortgages, down from 5.58% last week. The rates do not include 
add-on fees known as points.

 Money Supply Mixed: The Federal Reserve Board said the measure known as M2 
rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,590.8 billion in the week ended May 16, from a 
revised $3,587.9 billion the previous week.An even broader measure, M3, fell to 
a seasonally adjusted $4,214.3 billion from a revised $4,214.4 billion. The 
narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted 
$1,143.5 billion from $1,142.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, 
deposits in checking accounts and non-bank traveler's checks. M2 is M1 plus 
accounts such as savings deposits and money market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus 
less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of $100,000.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: FUND INVESTORS WAX CONSERVATIVE AFTER FED HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a few tightenings of the national credit spigot, the Federal Reserve 
Board already seems to have achieved one of its goals for 1994: The central 
bank has converted more than a few once-high-rolling mutual fund investors into 
paragons of financial conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
 That is apparent in the latest report on fund investment activity from the 
industry's chief trade group, the Investment Company Institute. The ICI said 
Thursday that gross purchases of stock and bond fund shares totaled $40.6 
billion in April, down sharply from $53.4 billion in March and even below the 
pace of $41.1 billion in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Net new cash flow, which measures fund purchases minus redemptions and after 
adjustment for net exchanges among funds in the same families, was $11.3 
billion for stock funds in April, a rebound from March's depressed $6.6 billion 
but still below the $11.7 billion of April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For bond funds, net new cash flow was a negative $4.8 billion in April, 
compared to a negative $7.7 billion in March and a positive $10 billion in 
April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeming contradiction in the numbers above -- gross fund purchases fell 
between March and April but cash flow improved -- actually is easily explained. 
Overall, investors' appetite for funds declined sharply in April. But because 
fewer investors redeemed shares in April than March, net cash flow looks 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, fund companies report a further easing of the panic that had 
gripped some fund investors in March and April, when markets convulsed because 
of the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in 
five years. Redemptions are down again in May, and a respectable number of 
people are buying funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's in demand are mostly the kind of stock funds traditionally favored 
by conservative, long-term investors, some fund companies say. Meanwhile, bond 
funds -- many of which have dropped more sharply in value than stock funds this 
year -- still are losing investors, though at a slower pace than in March and 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 At fund giant Fidelity Investments in Boston, spokesman Neal Litvack says net 
new cash flow into the company is on track to total $1.5 billion this month, up 
from $1.3 billion in April. But more than 90% of this month's cash flow is 
going into stock funds, Litvack says. Bond funds are basically flat, he says, 
meaning money coming in is just replacing the money that's leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, Litvack says, Fidelity investors also are shying away from 
small-stock funds and "sector" funds that target stocks of specific industries. 
Instead, the company's most popular stock funds this month are conservative 
names such as the Blue Chip fund and the Puritan fund, which are marketed as 
long-term holdings for relatively cautious investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, at the Kemper mutual funds in Chicago, the best-selling investment 
this month is the Total Return fund, a balanced (stock and bond) fund. In 
contrast, Kemper said that its U.S. Government Securities bond fund has 
continued to experience modest redemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Small investors' strong interest in blue-chip stock funds and in balanced 
funds, while pure bond funds suffer, may not look like evidence of a turn to 
conservatism. After all, academics would argue that bonds are more conservative 
investments than stocks, at least in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem in the bond market by late last year was that almost everyone 
had come to believe that interest rates only went down. Speculation in bonds 
was rampant, in large part because many bond owners didn't even know they were 
speculating: They really didn't think they could lose money in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In tightening credit this year, the Fed had more in mind than slowing the 
economy. The Fed also wanted to slow the wave of naive money that was inflating 
stock and bond prices and risking a U.S. version of Japan's 1989 market bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual fund trends since March show that the Fed has succeeded in injecting a 
new sobriety into the investing picture. And forced to stop and think about 
what they're doing, it appears that many investors in stock funds do indeed 
comprehend the risks and are comfortable with them, so they're still buying. 
The continuing outflow of money from bond funds, however, suggests that many 
bond owners either didn't understand bonds' risks, or finally do understand -- 
and no longer want to be a part of that game. Staying Flexible 
</P>
<P>
 The two fastest-growing categories of mutual funds over the past year, after 
international, have been flexible and balanced funds--which tend to invest in a 
mix of stocks, bonds and money market securities.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: FIRM PROBED FOR 'INVOICE' MAILINGS 
</P>

 The U.S. Postal Inspection Service says it is investigating a Los Angeles 
office equipment company that sent schools, businesses and charities 
solicitations that looked like bills for repair contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal inspectors said Integrated Design Products labeled the statewide 
mailings as "invoices" for service contracts on binding machines and 
laminators. In small type, the solicitation noted that the agreement was 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Frick, owner of IDP, said the word invoice appeared on the 
solicitations due to a printing error and that the problem has been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that's a no-no," he said. "It's a big mistake, and apology letters 
have gone out." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal authorities said complaints about IDP surfaced in April and are 
continuing. The regional office of the Better Business Bureau in Cypress said 
it began receiving complaints in February and that IDP has not responded to its 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those receiving the solicitation was World Emergency Relief of Carlsbad. 
Rev. Joel MacCollam, an Episcopal minister and World Relief president, said he 
received an "invoice" offering him a "special rate for being a nonprofit 
organization" of $369 for repair and service to a binding and laminating 
machine. MacCollam said World Emergency Relief doesn't own such a machine. 
</P>
<P>
 MacCollam said that when he called IDP to complain about the solicitation, he 
was answered with an obscenity. He said he has received no apology letter. 
</P>
<P>
 MacCollam said he believes some organizations probably paid the amount listed 
on the solicitation. "We have the advantage of being in a six-room suite, so we 
know what equipment we've got," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frick said customers are contacted with follow-up phone calls, preventing 
people from paying for a service they don't need. 
</P>
<P>
 Frick's company has other problems. General Binding Corp. has filed a 
copyright infringement suit against IDP in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
GBC wants IDP to stop offering a toll-free number that incorporates the letters 
GBC, among other things. Frick says he is being picked on because his company 
competes with GBC for equipment repair business.

 Arbitration score cards: Are new car owners who arbitrate disputes over 
automobile defects getting a raw deal? Depends on how you interpret the 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Voters, a consumer organization, said arbitration panels in California 
last year awarded refunds or replacement cars to less than 40% of complainants, 
too low in Motor Voters' opinion. But the state agency charged with overseeing 
arbitration programs says the statistic is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto manufacturers in California run their own arbitration programs, and 
results are reviewed annually by a unit of the state Department of Consumer 
Affairs. However, Motor Voters is sponsoring legislation that would institute 
state-run arbitration programs. A bill calling for state-run arbitration 
authored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) could reach the Assembly 
floor for a vote as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of arbitration programs vary by manufacturer. According to Motor 
Voters, Ford owners who arbitrated their disputes fared best in 1993, with 39% 
of them receiving either a refund or a replacement vehicle. Motor Voters said 
12% of Toyota owners who arbitrated disputes received a refund or a new 
vehicle, the lowest percentage. The Toyota program has been discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Brightbill, the state official charged with overseeing the 
manufacturer-run arbitration programs, said Motor Voters failed to count 
consumers who received free auto repairs. Had Motor Voters done so, the 
percentage of consumers receiving some form of compensation from arbitration 
boards last year would have risen to 63%, Brightbill said. 
</P>
<P>
 While agreeing that existing arbitration programs aren't perfect, Brightbill 
said win-lose records alone do not reflect fairness. He said manufacturers 
settle many complaints about defects before they reach arbitration, but those 
settlements are not reflected in the arbitration statistics. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Memorial Day notes: The American Automobile Assn. is predicting a 1% drop in 
Memorial Day trips in California and 10 other western states from a year ago, a 
result of the sluggish economy and iffy weather. That contrasts with an 
expected 1% increase in Memorial Day travel nationwide. AAA blames the modest 
increase on bad weather in the East and South. 
</P>
<P>
 People driving to their destinations this weekend will enjoy lower gasoline 
prices than last year. The national average at the pump last week was about 
$1.141, nearly 4 cents lower than a year ago, according to analyst Trilby 
Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lundberg Survey found that in Los Angeles last week, the average price of 
unleaded regular was just over $1.14, down 8 cents from a year ago. In San 
Diego, the average price of unleaded regular last week was slightly more than 
$1.19, down 3 cents. The Lundberg Survey checks prices at 10,000 U.S. gas 
stations every two weeks.

JAPANESE CARS HEAD LIST IN QUALITY SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese-made vehicles once again topped J.D. Power & Associates' annual 
survey of new car quality, while the average quality of all 1994 cars sold in 
the United States declined slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota's luxury Lexus division claimed the first three spots in the J.D. Power 
initial quality survey, which counts the number of defects reported by new car 
buyers during the first three months of ownership. The Lexus LS400 was No. 1 on 
the list released Thursday, followed by the GS300 and SC300-400 models. 
</P>
<P>
 Lexus cars have finished high on the J.D. Power list since they were 
introduced in 1990, and the LS400 has been first since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-ranking American car in the 1994 survey was No. 4 Geo Prizm, a 
compact sedan made in California in a joint venture between Toyota and General 
Motors Corp. It was followed by the Acura Legend (made by Honda), Infiniti J30 
(Nissan), Mercury Grand Marquis, Toyota Camry, Toyota Tercel, Lexus ES300 and 
Lincoln Town Car. 
</P>
<P>
 Car makers around the world have been focusing on quality, and the 3% decline 
reported by J.D. Power suggests they are getting to a point at which further 
improvements will come slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be reaching the four-minute-mile barrier in initial quality, but 
eventually many contenders will break it," said J.D. Power III, president of 
the marketing information firm. "Some, in fact, already have." 
</P>
<P>
 Lexus LS400 owners reported 32 problems per 100 cars in 1994, and four out of 
five reported no problems at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The average number of defects reported per 100 cars in the survey was 110, up 
from 1993's 107. Another way to say it: The average 1994 car had 1.1 defects 
reported by its owner during the first three months of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of light trucks reported an average of 126 problems per 100 cars -- 
1.26 problems per vehicle, three fewer than in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota Tercel, Geo Prizm, Mercury Grand Marquis, Buick Park Avenue and Lexus 
LS400 topped their price categories in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Power did not release rankings for light trucks, but it listed top 
scorers in five categories. Ford Ranger was the leading small pickup, Ford 
Explorer led in small sport utility vehicles and Toyota Previa led minivans. 
Toyota T100 was the top full-size pickup, and GMC Suburban was first among 
large sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey said Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., plant where Camry sedans are built 
was the top quality assembly plant in North America. The GM-Toyota joint 
venture plant in Fremont, Calif., tied for second with Ford's St. Thomas, 
Ontario, plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Six nameplates had all their models average fewer than one problem per car in 
the survey: Infiniti, Lexus, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Saturn and Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 David R. Sargent, senior project director at J.D. Power, said it was difficult 
to characterize the changes recorded in this year's survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we found was the models that were performing extremely well last year 
improved in quality. But the models in the middle of the pack -- some improved 
and some declined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The J.D. Power Initial Quality Studies were based on questionnaires answered 
by about 32,000 car buyers and 12,000 truck buyers who registered 1994 vehicles 
in November and December, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey differs from J.D. Power's customer satisfaction survey, which 
measures buyers' satisfaction with dealerships and the repair and reliability 
records of cars and light trucks after one year of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Power reports are widely used by car makers to tout specific models in 
advertising.

CBS ON THE PROWL TO REPLACE 8 STATIONS LOST IN FOX RAID; TELEVISION: SEARCH 
COULD THWART PLANS FOR TWO NEW NETWORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fox's historic raid on eight CBS affiliates this week could cause serious 
problems for Paramount and Warner Bros. as they try to launch their own fifth 
networks next year. 
</P>
<P>
 With CBS on the prowl to replace the affiliates it is losing in such key 
markets as Detroit, Atlanta and Cleveland, those stations that presently intend 
to align with the Paramount or WB network have become obvious targets, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stations that were going to be a Paramount or WB affiliate now have the 
option of going with CBS," said Matt Shapiro, a vice president at MMT Sales 
Inc., who advises stations on programming. "You have to assume that, given the 
choice, somebody is going to go with an established network rather than a 
start-up." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Paramount's announcement that it would use its spinoff 
"Star Trek: Voyager" series as the anchor for its network, neither company has 
disclosed much about its programming plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount Network, which is a joint venture with TV station group 
Chris-Craft, plans to go on the air with two nights of programming in January. 
WB is starting with one night and says it will expand to two by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount and Warner Bros. have been competing to sign up independent TV 
stations around the country. So far Paramount has aligned with 36 affiliates 
covering 47% of U.S. television homes, and WB has signed 22 affiliates, along 
with cable channel WGN-TV, that WB says will give it exposure to 73% of all TV 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that there are only a limited number of TV stations in each 
market, so an affiliation swap can set off a chain reaction of other switches. 
The smaller the market, the fewer the available outlets and the more likely a 
Paramount or WB affiliate is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the major broadcast networks has slightly more than 200 affiliates, 
but the top 30 markets account for 50% of all TV households. Since the networks 
own the majority of affiliates in the top 10 markets, the battleground will be 
in the 10th to 30th biggest markets. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in St. Louis (market No. 18), the ABC affiliate KTVI-TV will 
become a Fox affiliate, forcing ABC to seek another outlet in that market. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious scenario would have ABC partnering with KDNL-TV, the 
soon-to-be former Fox affiliate which is on Channel 30, or KPLR-TV (Channel 
11), which has agreed to become a WB affiliate. But KPLR would be the favored 
station since it is a VHF outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Phoenix (the 20th-largest market), WB has affiliated with KPHO-TV. 
Paramount will partner with KUTP, which will not change, because the station is 
owned by its partner Chris-Craft. CBS affiliate KSAZ-TV will become the Fox 
affiliate, leaving CBS the choice of picking up former Fox partner KNXV-TV, 
which is on Channel 15, or going after the more desirable KPHO-TV (Channel 5). 
Should CBS make a run on the ABC or NBC affiliates, whichever network is 
dislodged would also likely go after KPHO-TV before seeking the UHF 
independents in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Kellner, the former president of Fox Broadcasting who was integral in 
launching the fourth network and is now president of WB, said fears that the 
Fox raid on CBS affiliates will affect either WB or Paramount are "silly." 
Kellner said the four other networks have already picked off "the best 
stations," and CBS will "poach" ABC and NBC affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation promises to become even more complicated in the months 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch has told his station executives that he wants VHF 
affiliates in all of the top 30 markets. Murdoch has been trying to get 
Westinghouse to sell to Fox its TV stations in Philadelphia, San Francisco and 
Baltimore -- all but one of them NBC affiliates -- but Westinghouse so far has 
refused. Some, however, expect him to buy the Philadelphia station. 
</P>
<P>
 And CBS, badly shaken by the surprise attack on its affiliates, was rumored on 
Thursday to be mounting a counter bid for Argyle Television Holding Inc., part 
of the group of four TV stations that New World Communications Group is 
assembling to own 12 Fox affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer, while downplaying the effect 
the raid would have on the network, said Thursday in a meeting with reporters 
that CBS would consider investing minority stakes in TV stations to secure 
affiliation agreements -- signaling that the affiliate wars are far from over.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: SIX FLAGS BOSS MAN BECOMES PITCHMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Time Warner Inc. has a new strategy for promoting its Six Flags theme park 
division: humility. 
</P>
<P>
 In an advertising campaign geared to the summer tourist season, the media 
conglomerate is touting Six Flags as the No. 2 theme park that tries harder. 
Starring in the commercial is Six Flags Entertainment Chairman and CEO Robert 
Pittman, who entreats families to pay the parks a visit as he and a huge crowd 
of gleeful children stroll past vertigo-inducing rides. 
</P>
<P>
 The Avis-like approach is surprising for Time Warner -- which prides itself on 
dominating its businesses. It was only last year that the company enraged Walt 
Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner with a series of advertisements that 
lampooned the much larger Disney park operation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also unusual to find a division head playing the role of pitchman at the 
New York company, where senior executives tend to be insulated from the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Redling, the Six Flags marketing executive who helped devise the TV and 
print campaign, said Pittman gives the message more credibility. "We wanted to 
personalize it," Redling said. "An announcer's voice-over didn't do it for us. 
To have the chief executive officer saying the things we need to say means 
something. There's an obvious commitment level there." 
</P>
<P>
 While Pittman was traveling and unavailable for comment, Redling said it took 
some time -- and a bit of convincing -- to get the affable executive before the 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 The spot -- which begins with Pittman saying, "We're America's No. 2 theme 
park company, which means we have to work harder" -- also marks a strategic 
shift in the way the seven U.S.-based parks are promoted. After two years of 
running "comparative" advertising, Six Flags is trying to create its own 
national identity as the country's second-most popular theme park destination. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is still the David to Disney's Goliath -- the park division's $550 
million in revenue in 1993 compares to $3.44 billion for Disney -- 
entertainment analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles says Six 
Flags seems to be on track to meet its 15% annual growth target. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also credited with skillfully exploiting its Warner Bros. 
connection by creating more attractions based around classic Warner cartoon 
characters and movies, such as "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've created a national brand called Six Flags theme parks," Redling said. 
"From a marketing standpoint, the interesting challenge is making it clear that 
No. 2 is a great position." Or, as Pittman says in the ad, "Look around you -- 
we're in a fantasy land." 
</P>

 Barring a total turnaround in discussions, which is always possible with the 
parties involved, legal obstacles to a new Eagles album are close to being 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources privy to the talks say the album, mainly based on MTV recording 
sessions, would be released by Geffen Records in September under the tentative 
deal, which guarantees the group an estimated $10-million advance against 
sales. Geffen would also release a solo greatest-hits album with two new songs 
by Don Henley for the 1996 holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's back royalties from Geffen are among several unresolved issues. The 
singer and his label have been engaged in a bitter and protracted contract 
dispute that's approaching trial. Glen Frey, the other Eagles founder, is also 
suing his label, MCA. Since MCA owns Geffen, the agreement under discussion 
would put an end to all the litigation. It would also free Henley and Frey to 
pursue solo record deals with other companies. 
</P>

<P>
 On the same day Sony Corp. released its disappointing financial results last 
week, Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber had lunch in Manhattan with Walter 
Yetnikoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment historians will recall that it was Yetnikoff who helped persuade 
Sony to name Guber and his then-partner, Jon Peters, to head the studio five 
years ago. Yetnikoff, who was chief of Sony's CBS Records division at the time, 
subsequently lost his job. Most recently he's been working to line up financing 
to start his own ambitious record-film company. Among other things, Yetnikoff 
is developing a movie based on the life of legendary jazz trumpeter Miles 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber called the timing coincidental and said there was no business agenda. 
"I've known him my whole business life," Guber said Thursday. "Walter's a 
talented man at a good place in his life, and I'm happy to see it. We're just 
two friends getting together for lunch."

 If Hollywood seems more bustling than usual over the Memorial Day weekend, 
blame the publishing industry. Many executives who would ordinarily clear out 
of town are sticking around for events tied to the American Booksellers Assn. 
convention here. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention has a distinct show business vibe this year, which shouldn't 
require much of a stretch since most major publishers are units of 
entertainment conglomerates. Conventioneers have been invited to hang out with 
everyone from Motown Records' Berry Gordy Jr. to Hef himself at the Playboy 
Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Hefner's party on Saturday celebrates the upcoming release of "The 
Playboy Book, Forty Years," a pictorial history of the men's magazine. "Pajamas 
aren't necessary!" the black-and-white invitation notes. Later that evening, 
Disney-owned Miramax Films launches its publishing wing with a party at the 
Monkey Bar. At the same time, the New York set at Paramount Pictures is the 
setting for a party in honor of "Saturday Night Live, the First 20 Years," 
which is being published by Paramount Communications' Houghton Mifflin imprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Befitting its size, media conglomerate Time Warner has invited 1,000 people to 
the St. James Club on Sunday to celebrate "the genius behind Motown." The party 
marks the upcoming Warner Books publication of "To Be Loved," Gordy's 
autobiography. "Get down with your bad self," says the invitation, a phrase not 
often heard in publishing circles.

 Music: EastWest Records and the best-selling West Coast rap group Da Lench Mob 
are parting ways in the wake of murder charges being filed against two of the 
group's members. EastWest is part of Time Warner's Atlantic Group.Da Lench 
Mob's "Guerillas in tha Mist" was one of the top-selling rap albums nationally 
in 1992 and 1993. In a brief statement, EastWest Chairman and Chief Executive 
Sylvia Rhone said, "It would be in the best interest of both parties to 
discontinue our relationship." Sources within the company attributed the action 
to the group's legal problems as well as creative differences. A lawyer for the 
group's production company said a mutual release was agreed upon. . . . Moving 
Target Productions, the production company of former Paramount Pictures chief 
Brandon Tartikoff, has linked up with former Warner Bros. executive Michael Jay 
Solomon's international sales company on a three-year distribution agreement, 
starting with the international rights to the television movie "XXX's and 
OOO's." JAMES BATES

BEHIND THE WHEEL: SPOILING FOR A FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nissan makes au fait sedans for younger families and naughtier coupes for the 
higher spirited who take their driving seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouncing between both demands, capable of romping or simply strolling through 
life, has been Nissan's Maxima. 
</P>
<P>
 Visually . . . it's a four-door sedan.  
</P>
<P>
 Physically . . . it's a high-ceilinged sports car with a performance legacy 
that began in 1980 with an engine borrowed from the 240Z sports car. 
</P>
<P>
 Realistically . . . well, more than 90% of Nissan's car sales are of socially 
acceptable sedans: Altima, Maxima and Sentra. The company's sporty coupes, the 
240SX and the 300ZX, remain toys for a gymnastic minority. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the high energies and fine handling of 130-m.p.h. four-doors such as 
Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, Honda Accord and Chrysler's first family of LH cars 
become silky norms, the demand for sedans that snarl is no more. 
</P>
<P>
 So the 1995 Maxima was built to paddle steadily toward the mainstream of 
mid-size. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of every car in the new Maxima lineup remains hearty handling and 
V-6 athleticism. But they move with a quieter step while handling the 
irritations of traffic and road surfaces with higher sophistication. There's 
even a maxi Maxima, all wood-trimmed elegance, lustered upper crust and 
puffy-leather softness very suggestive of Infiniti luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes, however, more than better mechanicals and Ritz-Carlton interiors to 
buck the best of today's market. 
</P>
<P>
 So Maxima, depending on the model, is priced between $700 and $2,500 lower 
than last year. More significant of the tussle ahead, they cost $900 to $2,000 
less than the intended target: the V-6 Toyota Camry. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's Accord still has the edge on price -- but even 1995 versions do not 
offer a V-6 engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Taurus underprices Maxima -- but its V-6 is skinnier by 50 horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
 From two trim levels of last year, Maxima has advanced to three with the 
addition being that kinder, gentler, plushier sedan with a price tickling the 
velvet tootsies of Mercedes C-Class. 
</P>
<P>
 From a choice of two V-6s, Maxima has mellowed its power source to one 
lighter, more compact, double cam, 3.0-liter engine. It still produces 190 
horsepower but runs cleaner, more economically and produces heftier torque. 
</P>
<P>
 If bargain basements are your lifestyle, the Maxima GXE with manual 
transmission is your car and costs $19,999. Those nines, of course, fool no one 
because base prices conveniently exclude unavoidable taxes, registration and 
destination charges. So get real and figure on more than $21,000 with an 
additional $999 -- or $1,000 to be on the safe side -- for a four-speed 
automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ample goodies are standard on the GXE and include dual air bags, air 
conditioning, cruise control, power windows and steering, rear window 
defroster, cut pile carpets, dual mirrors and courtesy lighting from trunk to 
ashtray. 
</P>
<P>
 Next in line at $20,999 -- or $22,000 with all the hidden bits -- is the 
manual-transmission Maxima SE. This is a chariot for the warmer of blood who 
understand the real benefits of stiffened shocks, firmer struts and stickier 
tires. Also for those who believe that a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 
body-colored door handles, rear-deck spoiler, polished wheels and driving 
gloves are synonymous with speedy progress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the Maxima GLE, our test car, which, if not the lap of lady 
luxury, certainly lounges at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The sticker of $24,199 -- c'mon, work out the true price among yourselves -- 
includes needless, therefore desirable, luxuries that are native customs on 
European cars. Such as leather seats, bun warmers, heated mirrors and a Bose CD 
sound system that will rupture eardrums two cars over. There is key-less entry, 
a thinking climate control, an automatic security system and other programs 
aimed at one day rendering the human touch obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-lock brakes are a $995 option throughout the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, Maxima styling, sketched by Nissan Design International in San 
Diego, is a flop. Head-on, the three-lip grille with blacked-out mesh is a dark 
smirk from Morticia Addams. The car stands a little high, almost perching. The 
rear shrieks of Toyota Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads do not turn at Maxima's passage simply because in silhouette it makes 
only one positive statement: This is just another Japanese car. 
</P>
<P>
 The GLE's interior has much more to say and, again, Infiniti is the language 
being spoken. Leather-faced seats are soft quality with a magnificent, 
eight-way driver's chair that would adjust to Gumby. Walnut trim on the 
dashboard, center console and arm rests is deep and rich, albeit fake. And the 
switch gear works in deep whispers, not harsh clicks. 
</P>
<P>
 These are comfortable, friendly accommodations with understated touches to 
prevent luxury from becoming intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaciousness, as Casey Stengel might have allowed, is everywhere. Thanks to a 
longer wheelbase and compact suspension, cabin height has been improved until 
front-seat occupants no longer need open the sun roof for additional headroom. 
There's more leg, knee and shoulder space in the back seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But a hand brake set to the right of the driver's seat and barely three inches 
from the face of the console is an exercise in clumsiness. It needs relocating, 
at least shortening to keep from rasping and gouging a driver's knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarm and central locking controls -- including remote-control opening of 
front windows to release solar-basted summer air -- work flawlessly. Also 
silently. A clearly audible chirp or kerchunk would be a better way of advising 
a departing owner that the Maxima is armed and secure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Performance remains Maxima's might. It is not improved radically but has 
certainly been burnished carefully into a smoother, tighter, less strenuous 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a new rear suspension at work. Last year it was an independent, 
multilink setup thought to favor ride before handling. Now Maxima is fitted 
with a multilink beam axle feared by some to improve handling at the expense of 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? Nissan says the new system attains an optimum balance of stability 
and ride comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Who cares? Bottom line is that average bottoms will sense only that the GLE 
maneuvers securely, always in balance and with suspension capabilities far 
exceeding the day-to-day abilities of Freddy Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed-sensitive steering performs perfectly, tightening noticeably as speeds 
climb into the passing ranges. Here, Maxima delivers effortless, sweeping 
acceleration with large surpluses of brakes and steering should the manners of 
other road users start deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 The car's four-speed automatic unquestionably is best in class with shifting 
made seamless by electronic sensing. A button on the gear shift disengages 
overdrive, which makes entering and exiting quick corners more fun than Formula 
One. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxima went on sale this month and is adding many fresh elements to showroom 
shopping for a mid-size sedans. One is certainly its increased threat to the 
best-selling reputations of Taurus, Accord and Camry. 1995 Nissan Maxima GLE 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $24,199, base. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: Closer to mainstream, but still a street-fighter. Automatic 
transmission smoother than glycerine. Comfortable, friendly interior. Priced 
below last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Suffers ergonomic nits. Boring styling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ugly: A scowling, dark front end. 1995 Nissan Maxima GLE

MEET THE MILK MAN; NO, HE DOESN'T LIKE TO DRINK IT. BUT JEFF GOODBY SURE CAN 
SELL IT. COULD IT BE THAT MILK WILL BECOME -- GULP -- A HIP DRINK?

 There are just two things in the world more boring than whole milk: low-fat 
and skim. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pepsi has its own generation, milk can't muster one palpitation. No one 
cries over spilled milk -- they don't even notice. Milk is that nondescript 
stuff that you mix with equally nondescript powdered diet drinks. And anyone 
sent on a milk run probably drew the short straw. 
</P>
<P>
 Milk is for babies -- except those allergic to it. Oodles of health experts 
have put the kibosh on milk. Milkweed makes people sneeze. Milk of Magnesia 
makes people go. And that carton of milk sitting in your refrigerator since 
Halloween is quietly waiting to become cottage cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Milk is -- even on its best day -- a real yawner. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that said, there is one West Coast ad executive who is on the brink of 
-- holy cow! -- making milk halfway hip. 
</P>
<P>
 With oddball humor that seems part Harvard Lampoon and part grammar school, 
Jeff Goodby, creative director of Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, is trying to 
turn the milk carton into an advertising icon that will do for milk what Mr. 
Whipple did for toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, his San Francisco agency is intent on accomplishing this with 
just two words: "Got milk?" 
</P>
<P>
 You've seen the commercials. Frustrated folks who run out of milk at the wrong 
time -- like while eating a gloppy, gooey peanut butter sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 6-month-old ad campaign succeeds -- and it appears well on its way to 
doing just that -- the agency could grab on to the advertising world's elusive 
brass ring: creating ads that people actually remember.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Goodby is already recognized for creating knockout ads for American 
Isuzu Motors and Norwegian Cruise Line. In the wacky ad for Isuzu, a guy roars 
his off-road vehicle smack through the middle of a room-sized birthday cake. In 
the haunting, Norwegian Cruise ads, one passenger makes this vow: "I will be 
naked more often." 
</P>
<P>
 For the National Basketball Assn., the agency coined the ad slogan: "I love 
this game." 
</P>
<P>
 And its off-the-wall ads for Sega of America are so packed full of kid appeal 
that they have helped Sega out-cool Nintendo. But above all, any agency that 
can put pizazz into milk advertising could probably sell just about anything -- 
maybe even buttermilk. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives predict that the "Got Milk" campaign -- seen mostly by 
Californians -- will garner the 12-year-old agency many of the top national and 
international awards in advertising. Three years ago, Advertising Age named 
Goodby, Silverstein the agency of the year. Two years ago, Adweek named it the 
West Coast agency of the year. But this year, the most important judges of all 
-- everyday consumers -- are lapping up its milk ads. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with Jeff Goodby, who is the first to admit that he's no big milk 
drinker. Like many Americans, he lost the taste for milk somewhere between 
adolescence and adulthood, and replaced it with the likes of Perrier and 
Snapple. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how to sell milk? 
</P>
<P>
 First off, forget all that stuff about milk building strong bones, Goodby 
says. And to heck with promoting all that vitamin stuff. Goodby says there is 
just one reason -- and one reason alone -- most people buy milk: because 
they've run out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time you most notice milk is when it's gone," says Goodby, 42, who 
discussed the campaign recently while in Los Angeles on break from directing a 
new "Got Milk?" TV spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could make ads until we're blue in the face, but not many people are going 
to come in from jogging on a hot day and drink a tall glass of milk," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but who could pass up a glass of milk with a peanut butter sandwich? Or 
milk in a bowl of cereal? And, of course, milk with chocolate chip cookies? 
These are the times when thirsty people crave milk. The agency unleashed a 
campaign that exaggerates these situations with the firm's trademark humor. 
</P>
<P>
 The slogan was concocted by Goodby, a visual throwback to the generation who, 
in the 1960s, were among the first to begin turning thumbs down to milk. 
Goodby, who wears his hair to his shoulders and shuns tying it in a more 
socially acceptable ponytail ("Except in meetings with $30-million clients") 
says he devised the "Got Milk?" line during a staff meeting at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I said it," Goodby concedes, "everyone just kind of shrugged." 
</P>
<P>
 They're not shrugging anymore. For that matter, no one in the ad business can 
any longer shrug off the uncanny success of this agency. Advertising has made 
Goodby a millionaire, several times over. 
</P>
<P>
 But he rarely acts like one. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, he giggles too much. This is no made-for-TV-laugh-track type 
giggle, but the childlike kind that usually set his shoulders bouncing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his agency has two automotive clients -- Porsche and Isuzu -- Goodby 
drives a vehicle made by the less ostentatious of the two, an Isuzu Trooper. He 
also owns a sports car -- a modest Mazda Miata his wife gave him for his 40th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 While on break from directing a milk spot in Culver City, Goodby seems far 
more interested in gobbling some broken pieces of chocolate chip cookies left 
over from the shoot than in munching the exotic hors d'oeuvres that a catering 
firm was carting around the set. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was Goodby, alone, who spent the day walking around wearing 
goofy-looking booties that are specially made not to dirty the floor of the 
set. Although plenty of booties were made available for everyone, the rest of 
the crew seemed reluctant to wear such silly-looking slippers over their Doc 
Martens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the people in advertising," says Cathi Mooney, creative director of 
rival San Francisco agency Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley, "Jeff is the only one I 
know who has complete integrity to do what is morally right -- and not just 
what will sell a product." 
</P>
<P>
 When a giant chemical company approached his agency about handling a lucrative 
account, Goodby said no thanks. Ditto for a major West Coast defense firm. 
"We're '60s people," explains Goodby, who stays connected to the '90s by 
listening to what he calls "head banging" music from alternative rock groups 
such as Sonic Youth and Smashing Pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Goodby bums cigarettes from employees now and then, he says he 
wouldn't even consider making tobacco ads: "When you have three young kids as I 
do, you don't want to create that kind of advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 More an artist than copywriter, Goodby is passionate about drawing and 
photographing his daughters -- Grace, 1, and Nina, 11 -- and 4-year-old son, 
Nathaniel. These paintings and photos fill the walls of his San Francisco 
office and Piedmont home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising has not always been Goodby's livelihood. He was raised in East 
Greenwich, R.I., and graduated from Harvard in 1973 with a degree in English. 
His first job was as a City Hall reporter at a small daily newspaper in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 "At parties, I've always found it a lot more fun to tell people that I was a 
newspaper reporter than that I write TV commercials," Goodby says. 
</P>
<P>
 He detests almost all advertising -- except his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately," he says, shaking his head while taking a swig of bottled 
water, "I am judged by all of the other advertising that's out there -- 99% of 
which is awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodby stumbled into his advertising career. Shortly after he married, he 
moved with his wife, Jan Deming, a landscape architect, to San Francisco. "I 
couldn't land a job as a reporter," Goodby recalls, "so one day I randomly 
paged through the Yellow Pages." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where, 15 years ago, he came across the section labeled "advertising 
agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time," he confesses, "I didn't even know what an ad agency did." 
</P>
<P>
 But he started phoning agencies and asked if any had available jobs. With 
luck, he found one that did. 
</P>
<P>
 And after working for several ad firms, including a stint with ad legend Hal 
Riney (who later created the Bartles & Jaymes characters for Gallo), Goodby and 
two pals, Richard Silverstein and Andy Berlin, left to form their own agency in 
1983 -- an agency that promises employees a steady supply of 25-cent beers in 
the company soda machine. "Always was. Always will be," vows the unconventional 
employee handbook. (For a cold milk, employees have to head to the cappuccino 
stand down the street.) 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has thrived on being provocative. Its billboard ads for the San 
Francisco Examiner portrayed TV newscasters as Ken and Barbie dolls, leading 
one tough-talking TV station manager to broadcast an angry rebuttal. Similarly, 
one TV spot created for a Honda Dealers group depicted Southern Californians as 
airheads. 
</P>
<P>
 And while most clients are enchanted with the agency's work, several wondered 
aloud about the air of utter chaos that permeates the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their work is spectacular," says Jeff Stutin, marketing director for 
Norwegian Cruise Line. "But sometimes you've got to smack them around to get 
them in line." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of smacking them, however, milk executives want to hug them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no commercial crystallizes the meaning of the "Got Milk?" slogan 
better than one featuring a peanut butter sandwich. The offbeat ad has even 
managed to elevate Aaron Burr -- who heretofore was known as the former vice 
president who in 1804 killed statesman Alexander Hamilton in a gun duel. Now, 
he's the guy in the milk ad: 
</P>
<P>
 An Alexander Hamilton history buff is making a peanut butter sandwich. His 
home is littered with Hamilton memorabilia. He even has the very bullet that 
killed Hamilton.  
</P>
<P>
 The phone rings just as the buff takes a massive bite into his sandwich. A 
radio announcer promises $10,000 if he can name the person who shot Hamilton.  
</P>
<P>
 The historian can only muffle, "Aawwan Buhhh." He grabs an empty milk carton 
and loses the contest. As the commercial ends, he's still muttering, "Aawwan 
Buhhh."  
</P>
<P>
 The client behind that ad, the California Milk Processor Board, says the 
campaign is an attempt to turn around milk consumption in California, which has 
dropped a whopping 17% since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the ad campaign began seven months ago, it has developed a near-cult 
following. The agency constantly receives fan mail and suggestions for future 
milk ads. In fact, the milk spots have proven to be so popular with consumers 
that the agency shot four more commercials in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most unusual of the new spots is one called "Heaven," which Goodby 
directed. In the ad, a tyrannical executive dies and thinks he has gone to 
Eternity -- until he discovers there is no milk around to help wash down his 
chocolate chip cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 An ambitious set director made sure that everything was white. White furniture 
was everywhere. A white piano was hauled in and its black piano keys were 
whitened. White curtains hung from the windows. Even a white fish was imported 
to swim in a glass bowl. A heaven-like atmosphere of white clouds was created 
by mist generated from dry ice and mineral oil. And the white, marble-like 
floor was constantly swept by stagehands. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 chocolate chip cookies -- each about one foot in diameter -- were 
baked by a specially hired pastry chef who required an entire day to create 
them. The cookies were so gigantic that the chocolate chips aren't chips at 
all, but whole Hershey Kisses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a pretty elaborate way to sell milk," Goodby admits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ads appear to be influencing some people to drink more milk. For the 
first time in years, milk consumption in the state is up among teen-agers and 
young adults, says Jeff Manning, executive director of the Berkeley-based milk 
processor board. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads have also generated some complaints. Several consumers complained 
about the bad manners of the historian who talks with his mouth full of peanut 
butter.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the "Got Milk?" campaign has also teamed up with some other natural 
partners in milk: like Wheaties and animal crackers. One wonders, can Milk Duds 
be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 For Goodby, there are few illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scariest part of it all is, what's next?" Goodby says. "When will I ever 
get another good idea?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he looks down for a moment at his bottle of designer water. His eyes 
widen. Can he possibly be thinking: Got water?

BOOK WORLD BOOTING UP FOR A WHOLE NEW CHAPTER; PUBLISHING: CD-ROM HAS THE 
INDUSTRY ABUZZ AS THE AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSN. PREPARES TO GATHER HERE FOR 
ITS CONVENTION. THE PREDICTION? GET READY TO CURL UP WITH A GOOD COMPUTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like surfers waiting for the next wave, booksellers are an anxious bunch these 
days. They know a big one is coming, they just don't know where or when. 
</P>
<P>
 From coast to coast, the book biz is abuzz with talk of a brave new 
computerized world. In the future, some experts predict, a tsunami-force wave 
of CD-ROM technology and other innovations will wash through U.S. bookstores, 
dramatically transforming the way texts are written, packaged, sold and read. 
</P>
<P>
 Within years, they suggest, books will be more than hard-bound bestsellers or 
mass-market paperbacks. They'll be three-dimensional, sensory experiences on 
home computer screens that usher in a new era of literary information. You'll 
just pop in a compact disk, turn on the laptop . . . and read. 
</P>
<P>
 Few are predicting the demise of books as we know them, because it's hard to 
imagine your PowerBook at the beach, or bedtime stories with the kids in front 
of an impersonal computer. But in a nation where 32% of all homes have PCs, the 
demand for electronic book products could become insatiable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a change coming and we have to stake our claim to this new market," 
says Doug Dutton, owner of Dutton's Books in Brentwood. "Yet that's all we 
know. We booksellers have a lot of questions about where we're headed." 
</P>
<P>
 They'll be seeking answers starting Saturday, when more than 30,000 
publishers, authors, booksellers, agents and other vendors gather in Los 
Angeles for the annual American Booksellers Assn. convention. The four-day 
event is the largest book conference in the English-speaking world. 
</P>
<P>
 As in previous meetings, there will be lavish signing parties, gala dinners 
and no shortage of literary hoopla. Some of the nation's foremost writers will 
be in attendance: Tony Kushner, Tom Robbins, Maya Angelou, Dave Barry, Michael 
Crichton, Allen Ginsburg, Matt Groening, Dean Koontz, Amy Tan, Tom Peters, Anne 
Rivers Siddons, John Irving and Pat Conroy. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be glitz and dish galore when lovebugs James Carville and Mary 
Matalin preview their joint account of what it was like to be on opposing sides 
of the 1992 Clinton-Bush campaigns. On a local note, author panels will delve 
into the literature of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the image of the City of 
Angels as reflected in novels, poetry, short stories and memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the informal buzz, however, is expected to focus on electronic 
publishing, a relatively new branch of the book business that's gathering more 
force each year. For the first time, the ABA will be devoting a sizable chunk 
of convention floor space to computer book products. The market has clearly 
grabbed sellers' attention -- but will they be able to ride the new wave? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the $64,000 question," says Elisa Zachary, publisher of Simon & 
Schuster's interactive division, which is less than a year old. "You have to 
train people to sell these products, and consumers have to become more aware. 
Maybe they've heard about electronic books. But they don't know much more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it looks simple: CD-ROM technology records the text of a book 
on compact disk to be read on a computer screen. The experience is often 
enhanced with sound, graphics and material not found in the original book. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic feature of the new product, however, is interactive: It 
enables people to "talk back" to the text with the mere click of a computer 
switch. From a creative standpoint, the possibilities are endless. 
</P>
<P>
 In a future CD-ROM book, for example, readers could step into a novel, invent 
characters and change plots. The technology already exists for kids to watch 
Velociraptors crossing a Mongolian plain, as they click their way through a 
book about dinosaurs. History has been enhanced for many college students, who 
now can look up Hitler, Lenin or Stalin in an on-line encyclopedia and see 
grainy films of them delivering speeches on home computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers are calling it the ultimate marriage of reading and entertainment. 
But they caution that electronic books and their ilk are like many other 
futuristic products rolling down the new information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it's all talk and speculation," says a high-ranking executive of a 
major American booksellers chain. "Everybody knows the potential here is going 
to be vast and huge . . . but it's up to consumers to make this fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are only a limited number of CD-ROM book products on the 
market, ranging from the complete Oxford English Dictionary to a group of 
children's stories, including "Just Grandma and Me," which has sold more than 
130,000 copies. Customers seeking them out in bookstores may be disappointed 
because many stores don't yet carry a full product line. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, CD-ROM books are more typically found in computer stores such as 
Egghead Software and Comp USA. Booksellers hope to correct that so they don't 
lose the market. And publishers are also feeling the heat, because they don't 
want to merely provide the back list of material for others to re-create on 
CD-ROM. For them, the big bucks will be in marketing and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're rethinking what it means to be a publisher, and we're trying to move as 
many products on paper into electronics," says Randi Benton, who runs the 
interactive computer division of Random House Inc. "But everybody has to 
proceed cautiously, because there are some obvious business concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as: How do you bet the farm on a new medium when fewer than 5 million 
American homes have CD-ROM technology in their computers? Will enough customers 
buy electronic books that typically sell for $69.99 or more? 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, what happens if compact disk technology becomes the 
eight-track tape of the 1990s -- an obsolete hardware that's overtaken by new 
gadgetry? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it really matters that much," says Bob Stein, a creative guru 
at the Voyager Co., a New York-based firm that creates CD-ROM books. "Did the 
Beatles suffer when eight-track tapes gave way to cassettes? They did just fine 
and so did their audience. The point is, change will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stein should know. Working with author Art Spiegelman, he recently unveiled a 
stunning example of what CD-ROM technology can do to an already superb product. 
Spiegelman's "Maus," an award-winning cartoon that chronicled the horror of the 
Holocaust through the eyes of a mouse and other characters, has been 
transformed into a provocative new computer-book experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the original text and drawings, readers can tap into several hours 
of audiotapes featuring Spiegelman's father, on whose life the book was based. 
There's a running commentary by the author, describing his creative process, as 
well as thousands of additional sketches, maps and documents that helped create 
the world of "Maus." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a richer reading experience by far. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're entering a whole new world," Stein says. "Reading used to be something 
where you only used one of five senses, but now at least we've added a second, 
which is hearing. We've enlarged the band width, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we're going to see a time when many writers no longer just rely on the 
printed page to communicate. They'll be using the computer as a larger locus of 
expression. That's where you'll find our forward-looking writers." 
</P>
<P>
 The new technology also permits a richer look at the past. In the recently 
published diaries of Richard Nixon presidential aide H.R. Haldeman, for 
example, readers of the printed book can thumb through 684 pages of text. But 
the CD-ROM version just issued by Sony Electronics includes an expanded text as 
well as 45 minutes of rare home movies of Nixon shot by Haldeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Booksellers are watching and waiting to see how the new medium performs, but 
there are some preliminary indications it will be quite popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Rath, ABA executive director, notes that the introduction of on-line 
encyclopedias has caused a 10%-12% dip in sales of printed versions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a shame if we don't seize the advantage and get in the forefront 
of this," he says. "Our goal is to make the bookstore perceived as the place to 
go for information or entertainment in any format." 
</P>
<P>
 And the place to start, many say, is with kids. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no accident that Random House is emphasizing children's products in its 
initial CD-ROM ventures. Next year, Dr. Seuss' works will be available on disk, 
through a joint venture with Random House and Broderbund. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, Simon & Schuster will market a Star Trek junkies' dream -- the 
operating manual for the USS Enterprise in a bold new computer format, replete 
with interactive gizmos, color graphics and vivid sound effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are sponges with computers," Random House's Benton says. "They absorb 
this stuff completely, with no fear. They have no barriers. So they're a 
natural place for the first waves of this new medium to start appearing."

THE GOODS; THE DISCOUNT YEARS; AS WE GET OLDER, MANY OF THE PLEASURES IN LIFE 
GET CHEAPER. AND, THANK GOODNESS, SO DO SOME OF THE NECESSITIES.

 Most people want to be younger. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that's not working, if aches and wrinkles seem to be gaining on you, 
consider the advantages of getting older. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of discounts offered to "mature" audiences has expanded vastly in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, a mere trickle of price reductions were available for people over 65. 
Today, the trickle has turned into a torrent and benefits people as young as 
50, says an author of a book on senior discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Discounts are expanding as more businesses recognize that people over 50 are 
America's fastest-growing population segment and control half the discretionary 
income, says Joan Rattner Heilman, author of "Unbelievably Good Deals & Great 
Adventures That You Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50" (Contemporary 
Books, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few of the bargains available. Many other places also offer 
discounts so, if you have reached 50, don't be shy about asking. Entertainment

TECHNOWATCH; PICTURE THIS: IMPROVE YOUR MEMORIES USING PHOTO CDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget faded family photographs. Now you can keep pictures in perfect shape 
forever on Kodak's Photo CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Photo CDs were introduced in August, 1992, they've been vastly 
improved since then. The latest models offer photos with remarkable clarity and 
gorgeous color when inserted in a special CD player and viewed on a regular TV 
set, even better on a high-resolution one. They also play on most CD-ROM drive 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each five-inch disk can store up to 100 35-millimeter photos, and images can 
be transferred to the Photo CD from old or new negatives or slides, color or 
black-and-white. If you want prints as well, a photofinisher can make them from 
the disk. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak says its gold-colored Photo CDs are permanent. But even if the photo 
quality never declines, we can hope the price eventually will. Right now, it 
costs from about $1 to $4 per picture to put it on a disk, compared to about 25 
cents for one regular paper print. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology junkies will love the options: Viewing your photos via a CD player 
allows you to enlarge or crop them, rotate, pan and arrange the images in any 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a CD-ROM drive computer, you can enhance or rearrange portions of 
each photo. Kodak also has several new computer programs you can use to add 
voice, music and text. There is also an interactive capability to help you set 
up question and answer segments for use, say, as a teaching aid or for sales 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak offers three Photo CD players to be used with televisions. All come with 
remote control and double as music CD players with high-quality stereo sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The PCD 870 plays three disks and costs about $250; the PCD 5870 has a 
five-disk carousel and costs about $450; the PCD 970 is a battery-operated 
portable player with stereo headphones that easily connects to any standard TV 
and costs about $450. They're sold at electronics outlets, or call Kodak at 
(800) CD-KODAK. When You're On a Roll

 Listen up, skaters. Rollerblade has new skates with brakes. Really. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that pioneered in-line skating nationally in the 1980s has just 
introduced five in-line models with a new braking system called Active Brake 
Technology (ABT). The system offers beginners an easier (and less painful) way 
to stop and gives advanced skaters better speed control, Rollerblade 
representatives say. 
</P>
<P>
 With ABT, you can brake while keeping all eight wheels on the ground instead 
of having to lift one foot. The brakes are activated when you move the braking 
skate forward, causing the brake at the back of the skate to automatically 
lower and make contact with the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The five ABT models are priced from $149 to $339. To find a nearby retailer, 
call (800) 232-ROLL. Bigger Than It Looks 
</P>

 Space Bag is a new storage sack you won't believe until you see it. Thanks to 
Silicon Valley technology, the reusable Space Bag has a one-way valve that 
allows the bag to "shrink" a three-foot-high stack of sweaters, comforters or 
pillows into a package six to nine inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Space Bag is simple to use. Fill it with soft items for storage, then insert a 
vacuum hose in the valve to suck out the air. Any home vacuum cleaner with a 
hose will work, including the small hand-held ones. Once the air has been taken 
out, you can hang the bag in a closet or store on a shelf. The bag also 
protects items from moisture, mildew and moths. 
</P>
<P>
 Space Bag comes in two sizes. Small (22 inches by 34 inches) can hold up to 10 
sweaters and costs $14.95; large (36 inches by 52 inches) can store two 
king-sized comforters and several pillows and costs $29.95.

THE GOODS; ECONOTES; 'GLOBEHEADS' SHOW KIDS THE WAY TO CLEAR THE AIR

 Looking for family entertainment with a message? The Globehead family welcomes 
you to "Our Urban Environment," the exhibit at the California Museum of Science 
and Industry in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Claymation characters by Will Vinton introduce the exhibit on a video screen 
and pop up frequently as visitors explore the ways city living affects the air 
around us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives kids a chance to play Smog Detective and look for sources of air 
pollution," says curator David Bibas. "The idea is to make people aware of 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The interactive exhibit includes riddles about what makes smog, a ride-share 
game that leaves you stuck in traffic if you insist on driving alone, and a 
chance to design a mixed-used neighborhood and save enough space to throw in a 
swimming pool or playground. There is also a full-scale freeway ramp and a live 
feed from Caltrans' Traffic Management Center updating traffic conditions. And 
the Globeheads offer some ideas about getting involved in environmental action 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 This exhibit, which opened on Earth Day, completes the museum's 
6,500-square-foot environmental show. The first section, which introduced the 
Globeheads, focuses on water quality, waste management and home energy use. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, the museum will be open on Memorial Day and 
it's free. Information: (213) 744-7400. 
</P>
<P>

BE PREPARED AND NAME A GUARDIAN; PARENTING: WHO WOULD TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS IF 
YOU COULDN'T? THE TIME TO DECIDE IS NOW, WHILE YOU ARE STILL HERE AND ABLE TO 
CONSIDER ALL THE DETAILS.

 The worrisome question arose again as Lisa Harmon and her husband were 
preparing recently for a trip to San Francisco: 
</P>
<P>
 "I just started thinking, if something happened and we were away, what would 
happen to the kids," said Harmon, 35, of Northport, N.Y., whose children are 3 
and 5. "I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think about this a lot, but we seem to get nowhere, because no one likes 
to think about mortality," Harmon said. "It's total avoidance." 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon and her husband, Marc Offenbach, are far from alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers say 75% of Americans have no formally designated guardians for their 
children. Such parents potentially are leaving it up to a court in the event of 
their deaths to place their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not an outcome many parents would relish. Nonetheless, parents continue 
to procrastinate in choosing a guardian, either because they find death to be 
an unappealing subject or because they cannot settle on an acceptable guardian, 
say attorneys and psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us wants to embrace our own mortality," said Sally L. Mattson, a 
psychologist in Brattleboro, Vt. "We don't want to think about our children 
being without us." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she said, the process of choosing a guardian need not be 
daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to be aware that you need to make a good-enough decision, but not a 
perfect one," Mattson said. "If you don't make the decision, it's left up to 
the court. And, often, if you don't have immediate family that are appropriate, 
your kids will be in foster care." 
</P>
<P>
 Considerations in choosing a guardian range from the relatively simple -- 
Would the prospective family have enough room in their home for my kids? Do 
they live close enough so that my child wouldn't have to uproot? -- to the 
dismayingly complex -- Would I upset members of my family if I chose a close 
friend for a guardian? What happens if we divorce? Would the guardians truly 
love my children and raise them as if they were their own? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, estate lawyers and other experts have developed some standard 
questions and suggestions to help make a difficult decision less onerous. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they say, draw up a will. 
</P>
<P>
 The document, which you and your attorney will keep on file in a safe place, 
should include language designating a guardian and, if possible, an alternate 
in case the primary designee becomes unable or unwilling to serve. In the event 
of a court contest, the designation is not legally binding. But judges 
typically side with the parents' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph M. Engel, a New York City attorney who specializes in estate planning, 
said that many people who consider their assets insubstantial ignore the 
writing of a will. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have kids it can be a disaster," Engel said. "If something happens to 
them, there is no decision as to who gets the child, and the two sides of the 
family can go to war with each other. The only loser is the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've settled on a guardian, decide whether that person will have charge 
over both the children and their estate, or whether you want a separate 
individual, called a trustee, for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The simpler job usually is handling the children's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guardian of the person is the new parent -- that's the tough one," Engel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Engel also said that although parents frequently entrust both the children 
and their inheritance to a single guardian, "the fact that somebody is good to 
raise your kids doesn't mean that someone is good to manage your money" -- or 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing to keep in mind is that the guardian is concerned with the 
welfare of the minor's person, as opposed to the minor's trust estate," said 
Eliot Kaplan, an estate attorney in White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to choose somebody who is able to be aware of a minor's needs, and 
to make wise decisions on a minor's behalf," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Prye, a New York City attorney who writes an estate-planning column for 
the Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tenn., said basic criteria for choosing a 
guardian include the age and health of the person or couple, whether they have 
children of a similar age, where they live and their religious preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideal guardian is a stable person who can give the child love and 
affection and who has the emotional and financial ability to raise the child," 
Prye said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most typical choice is family members," he said. "Longtime friends are 
often possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, however, parents often become stuck at precisely this stage of 
the process as they weigh the relative merits, and deficiencies, of their 
potential replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that have the easiest time have close relatives whom they feel 
very connected with, and there is no question in their minds about 
guardianship," Mattson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when family members appear to be inappropriate, parents often shy away 
from naming friends. That is because of the implication that the relatives 
somehow came up short. 
</P>
<P>
 A 44-year-old Long Island woman whose children are 10 and 7 said she would 
like to choose as a guardian a couple in Philadelphia who, she believes, "have 
our values" about issues ranging from religion to education. But she can't 
quite bring herself to make that choice, in part because of the reaction she 
fears from her immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so comfortable with my children being raised by members of my 
family," said the woman, a psychotherapist who asked not to be identified. But, 
she said, "part of me thinks this would hurt my family. I would feel I would 
hurt their feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Some make the choice of friends more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill and Myra Feeney of Greenlawn, N.Y., had designated Bill Feeney's brother 
and sister-in-law as guardians of their daughters, Molly, 9, and Rebecca, 5. 
But the two families have since had a falling out, and the Feeneys recently 
named as the new guardian a single mother with whom they are close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt she was more stable than my brother," Bill Feeney, 45, said of the new 
guardian, who has a son, 13. "We chose her because she was basically the best 
mom you can imagine. She's totally into her son." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys suggest that parents who have chosen guardians also review their 
designation every few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friendships change, people move, people grow apart," said Paul Horton, a law 
professor at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supposing you appoint your sister and brother-in-law, and your sister dies -- 
would you want the brother-in-law to be the guardian?" asked Ira H. Lustgarten, 
an estate specialist at Willkie, Farr & Gallagher in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Divorce of the parents also can throw open the guardianship issue all over 
again. One member of a couple, for instance, may no longer want his or her 
former in-law to remain the children's guardian, Prye said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many disputes that come up during a divorce, "there's really no good 
way to handle it," Prye said, other than to attempt to negotiate new terms of 
guardianship. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid another potentially unpleasant outcome -- a divisive custody battle 
-- estate attorneys say it is a good idea to encourage a relationship between 
the child and his or her guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to prove the existence of such a relationship is particularly 
valuable if others, especially family members, decide to contest the parents' 
choice of a guardian.

SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR SALE OF US FACILITIES; INSURANCE: COSTA MESA FIRM IS TO 
BE ACQUIRED BY HIGHEST BIDDER. TWO NOMINATED BY WOULD-BE PURCHASER ARE ELECTED 
AS DIRECTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shareholders of US Facilities Corp. voted overwhelmingly to sell the insurance 
holding company to the highest bidder, and they narrowly elected two directors 
nominated by the company's hostile pursuer, according to results released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 59% of the shares voted were cast at Wednesday's annual meeting in 
favor of the sale proposal sponsored by Fidelity National Financial Inc. in 
Irvine. Only 37% voted against the resolution, and the rest abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory for Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest title insurer, should 
lead to negotiations soon on its hostile $79-million offer to take over US 
Facilities. With no other bidders in sight, Fidelity hopes to have the highest 
offer at $15 a share, though the price will depend on a detailed review of US 
Facilities' financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major accomplishment from our perspective because it directs 
management and the directors to put the company up for sale," said William P. 
Foley II, Fidelity's chairman. "They had never agreed to that before. Now the 
company must be sold." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley pointed out that the vote was "not a mandate that the company be sold to 
Fidelity but to the highest bidder." He noted, however, that "we're a very, 
very serious bidder." 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities already has a committee of outside directors and an investment 
banker reviewing its options, but it had not given them authority to negotiate 
a sale. That authority is now expected to be given. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank P. Willey, a Fidelity executive vice president, said he hopes to set up 
a negotiating schedule that includes a review of non-public financial 
information at US Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had confidence in our positions and worked hard to make sure stockholders 
understood them," said Cecilia Wilkinson, a US Facilities spokeswoman. But the 
company accepted its defeat on the sale proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, US Facilities Chairman George Kadonada said the company may challenge 
the election of Fidelity's director-nominees, Newport Beach lawyer Andrew F. 
Puzder and Wall Street money manager Seymour Preston Jr. He said the company 
will decide in a week whether to go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity's candidates edged management's slate by only 23,808 votes, or 0.5% 
of the shares cast, after independent vote tabulators threw out 80,386 shares 
that appeared to be for management's slate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a voice that broke once while reading a prepared statement, a tense 
Kadonada said US Facilities will investigate the reason why the shares that 
could have provided the winning margin for the company were thrown out. But 
Willey was confident that no court would uphold a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadonada said the election is important because, with management's slate, the 
company could try to attract other suitors that could drive the price of its 
stock higher. With Fidelity's candidates on the board, he said, other 
prospective buyers may shy away because they might perceive that Fidelity has 
the advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the defeat more agonizing for US Facilities is that the 
disqualified shares are owned by the company's employees through their 401(k) 
retirement program. "We all feel that this is a very unfortunate circumstance," 
Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors disqualified the shares because they couldn't determine which side 
held the legitimate proxy -- the right to vote those shares. Shareholders 
voting by proxy were supposed to turn in a white form if they were voting for 
management or a blue form if they were voting for Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street responded favorably to the vote. The price of US Facilities stock 
rose 56.25 cents to close at $14.125 a share in Thursday's Nasdaq trading. 
Fidelity's stock, which has dropped a few dollars a share over the last month, 
closed at $16.625 a share, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said he wants US Facilities to help steady earnings at his real 
estate-related business. Fidelity's aim is to diversify so it can level out its 
operational peaks and valleys.

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL AND RESTAURANTS; O.C. HOPES CELEBRATION OF SURFING WILL SWELL 
THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS

 Surf's up in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the nation's first surfing walk of fame will be dedicated on the 
corner of Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 3, "The Endless Summer II," a long-awaited sequel to the classic surf 
film that made its debut in 1963, will open on screens around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. will hold its fifth-annual 
Waterman's Ball, a fund-raiser designed to support three ocean-related 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the Huntington Beach-based Assn. of Surfing Professionals has signed an 
agreement with San Clemente-based DynoComm Sports to produce television 
specials in conjunction with the Coke/ASP World Championship Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Surfing magazine recently released the second of three issues 
designed to celebrate its 30th year of publication. 
</P>
<P>
 What does all of that have to do with the retail industry? 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, in addition to honoring surfers, the walk of fame is designed to 
bring more tourists and surfers to town -- no mean feat when much of Southern 
California is suffering from a dearth of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk will be dedicated at 11 a.m. Saturday in front of Jack's Surfboards. 
Nominees are being selected from four categories: surf pioneers, surfing 
champions, surf culture figures and local heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 The surf industry views the June 4 SIMA event as proof that apparel and 
equipment manufacturers will be around for a long time to come -- and that 
they're doing their part to ensure that the oceans also will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waterman's Ball is expected to generate more than $100,000 in donations 
that will be split among three organizations -- American Oceans Campaign, 
Orange County Marine Institute and Surfrider Foundation. The 1993 event raised 
more than $75,000 for ocean-preservation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Surfing magazine anniversary and the television pact are likely to help 
increase surfing's visibility and, in turn, help equipment manufacturers and 
clothing companies generate additional sales. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Endless Summer II," surf industry executives hope the film -- along 
with several other beach and surf flicks now being considered by Hollywood 
studios -- will spark additional interest in equipment and clothing for 
surfing, volleyball and other beach-lifestyle sports.

PCC GROUP LEAVES BREA FOR POMONA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 PCC Group, a computer company that suffered a $2.2-million loss from an armed 
robbery last year, has moved from Brea to a smaller headquarters in Pomona, the 
company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauro Valdovinos, chief financial officer, said the company's lease on its 
45,000-square-foot headquarters expired last month.The company moved to a 
20,000-square-foot building about eight miles away in Pomona last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the robbery, in which thieves tied up employees and stole computer 
chips, forced the company to shut down six branch offices and shrink its 
overall work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The company received an insurance settlement for $2.45 million, and police 
recovered $234,000 in cash and equipment from the captured thieves, but 
Valdovinos said the delay hurt the company. Its sales shrank from $91.8 million 
in the 1992 fiscal year to $75 million for fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdovinos said the company now has 35 employees in one location, down from 
150 a year ago.

PLAZA HOME MORTGAGE CORP. SHARES SOAR ON SPECULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plaza Home Mortgage Corp., the Santa Ana lender, saw its stock price jump more 
than 23% on Thursday on market speculation about further consolidation in the 
mortgage industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza's stock gained $1.56 a share to close at $8.19 in Thursday's Nasdaq 
trading."There is some broad-based speculation on consolidation in the industry 
in general," said Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst with the investment bank Mabon 
Securities in San Francisco. "Plaza just caught fire today. It's not a 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation speculation is being sparked by New York-based Chemical Bank 
Corp.'s May 12 purchase of Margaretten Financial Corp., a large New 
Jersey-based mortgage lender, Jeffrey said. Margaretten, with 89 offices in 25 
states, is one of several mortgage companies that have been purchased this year 
by banking companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza, with 39 offices in 13 states, recently reported that its April loan 
originations totaled $397 million, compared to originations of $730 million for 
the same month last year. For the first four months of 1994, however, the 
company originated $2 billion in loans, an increase from $1.85 billion for the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza officials would not comment Thursday on the movement of the company's 
stock prices.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; THE END ZONE; COLLEGE-BOUND STUDENTS FACE 
FEAR AND ANTICIPATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BO YOON CHOI and JANE KIM, Bo Yoon Choi and Jane Kim are seniors at Sunny 
Hills High School in Fullerton. this article first appeared in the student 
newspaper, the Accolade. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the countdown continues toward graduation, seniors find themselves caught 
in a sort of twilight zone -- that point in time between receiving a high 
school diploma and entering a new adult life, whether in college or the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to remain in the here and now. Exams, final papers, homework. "Why 
bother?" many cry. "We're outta here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's called senioritis. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at that affliction and excitement facing college-bound seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will college mean freedom from the clutches of smother-mothers or lonely 
isolation that leaves us gazing wistfully at a stash of family snapshots? 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't the slightest idea. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bit scary imagining leaving for college in a few short months. Most 
college-bound seniors seem to fear or eagerly anticipate the coming experience. 
Some have both emotions at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to college evokes many images: caffeine pills the week before midterms; 
turning all your new white shirts, socks and underwear pale pink in the wash; 
discovering that your roommate performs satanic rituals in the middle of the 
night, realizing that you're no longer the big shot on campus but rather just a 
little fish in a gigantic pond of scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 The list doesn't end there. 
</P>
<P>
 What about determining your major and career? We've heard horror stories about 
the student who changed her major 12 times before returning to her original 
choice. And the age-old problem of finding new friends. Uncertain and alone on 
a distant campus, we must take the initiative and responsibility of meeting the 
right friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering college is often an initiation into adulthood: Inexperienced high 
school youths must learn to manage time and money while trying to discover 
their niche in a new environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apprehensions, most seniors seem quite optimistic and eager about 
the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe college is a place to start anew, to try not to make the mistakes made 
in high school and, ultimately, to change. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a time for self-discovery in a place that affords the opportunity to be 
exposed to perspectives of students from a wide variety of backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many seniors eagerly await the chance to move out, to liberate themselves from 
the tyranny of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom in deciding when to party, when to study, when to sleep and when to 
return to the dorm is very alluring -- especially for those students who have 
been under strict parental control all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquiring the ability to really fend for yourself -- as well as the knowledge 
to be gained from interacting with professors and peers -- makes college a 
much-anticipated place. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we who still enjoy getting the surprise toys in Happy Meals and manage to 
overspend every month's allowance shoulder the responsibilities of the mature 
college student? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe the uncertainty about the future is one of the most appealing and 
exciting aspects of college. In a few months, it will begin to happen. For now, 
we can't wait.

 As the countdown continues toward graduation, seniors find themselves caught 
in a sort of twilight zone -- that point in time between receiving a high 
school diploma and entering a new adult life, whether in college or the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gary sits in his economics classroom, passively watching his teacher drone on 
in a monotonous voice about economic indicators and the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher asks desperately, "Did anyone finish their assignment? Anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gary kicks himself again for not finishing his homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Last night he went home, fully intending to do the assignment, only to grab a 
Snapple and some Teddy Grahams from the kitchen and place himself lethargically 
on the couch to watch another episode of Tiny Toons. "It doesn't matter 
anyway," he thought. "I'm outta here." 
</P>
<P>
 It is only days until graduation, and the Class of '94 is patiently awaiting 
June 16, about as patiently as a 6-year-old waiting outside an occupied 
restroom after drinking 32 ounces of Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's senioritis , wreaking havoc once again on seemingly innocent 
victims. The same senioritis that millions of American students fall prey to 
every year. We thought the end of the school year was bad last year. But this 
time there is no one to keep us accountable, because we aren't coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 We are suddenly responsible for our own lives. Wasn't this transition supposed 
to be fun? 
</P>
<P>
 So, hey, we're almost independent now. This is what we wanted, right? People 
will have to treat us as adults. We get to do all that nifty adult stuff. We 
get to work 40 hours a week, make car payments, pay taxes, pay rent, vote, 
start a career, worry about cholesterol and heart failure, buy a Nordic Trak, 
watch TNN and Bob Villa and set our own bedtime.

<P>
 Not only are we adults, but we are adults with vision. Ironically, we possess 
that childlike hope for the future that makes us the idealistic young people 
that we are. We think we've got it all together. And that's the point, right? 
We don't need to be in this hideously over-structured, creatively limiting 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 We are the immortal youth! Not even large quantities of butter can stop us 
now! 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, we still have plenty to learn. We have been at here at Troy 
High for four years. Why is it so hard now? 
</P>
<P>
 If we are as mature as we would like people to think, why are we struggling to 
finish our last quarter of high school? 
</P>
<P>
 Conquering senioritis requires one more burst of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 As seniors, we are leaving our final impression on our friends, our teachers 
and those that we have grown close to. Whether it be school, or a job or some 
equally important place or event, how you leave indicates a great deal about 
your character. 
</P>
<P>
 As we leave Troy we will show a lot of people how well we will follow through 
with responsibilities in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need to do is take a look at how the actions we take now will affect 
our future. We have worked hard to get where we are. The teachers and 
administration have worked as hard, if not harder, to assist us in preparing 
for our future. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a moment to decide what kind of impression you want to leave on those who 
will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 We can still do all that crazy senior stuff. We can still run through the 
halls with underwear on our heads singing "Ukuleles From Heaven" at the top of 
our lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 But we really should try to get our economics homework done, too.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; THE END ZONE; UP ATTITUDE CAN WARD OFF 
UNHEALTHY CASE OF SENIORITIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL BOLEN, Michael Bolen is a senior at Huntington Beach High School, 
where this article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Oiler Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the countdown continues toward graduation, seniors find themselves caught 
in a sort of twilight zone -- that point in time between receiving a high 
school diploma and entering a new adult life, whether in college or the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to remain in the here and now. Exams, final papers, homework. "Why 
bother?" many cry. "We're outta here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's called senioritis. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at that affliction and excitement facing college-bound seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It can't hurt your health, and it won't leave a rash. In most cases, however, 
it will affect your grades and your attitude toward school. It may be 
contagious. Its symptoms can last from just one quarter to a full year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senioritis is a condition that strikes high school seniors who know that it's 
almost time to graduate and move on to bigger and better things. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are afflicted with the educational disease become more lax in 
completing their work. The quality begins to diminish, and their test scores 
slowly fall. Those seniors who have it tend to have shorter attention spans and 
may even fall asleep in class from time to time. Those who have this senior 
plague are more prone to absenteeism. Their feelings toward the teachers' 
lessons are nonchalant; some formerly diligent students don't show up for 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the condition almost always improves with time, some students suffer 
lasting effects. A final slip in grades can affect college admission, 
regardless of earlier acceptance, and it can affect a potential employer's 
assessment of job skills. It can also cause a senior to lose academic status as 
a Distinguished Scholar or graduate with honors if required classes are not 
completed with strong grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Senioritis is nothing more than a lazy and negative feeling about school. 
Individuals can ward off senioritis, though, by making the decision to finish 
the school year strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging yourself to do your homework on time and coming to school with a 
creative and productive attitude can help keep you clear of the malady, which 
can undermine years of hard work throughout high school.

FOREST CLOSURES TO MAKE FOR UNHAPPY CAMPERS; RECREATION: BUDGET CUTS HAVE SHUT 
PARTS OF ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST. SOME MAY BE TURNED AWAY THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visitors in search of serenity in Angeles National Forest over Memorial Day 
weekend will instead be confronted by the closure of some of the most popular 
camping and picnic areas because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Saugus district, 40 of 117 camping spots will be unavailable because 
Lower Shake, Prospect and Zuni campgrounds have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mt. Baldy Ranger District near Azusa, which annually attracts more 
visitors than Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks combined, 90% of the 
camping spots have been closed. Gates have been locked at Crystal Lake 
campground with its rock-work amphitheater and at the Switzer picnic area above 
La Crescenta with its nearby 50-foot waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in areas of the forest's five districts where overnight campsites will be 
available, it will sometimes be necessary to hike for miles to reach them, and 
visitors may face overflowing trash cans or dirty restrooms because of road 
closures and reduced maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest officials are already fielding angry calls from unhappy campers. And 
they are bracing for more this weekend, the traditional kickoff of the summer 
camping season, when some people will probably have to be turned away at 
entrances to the 694,000-acre forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 38% of the forest's 1,400 camping spots will be unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine a station wagon loaded down with camping equipment and tents and ice 
chests, and kids are singing songs, going to the mountains . . . and then 
finding there's no place to go," said Tom Spencer, the Mt. Baldy district's 
recreation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 This fiscal year's $20-million budget is down 20% from last year, Forest 
Supervisor Michael J. Rogers said. Twenty-five of 150 temporary workers and 16 
of the 320 full-time employees have been laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just tightened up and done things with volunteers and (campground) 
concessionaires to try to keep things together, but we're at the point now 
where we're running out of miracles to pull out of the hat," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 National forests nationwide are facing similar cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget for the Forest Service is down only 3% this year from fiscal 1993. 
But inflation, combined with that reduction, has taken its toll, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The squeeze means that available campgrounds will fill faster than ever in a 
forest that draws more than 32 million visitors each year, the second most 
frequently visited national forest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect everything to be booked up, whatever's not closed," forest 
spokeswoman Dianne Cahir said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Mt. Baldy district have fielded more than 300 phone calls 
this week from people complaining, Spencer said. Besides Crystal Lake 
campground, Mt. Baldy officials have closed Manker campground and the Glacier 
and Little Dalton picnic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Arroyo Seco Ranger District above Arcadia, West Fork and Valley Forge 
campgrounds are closed to vehicle traffic but open to walk-ins. Locked gates 
mean that visitors have to walk three miles from parking lots to Valley Forge 
campground and five miles to West Fork campground. Maintenance workers try to 
get to the sites for cleanup once a week, if they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the pits, I tell you," said Don Wopschall, the Arroyo Seco district's 
recreation lands officer.  
</P>
<P>
 The Valyermo Ranger District in the Big Pines area is bracing for the overflow 
of campers who might have headed to Crystal Lake and other now-closed 
campgrounds, said Shawn Lawler, that district's interpretive manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting we'll probably be filled at least by tonight," she said. 
"Everyone that calls, we're telling them to come as soon as they can." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has not had to close any of its 13 campgrounds, she said. But 
people can expect reduced services. "That's the only way we can keep them 
open," she said. "That's a real different mode of operation than any of us are 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Some campers are scrambling to make other plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Explorer Scout Troop 964 from Redondo Beach camped at Crystal Lake last year 
and had planned a return visit, troop leader Sam Rahman said. About 30 
teen-agers learned such things as how to start a fire with rocks and twigs, and 
how to pitch a tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll go sightseeing or exploring a lot more than they would just sitting 
around a city street," Rahman said. The troop had to camp this year in a park 
in Monrovia, he said. Officials at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Los Angeles 
are also looking for another campsite, said volunteer Al Estrella, who has 
arranged for group trips to Crystal Lake for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can hear the birds singing in the morning and the waterfalls in the 
distance," Estrella said. But not this year, he said.

IN HIS OWN WORDS; ACTOR'S ADMIRATION FOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. INSPIRES 
PREMIERE OF ONE-MAN SHOW IN ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, Roosevelt Blankenship 
Jr. was barely 9, a rural kid living in a backwater town deep in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 He was playing with brothers, sisters and other children when the wailing of 
adults broke through. Everyone gathered around their TVs to listen to the only 
station that broadcast into tiny Greenville. As the news became clear, 
Blankenship recalled, a sense of fatalism settled over the black neighborhood 
where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, first they got Kennedy, now they got Martin," he sighed. "It was 
such a big blow to the community, this feeling that things were going to go 
back to the way they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenship said he was too young to fully understand the event, but as he 
grew older, he studied King's life and work. His admiration for the 
civil-rights leader inspired "An Evening With Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.," 
Blankenship's one-man show that premieres at the Ensemble Theatre on Sunday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenship, who founded the Ensemble Theatre last year in the back of a 
mini-mall, said the play will last about an hour and cover King's life from 
1955 and events surrounding Rosa Parks and the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott to 
the King-led "March on Washington" of 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tribute goes well (meaning if the Ensemble is packed and the show 
appreciated), Blankenship said he'd dramatize the rest of King's life, 
including his murder, in a performance "a month or two down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 "An Evening With Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." is based on King's speeches, 
sermons and writings. Blankenship wrote connecting passages and will dress in 
costume, portraying King in various stages throughout the period, considered by 
many to be the most crucial years for the civil-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important for me to use his actual writings, mainly because I wanted a 
sense of realism," Blankenship explained. "I go into (when he made) a stirring 
speech about the bus boycott (involving Parks) and when his house was bombed in 
Montgomery in 1956. The crowd was threatening to riot, but he quieted them." 
</P>
<P>
 Other significant events include the days King spent in jail for his protests 
of racism and his reaction to George Wallace, then-governor of Alabama, and his 
attempt to bar integration at public schools. Blankenship also goes into King's 
1959 journey to India to study the passive resistance philosophy of Mahatma 
Gandhi, one of his role models. 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenship, 35, says he hopes the play will further bring into focus the man 
hailed by blacks and whites alike as one of the world's most influential 
leaders, but who also was ridiculed by some black Americans for not taking a 
more aggressive, uncompromising approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our greatest leader," Blankenship said, "and when he died, much of the 
dream died with him. He was great because he was always trying to find a 
solution to the problems. He had this confidence that said he, and us, could 
accomplish anything once we put our minds to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenship, who has lived in Orange and worked in theater locally for several 
years, said it was an experience with his 6-year-old son, Roosevelt Blankenship 
III, that helped inspire him to create his Martin Luther King show. He recently 
asked the youngster what he knew about King and was disappointed by the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son just didn't know much about King's history, what he meant to us," 
Blankenship said. "I want to bring him back into the light, because children 
today need to know more about the movement. If kids today had him as a role 
model, I feel there wouldn't be as much gang activity." Accordingly, he said he 
feels his show about King is appropriate for all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenship also says that King's desire for integration (in contrast to 
Malcolm X's separatist's position) is a powerful message for contemporary 
blacks. In contrast, Blankenship pointed to the Rev. Louis Farrakahn as a 
modern leader "with many good ideas about black pride" but also someone who 
preaches racial division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do all have to get along, just like King said," noted Blankenship. "Blacks 
and other minorities should not separate themselves or their businesses from 
the mainstream. To accomplish more, we have to mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a philosophy that reaches to the Ensemble Theatre. Blankenship, who 
directs many of its productions, said he prefers "high quality" dramas and 
comedies that reach a wide audience, regardless of race.  
</P>
<P>
 Although he staged Athol Fugard's apartheid play "The Island" last year, he 
recently presented N. Richard Nash's "The Rainmaker" and plans to offer David 
Mamet's "Glengarry Glen Ross" next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been asked why I don't do more racially oriented plays, but I don't feel 
I have an obligation to," he said. "Some people might not like that about me. 
If the play is interesting and has a strong message to society as a whole, then 
I'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel just because I'm black I have to reach out to a black audience.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: AMID LATE-NIGHT WARS, 'MOMENTS' TO REMEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg

<TEXT>
<P>
 What are talk shows if not collections of fleeting moments -- some of which 
are delectable, most of which run together like a monotone buzz that you listen 
to without really hearing? Drop the buzz, keep the highlights and you really 
have something. So. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He-e-e-e-e-re's "Johnny Carson: His Favorite Moments From 'The Tonight Show.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Carson has described his nearly 30 years of bending America's ear as "just a 
helluva lot of fun." That also applies to this four-tape set from Buena Vista 
Home Video. It goes on sale today, ironically just as Carson's once-energized 
competitor -- Arsenio Hall -- is ending his own, skimpier, run as a late-night 
host. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing gets more inflated than a eulogy. Celebs have been dropping by the 
syndicated "Arsenio" in advance of tonight's finale (at midnight on KCOP-TV 
Channel 13) to assure him that he's a giant of entertainment who will be widely 
missed. Carson heard much the same thing in 1992 during his last days, and, 
three decades earlier, so did the man Carson succeeded on "The Tonight Show," 
Jack Paar. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by his dive in the Nielsen ratings, though, Hall's departure has been 
preceded by a fade to anonymity. The "indelible" memory of Paar lasted only as 
long as it took Carson to launch his first one-liner. And the worshiped Carson 
himself -- despite his enormous impact as a television icon and a thread of 
continuity during momentous change in the United States -- was missed only a 
little longer. Like television itself, we're creatures of the moment with short 
memories. There are just too many distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 As TV-driven zombies, most of us are easily diverted by bells, whistles or any 
other loud noises. Nothing has been noisier of late than the duel of 
television's late-night commandos, Jay Leno and David Letterman. On CBS, "Late 
Show With David Letterman" has been a true phenomenon, and Leno on NBC has at 
times creatively used "The Tonight Show" to tap sources of humor distinct from 
the late-night talk and comedy of the Carson era. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how distinct is evident from watching the Carson tapes, which, says an 
accompanying publicity blurb, will be the only video retrospective of his show 
to be released. The first three tapes can be purchased separately ($15 each), 
but you have to buy the entire set for $60 to get the fourth tape, which is 
Carson's final "Tonight Show," broadcast two years ago this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes -- opening with "The Tonight Show" originating from New York in 
black and white -- are a kick on several levels, one of which is historical. In 
only a few moments you're returned to an earlier universe in which such names 
as Ethel Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey surface in Carson's monologues, and 
smoking was still the nasty habit of the TV multitudes (Buddy Hackett, Flip 
Wilson, Dean Martin, George Gobel and the host himself are seen blithely 
puffing away). 
</P>
<P>
 And who is that androgynous falsetto freak that we see a bowled-over, 
can't-believe-his-eyes-or-ears Carson greeting in 1968? Why, it's none other 
than coquettish sheman Tiny Tim. Yet he looks as quaint as a sweet old aunt and 
as mainstream as Peoria compared to 1994's Prince or Michael Jackson -- to say 
nothing of half the guests that file across the screen during daytime's talk 
zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the "moments" are in the still-funny-after-all-these-years category. 
In one of the most famous accidental sight gags ever (1965), there is dead-eye 
Ed Ames once again throwing his tomahawk in a cardboard cowboy's crotch. 
"Welcome to Frontier Bris," says Carson, who shrewdly extends the joke by 
stopping the chagrined Ames from removing the tomahawk. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Carson in 1968 face-to-face with Jack Webb in a "Dragnet"-style 
stone-faced talking-heads dialogue about a "Copper Clapper Caper" that could 
have been pulled from a contemporary police parody; then a decade later as 
Mister Rogers, using mommy and daddy dolls to explain the birds and bees. And 
there he is spoofing George C. Scott's Gen. Patton, giving a stirring speech in 
front of an enormous U.S. flag. When the camera pulls back, you see that he's 
been speaking to Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson interviews a cerebral myna bird. The potato chip sculptor is here, too, 
as are other eccentric guests who are either a hoot on their own or become 
fodder for Carson's humor and acute sense of the absurd: "Now, about these 
quail droppings. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 What strikes you, though, is just how little time is devoted to traditional 
interviews, almost as an admission that the bulk of them were too forgettable 
to earn a shot at posterity. Instead, Carson affirms here that he not only was 
a hair-trigger ad-libber but also was someone adept at shaping cleverly written 
material into hilarious physical comedy, whether as fast-talking movie host Art 
Fern or as all-knowing, all-seeing Carnac the Magnificent ("Piggly wiggly: 
Describe Kermit's wedding night"). 
</P>
<P>
 You particularly appreciate just how gifted and instinctive he was as a 
physical comic when he elasticizes his gangly body when he comes under attack 
from the various exotic insects and animals brought on the show by Joan Embery, 
Jim Fowler and others. A marmoset reposes on a nervous Johnny's head, a larger 
monkey slugs him in the jaw, and so on and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes also showcase a slew of young stand-ups -- including Leno, Letterman 
and Garry Shandling -- before they became major stars. In fact, all of Carson's 
hosts-in-waiting are memorialized here. Well, almost all. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny holds a grudge so long. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How long? 
</P>
<P>
 So long that former Carson favorite Joan Rivers -- who reportedly angered him 
deeply when she bolted "The Tonight Show" for her own competing late-night 
series on Fox in 1986 -- is a non-person on these tapes. Despite her prominence 
as a very funny guest and substitute host, zilch, zero, invisible, outranked 
even by the myna bird. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional heart of "His Favorite Moments" is not the sign-off show -- a 
no-guest, anticlimactic sprawl of clips and various bits of nostalgia -- but 
the famous next-to-last show that included a visibly moved Carson being 
serenaded by Bette Midler. It was a lovely, lingering, moist-eyed instant of 
television that seemed to belie the fact that, for nearly all its life under 
Carson, "The Tonight Show" was nothing more than fluff. Which, of course, is 
why we watched it.

2,034 -- AND STILL TICKING; COMEDY: RHINO RELEASES A BOXED-SET OF ALBUMS WITH 
THE 2,000 YEAR OLD MAN. 'I LISTENED TO THE LAST RECORD YESTERDAY, AND IT'S 
STILL FUNNY,' CARL REINER SAYS OF THE ROUTINES HE DID WITH MEL BROOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the 2,000 Year Old Man was introduced to the world in 1960, he had two 
simple tips for longevity: Never, ever touch fried foods, and never run for a 
bus -- there'll always be another. 
</P>
<P>
 Today avoiding fast food and stress will only get you so far. The Man is now 
2,034 years old, and clearly, there must be something else that accounts for 
his enduring nature. But Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner, the masterminds behind the 
old guy, never expected him to last this long without life-support systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhino has released a boxed-set of the team's four comedy albums -- "2,000 
Years," "2,001 Years," "At the Cannes Film Festival" and "2,000 and Thirteen." 
As Billy Crystal states in his introduction in the set's booklet, these are 
"historical" recordings that influenced many a comic in their day. They also 
happen to be crushingly funny in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderfully shocking," says Reiner. "I listened to the last record 
yesterday, and it's still funny. It's the absolute truth, some things don't 
change. A lot of the same principles remain true -- there's a bit about the 
first hospitals in history with patients screaming and indifferent doctors, and 
we still have that today. There's the bit about selling the U.S. to Japan 
that's probably even more timely." 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, it took 10 years before the 2000 Year Old Man became anything other 
than an act with which Brooks and Reiner graced friends at parties. Reiner and 
Brooks became fast friends working on Sid Caesar's "Your Show of Shows" in the 
1950s. And as it turns out, the 2,000 Year Old Man was inspired by a really bad 
TV show, a '50s equivalent of reality television. 
</P>
<P>
 As Reiner recalls, "They were interviewing this guy on TV, who was saying, 'I 
was in Stalin's toilet and I overheard their plans -- they're gonna blow up the 
world next Tuesday.' I couldn't believe I had heard something on TV so stupid. 
So I went into the writer's room and said to Mel, 'Isn't it true you were there 
when Christ was crucified?' I didn't even expect an answer, but Mel just took 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Brooks' contribution to the act had a more personal origin. 
"My mother's side was Russian, and they were always so positive that they were 
right," he recalls. "When I was a kid, my Uncle Sol used to say, 'Why do we 
need these big, six-story buildings? God never intended people to live so far 
from the street. Why do we have to be above two floors from the street?' I was 
5 or 6, and I thought, this is funny. If he goes downtown, he'll faint. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was crazy, he was wild. I loved his energy. The 2,000 Year Old Man is a 
purveyor of these same large truths -- I don't wanna call them lies. He mocks 
the things that we all are to become, just as I see my kids making fun of me 
and my ways. But someday they're gonna end up with their own kids mocking them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never forgot his voice. That sound meant a great deal to me -- safety, 
protection, strength, that loud, vigorous voice with the Jewish accent. When I 
redid it, when I listened to the tapes the first time, it was amazing, it was 
incredible. I went right back to being 6 years old with my mother's family." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that personal aspect that made Brooks particularly resistant to the 
notion of the Wise One going public. "It was a private thing, I thought no 
one'll understand it. It was all about crazy Jews, it was so insular. It was 
about being Jewish, and being from the Bronx. No one else would understand." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, Steven Allen finally persuaded the duo to record a session. "I was 
not interested in money," Brooks said. "For the contract, there was no fooling 
around. All it said was if we thought they were no good, they would not issue 
them, we would burn the tapes. We had to think they were good enough -- these 
were going to strangers' ears, to Gentiles' ears, God forbid! All we wanted was 
the right to edit every single Q and A. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "So they sent them out, and they started selling, I couldn't believe it. I 
said, 'Carl, there must be a lot of Jews out there.' He said, 'No, others are 
buying them, too.' It just took off like wildfire." 
</P>
<P>
 The records were directly responsible for kick-starting Brooks' career -- on 
the strength of those records, he was hired to co-create the TV series "Get 
Smart" and moved on to his celebrated film career. (Reiner's career was already 
in high gear -- he was working on his classic creation "The Dick Van Dyke 
Show.") 
</P>
<P>
 One of the chief pleasures in listening to the routines (the first three 
records feature other segments beside the 2,000 Year Old Man) is the terrific 
give-and-take between Reiner's skeptical interviewer and Brooks' feisty 
bimillenialarian. Except for the fourth album, the performances were completely 
ad-libbed, with Brooks never quite sure just what questions Reiner would be 
posing -- and Reiner was looking to give Brooks the gears at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew a man in panic was just hilarious," Reiner says. "I knew that if he 
was against the wall, he'd always find gold. I never knew what his answers 
would be. We'd do the routine for friends, and he'd be hilarious, but on record 
he never gave me the same answers, and he was still hilarious." 
</P>
<P>
 "His genius was in getting this little Jewish rat in a corner and trapping 
him," Brooks says of Reiner. "He'd always say, 'Prove it, prove it.' I'd come 
up with these fantastic statements -- I knew Robin Hood, I knew Joan of Arc, I 
knew Shakespeare -- and he never let me up, he'd be demanding real proof for 
all my statements. Which was insane, since the first statement was I was 2,000 
years old and that wasn't challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 Is the 2,000 Year Old Man up for a return engagement? Reiner's ready, but 
Brooks seems to require a bit more persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd ask him about everything in the paper today -- sexual harassment, 
feminism, Bosnia, crime, Rwanda, the Hubble telescope," says Reiner. "That's 
how we originally did it, we'd come to a party every Saturday and everyone 
wanted us to do them." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks says he'll wait until he sees how well the boxed-set reissue does 
before committing to delivering any future pearls of wisdom. But he has 
consulted with the 2,000 Year Old Man, who once declared Saran Wrap "the 
greatest thing devised by man" ("You can look through it, you can put three 
olives in it, you can put 10 sandwiches in it -- it's clear, it clings and it 
sticks," he marveled; when asked about the space program, he shrugged, "That 
was good"). And Brooks says he's found an even greater invention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Velcro is state-of-the-art, Velcro can kick Saran Wrap's ass," Brooks, 
channeling the 2,000 Year Old Man, says. "You can use it to do up your fly. You 
can use it to do up your shoes, or the cuffs on your coat, you can wrap it 
around your neck. Velcro is miles ahead of Saran Wrap -- it's the only thing in 
the last 30 years I like as much." 
</P>
<P>
 * Carl Reiner will be signing copies of "The 2000 Year Old Man" at BookStar in 
the Beverly Connection on June 4 from 1-3 p.m.

THEATRE CORP. OF AMERICA SCALES BACK, CITES ECONOMY; THEATER: 'LACK OF 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT' IN FRESNO, SANTA BARBARA, SAN DIEGO IS ALSO GIVEN AS A 
REASON TO RETRENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. of America, which has been exporting its Pasadena Playhouse and 
Alex Theatre productions to four other California venues, is retrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena-based company will no longer send its shows from the Alex in 
Glendale to the Spreckels Theatre in San Diego or the Warnors Theatre in 
Fresno. Nor will the Playhouse-bred productions move to the Lobero Theatre in 
Santa Barbara. The cutbacks follow last week's sudden cancellation at the 
Lobero of the Pasadena production of "The Fourth Wall" on the eve of its 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Pasadena show, "Special Occasions," may travel to the Poway Center 
for the Performing Arts, near San Diego, to complete the current season for 
Poway subscribers to the Pasadena series. But its run probably will be moved up 
and condensed into fewer weeks. A meeting was being held late Thursday to 
discuss these details. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. also has withdrawn from a plan that would have brought the Alex 
shows to theThousand Oaks Civic Auditorium, starting next fall. Although a deal 
hasn't been signed, Thousand Oaks plans to substitute shows from the Theater 
League, an organization that already presents musicals at Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 A Theatre Corp. statement released late Wednesday quoted president David Houk 
saying that California's economic conditions "and the lack of community support 
by way of attendance in San Diego, Santa Barbara and Fresno have forced us to 
temporarily scale back to a two-theater operation. Our first obligation" is to 
Pasadena and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a loyal, base audience of 20,000 subscribers in Pasadena," and an 
"encouraging" response in Glendale -- 14,000 subscribers, he said. "At this 
time, we choose not to expand our base if it means compromising the quality of 
productions in Pasadena and Glendale. We are in the process of reorganizing and 
right-sizing our business in order to meet the many financial challenges that 
lie ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Houk wasn't available for further comment Thursday. But a Theatre Corp. 
spokesman said that layoffs or reduced hours in the company's telemarketing 
office in Pasadena is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers in San Diego, Fresno and Santa Barbara are being offered tickets 
to productions in Pasadena, Glendale or Poway. Fresno subscribers also will be 
offered tickets to other Theatre Corp. presentations in Fresno. At the Lobero, 
each subscriber has been offered two tickets -- and a similar policy is likely 
in San Diego and Fresno. Or current tickets can be held as vouchers for later 
refunds or for a possible 1995 season, should the Theatre Corp. muster the 
resources to resume touring. 
</P>
<P>
 That's unlikely. At the Lobero, for example, subscription figures for the 
Pasadena series dropped from 5,604 in the initial three-play half-year season 
to 3,232 in the current season, the fourth. Single-ticket sales weren't doing 
well either, said Nancy Moore, executive director of the Lobero. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp., which paid the Lobero an undisclosed rent plus a small 
percentage of the gross, still owed the Lobero money for a run of "Sweet, 
Smart, Rodgers and Hart" last winter, said Moore. And the contract had been 
renegotiated twice during two years. The number of performances had dropped 
from an initial 22 to 15 and would have been cut to 11 next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal of "The Fourth Wall" one day before its opening night, forced a 
layoff of the theater's stagehands and janitors, and the rest of the Lobero 
staff was reduced to part-time hours, Moore said. However, the show's actors 
will be paid for the entire run, according to an Actors' Equity official, 
because Theatre Corp. failed to provide enough advance warning of the 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. would have gone on with "The Fourth Wall" if the Lobero had 
postponed the rent and helped pay for advertising, Houk said in an interview on 
Tuesday. But "we're not in any position to be the banker for the Pasadena 
Playhouse," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said she heard many complaints about the Theatre Corp.'s telemarketing. 
The president of the Lobero board, for example, received repeated phone calls 
urging him to subscribe, though he had already signed up. "We kept begging them 
to let us monitor the telemarketing." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's normal everywhere," said Houk, when asked about the telemarketing. 
"Nobody likes to be telemarketed, including me. But it works." But he said that 
Santa Barbara may be too small a market for the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Spreckels owner Jacquie Littlefield contended that Theatre Corp. 
"needed stronger marketing. They thought they were doing it through mailings 
and subscriptions. But they underestimated the economy and how much competition 
there is for the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a regional mentality," said Littlefield. "But this is a very 
commercial area. It needs more of a Nederlander approach" -- a reference to the 
commercial theater company that books tours into San Diego Civic Auditorium, as 
well as several theaters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Spreckels, Theatre Corp. was honoring the subscriptions of the failing 
Starlight Musical Theatre. While total attendance at the last show, "Mame," was 
a respectable 11,623, 4,810 of those were Starlight subscribers who provided no 
additional revenue. Littlefield criticized the Theatre Corp. decision to take 
on those subscribers for free instead of giving them two tickets for the price 
of one. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fresno, sales were reported to be dropping for the upcoming "Fame," 
compared with the first two Alex shows -- "Sayonara" and "Mame." As of 
Wednesday, only 740 seats of 2,164 had been sold for the June 9 opening.

 Tandy Beal has developed a weighty resume as a performer and choreographer. 
Founder of the 20-year-old contemporary-dance troupe Tandy Beal and Company, 
the Santa Cruz artist has created and performed more than 100 works, including 
one of the very few contemporary-dance versions of the "Nutcracker." That show 
premiered in 1982 and was seen in Orange County in a 1986 Cal State Fullerton 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Beal created choreography for animated characters in Tim Burton's 
stop-action film "The Nightmare Before Christmas," has appeared in concerts and 
on TV specials and music videos with jazz-pop singer Bobby McFerrin and has 
collaborated on projects with artists ranging from the late Frank Zappa to the 
Hovik Ballet of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, her career took an unexpected twist. Last year, Beal ran away 
and joined the circus. Or, more precisely, circumstances brought the circus to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she continues to head her dance company, Beal now serves as artistic 
director of the New Pickle Family Circus. The San Francisco-based ensemble 
performs Beal's "Tossing and Turning," a lighthearted look at insomnia that 
features circus skills such as acrobatics and juggling along with live music, 
comedy and dance. The company appears today through Sunday at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Romantics could liken Beal's relationship to the Pickles to a fairy tale, 
perhaps something in the vein of valiant knight snatching worthy maiden from 
jaws of fierce dragon. But, as Beal is quick to point out, last year's rescue 
of the Pickles from financial collapse was the work of a whole squadron of 
knights, not just one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1974 by a group drawn largely from the San Francisco Mime Troupe, 
the original Pickle Family Circus was hailed as a pioneer in the "new circus" 
renaissance. The Pickles fared well until 1987, when the company's artistic and 
administrative leadership began to change. By the spring of '93, the company 
filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Beal, who had choreographed a show for the Pickles, happened to be on the road 
with the circus at that time as show director for "Tossing and Turning." 
Performers and contractors, herself included, were working unpaid, and the 
prospects of the tour lasting to its scheduled completion at Washington's 
Kennedy Center were bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Pickles weren't ready to bow out. With no staff to support them, 
the ensemble, musicians and crew kept working, cutting costs wherever possible 
and handling administrative tasks from making fliers to tacking up advertising 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with the help of Bay Area arts consultant Barbara Kibbe (Beal calls 
her "our guardian angel") and a consortium of volunteers, Beal's nonprofit 
operating company, Friends of Olympia Station, took control of the Pickle's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gifts from private donors and earned income, including proceeds from a 
specialty store run by the Pickles in San Francisco's Embarcadero Center, 
helped get the company on firmer financial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-to-day management of the company is now overseen by a six-person team that 
includes Beal, cast members Diane Wasnak and Jeff Raz and three administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the circus launched a national tour with Beal at the helm. It will 
wind things up in October with a Japanese tour, the first international dates 
the company has played in 15 years. In December, the company will premiere its 
circus-style salute to the movies, tentatively called "Jump Cut." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a company spokeswoman, Beal has added a sophisticated sense of 
movement and timing to the Pickles' shows. Some reviewers have even compared 
the Pickles to Canada's famed Cirque du Soleil, although Beal has other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of difference between (Cirque du Soleil) and us," Beal said 
during a phone interview from her home. "The Pickles are a very touchable 
circus, very human . . . and there's a lot of humor. Watching them, you feel 
like, 'Gee, that might be me up there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although her dance company and the Pickles operate independently, Beal has 
blended the two entertainment forms in the past and plans to do so more in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Her "Nutcracker" incorporated circus-style performances, she said, and her 
dance company is currently touring a show about the poetry of William Blake 
that includes a trapeze artist and a fire juggler. In the next two years, she 
wants to develop "a very large literary project" that will use both companies 
and perhaps stage a revival of the "Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what her artistic visions, she said she has no intention of 
taking the Pickles away from family audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may do something really off the wall," she said, "but I will always keep us 
touring a family show." 
</P>
<P>

Drive, Irvine, tonight through Sunday at 7:30. Matinees Saturday and Sunday at

THEATER / JAN HERMAN; SHAKESPEARE LIVE? IT'S A GHOST OF A CHANCE; ORANGE 
COUNTY'S ONLY PROFESSIONAL CLASSICAL COMPANY OPENS ITS THIRD SEASON WITH A 
ONE-MAN SHOW, FEATURING GREGORY BELL AS THE BARD. A FUND-RAISER PRECEDES THE 
PERFORMANCE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the opening of its third season, Shakespeare Orange County has decided to 
bring on the Bard himself. 
</P>
<P>
 You say that's impossible? You say the great man gave up the ghost 378 years 
ago? You say he didn't even write the plays? 
</P>
<P>
 Then you have reckoned without Gregory Bell, an actor who believes his mission 
is to bring Shakespeare to life and refute the naysayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has come to set the record straight," says Bell, his voice deeply resonant 
and reassuring. "He has come to settle the authorship question. Between you and 
me, there is no question. But I'm constantly in contact with people who want to 
tell me who really wrote the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's one-man show, "Alms for Oblivion," will launch the SOC season at 
Chapman University's Waltmar Theatre in Orange June 16 through 26, followed by 
"Twelfth Night" (July 7 through Aug. 6) and "King Lear" (Aug. 11 through Sept. 
10). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Preceding the season opener, the county's only professional classical company 
will hold a fund-raiser, "Shakespeare and Me: The Lunatic, the Lover and the 
Poet," June 4 at the Waltmar. SOC regulars will perform scenes, recite poems 
and deliver speeches from the Shakespeare canon. "I basically uncover the man 
through his reminiscences," says Bell, who plays the Bard in Elizabethan 
doublet (the coat), pumpkin breeches (the pants), hose (the tights) and whisk 
(the collar). 
</P>
<P>
 "The net effect is to reveal the artist behind all those golden words. A lot 
of my play is educated conjecture. I did a tremendous amount of research. I 
consulted a whole wall of books, read every biography I could get my hands on." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, 46, says "Alms for Oblivion" grew out of a job he landed back in the 
'80s playing Shakespeare at a Renaissance Faire. He wanted to go beyond mere 
appearance. Though he was happy to evoke the physical image of the Bard as seen 
in Droeshout's famous copperplate drawing from the First Folio, the 
personification of Shakespeare strictly in terms of a theme-park figure left 
something to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'These are the biggest shoes I've ever had to fill.' I became 
fascinated with his life. He was a man driven by his passions." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's research blossomed into a theater piece in 1990. Over the next three 
years he performed it in the Venice Sculpture Gardens, the Crystal Theatre in 
Santa Monica, the Itchey Foot restaurant in Los Angeles and the Edinburgh 
Festival in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 The title "Alms for Oblivion" comes from the third act of "Troilus and 
Cressida," in which the great warrior Achilles expresses dismay at the apparent 
indifference and even disdain shown him at the Grecian camp by Agamemnon, 
Nestor, Ajax and the rest of their military retinue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pass'd by me," Achilles tells Ulysses, "as misers do by beggars; neither 
gave to me good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ulysses, who is full of stoic insight, replies in a philosophic speech studded 
with brilliant Shakespearean metaphors about the fickleness of glory, the value 
of perseverance and the shortcomings of human nature: "Time hath, my lord, a 
wallet at his back, wherein he puts alms for oblivion, a great-siz'd monster of 
ingratitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell says he took the phrase for his title even though "it sounds 
highfalutin," because he's "fond of paradox." Besides, he adds, alms for 
oblivion "implies that there is some sort of palliative, some remedy" for 
life's injustices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Shakespeare shows us the heights and depths of existence -- and 
always with empathy and compassion," Bell notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, for the title of the fund-raiser, Daniel Bryan Cartmell chose "the 
lunatic, the lover and the poet" from the famous fifth-act speech by Theseus in 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream":  
</P>
<P>
 Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that 
apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends. The lunatic, the lover and 
the poet Are of imagination all compact.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's an all-encompassing idea, which lets us incorporate a lot of excerpts 
in one evening," says Cartmell, an SOC actor who is staging the show. "We can 
do Kate and Petruchio in a scene from 'The Taming of the Shrew,' for instance, 
and Brutus and Cassius in a scene from 'Julius Caesar.' And we can do 
monologues, each with a particular viewpoint on love, from 'Measure for 
Measure' and 'Macbeth' and 'Othello.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The show, a sort of "greatest hits," will be presented in modern dress with 
minimal scenic design. But it will be more than reader's theater. "We're not 
going to be reciting words from music stands," says Cartmell. "We'll be doing 
prepared material." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening also will feature some improvisatory challenges: Actors will be 
handed non-Shakespearean scripts they've never seen and asked to do unprepared 
scenes. Cartmell says "we want the audience to see how we relate as a company." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Shakespeare and Me: The Lunatic, the Lover and the Poet" will be presented 
June 4 at 8 p.m. at Chapman University's Waltmar Theatre, 301 E. Palm St., 
Orange. $25. "Alms for Oblivion" by Gregory Bell will be presented at the 
Waltmar June 16-26, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 3 p.m. 
$16-$18. (714) 744-7016.

EMMY'S EYE IS ON CBS, WITH 17 DAYTIME AWARDS; TELEVISION: IN THE 21ST ANNUAL 
PRESENTATION, 'SESAME STREET' TAKES 7 HONORS AND WINFREY IS ONCE AGAIN VOTED 
BEST TALK-SHOW HOST.

 Oprah Winfrey had the golden touch at the Daytime Emmy Awards this year, 
winning two of her own and then presenting the award for best drama series to 
ABC's "All My Children." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is getting to be nice," Winfrey said Wednesday night as she accepted her 
fourth consecutive award for outstanding talk-show host. Her popular program 
also was named best talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Soap opera queen Susan Lucci, famous for losing Emmy Awards, played hostess at 
the 21st annual Daytime Emmy Awards, televised on ABC. Lucci, who has played 
Erica Kane on "All My Children" for 23 years, has lost the award 14 times and 
was not nominated this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The best soap opera actress honor went to Hillary B. Smith for her portrayal 
of Nora Gannon on ABC's "One Life to Live." Two of her fellow cast members also 
won: Susan Haskell (who plays Marty Saybrooke) was named best supporting 
actress, and Roger Howarth (Todd Manning) was selected best younger actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zaslow, who plays Roger Thorpe on CBS' "Guiding Light," won as lead 
actor, and Justin Deas, also of "Guiding Light," as best supporting actor for 
his portrayal of Buzz Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC picked up the most awards Wednesday night, but counting the Emmys that had 
been handed out earlier in non-televised ceremonies, CBS was the big winner 
overall, capturing 17 statuettes. PBS was next with 12, followed by ABC and 
syndicated programs with nine each, and NBC with three. Fox, the Disney Channel 
and Nickelodeon got two apiece, and HBO and Lifetime each got one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sesame Street" was named best children's series and also picked up six other 
awards, making it the most-honored program of this year's Emmys. "Guiding 
Light" and CBS' "The Bold and the Beautiful" garnered five each, and "The Oprah 
Winfrey Show" and "One Life to Live" each got four. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners were determined by peer panels of the Academy of Television Arts & 
Sciences and the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. The awards 
were for programs broadcast in the period from Feb. 6, 1993 to Feb. 5, 1994.

IN NEWS RATINGS, 7 IS STILL THE LUCKY NUMBER; TELEVISION: KABC MAINTAINS ITS 
LONGTIME LEAD DESPITE THE LOSS OF ANCHORS MOYER AND MARTIN. WHETHER IT WILL 
NEXT TIME IS OPEN TO QUESTION.

<P>
 When the Lakers lost Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson to retirement, they 
quickly plummeted from champions to also-rans. When KABC-TV Channel 7 lost 
superstar anchors Paul Moyer and Ann Martin to its archrivals, the station's 
news department stayed right where it was before the defections: on top.  
</P>
<P>
 At least for now, according to statistics released Thursday by the A.C. 
Nielsen Co. for the May ratings "sweeps," one of four periods each year that 
help stations set advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But with all the personnel changes going on, both in front of and behind the 
cameras, the local TV news market is in more flux than it has been in years, 
and KABC's longtime No. 1 standing appears shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the 10 p.m. crown, normally claimed by KTLA-TV Channel 5, became an 
actual race this month for the first time in nearly 20 years. KTTV-TV Channel 
11 ran a strong second, benefiting from a new anchor lineup, the lead-ins 
provided by a strong prime-time showing here by Fox and by a sometimes un-newsy 
sweeps approach that featured gimmicks such as a phone poll asking viewers 
whether they wanted the departing Shannen Doherty to stay on "Beverly Hills, 
90210" (they did). KTLA, which with anchor Hal Fishman has virtually owned 10 
p.m. news since the 1970s, still managed to win by about 25,000 households, but 
that was about half the advantage it held a year ago and only about 25% of the 
lead it scored last February. KTLA, which now carries both Dodgers and Angels 
games, said its news ratings were hurt by eight baseball games this month that 
delayed the start of the newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 KTTV's 10 p.m. news numbers grew about 16% over a year ago, with former 
KNBC-TV Channel 4 anchor John Beard headlining the show with co-anchor 
Christine Devine. KCAL-TV Channel 9 was a distant third, about 125,000 homes 
behind the leader, and KCOP-TV Channel 13, which scaled back its newscast to 
half an hour midway through the sweeps month, registered barely a blip on the 
Nielsen radar screen, drawing only 3% of the people watching television at that 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 For the network-owned stations, the revolving free-agent anchors did little to 
change the balance of power, and although several of the races were close, KABC 
found itself in about the same place this month as a year ago, when Martin was 
still its star, and doing even better at the advertising-rich 11 p.m. hour. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC, as usual, headed the early-morning news hour. But KABC triumphed in the 
weekday battles at 4, 5 and 6 p.m. and tied with KNBC at 11 p.m. KCBS, which 
put Martin on the air midway through the month, came in a lackluster third 
across the board, as it has been for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m., KABC used the huge "Oprah Winfrey" lead-in advantage to crush KNBC. 
At 5 p.m., however, KNBC, with Paul Moyer and Colleen Williams, closed the gap 
significantly -- to a deficit of about 10,000 homes, about the same as a year 
ago, when KABC had Martin teamed with Harold Greene. (This month, Susan Campos 
replaced Martin on Channel 7's 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts.) 
</P>
<P>
 The standings were the same at 6 p.m., with KABC leading by about the same 
10,000 homes over KNBC and another 120,000 over KCBS. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 p.m., KABC's Greene and Campos tied with KNBC's Moyer and Kelly Lange. A 
year ago, KABC, with Martin, had trailed the KNBC team by about 125,000 homes. 
So even without Martin (or Moyer, who had left in 1992), KABC's ratings grew 
16% over last May, whereas KNBC dropped about 5%.  
</P>
<P>
 KABC benefited at 11 p.m. with a strong prime-time showing by ABC, which won 
the four-network race nationally -- its first May sweeps victory since 1986. 
ABC averaged a 21% share of the prime-time audience for the month, with CBS 
grabbing 19%, NBC 18% and Fox about 13%. In the Los Angeles market, ABC's 
prime-time lead-in to the 11 p.m. news gave Channel 7 a big advantage, which 
KNBC overcame in pulling into a tie for the entire newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS, though still in third by nearly 150,000 homes, also saw its 11 p.m. 
rating jump a whopping 37% over a year ago, perhaps because of Martin's 
half-month of work there (although the audience for her 5 p.m. newscast was 
down from a year ago). 
</P>
<P>
 In local news, suddenly everything seems up for grabs. Martin's move to KCBS, 
although not immediately detrimental to Channel 7, is likely to have further 
ramifications, many newsroom insiders believe. And they note that many of the 
stations are currently operating without key executives. Channel 4 has a news 
director but no general manager. Channel 7 has a general manager but no news 
director. Channel 11 has several former news directors at other stations on its 
staff but no general manager. Channel 5 has an experienced general manager but 
no news director. When these positions are filled, further changes may be in 
store, perhaps affecting the ratings and the kind of news that local viewers 
will see. 
</P>
<P>
 As for non-news programming, "The Oprah Winfrey Show" at 3 p.m. on KABC is 
still the top-ranked talk show here, although its audience decreased 12% from 
last year. Rookie talk entry "The Ricki Lake Show," airing at 5 p.m. on KCOP, 
continued to impress as the second highest-rated talker in the market.  
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most astounding performance was turned in by KTTV's kids' 
smash "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," which not only demolished "Ricki 
Lake" at 5 p.m. but also beat all three local newscasts and anything else on 
television at that time by more than 175,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In late night, Dave and Jay lost out to Ted Koppel and "Nightline" here on 
KABC. "Late Show" with Letterman came in second on KCBS and "The Tonight Show" 
with Leno third on KNBC. Among the network newscasts, Peter Jennings and ABC 
won easily at 6:30 p.m., with Tom Brokaw and NBC second and the Dan 
Rather-Connie Chung team on CBS a very distant third. None of them was as 
popular as reruns of "Cops" on KTTV, which captured the time period outright. 
</P>
<P>
 KMEX-TV Channel 34 continued to be the No. 1 local Spanish-language station, 
winning both the 6 and 11 p.m. news battle with KVEA-TV Channel 52.

NATURE'S DOOR OPENS; STARTING JUNE 4, PUBLIC MAY TOUR 6,600 ACRES OF 
LONG-CLOSED LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 4-year-old promise was finally fulfilled by Thursday's announcement by 
Irvine Co. officials that a vast swath of land that has been closed to the 
public -- the 6,600-acre southern portion of the Irvine Co. Open Space Reserve 
-- will be opened next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Co., said the open space, which is being 
created in exchange for development rights on adjacent land, will rival the 
greatest urban parks in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the centerpiece of the county, like Central Park is the 
centerpiece of New York," Bren said. "It will be to Orange County what Griffith 
Park is to Los Angeles; a place bringing relaxation and relief from our busy 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible asset that has been blocked by barbed wire for more than a 
century," the chairman said of the parcel, stretching from Coast Highway inland 
through Emerald Canyon to the north and from Laguna Canyon Road to Crystal Cove 
State Park. "We think it is socially and botanically important to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Irvine Co., the county's largest developer, announced in 1990 
that it intended to eventually make the property accessible to the public via 
docent-led tours. However, the opening of the reserve's southern Emerald Canyon 
portion, which was originally scheduled for last October, had to be postponed 
because of the Laguna Beach fire, which destroyed about 80% of it. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the seven months since then, the area has experienced a dramatic 
recovery, experts say. So starting June 4, it was announced Thursday, 
interested members of the public will for the first time be able to hike 
through the area, accompanied by docents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to witness firsthand the recovery from the fire," said Trish 
Smith, a Nature Conservancy biologist overseeing the project. "It really is 
quite remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the company signed an agreement with the Nature Conservancy -- a 
nonprofit conservation organization -- to preserve and protect the natural 
resources of the land while developing a program to provide public access to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement covered three pieces of Irvine Co. land totaling 11,000 acres. 
The pieces aren't contiguous, but all are along Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the program began with the opening of Limestone Canyon to 
docent-led tours. The program is expected to be completed this fall with the 
opening of 2,800 acres in Weir/Gypsum Canyon farther north. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, the southern 6,600 acres in Emerald Canyon are getting the 
attention, especially after the land's impressive recovery from the devastating 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, an advance tour by van of the reserve Thursday revealed the bustling 
of natural life resuming. Where six months ago the landscape looked black and 
barren, it now provides nourishment for fields of purple wild hyacinths, red 
Indian paintbrushes and yellow California sunflowers. And a land not too long 
ago seemingly devoid of life now supports red-tailed hawks, meadowlarks, 
bobcats and mule deer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Smith, strenuous five-hour hiking tours led by Nature Conservancy 
volunteers will be available on the first and third Saturday mornings and 
afternoons of each month beginning June 4. In addition, she said, 13-mile 
mountain cycling tours and 10-mile equestrian tours will be offered twice 
monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 To make reservations for tours, Smith said, interested individuals should call 
(714) 832-7478. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of what the hikers will see was evident during the caravan tour attended 
by officials of both the Irvine Co. and the Nature Conservancy, as well a 
handful of journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be here and think that you're the only person in the world," said 
Monica Floria, one of the company's senior vice presidents, gazing wistfully at 
the green and brown hills rolling gently into the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 A later stop at a trickling waterfall tumbling some 15 feet down the face of a 
rock by the side of the road elicited some excited responses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great experience coming out here," Smith said. "People are always 
amazed at the vastness of the open space." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused before continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I come here I experience something totally different," the 
biologist mused. "That's what keeps me excited; there's a surprise around every 
corner."

DANA PARSONS: LOITERING AT LIBRARY CAN MEAN TICKET TO ENRICHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mindful that the county's libraries are feeling the budget squeeze, I browsed 
one for three hours just to get that buzz from books. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's some stuff I know now that I didn't know before I went to the library: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ernest Lawrence Thayer, the author of "Casey at the Bat," never understood 
the poem's popularity. He refused to take any royalties from it, saying at one 
point: "All I ask is never to be reminded of it again." The poem, an American 
classic about the Mudville 9, was first published in 1888 in the San Francisco 
Examiner among a group of editorials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before he invented the steamboat and made "Fulton's Folly" part of American 
lore, Robert Fulton tried to interest both France and Britain, which were 
warring with one another, in submarines. Napoleon considered but eventually 
rejected Fulton's offer. The British weren't interested either. 
</P>
<P>
 * Umbrellas probably originated in Egypt. Their design may have been used to 
symbolize the heavenly status of the royalty who used them rather than to 
protect them from the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most of the money that Albert Schweitzer used to set up his African hospital 
in 1913 came from royalties he received from a book he wrote on composer Johann 
Sebastian Bach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stung by criticism that he had never personally arrested anyone, FBI 
Director J. Edgar Hoover took Alvin Karpis, Public Enemy No. 1, into custody in 
1936. The arrest was made on Canal Street in New Orleans, and Hoover allegedly 
said "Put the cuffs on him, boys." However, no one had remembered to bring any 
handcuffs, so Karpis' hands were tied behind his back with an agent's necktie. 
</P>
<P>
 * Herman Melville moved in 1850 to rural Massachusetts, where he began working 
on "Moby Dick." At the same time and living just six miles away, Nathaniel 
Hawthorne was writing "The House of the Seven Gables." 
</P>
<P>
 * In ancient times, pigeons were used to deliver messages about troop 
movements. Julius Caesar used them in many of his campaigns. Domesticated 
pigeons have been dated to at least 3000 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many Roman Catholics were among the throngs of Germans and Italians who 
emigrated to America in the 1800s. When they began building Catholic churches 
and convents, it frightened many Protestants, who believed the Pope was trying 
to expand the church's empire. Many wondered openly why Catholics were joining 
police departments and the military and storing weapons if they weren't 
planning a day of reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Noah planted the first vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 * After the notorious Billy the Kid was captured, a local reporter said to 
him, "You appear to take it easy." To which the Kid replied: "What's the use of 
looking on the gloomy side of everything? The laugh's on me this time." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fashion designer Oleg Cassini had to convince President Kennedy that it 
would be OK for Jackie to wear a Cassini-designed evening dress that exposed 
one of her shoulders. Family patriarch Joseph Kennedy once told Cassini not to 
bother the President or First Lady with the bill for his services, saying "I'll 
take care of it." Cassini wrote that the elder Kennedy "asked me to be discreet 
about the cost of the operation, as it might be used politically against the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 * Researchers aren't absolutely positive about the origin of Dalmatians. 
However, one authoritative expert on dogs says they came from Dalmatia, a 
region in the former Yugoslavia. Over the centuries, Dalmatians have served as 
sentinels, sheep dogs and bird dogs, as well as in packs for boar and deer 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mongol armies, such as those under Genghis Khan, are characterized as wild 
hordes but were models of discipline and skill. They liked to operate in winter 
so they could use frozen marshes and ice-covered rivers for troop movement. One 
trick was to use local townspeople to test the strength of the ice, using such 
ploys as placing a herd of cattle across a frozen river from hungry citizens. 
Mongols also used smoke screens as a battlefield tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leonardo da Vinci was more than a painter. He was among the first to draw 
the human skeletal structure and probably made the first accurate drawing of 
the skull, jaw and teeth. He also described how the upper and lower teeth work 
together.

CONROY CRITIC MAKES POINT WITH PAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people grumble at their local legislator in a letter. Others pick up the 
phone to gripe. 
</P>
<P>
 But a disgruntled constituent of Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) has 
skipped the usual routes and spray painted an opinion on the doors of the 
lawmaker's district office. 
</P>
<P>
 The message was the work of a tagger with a sense of the sardonic. The object 
of scorn was a bill Conroy introduced this week calling for paddlings of 
juveniles caught scrawling graffiti. That proposal has earned Conroy nationwide 
media attention and prompted public reaction ranging from hearty applause to 
outright ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 His most pointed critic was right back home in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's staff arrived Thursday morning at the district office in Orange to 
discover the words "Spank Me" scrawled on both office doors by the taunting 
tagger. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called in and promised a full investigation, but no suspects have 
been apprehended. Conroy was less than amused but didn't miss the opportunity 
to give his bill a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disgusting," he said in a news release distributed within hours of the 
discovery. "However, if the punks who did this think that this is going to stop 
me from passing my paddle law, they've got another thing coming. . . . If these 
criminals want a fight, I'll give 'em one." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy wouldn't hazard a guess who might have been behind the vandalism. Local 
youths? Disgruntled Orange County Democrats? "I don't have any idea," he said 
Thursday. "I'm surprised it took them this long. We've been expecting it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy was happy that "at least they're aware of what I'm trying to do," but 
he lamented that the episode demonstrates once again "just what the attitude of 
people is today. That's why we need a little public humiliation like that 
proposed in my bill." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which faces stiff opposition in the Democrat-dominated state 
Legislature, calls for juveniles convicted of defacing or destroying property 
with graffiti to be punished by being struck as many as 10 times with a wooden 
paddle wielded in court by a parent or a bailiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's office is tucked in the back of a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owner of the complex is not happy," said Ann Conroy, the assemblyman's 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was not surprised by the graffiti message. Indeed, she said, "I would 
think it would be a natural reaction (to her husband's proposal). It is 
targeted toward vandals and I would think they would try to retaliate." 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti, she said, is common in the area. The mall and a business complex 
behind it have been constantly defaced by vandals, which is one of the reasons 
her husband's bill has received an "overwhelmingly positive response" among his 
constituents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Except one with a spray can.

ELECTRICAL CAUSE IS RULED OUT IN SEAL BEACH PIER BLAZE; INQUIRY: INVESTIGATORS 
SWITCH FOCUS TO POSSIBLE 'INCENDIARY SOURCE.' THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IT WAS 
INTENTIONALLY SET, CITY MANAGER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A malfunctioning electrical system has been ruled out as the cause of 
Saturday's fire at the Seal Beach Pier, and officials are now investigating 
whether an "incendiary source" brought onto the boardwalk sparked the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said Thursday that fire investigators have not 
identified the source of the fire and are still looking for clues. He stressed 
there is no evidence that the fire was intentionally set. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators and fire engineers believe that the heat source somehow ignited 
a plastic gas line that runs beneath the old wooden pier from its base to the 
Ruby's restaurant at the end of the structure, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising turn in the fire investigation contrasts with preliminary 
reports from officials that pointed to the pier's electrical system as playing 
a role in the blaze that temporarily stranded people on the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 But an extensive examination of the system by both fire investigators and 
three electrical engineers found that it did not cause the blaze. Officials 
said that the high-voltage conduit that runs the length of the pier was burned 
on the outside but not on the inside, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another indication that the electrical system did not malfunction came from 
computer records from Ruby's restaurant, which showed that the establishment's 
cash registers, clocks and kitchen equipment continued to receive power at 
least 10 minutes after the fire was reported, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an opportunity to put together time sequences," he said. Ruby's "still 
had electricity 10 to 13 minutes after the first calls were made to Fire 
Department dispatch." 
</P>
<P>
 To get a better look at the area of the fire, portions of the pier's wood deck 
were pulled up, labeled and reconstructed. Investigators found no junction 
boxes and detected no evidence of spliced electrical lines in the area of the 
fire, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saturday blaze temporarily stranded more than 100 people at the end of the 
boardwalk but injured no one. Witnesses reported hearing several small 
explosions just before the fire, possibly arcs of electricity. Bankston said 
the arcs could have occurred when the fire burned electrical lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors have also circulated in the city about someone operating a barbecue at 
the pier around the time of the blaze. Officials said they don't know whether 
that report is true but added they would welcome any solid information that the 
public can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston said investigators are still working to identify the fire source and 
determine if -- and how -- it was able to ignite the gas line. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into a 1992 pier fire did not find a conclusive cause. But it 
did indicate that the electrical lines and gas lines did play a role in the 
blaze.

PRIVATE FIRM MAKES BID FOR WATER DISTRICT; UTILITIES: SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN 
WATER WORKS CO. WOULD PAY MORE THAN $300 MILLION FOR THE BELEAGUERED SANTA 
MARGARITA AGENCY AND ASSUME ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise announcement, a large private water company said Thursday it has 
offered to buy the troubled Santa Margarita Water District for a price "in 
excess of $300 million" if it can win the approval of the state's Public 
Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The California-American Water Co. of Chula Vista, a subsidiary of New 
Jersey-based American Water Works Co., the largest investor-owned water utility 
in the country, said it would also assume all of the district's estimated $370 
million in outstanding debt. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposed deal is worked out, the company would provide -- without any 
rate increases for three years -- the same water and sewer services offered by 
the scandal-plagued South County district, which serves Rancho Santa Margarita, 
Coto de Caza, small parts of San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente, and the 
40,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came only one day after the Orange County Grand Jury 
recommended that the district be consolidated with four other county water 
agencies and three months after its former two top managers were indicted on 
criminal conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other top district officials remain under investigation by the Orange 
County district attorney's office for failing to report gifts from contractors 
in excess of state limits and then continuing to influence decisions that 
benefited the gift-giving firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal ultimately led to the election of an entirely new five-member 
board, which in April fired its longtime general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Jones, the president of California-American Water Co., said he was aware 
of the grand jury report and the scandal that has embroiled the district for 17 
months but pressed forward because of Santa Margarita's long-term potential. 
The district now serves a population of about 80,000 residents but is located 
in one of the county's fastest-growing areas, which is expected to soon be home 
to 180,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obviously aware that these things had occurred, but it doesn't have 
any impact on us," Jones said. "We certainly have an interest in such a growing 
area. . . . We think we have something to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Nancy Rollins, a company spokeswoman, said their representatives 
have not talked to any of the five district board members but have discussed 
the offer with John J. Schatz, the general manager, and officials at the Santa 
Margarita Co., the large South County developer that is building Rancho Santa 
Margarita and has major long-range plans to expand in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving forward with the premise that Mr. Schatz would take this offer 
to the board and, hopefully, we would be able to meet with them soon," Rollins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, however, Schatz said the district has not been 
provided a copy of the proposal, nor has it been "contacted by the company to 
provide any information or input." 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the recent elections of the new . . . board of directors (and) the 
hiring of a new general manager . . . it seems premature to look at the issue," 
Schatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the announcement caught district board members and other water 
industry officials by surprise, at least one director said he would welcome any 
proposals of help. No purchase could go forward without board approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just caught wind of this yesterday -- that something was going on," said 
Director Bob Lay of Mission Viejo, who added that he was sure none of the other 
members of the board were any better informed. "I think it's an interesting 
idea. I'm a believer that if privatization can make this more efficient, let's 
talk about it. However, this is very preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
 Lay described the district as financially troubled because of decisions made 
by the previous board. But he said the district was battling back and would be 
able to make a large June 30 bond payment -- estimated to be $21 million -- 
that some insiders had doubted could be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the directors were seriously considering some tax increases to 
help pull the agency out of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are definitely some challenges for us . . . but I would not consider we 
are anywhere near a crisis," Lay said. "All this can be worked out . . . but it 
would have been a lot easier if our predecessors had been paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 John V. Foley, general manager of the neighboring Moulton Niguel Water 
District and chairman of the board of directors of the powerful Metropolitan 
Water District of Southern California, said he heard about the offer Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a windfall for the residents," Foley said. "The district was 
apparently planning to raise the tax rates to buy down that debt. . . . The key 
here is if they have enough cash to pay down the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The danger would be if the company came in and bled the district's assets "and 
then ran," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 years ago, the public El Toro Water District purchased the Rossmoor 
water and sewer districts in what is now Leisure World, but Foley said he had 
never heard of a private company buying a public water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase would have to be approved by the county's Local Agency Formation 
Commission and the Public Utilities Commission. A PUC spokeswoman said these 
purchases "happen all the time." 
</P>

 Rollins said her company had never before purchased a public water agency in 
California. The company arrived in California in 1966 by purchasing the private

"all of the Monterey Peninsula."

 Jones said his company is financially sound and "has been doing its own work

company would use its own assets and "use cash that's available in the (Santa

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; COUNCIL VOTES TO CUT BASIC CABLE RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The basic cable television rate will decrease slightly for about 8,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved action that reduces Copley Colony's 
basic cable rate by 72 cents a month, from $11.94 to $11.22.It will go into 
effect no later than June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 A Copley Colony representative who spoke at Monday's council meeting said the 
company does not object to the council action. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's move came under federal legislation that once again allows 
cities to regulate basic cable rates under their jurisdictions. Congress 
previously had deregulated cable companies, but it restored local governmental 
authority in 1992 after numerous protests around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our federal government saw fit to deregulate cable, but it wasn't long before 
they changed to regulate it again," Mayor Richard Partin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council reasserted its control over basic cable rates by hiring 
professional consultants to study Copley Colony's fees. The consultants, who 
used Federal Communications Commission guidelines on cable rates, reported 
Monday night that they found Copley Colony "was overcharging on its basic rates 
by 72 cents but undercharging on remote controls and converter boxes by 2 cents 
and 10 cents respectively." 
</P>
<P>
 The rate rollback would be retroactive to last September and Copley Colony is 
required to provide refunds within 30 days. The individual refund will be about 
$6 but will vary because Copley Colony can deduct its 12-cent undercharge for 
equipment for the months included in the refund period. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants said Copley Colony has 7,956 subscribers in the city. BILL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; ART COMES WITH BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of students swayed to guitar music, watched dancers and strolled past 
dozens of drawings, paintings and other artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtyard at Santa Ana High School was transformed into a lunchtime 
carnival Wednesday for the third annual "Arts on the Lawn" party.The festival 
was designed to recognize student performers and artists, as well as interest 
students in classes about dance, drawing, photography and other disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a way for them to expand their awareness of all the different 
kinds of ways there are to express themselves," art teacher Pat Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives them a good chance to get involved, and I think everyone in the 
school is very enthusiastic about the arts programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a better understanding of what art is," said Alicia Cerranza, 15. 
"And I think its very important because these kids don't always get recognized 
by other students. This shows us what they've been doing with their hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the four-hour event, students performed for their peers, singing, 
dancing, drawing sketches and demonstrating how to make colorful acrylic masks. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Several youngsters stopped to watch Javier Carlos, 18, as he sketched a flower 
in colored chalk.  
</P>
<P>
 Carlos smiled at the attention. "I've gotten lots of compliments," he said 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (festival) is a good idea," he said. "It takes away a lot of the bad 
reputation that Santa Ana has. It lets people know there are still some people 
who do art work, who are still creative." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, he added, "It's a pretty good time."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; LAW TO BAR UNWANTED SOLICITORS AT HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hucksters, beware. Villa Park is taking aim at unwanted, door-to-door 
solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a flurry of complaints, the City Council Tuesday night gave 
preliminary approval to an ordinance that will allow residents to post "no 
solicitor" signs that are legally enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, a person who tries to sell anything at a home where the 
signs are posted could be arrested on misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the first reading of the proposed new law, 
clearly indicating that it will approve final passage at next month's meeting. 
The new ordinance would become effective in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new city law says that no solicitors "shall enter upon private 
property where a sign prohibiting solicitation has been posted." It would ban 
"soliciting orders for the sale or lease of goods, wares, merchandise and 
services," as well as advertising or canvassing for that purpose. Seeking 
contributions for charities or religious groups would also be prohibited at 
such homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some on the council chuckled aloud when City Atty. Leonard Hampel told them 
that the "no solicitors" warning could include unwanted visits by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law would allow residents to register at City Hall, listing their 
homes as off limits to door-to-door solicitors. The names and addresses on the 
no-solicitors-wanted register would then be given to each person or company 
asking for a solicitation permit, City Manager Fred Maley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park already has a law requiring solicitors to register, but some on the 
council said it is usually ignored. Councilman John Frackelton said his home 
had recently been visited by a roofing saleswoman who had no solicitation 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they (solicitors) don't have a license, people can call the sheriff's 
office," Maley said. "They can be charged with trespass." BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SOCCER MURAL TO BE UNVEILED ON SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A huge mural to commemorate the World Cup soccer tournament will be unveiled 
Sunday in a San Juan Capistrano studio. 
</P>
<P>
 For two months, a local artist best known for his Chicano art has worked seven 
days a week, along with an Italian protege, to complete the 50-foot-high 
mural-banner. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-color painting is scheduled to be hung at the Los Angeles International 
Airport early next week. Four other murals will be hung along various freeways 
before a series of World Cup games is played this summer at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Solo Unido Un Mundo Vancera (Only United Will One World Be 
Victorious)," the mural will hang at the airport for about 4 1/2 years, 
according to its creator, Laguna Hills resident Willie Herron. The mural 
expresses Herron's greatest hope, "that one day we can be a victorious world if 
all the races unite." 
</P>
<P>
 The mural is an image of athletes helping one another to reach for a globe and 
a World Cup trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The public reception will be held from 2 to 6 p.m. Sunday at the studio, 31050 
Camino Capistrano. Also, anyone can drop by Friday or Saturday for a glance of 
the mural, Herron said. ANDREW LePAGE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; DRAINAGE SYSTEM WILL BE INSPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Councilman Bob Patchin groused that little, non-industrial Villa Park 
is an unlikely site for pollution spills, the city is nonetheless obeying a 
federal law requiring drainage-system inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday night approved a contract that calls for 
inspection of all underground, city-owned drainage facilities.The contract, 
which is not to exceed $10,000, is with Orange County government. City Manager 
Fred W. Maley told the council that county government is the only available 
agency to perform the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of the national policy for discharge elimination systems," City 
Engineer Arnt G. Quist told the council. Quist noted that federal law requires 
inspection of underground drainage systems to prevent pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin said the federal law is really aimed at big, industrial polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're (federal officials) really looking for industrial waste," Patchin 
said. He added that Villa Park has no industries that might cause drainage 
pollution.  
</P>
<P>
 Patchin said the federal law's application to a small, residential community 
such as Villa Park is "sort of ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Quist responded that the federally required inspection actually serves a 
good purpose for Villa Park. "They (the county inspectors) are going to locate 
any problems we have with our storm drains," he said. "They'll locate potential 
problems we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Quist also assured the council that Villa Park will not get a bum rap for 
possible drainage pollution that originates in nearby cities. Quist said the 
drainage inspectors will carefully follow maps, making sure that only Villa 
Park's drainage is accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, including Patchin, ultimately gave unanimous approval to the 
inspection contract. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TEMPORARY RAMPS TO OPEN AT GRAND AVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some good news for residents and commuters in Santa Ana: Temporary ramps are 
scheduled to open today to allow motorists to exit and enter the southbound 
Santa Ana Freeway at Grand Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Access to busy Grand Avenue has been disrupted since the southbound off-ramp 
closed in December, Caltrans spokeswoman Maureena Duran-Rojas said.The ramp to 
get on the southbound Santa Ana Freeway from Grand Avenue closed in March, 
Duran-Rojas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ramps will remain open until construction of the permanent ramps 
is finished in late 1995, Duran-Rojas said. Both temporary ramps are scheduled 
to open this morning, but perhaps not in time for the morning rush hour, 
Duran-Rojas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The northbound on-ramp at Grand Avenue is now open only to drivers heading 
north on the street. The ramp to Grand Avenue from the northbound Santa Ana 
Freeway is still closed, though it may open this summer, according to Caltrans.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; COUNCIL OPPOSES BILL ON AMBULANCE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council opposes proposed state legislation that would strip cities of 
the right to regulate ambulances used for emergency medical service. 
</P>
<P>
 A pending bill in the state Legislature in Sacramento would give counties sole 
control of such operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, Assembly Bill 3156, introduced by Assemblyman Curtis Tucker 
(D-Inglewood), would make each county's Board of Supervisors "the sole public 
entity to authorize the implementation, and control the operation of, the 
system for the provision of emergency ambulance services in the incorporated 
and unincorporated areas of the county," according to a city staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report to the council said the bill "will preempt the ability of a city or 
district to choose how Emergency Medical Services System (EMS) transportation 
services shall be structured and financed within the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, cities are free to provide such services, contract with a private 
company or establish a shared public/private partnership, the memo said, adding 
that if the bill passes, "these choices will be available to a city or district 
only insofar as they are allowed by the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The California League of Cities and the California Fire Chiefs' Assn. are 
among state organizations that have also announced opposition to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress City Council unanimously voted to add its name to the list of 
opponents of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's resolution said, "Local government, including the City of 
Cypress, must maintain the right to assess how best to provide those services 
based on local needs and opportunities." BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; RAILROAD UNDERPASS CONTRACT AWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has awarded a contract to an Irvine firm to prepare plans for 
constructing a railroad underpass on Dale Street and aligning the street with 
Burlingame Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city on Monday gave the nearly $590,000 contract to H.D.R. Engineering 
Inc., one of eight firms that submitted proposals for the $9.6-million 
project.The money will come from county Measure M funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Donald K. Jensen, director of public works, said the firm is "highly preferred 
by the railroad and the staff" and has done other railroad grade separation 
projects well. 
</P>
<P>
 The realignment of Dale Street to Burlingame Avenue, a residential street that 
leads to homes in the Bellehurst neighborhood, was opposed by residents. 
Despite the protest, the City Council in January approved the Dale Street 
realignment and the rebuilding of the underpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Tuthill, deputy director of public works, said construction is planned 
to begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for the project will come from state, county and local sources, 
including $5 million from the state Public Utilities Commission, which approved 
construction and funding of the railroad underpass in March, Tuthill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. will contribute $870,000. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; U.S. MAY BE BILLED FOR NIXON FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city was happy to take center stage to hold the funeral of former 
President Nixon last month. But now that city officials are facing a $98,000 
tab for police, public works and personnel costs, they are hoping the federal 
government will pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager David A. Gurchow said the thought occurred to him 
several weeks ago as he was mulling the city's bills, and he asked Rep. Jay C. 
Kim (R-Diamond Bar) look into making a formal request for payment on behalf of 
the city -- home to the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistant city manager's efforts to divert the costs to Washington aren't 
siting well with some. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if we take the pride in having the Nixon Library & Birthplace 
here in Yorba Linda, we also take the responsibility," said Mayor Barbara 
Kiley, who wrote a poem mourning Nixon's passing in the days after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are also the ones who are going to reap the sales tax revenue, and we 
have," she said. "This was a national event. It was an honor. I was proud. I 
still am, and I knew there was a price tag. I anticipated a price. Anyone who 
didn't was overwhelmed by the glitz." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley said the City Council plans to take up the subject at its June 7 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of cost never came up when the city -- which employs only 84 
full-time staff members -- learned that Nixon's funeral would be held not in 
Washington but on the patch of land where he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurchow said he now feels he would be remiss in not seeking some relief for 
city taxpayers. The city is more than willing to bear the day-to-day costs of 
the library, including police protection for high-ranking visitors, but Gurchow 
said a state funeral is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death of a President of the United States is an extraordinary expense, an 
extraordinary event. If there's funding available, I think we owe it to the 
citizens of Yorba Linda to ask for it," he said. "If it's not there, it's not. 
But I think we make a valid case." 
</P>
<P>
 The city bore the costs of Pat Nixon's funeral, including security, and bore 
similar costs whenever Nixon came to visit.  
</P>
<P>
 "Having the library in Yorba Linda does impose an obligation on us, and I 
think we fulfill that obligation very well," Gurchow said. "We're proud to have 
the library here and we're proud to have Richard Nixon as our native son. I 
don't think seeking reimbursement diminishes that." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's trash collection and street sweeping services volunteered to clean 
up for nothing, and local businesses donated food for the hundreds of police 
officers who directed traffic and kept streets calm during the week of the 
funeral. The Ralphs grocery chain donated 600 pounds of macaroni salad, Gurchow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yorba Linda incurred plenty of costs: The city, which contracts with the 
Brea Police Department, spent $30,500 on police wages and another $21,700 on 
police overtime; $18,700 in other personnel costs; $26,700 in public works 
costs for workers to erect and pick up street barriers, cones and barricades 
that diverted traffic from the library; and $323 on food, Gurchow said. 
</P>
<P>
 All but $48,000 are costs that the city would have borne anyway, for daily 
services, but Gurchow said he's seeking to recoup the entire $98,235.87 from 
the federal government because all of the money was spent on funeral expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days surrounding the April 27 funeral, tens of thousands of visitors 
flocked to Yorba Linda, and the ceremony was attended by all living Presidents 
and dozens of other national figures and foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John M. Gullixson said he talked to local merchants and knows sales 
were way up during the period surrounding the funeral. But he argues that the 
federal government actually saved money when it was spared the obligation of 
hosting the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that basically we could have seen Mr. Nixon lying in state in the 
(Capitol) rotunda, and there could have been even more expense than was 
incurred here. In some sense, there was a savings, and if the members of 
Congress are beneficent enough to help us out here, that would be great with 
us," he said. "Kim has picked up the gauntlet, and I'm sure (Rep. Ed) Royce is 
going to help us." LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CANDIDATES DIG DEEP INTO OWN POCKETS 
</P>

<P>
 If money were the deciding factor in the tight race to succeed retiring county 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson would lead the 
crowded field because of her own deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson, however, is not the only candidate in the June 7 primary who has 
relied on personal finances to become a serious contender for public office, 
according to campaign finance reports filed Thursday with the registrar of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 70th Assembly District race, Republican businesswoman Marilyn C. Brewer 
has received $187,500 in loans -- $180,000 from her personal and business 
accounts and $7,500 from the Santa Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those filing reports Thursday was Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron, who faces opposition for the first time in 24 years. Citron 
received $32,198 this reporting period, some $6,000 of which came from 
brokerage firms and banks which do business with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said the money has been needed to defend a challenge from Costa Mesa 
accountant John M.W. Moorlach, who has been critical of Citron's aggressive 
investment strategies. Moorlach's report was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent said he saw no conflict in accepting funds from those who do 
business with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have offered to lend a hand," Citron said. "I needed it, and I'm 
not embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with the $217,000 Tillotson had previously lent her supervisorial 
campaign, she recently enriched her bid for the seat with another $95,000 for 
the final stretch leading to the primary, according to a statement filed with 
the county. The full campaign finance report was not filed Thursday and 
unavailable for review. Candidates were allowed to send their reports by 
overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three major front runners in the county race, Huntington Beach 
Councilman Jim Silva is the most cash poor. His finance statement for the 
reporting period that ended Saturday showed that after raising $60,761, his 
cash has dwindled to $5,142. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Silva's list of contributors on the latest report were executives of the 
Koll Co., which has become the center of controversy in Huntington Beach 
because of its proposal to develop a portion of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. The 
corporate officers donated $2,625. 
</P>
<P>
 Another front-runner, Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, has 
$25,804 cash on hand after having raised $70,738 for her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her contributors were Democratic organizations and women's groups, 
including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the bipartisan 
Women in Leadership, which each gave $1,000. Pro-choice Orange County and the 
National Women's Political Caucus gave a total of $800. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach businessman John A. Thomas recently has become a contender in 
the five-way race by relying on his own finances. Of the $50,163 he has 
reported in contributions, all but $1,500 came in the form of personal loans he 
made to his campaign and a $200 donation by his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth candidate, Raymond Thomas Littrell, a former Garden Grove 
councilman, has raised $4,874 and had $141 cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 70th Assembly District, Thomas G. Reinecke also has relied heavily on 
loans, with most of it coming from outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $142,500 received in loans so far, Reinecke lent his own campaign 
$12,500; Madeline Weyrick of Malibu loaned $100,000; Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach), who has chosen Reinecke as his successor, loaned $20,000; 
and Reinecke's mother, Jean, loaned $10,000 to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The third Republican candidate in that race, Irvine Councilman Barry J. 
Hammond, reported cash on hand of $9,581. His largest single campaign 
contribution totaled $7,500 from the Allied Business PAC. GEBE MARTINEZ and

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OSHA CHIEF DETAILS PLANS TO GET TOUGHER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal penalties against employers who purposely endanger the health of 
workers are grossly inadequate, the U.S. assistant secretary of labor for 
occupational health and safety said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some folks are genuinely offended that it is a more serious federal offense 
to harass a wild burro on federal land than it is to kill or seriously injure a 
worker through willful neglect of safety and health," said Joseph A. Dear, 
eliciting applause from those attending the annual meeting of the American 
Industrial Hygiene Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the group at the Anaheim Convention Center, Dear, who took the helm 
of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration last year, described his 
plans to strengthen environmental standards and reform the federal agency 
designated to protect the health and safety of American workers.  
</P>
<P>
 Noting that OSHA and its state counterparts have a combined 2,100 compliance 
officers to monitor 6 million workplaces in the nation, he said, "This gap 
between mission and resources is the principal drive behind the necessity to 
reinvent OSHA." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear said that under his direction OSHA is reviewing all segments of industry 
to target enforcement efforts at work sites that pose the most hazards. "Let's 
pick out the worst actors," he said. LESLIE BERKMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; ELECTION DEBATE RAGES ON RECALL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joetta Simmons has decided how she will vote in the June 7 election: "Yes" for 
the recall of four Fullerton officials. Barbara Johnson, has decided to cast 
"no" votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The two residents reached those decisions after attending a debate Wednesday 
night at Troy High School, where two opponents and two proponents debated the 
recall effort against Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, City Clerk Anne M. York and 
council members Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead. The recall effort began last 
July when the City Council voted 3-2 in favor of an 2% utility tax, despite 
objections from hundreds of residents. Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead voted 
for the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 York became a recall target because she delayed the process: She rejected 
recall petitions against council members, saying that the notices exceeded the 
200-word legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 residents attended the League of Women Voters-sponsored debate.  
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Recalls Committee co-chairman Thomas Babcock and treasurer Bruce 
Whittaker contended that the city's leadership has not been representing its 
constituents. They charged that residents were ignored when they voiced their 
opposition to the utility tax and demanded that the council place a referendum 
on last November's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends, this is all we asked," Babcock said. "We were willing to be bound 
by the vote. . . . The recall election is the referendum that Molly, Don and 
Buck refused the citizens of Fullerton last November." 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan and former mayor Richard Ackerman, who presented the opposing view, 
said the council does represent the people and that controversial decisions 
never sparked a recall effort in the city's history before the utility tax 
vote. They said placing it on the ballot would have been too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referendum would have cost $33,000 and we were watching every nickel," 
McClanahan said. Prior to the debate, a county official announced that if the 
recall is successful and voters decide to hold a special election to replace 
the three council members, the cost to the city could climb to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman said the recall effort was not necessary. "You elect people who are 
supposed to do your will. No one's going to agree with you on all issues. 
That's why we have an election every four years." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate will be aired on the local Cable Television channel next Thursday 
at 5:30 p.m. and next Friday at 6 p.m. Residents also may watch a live debate 
at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Sunny Hills High School. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; TENANTS FACE OUSTER AS CITY CUTS UTILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 tenants are facing eviction from a low-rent motel where water and 
electricity were shut off by the city this week after the landlord failed to 
pay his utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Power and water to the Razzmatazz Motel, 823 S. Beach Blvd., were cut off 
about 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, city officials said. Under county health codes, a 
motel without water service is considered unsanitary and its residents must be 
moved out. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials would not say how much landlord Daud Alani owes the city. Alani was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landlord had final notices. We try to work with our customers and give 
them every opportunity to pay their bills," said Suzie Brown, a spokeswoman for 
the Anaheim Public Utilities Department, which supplies both water and power to 
city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the 50 remaining motel tenants, many of whom receive welfare 
benefits, were upset by the city's action. Tenants reported being in need of 
food and water and said they were trying to cope with the outage as best they 
could. 
</P>
<P>
 "They caused the unsanitary conditions, then they came here to kick everyone 
out," said tenant Larry McKee, 40, who until April ran a dinner theater next 
door to the motel. "This is a real disservice to these people. They are caught 
in the middle."  
</P>
<P>
 McKee said tenants asked the city to restore power until June 1, when many 
tenants will receive their welfare checks and can afford to move. But city 
officials said they made their decision based solely on the landlord's failure 
to pay and had no choice but to eliminate power and water service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unfortunate situation," Brown said. "We can't legally subsidize 
anyone using other ratepayers' money. It would be considered a gift of public 
funds." Officials had been negotiating with Alani for several months, but were 
unable to get him to pay, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's action marked the second time in 10 days that water and power were 
cut off at the motel. The city cut off service May 17, but a tenant illegally 
restored power. The city allowed it to remain on after officials discovered 
that a woman living there was dependent on an electrically powered oxygen tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old woman, a diabetic, was relocated to another Anaheim hotel 
Tuesday, Brown said. MARTIN MILLER

CITY TO PAY MORE FOR POLICE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cost of policing has gone up in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved a $29,552 increase for next fiscal 
year in its contract with the Sheriff's Department.The current year's bill from 
the county was $491,894; in the budget year that starts July 1, the cost goes 
up to $521,446. 
</P>
<P>
 The price hike does not give added service to the city, City Manager Fred W. 
Maley told the council Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff's Capt. Bill Miller said the increase to Villa Park does provide 
for an improved police communications system. Miller acknowledged, however, 
that much of the increased cost results from rising personnel expenses. "We've 
experienced some increases in costs that are significant . . . particularly in 
the areas of retirement and medical benefits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also said that Villa Park got off cheap for the 1993-94 fiscal year. 
"You were undercharged last (fiscal) year," Miller told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members questioned Miller about specifics of the increased 
costs, but none criticized the proposal. Mayor Barry L. Denes concluded the 
council's discussion by saying Villa Park gets a bargain in its contract with 
the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the service we get," Denes said. "It's just terrific."

BROWN TAKES HER CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR TO LITTLE SAIGON; POLITICS: SAYING SHE 
WELCOMES 'THE DIVERSITY THAT IS CALIFORNIA,' SHE BECOMES FIRST SUCH CANDIDATE 
TO VISIT AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Drawing on her family's own immigrant background, Kathleen Brown spoke to an 
intimate crowd of Vietnamese Americans in Little Saigon on Thursday, becoming 
the first gubernatorial candidate ever to campaign here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcome the diversity that is California to my table as I launch my 
campaign for governor of California," Brown told the small group, promising to 
"reinvent the California Dream" if she wins her bid for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinh Kim Le, president of the Vietnamese American Democratic League, which 
sponsored the event, said, "This is a first ever, so we are very honored to 
welcome a gubernatorial candidate. Pete Wilson never came here. Personally, I 
am very moved, because she is a front-runner. We want to show her our 
hospitality." 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 people attended the brief event, hosted in a second-floor storefront 
of a Little Saigon strip mall decorated with red, white and blue balloons.  
</P>
<P>
 Calling California "a place where dreams were born and dreams realized," Brown 
recounted her great-grandfather's journey from Germany to dig for gold in the 
hills of Northern California, and her other great-grandfather's flight from the 
famines of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "California opened up its arms, opened up its state and welcomed people from 
all over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief question-and-answer session, Brown also ran down her main campaign 
promises, spelling out a commitment to create 1 million jobs and emphasize 
technology, trade and global competition in a new economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people in the audience pressed her on her stance on immigration, 
saying many legal residents in the Vietnamese community are fearful that the 
anti-immigrant climate in California could lead to the whittling away of their 
access to welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown derided "immigrant bashing" and said she opposed denying education to 
children of illegal immigrants or blocking access to emergency health care. But 
she stressed that she believed illegal immigrants should not receive welfare or 
"long-term health care." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very bright, very close to people," Hoan Nguyen of Fountain Valley said 
after the event, praising Brown's demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the audience, however, found Brown short on specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very general about her answers," said Hong Tram Pham, who works with 
Vietnamese Community of Orange County, Inc. "She talked about her master plan 
for education, but what is her master plan? She was very polished, but that's a 
politician." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said Brown's visit nevertheless was significant for her community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe for the first time, the mainstream is starting to recognize the 
Vietnamese community, not only economically, but as a strong voice in the 
political process. That's important," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very smart move on her part," added Arthur Nakazato, president 
of the Orange County Asian-American Bar Assn. "Orange County has 2.5 million 
people and 250,000 are Asian . . . Evidently Kathleen Brown has realized that, 
and I commend her for doing that."

COURT HEARS MORE OF LOVE STORY THAT LED TO SLAYINGS; TRIAL: BUSINESSMAN TSENG 
PENG TESTIFIES ABOUT LETTERS TO THE MISTRESS HIS WIFE IS ACCUSED OF KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A stoic Li-Yun (Lisa) Peng sat quietly during her preliminary hearing Thursday 
while her husband of 21 years testified about the love letters, gifts and bank 
account he gave to the mistress Peng is accused of killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwanese businessman Tseng (Jim) Peng, 51, showed extreme reluctance to a 
line of questioning about his relationship with the victim, Ranbing Jennifer 
Ji, 25, who had conceived Peng's son. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Peng, 44, is charged with fatally stabbing Ji and suffocating Ji's 
5-month-old son, Kevin, last summer in Ji's Mission Viejo apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 On matters of money and romance, Jim Peng repeatedly has told the court, "I 
don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 But that changed Thursday when Lisa Peng's attorney, Marshall M. Schulman, 
produced copies of Jim Peng's love letters to Ji. They told of a budding 
romance between the two, who met at a resort bar in China in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for a temporary goodby again," Jim Peng once wrote. "Although time 
goes by so fast when we're together . . . every minute, every second. It feels 
like life is so fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter continued: "Please, none of your frowned eyebrow spoiling your 
lovely smile and singing lightly, I just called to say I love you, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 The letter ended, "My heart is with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman: "You were in love with her at that time right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not yet," Peng said. 
</P>
<P>
 During previous testimony, Peng said he met Ji in October, 1990, at a hotel 
bar during an electronics convention. At the time, Peng, a wealthy businessman, 
owned San Diego-based Ranger Electronics. Ranger had three factories in Taiwan 
and manufactured transceivers in Malaysia and China. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Ji called Peng at his hotel, he said. And, that evening one 
of Peng's associates invited Ji and a female companion to attend a dinner 
hosted by Ranger. At the time, Ji was earning about $85 a month working as a 
restaurant hostess. 
</P>
<P>
 In photographs, Ji was a tall, young beauty and Peng was older and much 
shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 They met again in the following December, and Peng hired Ji to work for his 
company in Shanghai, China, the next month. He paid her $129 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 He also opened a personal account for her at a Hong Kong bank with a check for 
$300, he said in court. After Ji left Ranger Communications after a 
disagreement with another employee, Peng hired her to help run a new venture, 
the J and J Co., which bought electrical parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The two became intimate in May, 1991. She became pregnant the following 
summer. He moved her to Mission Viejo where he would visit her while on 
business trips. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pengs also maintained a home in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing continues today.

SCHOOL FEARS STIGMA IN WAKE OF TB OUTBREAK; DISEASE: SOME AT LA QUINTA HIGH 
DOWNPLAY TESTS, BUT A HEALTH OFFICIAL SAYS THAT IT'S THE LARGEST INCIDENCE OF 
DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS EVER IN A U.S. HIGH SCHOOL.

<P>
 Although health officials have ordered a second testing for a drug-resistant 
strain of tuberculosis at La Quinta High School, some students and staff said 
Thursday they are more concerned about the stigma than the danger of the 
potentially deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tuberculosis is not going to be the death of any students. But the sad thing 
is that it could be the death of the school," said Kevin McClure, a chemistry 
teacher and football and track coach at La Quinta. 
</P>

 McClure, 26, said he tested positive for exposure to TB during a screening 
last year, but he doesn't fear getting the disease. Rather, he said he worries 
that enrollment could drop at La Quinta next fall because of a new state law 
that gives parents a choice of sending their children to any school, no matter 
where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 McClure said although La Quinta has a strong scholastic record, he would "bet" 
that some parents will pass over the school or pull their students out for fear 
of TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Thomas, La Quinta's principal, said so far the TB outbreak at the 
school, in which 17 students were found with active cases and another 175 with 
exposures, has not hurt advance enrollment applications. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that could change following a report this week that at 
least 18 more La Quinta students and two teachers tested newly positive, 
indicating they were exposed recently to a more drug-resistant strain of TB 
from a student who suffered a relapse of the disease. That student, Debi 
French, underwent surgery this week to have part of a lung removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said he had received 50 to 60 calls from parents Thursday about the 
tuberculosis issue. He said one father was considering removing his child from 
school, but most of the others were supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to know how can we get the message out that we are not a leper 
school," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dottie Matlock, mother of a junior, said La Quinta "is probably one of the 
safest schools around because they have all these tests. I feel the school has 
taken every precaution." 
</P>
<P>
 Several students and faculty said they believe La Quinta has been unfairly 
singled out and that other schools probably have similar exposure to TB. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dr. Hugh Stallworth, county health officer, said, "I really hate the 
stigma, but the reality is from what the CDC (federal Centers for Disease 
Control) tells us: The outbreak we had at La Quinta High School is the largest 
outbreak of multiple drug resistant TB in a high school in the history of the 
United States. That kind of singles you out." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at La Quinta should be aware of the potential danger, he said. "When 
you look at it, TB is potentially lethal. It is serious. Parents should be 
concerned enough to find out more about TB and to have their kids skin tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said although the county doesn't have the resources to test all 
students in the county, next fall it will begin tuberculosis screening of all 
students who will be entering Orange County schools for the first time.

HANTAVIRUS THREAT FOUND IN COUNTY; HEALTH: A STRAIN OF THE VIRUS THAT HAS 
KILLED 42 PEOPLE IS FOUND IN MICE TRAPPED AT CRYSTAL COVE STATE PARK. HEALTH 
OFFICIALS URGE HIKERS TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Researchers in Orange County and New Mexico said Thursday they have identified 
a new and potentially deadly strain of the hantavirus in harvest mice trapped 
in Crystal Cove State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The hantavirus previously found in deer mice killed 42 people in 18 states, 
mostly in the Four Corners area of the Southwest. Among the fatalities were two 
California cases, but there were none reported in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to tell from the data we have now whether (the new strain) has 
any disease-causing ability, but because it is close to the Four Corners 
strain, we have to assume that it may have that capability," said James P. 
Webb, Jr., ecologist with the Orange County Vector Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in New Mexico, where at least one harvest mouse with the strain was 
identified, announced its discovery Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said that no people have been infected, and Orange County health 
officials have no plans to bar visitors to Crystal Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're recommending that this is another precaution in going into wild areas, 
along with poison oak, mountain lions, rattlesnakes and coyotes," Webb said. 
"Stay on the trails there, and you're probably not going to have any problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers who leave the trail "shouldn't be kicking up a lot of dust, or digging 
holes or trenches. Make sure to camp in an area that's free of rodents or 
rodent droppings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Routine testing of rodents in recent months turned up five infected harvest 
mice -- four at Crystal Cove and one in South County, near the TRW testing 
facility, according to Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The harvest mice had been collected earlier this year and sent to New Mexico, 
where they were analyzed by Brian Hjelle, assistant professor of pathology at 
the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 "They determined that initially we have another species of mouse, a harvest 
mouse, carrying a related strain of hantavirus related to the Four Corners 
virus," Webb said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Subsequently, we sent in another sample from harvest mice" from the Crystal 
Cove area, Webb said, taken after the Laguna fire in January. "Out of that came 
four more positives." 
</P>
<P>
 There are distinct differences between the different harvest mice and deer 
mice, which were responsible for the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The harvest mouse, Webb said, "tends not to go into buildings. It is found in 
more grassland areas, and builds its nest on the ground, it does not tunnel 
under the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 In the initial outbreak, people became infected with the hantavirus by 
inhaling airborne particles of urine or saliva of infected deer mice. Early 
symptoms of the illness mirror the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease progresses rapidly, causing breathing difficulties and filling the 
lungs with fluid. Hantavirus is fatal about 60% of the time.

O.C. TRANSPORTATION FUNDS REPORTED SLASHED; CONGRESS: $28 MILLION APPROVED BY 
HOUSE IS CUT TO $16 MILLION BY PANEL. ENOUGH IS LEFT FOR DISNEY GARAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just hours after the House of Representatives authorized $28 million for three 
Orange County transportation projects -- including a mammoth parking structure 
coveted by the Walt Disney Co. -- the subcommittee that controls the purse 
strings snatched a chunk of the money back, congressional sources said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The appropriations subcommittee on transportation reportedly slashed $16 
million, more than half of what the House had recommended funding only 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Orange County transportation officials said the reduction was not 
likely to stall the 12,000-space parking complex Disney says is central to its 
plans to build a $3-billion resort adjacent to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, if all the projects had hit, it would have been the biggest 
appropriation for Orange County transportation ever," said Stan Oftelie, 
executive director of the Orange County Transportation Authority. "We're happy 
with what we got." 
</P>
<P>
 The money fell away in a two-step process: All funds authorized by the House 
must then win the blessing of House appropriators before they can be released. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the appropriations subcommittee decided to be more frugal, 
reducing to $10 million a $15-million appropriation for the Disney garage and 
for ramps at the San Diego Freeway and Costa Mesa Freeway connectors in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3 million sought to improve Bristol Street in Santa Ana was cut to $2 
million, which is likely to stall work there, Oftelie said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the panel appears to have eliminated entirely a $10-million line of credit 
requested to support the Eastern Transportation Corridor, a planned tollway 
connecting the Riverside Freeway with the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 While the other projects are important to Orange County's transportation 
future, it is the Disney garage that grabs the limelight. Because Disney 
contends it cannot build the resort without it, the otherwise mundane parking 
structure is viewed as a key to a tourist bonanza for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned resort includes 5,000 hotel rooms, an amphitheater, a shopping 
district and a new theme park next to Disneyland called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear we got $10 million and it is a major hit for us," Oftelie said, 
explaining the county had requested the money in two installments, with the 
remaining $5 million to come next year. "We'll just go back next year and ask 
for the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of funds is less a function of the rumored dislike of the Walt Disney 
Co. on Capitol Hill than it is of hard financial times, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think because of the lean budgetary times, we were expecting cuts," said 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) who fought for the funding. "I always 
hear the stories about some resistance (to) the Disney name . . . but I can 
never really find it. People here see in the faces of their grandchildren and 
children what I see when I take mine to Disneyland, so it's still more of a 
positive than a drag." 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee's recommendations have been sealed until the full committee 
meets after the Memorial Day recess, but word was quick to spread about who got 
what. Even the reduced figures must still be approved by the full 
Appropriations Committee, the House and then the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, appropriators also approved $25.2 million for the new 
federal courthouse in Santa Ana, the full amount requested, and $66 million for 
the Santa Ana River flood control project. Although the flood control money is 
less than hoped for, it would be supplemented by $16 million left over from 
this year, bringing the total to the full $82 million sought, officials said.

SUPERVISOR RAPS SANITATION AGENCY OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Frustrated by continuing troubles at the Orange County Sanitation Districts, 
county Supervisor Roger R. Stanton accused the agency's administrators Thursday 
of muddling critical information about agency contracts and management 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get a . . . answer out of those people," said Stanton, a member of 
the agency's board of directors. "It is just incredible down there. It's an 
organization that has a high level of obfuscation." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the agency has been beset by a range of troubles, from two 
ongoing criminal investigations related to a fatal fire at one of its treatment 
plants and possible conflicts of interest by sanitation officials to a 
personnel dispute involving the agency's laboratory manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those problems, Stanton said, have been exacerbated by serious 
management problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization is several decades behind in terms of management 
structure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top agency administrators were unavailable for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 With his statements, Stanton joins colleagues on the board of directors in 
expressing concern about sanitation agency operations. Last week, several 
directors called for a review of legal expenses, which have totaled $4.2 
million in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 And this month, directors are expected to give final approval to the first 
phase of a management audit, which could extend to a review of the entire 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the agency's executive committee Wednesday night, Stanton 
became particularly angry over how long and difficult it was to obtain 
estimated costs for computers to replace a faulty system at the agency's 
treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Following lengthy exchanges involving a number of confused directors who were 
forced to dig through a pile of documents, and after the total cost was finally 
estimated at $9.5 million, Stanton said: "This is really unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, administrators pledged to streamline their reports and 
policies so as not to cause further board confusion.

 CSUN SHINES: The Cal State Northridge Matadors softball team is one-for-one in 
the College World Series in Oklahoma City (C1). Pitcher Amy Windmiller led the 
team in its first-round victory over Missouri by striking out 11 and allowing 
only four hits. Final score: 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 BUCKING THE EEOC: Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) opposes 
proposed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines intended to help 
curb religious harassment in workplaces (B5). . . . McKeon, a Mormon, claims 
that the proposal would bring about "religion-free zones," but Rep. Howard L. 
Berman (D-Panorama City) counters that it is aimed at "disparaging comments" 
that might make workers "feel that they are not held in good standing." 
</P>
<P>
 BIG HIT: CityWalk (above) is a year old, and no matter how people feel about 
its symbolism and aesthetic value, one thing's for sure: It's a tremendous 
success. In fact, an estimated 2 million people have come specifically to see 
the Universal City complex, twice the number that MCA had hoped for. . . . 
"It's a good place to hang out and not spend too much money," one visitor said.

 ABORTION: The two sides of the abortion debate, as expected, had far different

a Sherman Oaks clinic, says women now "have the law on their side," while Laura 
Sharp, a Valley spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, said it "turns good, decent

INFLATION FEARS IN CHECK, STREET MARKS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A dearth of market-moving news kept stocks mixed Thursday. Share prices 
closely followed the bond market, just as they have for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said inflation fears remain in check for now, so there was little to 
push buying or selling ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average was dragged down all day by Philip Morris, 
whose shares were hit after the company's directors voted against splitting 
their food and tobacco businesses. The blue chip average fell 1.84 points to 
3,753.46. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining issues by about 
9 to 7 on New York Stock Exchange volume of 256.05 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields edged upward, with the market sitting tight ahead of a 
long holiday weekend and scheduled remarks by Federal Reserve Board Chairman 
Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 The long bond's yield closed at 7.35%, up from 7.34% on Wednesday. Its price, 
which moves in the opposite direction, fell 4/32 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 in 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau's index, a measure that tracks 21 commodities, 
fell for the third straight day. The index dropped 2 points to 229.6, and is 
down from Monday's 239.2, the highest reading since October, 1990. Commodity 
prices are considered an indicator of inflation, which diminishes the value of 
fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty about inflation -- and how high the Fed will raise interest rates 
to curb it -- has kept stock and bond investors nervous for several months. 
Higher rates and inflation can harm the value of both stock and bond 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Farrell, investment strategist at PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said: 
"The stock market is focusing on the bond market, and the bond market prior to 
that last rate increase clearly was fearing inflation. Now we've gotten some 
slower (economic) growth numbers, in retail sales and elsewhere, so it appears 
the higher interest rates are slowing growth and taking some of the fear out of 
the bond and stock markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange's composite 
index gained 0.55 points to 252.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 
gained 0.72 to 457.06, while the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller 
company stocks, lost 0.43 to 731.64, hurt by weak technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris was the most active NYSE issue, dropping 3 1/8 to 50 5/8. 
Boeing helped offset the industrial average's cigarette blues, gaining 2 1/2 to 
47 on a report in the Wall Street Journal that it is near a deal with China for 
more than 50 commercial airliners, valued at more than $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * United Technologies rose 5/8 to 65 1/2 on speculation that its jet engine 
division may get some of the business from the possible Boeing-China deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Upjohn surged 3 7/8 to 33 on what analysts said was a new round of rumors 
about a possible takeover deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer Associates gained 6 to 43 1/8 after its quarterly earnings came in 
well ahead of Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Morton International, a maker of specialty chemicals, gained 1 1/2 to 82 
7/8. A.G. Edwards & Co. upgraded the stock to "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Software maker Lotus Development lost 2 to 61 1/8. Some analysts were 
disappointed in the company's earnings predictions Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, share prices slid further in Frankfurt on a wave of 
foreign selling. The DAX 30-share average closed at 2,130.25, down 28.52 
points. The DAX is down some 118 points in three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share average fell 167.83 points to close at 20,495.80, 
while in London, the Financial Times 100-share average lost 1 point to finish 
at 3,019.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index declined 16.71 points, or 0.68%, to close at
